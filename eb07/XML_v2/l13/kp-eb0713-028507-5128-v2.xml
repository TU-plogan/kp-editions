                    subjects, first led to the formation of books; and the convenience of being able
                    to compare different writings on the same subject, or to consult various
                    writings on different subjects, naturally suggested the assemblage of books, any
                    considerable collection of which constitutes a library.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence in almost all parts of the world where civilization has made any
                    considerable progress, traces may be discovered of the existence of libraries.
                    At the period of the Spanish invasion of South America, for instance, emblems or
                    pictural representations were employed instead of writing, letters being wholly
                    unknown; in Yucatan and Honduras there were books composed of the leaves of
                    trees; and in the kingdom of Mexico the natives had a <hi rend="italic"
                        >library,</hi> histories, and calendars, in which they painted such things
                    as had proper figures by their natural representations, and such as had none, by
                    means of various other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205141?mode=fullsize"

                    whatever they pleased.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Herrera, decade ii. book ix. c. 4.</p></note> This may be
                    considered as a library in its earliest stage; for all those which are described
                    as having belonged to the ancients were composed of rolls, which, though
                    different in form from our books, supplied the place of them, and, when
                    collected, constituted a library, even in the modern acceptation of that
                    term.</p>
                <p part="N">The origin of libraries is involved in obscurity. According to some, the
                    distinction of having first made collections of writings belongs to the Hebrews;
                    but others ascribe this honour to the Egyptians. Those who support the former
                    opinion contend that the care which the Hebrews bestowed in preserving their
                    sacred books, in which the history and fortunes of their ancestors, as well as
                    their laws, were recorded, became an example to other nations; whilst those who
                    hold the latter opinion maintain that, as the civilization and learning of Egypt
                    were of much higher antiquity than in almost any other country with the history
                    of which we are acquainted, and as the art of writing was known and practised
                    therein from the earliest times, indeed long before knowledge had dawned amongst
                    any other people, so it maybe presumed that collections of books first began to
                    be made in that region where the art of writing seems to have been originally
                    invented. This question, however, is not one which it is of importance to
                    discuss. It is sufficient to observe, that, in ancient Egypt, the priests
                    appear, from the earliest times, to have kept records or archives, in a
                    character expressly appropriated for the purpose, and hence called hieratic or
                    sacerdotal; that consequently every sacred college contained a library, composed
                    in part at least of such archives; and that, besides, they had written books, in
                    which were inscribed all the knowledge, whether of science or of art, which had
                    either descended to them from their predecessors, or had been the fruit of their
                    own labour and research.</p>

                <p part="N">As the earliest form of the graphic art appears to have consisted in
                    inscribing or engraving characters on stone, metal, wood, or other durable
                    substance, so the first public libraries were composed exclusively of archives
                    deposited in the temples, that the acts relating to history and public law might
                    there be preserved. This will be found to hold true almost universally. Men
                    invariably begin with what is absolutely necessary to their well-being; and it
                    is only after the lapse of a long interval that time and the progress of
                    improvement add the useful to the necessary, and the ornamental to the
                    useful.</p>

                    visited Egypt, but who merely mentions the fact, without giving us any
                    information as to its contents. It probably contained works of very remote
                    antiquity, and also the books accounted sacred by the Egyptians, all of which
                    perished amidst the destructive ravages which accompanied and followed the
                    Persian invasion under Cam byses. There was also, according to Eustathius and
                    other ancient writers, a fine library at Memphis, deposited in the temple of
                    Phtha, from which Homer has been accused of having stolen both the Iliad and the
                    Odyssey, and afterwards published them as his own. (See the article <hi

                    the one founded by Ptolemy Soter, at Alexandria, and enriched by successive

                    Ptolemy Soter, a learned prince, founded an academy at Alexandria, called the

                    study of philosophy and the sciences; and for their use he formed a collection
                    of books, the number of which has been variously computed, by Epiphanius at
                    54,000, and by Josephus at 200,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his death left in it about 100,000 volumes. He had agents in every part of Asia
                    and of Greece, commissioned to search out and purchase the rarest and most
                    valuable writings; and amongst those he procured were the works of Aristotle,
                    purchased of Neleus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    Greek version of the Jewish Scriptures, designated the Septuagint, which was
                    undertaken at the suggestion of Demetrius Phalereus,, who first executed the
                    office of librarian to this monarch. The measures adopted by Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus, for augmenting the Alexandrian Library, were pursued by his
                    successor Ptolemy Euergetes, with unscrupulous vigour. He caused all books
                    imported into Egypt by Greeks or other foreigners to be seized and sent to the
                    academy or museum, where they were transcribed by persons employed for the
                    purpose; upon which the copies were delivered to the proprietors, and the
                    originals deposited in the library. He borrowed of the Athenians the works of
                    Sophocles, Euripides, and AEschylus; caused them to be transcribed in the most
                    elegant manner possible; retained the originals for his own library; and
                    returned to the Athenians the copies which had been made of them, with fifteen
                        talents<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Upwards of L.3000 sterling.</p></note> for the exchange. As the museum,
                    where die library was originally founded, stood near the royal palace, in the
                    quarter of the city called Bruchion, the books were at first deposited there;
                    but when this building had been completely occupied with books to the number of
                    400,000 volumes, a supplemental library was erected within the Serapeion, or
                    temple of Serapis; and the books there placed gradually increased to the amount
                    of 300,000 volumes; thus making, in both libraries, a grand total of 700,000
                    volumes.</p>
                <p part="N">The Alexandrian Library continued in all its splendour until the first
                    Alexandrian war, when, during the plunder of the city, the Bruchion portion of
                    the collection was accidentally destroyed by fire, owing to the recklessness of
                    the auxiliary troops. But the library in the Serapeion still remained, and was
                    augmented by subsequent donations, particularly by that of the Pergamean
                    Library, amounting to 200,000 volumes, presented by Mark Antony to Cleopatra; so
                    that it soon surpassed the former both in the number and in the value of its
                    contents. At length, after various revolutions under the Roman emperors, during
                    which the collection was sometimes plundered and sometimes re-established, it
                    was utterly destroyed by the Saracens, under the orders of the Caliph Omar, when
                    they acquired possession <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205154?mode=fullsize"

                    642. Amrou, the victorious general, was himself inclined to spare this
                    inestimable treasury of ancient science and learning; but the ignorant and
                    fanatical caliph, to whom he applied for instructions, ordered it to be
                    destroyed. “If,” said he, “these writings of the Greeks agree with the Koran, or
                    book Allah, they are useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they
                    are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed.” The sentence of destruction was
                    executed with blind obedience. The volumes of parchment or papyrus were
                    distributed to the four thousand baths of the city; and such was their
                    incredible number, that six months were scarcely sufficient for their
                        combustion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                            Gellius, Ammianus Marcelli-tus, and Orosius, are foreign to the purpose;
                            inasmuch as the destruction referred to by these writers is that which
                            took place in he time of Julius Caesar, after which the library was
                            restored, and continued to flourish, until it was annihilated by the

                    of the prophets, the compositions of David, the letters of the Hebrew kings, and
                    the records of offerings. As the Jews dwelt alone, and were not reckoned amongst
                    the nations, we know nothing of their early literature, beyond the books which
                    are contained in the Old Testament. It has been supposed, however, that they had

                    that “the house of the rolls” was not a library belonging to the Persians, but a
                    collection of the records or archives of the kingdom. There was formerly a
                    considerable library at Susa, the residence of the Persian sovereigns, where
                    Metasthenes consulted the annals of the Persian monarchy, in search of materials
                    for his history. This library is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus; but, like that
                    referred to by Ezra, it seems rather to have been a collection of laws and
                    records, than an assemblage of books on science or learning.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the Greeks, as amongst other nations, the first libraries
                    consisted merely of archives, deposited, for the sake of preservation, in the
                    temples of the gods. The sacred books, of which mention is made by Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, under the denomination of Deltoids, were of this description.
                    Amongst the most ancient people of Greece these archives comprehended also the
                    genealogies of the royal families; the successions of the priesthood, which
                    served to fix historical epochs; and the titles of public property, engraved,
                    according to their importance, on marble and on brass. Tacitus attests the
                    existence of one of these titles, which was dated twelve hundred years before
                    his time, and the authenticity of which was recognised by the senate in the time
                    of Tiberius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    The Lacedaemonians had no books; amongst them writing was considered as a

                    that city, though Strabo ascribes to Aristotle the honour of having rendered

                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-5167-0288"/> to his countrymen. In this library he
                    deposited the works of Homer, which he had collected with great difficulty, and
                    at a very considerable expense; and the Athenians themselves were at great pains
                    to increase the collection. The fortunes of this library were various and
                    singular. It was transported to Persia by Xerxes; brought back by Seleucus
                    Nicator; plundered by Sylla; and at last restored by the Emperor Hadrian. On the
                    invasion of the Roman empire by the Goths <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 260),
                    Greece was ravaged; and in the sack of Athens they had collected all the
                    libraries, and were upon the point of setting fire to this funeral pile of
                    ancient learning, when one of their chiefs interposing, dissuaded them from the
                    design, observing at the same time, that as long as the Greeks were addicted to
                    the study of books, they would never apply themselves to that of arms.</p>
                <p part="N">Next to the Alexandrian Library, that of Pergamus was the most
                    conspicuous, and, according to Plutarch, contained 200,000 volumes. It was
                    founded and successively enriched by the kings of Pergamus called Eumenes, all
                    of whom were zealous promoters of the arts, and to one of whom we are indebted

                    Attalus surpassed all his predecessors in magnificence, and after their example
                    devoted part of his treasures to the purchase of the principal works or writings
                    of his age. As already noticed, the Pergamean library was presented by Antony to
                    Cleopatra, in order to form the foundation of a new library at Alexandria.

                    contained about 30,000 volumes.</p>
                <p part="N">These particulars, scanty as they may no doubt seem, are nevertheless
                    sufficient to show that the libraries of Greece, in ancient times, were both
                    numerous and extensive. But a question of much more immediate interest here
                    presents itself, viz. as to whether any of the treasures with which they were
                    enriched still remain undiscovered, and where these may be supposed most likely
                    to be found. On this subject various conjectures have been formed, particularly
                    in regard to the remains of the ancient Greek historians. It is well known that
                    many manuscripts had been collected at a vast expense in Greece for the library
                    of Buda, which was destroyed by the Turks in the year 1526. In this library
                    Alexander Brassicanus had seen the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Hyperides</hi>
                    with <hi rend="italic">scholia,</hi> the works of many of the Greek fathers, and
                    also those of the classical writers. From it issued parts of Polybius and of
                    Diodorus Siculus. A manuscript of Heliodorus, from which was afterwards printed
                    the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">AEthiopica,</hi> likewise belonged to
                    it, having been found by a soldier, who carried it to Vincentius Obsopaeus.
                    Neander, speaking of this collection, says, “Ex media Graecia inaestimandis
                    sumptibus emerat Matthias Corvinus rex.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">Constantinople and Athos have contributed the greater number of the
                    manuscripts which are still extant in different parts of Europe. Until a
                    comparatively recent period there were monasteries full of learned men at
                    Byzantium, and every monastery had its library. The Turks, on their conquest of
                    Constantinople, did not indulge m that indiscriminate destruction which has
                    sometimes been imputed to them. Mahommed II. secured the library of the Greek
                    emperors, which his successors preserved until it was destroyed by Amurath IV.
                    At Byzantium, Constantine Lascaris transcribed many of the works which were
                    afterwards conveyed to the Royal Library at Madrid; and in this city were
                    procured those manuscripts which, having been presented to Hurtado de Mendoza by
                    Solyman II., were left by the former to the library of the Escorial. Possevin
                    has given partial catalogues of some of the libraries at Constantinople; and an
                    early traveller, who visited that city in the year 1597, mentions a valuable
                    collection which he had seen there, though without specifying its contents. With
                    respect to Athos, it appears that there were deposited in one library alone, two
                    hundred manuscripts originally obtained from the monasteries upon the mountain;
                    and a great part of those formerly at Moscow had been collected by the monk
                    Arsenius, in Athos, at the suggestion of the patriarch Nicon. Thessaly, Chios,
                    Corfu, Crete, Cyprus, Chalce,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            monasteries of Thessaly. He had visited all of them, and had resided
                            many days at Triccala for the express purpose of copying a Greek
                            manuscript belonging to a monastery. But having been attacked by fever

                            he had so diligently pursued.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">Mr Walpole is of opinion, that notwithstanding the acquisitions which
                    have already been made, researches in the Levant should not be intermitted. By
                    these many manuscripts may still, according to him, be rescued from destruction.
                    No care whatever appears to have been taken to preserve them. Dr Covell mentions
                    having seen, in the monasteries of Mount Athos and elsewhere, vast heaps of
                    manuscripts of the Fathers, and other learned authors, all covered over with
                    dust and dirt, many of them rotten and spoiled, and never in any instance placed
                    upon shelves or arranged in good order. Mr Walpole also thinks that an inquiry
                    should be made into the truth of what was stated to Hemsterhusius by some
                    Greeks, viz. that part of the comedies of Menander was still extant.
                    “Application,” says he, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> might be made to the
                    Greek nobles of the Phanar, many of whom are versed in ancient Greek, and
                    probably the possessors of some valuable manuscripts. Parts of the first book of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Demonstratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelieα</hi> of
                    Eusebius were printed by Fabricius, from a manuscript belonging to Prince
                    Mavrocordato; and a copy of the Greek Orators, now in England, was once the
                    property of a Greek noble.” This, however, is, we fear, much too sanguine. It is
                    probable that many Greek manuscripts have experienced the treatment which works
                    of the same sort have met with in other countries. Poggius, whilst at the
                    council of Constance, found a manuscript of Quintilian upon the table of a
                    pickling shop. Masson met with one of Ago-bardus in the hands of a bookbinder,
                    who was preparing to use it for the back of a book; and one of Asconius was
                    about to be employed for the same purpose. In the roof of a Benedictin
                    monastery, Musculus discovered some of the works of Cicero, and the whole of
                    Ovid. Numbersŉf manuscripts in Greece are irrecoverably. lost, either by design
                    or accident,“by the casualties of war or the havoc of revolution; and of those
                    which may hereafter be met with, it can scarcely be supposed that almost any
                    will prove to be of much value, or of any great antiquity.</p>

                <p part="N">A list of the theological manuscripts in the library of Patmos has been
                    given by Possevin; and another, copied bv the Marquis of Sligo, has been
                    published by Mr Walpole. The actual catalogue contains the titles of ninety-two
                    manuscripts, and about 400 printed volumes; but the Greek compiler has not
                    stated any circumstance relating to the manuscripts by which an estimate of
                    their value may be formed. He gives no information concerning the form of the
                    letters or that of the spirits, or upon any of those subjects by which a
                    knowledge of their respective dates might be obtained. But there is one
                    manuscript mentioned in the catalogue, in regard to which it is impossible not
                    to feel more than ordinary curiosity. We allude to a manuscript of Diodorus
                    Siculus, an accurate inspection of which would probably determine whether the
                    hopes which were oftener than once entertained, of recovering the lost books of
                    that historian, were in this instance also to be disappointed.<note

                    be admitted, that those accidentally rescued from destruction have, in general,
                    been either of comparatively modern date or of but little consequence. Neither
                    the inquiries which have been extended to the African states, nor the
                    excavations and researches made at Herculanum and Pompeii, have recovered the

                            information respecting the library of that celebrated island. “We left
                            Geronta on .he 23d February,” says he, “and reached this island, after
                            experiencing the fury of a violent storm. The town is situated upon he
                            summit of a mountain in the rear of the harbour, and, rising above it
                            like a citadel, stands the monastery of John the Baptist.” ÍLfter the
                            travellers had dried themselves in a storehouse at the harbour, they
                            proceeded to pay their respects to the Hegumenos of he monastery, and
                            the patriarch of Alexandria, who was upon a visit to his birth-place,
                            Patmos; and Thiersch and his companions met hearty welcome under the
                            prelate’s roof, and were received in the far-famed library of the

                            contained nothing ut what has appeared in print; and the readings, so
                            far as Thiersch had an opportunity of investigating them, were not of
                            much iterest. lie attached greater value to a manuscript of Paulus

                            emendations may in consequence be made on the text of ⅛ineta ’ s work.
                            The library contains enough in grammatical treatises, glossaries,
                            lexicons, and scholia, to afford employment to a υung philologist for
                            six months at least; and it is particularly rich in ancient manuscripts
                            of the Bible, amongst which are a Greek þanuseript of the book of Job,
                            another of two of the Gospels with commentaries, a third exhibiting the
                            musical characters of the h ’ eek church, and others containing the
                            works of some of its fathers. As these are considered in the light of
                            sacred relics, none of ,hem have been injured, and they are in a
                            respectable state of preservation. But the heathen manuscripts, on the

                    Rome was still in its infancy when the archives of the Etruscans contained a
                    continuous collection of public acts, and particularly an uninterrupted series
                    of births and deaths, that enabled that people to fix the unequal duration of
                    the eight centuries of their previous history, which hey reckoned up to about
                    the middle of the sixth century before Christ. The details given by Censorinus
                    in Varro, prove that the Etruscans kept regular registers of births and deaths,
                    from the epoch of their first establishment in Italy, which Larcher refers to
                    the year 1344 before Christ; that, the eighth century thereafter, to which lie
                    Etruscan histories were written, must have been the sixth before the Christian
                    era, in which other histories appeared that arc no longer extant; and that,
                    during these eight hundred years, the most extended term of human life was
                    nearly the same as at the present day. In the works of Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, of Plutarch, and other ancient authors, we also discover
                    scattered glimpses of the history of Italy in the most remote times, and learn
                    that the tribes or races by whom the Etruscans were surrounded had also their
                    historical archives. It may even be supposed that the Romans, in causing their
                    Capitoline marbles to be engraved, followed, amongst others, the example of
                    Praeneste; a city much more ancient than Rome, and which had long continued the
                    practice of classifying as well as engraving its municipal records. Such were
                    the sources consulted by several historians who treated of the antiquities of
                    different Italian nations, particularly Zenodotus of Troezene, who composed a
                    history of the Ombrians.</p>

                    probably, as little inclination, to cultivate letters. It was not until they had
                    subdued Magna Graecia that they began to emerge out of barbarism, nor until they
                    had accomplished the conquest of Greece itself, that a taste for the arts,
                    sciences, and books was diffused amongst them. They became civilized by frequent
                    contact and familiarity with civilization. The immediate consequence of the
                    conquest of Greece was a more frequent intercourse with the Greeks, at once
                    their subjects and their masters; and in proportion as they became acquainted
                    with the literature and arts of that refined people, the asperity of character
                    and manners which had distinguished this nation of conquerors began to

                    Aristotle and Theophrastus. Lucullus, another conqueror of Mithridates, was not
                    less distinguished by his taste for books. The number of volumes in his library
                    was immense; and they were written in the most distinct and elegant manner
                    possible. But the use which he made of his collection was still more honourable
                    to that princely Roman than the acquisition or possession of it. His library was
                    open to all; and the Greeks, who visited Rome, resorted to the galleries and
                    porticos of Lucullus as to the retreat of the Muses, where they spent <pb

                    Lucullus liberally gave public access to their literary treasures, still their
                    libraries can, in strictness, be considered as only <hi rend="italic"

                    dictator, and the establishment of public libraries did not take place until the

                    Pollio, who erected a public library in the Court of Liberty on the Aventine
                    Hill. Augustus, amongst other embellishments which he bestowed upon Rome,
                    erected two public libraries, viz. the Octavian and the Palatine. The Octavian
                    Library, which was thus denominated in honour of the emperor’s sister, stood in
                    the portico of Octavia; and the charge of it was committed to Melissus, who had
                    been manumitted by Augustus. The Palatine Library was added by Augustus to the
                    temple of Apollo, which he had erected on the site of that part of the Palatine
                    House which had been struck by lightning. There were deposited the corrected
                    books of the Sybils; and, from two ancient inscriptions quoted by Lipsius and
                    Pitiscus, it would seem that it consisted of two distinct collections, one Greek
                    and the other Latin. This library having survived the various revolutions of the
                    Roman empire, existed until the time of Gregory the Great, whose mistaken zeal
                    led him to order all the writings of the ancients to be destroyed.<note

                    though they did not equally encourage learning, were not altogether neglectful
                    of its interests. Suetonius informs us that Tiberius founded a library in the
                    new temple of Apollo; and we learn from some incidental notices, that he
                    instituted another in his own house, called the Tiberian Library. Vespasian,
                    following the example of his predecessors, established a library in the Temple
                    of Peace, which he erected after the burning of the city by order of Nero; and
                    even Domitian, in the commencement of his reign, restored at great expense the
                    libraries which had been destroyed by the conflagration, collecting copies of
                    books from every quarter, and sending persons to Alexandria to transcribe
                    volumes in that celebrated collection, or to correct copies which had been made
                    elsewhere. Various writers have asserted that there was a library attached to
                    the Temple of the Capitol; but they have not informed us by whom it was founded.
                    Lipsius ascribes it to Domitian, whilst Donatus refers it to the Emperor
                    Hadrian, by whom it was at least enlarged, if not founded, and who probably
                    erected the Tiburtine Library, at Tibur, in the vicinity of Rome.<note

                    magnificent of all the libraries founded by the sovereigns of imperial Rome was
                    that of the Emperor Ulpius Trajanus, from whom it was denominated the Ulpian
                    Library. It was erected in Trajan’s Forum, but afterwards removed to the Viminal
                    Hill, to ornament the baths of Diocletian. In this library were deposited the
                    elephantine books, written upon tablets of ivory, wherein were recorded the
                    transactions of the emperors, the proceedings of the senate and Roman
                    magistrates, and the affairs of the provinces. It has been conjectured that the
                    Ulpian Library consisted of both Greek and Latin works; and some authors affirm
                    that Trajan commanded all the books which could be found in the cities he had
                    conquered to be immediately conveyed to Rome, in order to increase his
                    collection. The library of Domitian having been consumed by lightning, in the
                    reign of Commodus, was not restored until the time of Gordian who rebuilt the
                    edifice, and founded a new library, adding thereto the collection of books
                    bequeathed to him by Quintus Serenus Samonicus, the physician, amounting, it is
                    said, to no less than 72,000 volumes. Donatus conjectures that this library was
                    deposited in the palace of Pompey.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">In addition to the imperial libraries, there were others to which the
                    public had access in the principal cities and colonies of the empire. Pliny
                    mentions a public library which he had founded for the use of his countrymen;
                    and Vopiscus informs us that the Emperor Tacitus caused the historical writings
                    of his illustrious namesake to be deposited in the libraries. The number of
                    calcined volumes, which have been excavated from the ruins of Herculanum and
                    Pompeii would also seem to indicate that collections of hooks were common in
                    those cities. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Herculaneum).</hi> But the
                    irruptions of the barbarians who overran and desolated the western empire proved
                    more destructive to the interests of literature than either volcanoes or
                    earthquakes, and soon caused the disappearance of those libraries which, during
                    several centuries, had been multiplied in Italy. The libraries of the East,
                    however, escaped this devastating torrent; and both Alexandria and
                    Constantinople preserved their literary treasures, until the capture of those
                    cities by the Saracens and the Turks, who finally subverted the Roman empire in
                    the East.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    Byzantium the seat of his empire, he decorated that city with splendid edifices,
                    and called it after his own name. Desirous to make reparation to the Christians
                    for the injuries they had suffered during the reign of his predecessor, he
                    commanded the most diligent search to be made after those books which Diocletian
                    had doomed to destruction; he caused transcripts to be made of such as had
                    escaped the fury of the Pagan persecutor; and, having collected others from
                    various quarters, he formed the whole into a library at Constantinople. On the
                    death of Constantine, however, the number of books in the imperial library was
                    only 6900; but it was successively enlarged by the Emperors Julian and
                    Theodosius the younger, who augmented it to 120,000 volumes. Of these, more than
                    half were burned, in the seventh century, by the command of the Emperor Leo HI.

                    deposited the only authentic copy of the Council of Nice; and it is also said to
                    have contained the poems of Homer, written in gold letters, together with a
                    magnificent copy of the Four Gospels, bound in plates of gold, enriched with
                    precious stones; all of which were consumed in the conflagration. The
                    convulsions which distracted the lower empire were by no. means favourable to
                    the interests ot literature. In the eleventh century learning flourished for a
                    short time during the reign of Constantine Porphyrogennetus; and this emperor is
                    said to have employed many <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205206?mode=fullsize"

                    forming a library, the arrangement of which he himself superintended. But the
                    final subversion of the eastern empire, and the capture of Constantinople in
                    1453, dispersed the literati of Greece over western Europe, and placed the
                    literary remains of that capital at the mercy of the conqueror. The imperial
                    library, however, was preserved by the express command of Mohammed, and
                    continued, it is said, to be kept in some apartments of the Seraglio; but
                    whether it was sacrificed in a fit of devotion by Amurath IV. as is commonly
                    supposed, or whether it was suffered to fall into decay from ignorance and
                    neglect, it is now certain that the library of the Sultan contains only Turkish
                    and Arabic writings, and not one Greek or Latin manuscript of any
                    importance.</p>
                <p part="N">Upon the whole, it appears that books were abundant, both at Rome and at
                    Constantinople, and that learned men in Those cities had at their command
                    greater resources than might at first be supposed. Some idea of the quantity of
                    books accessible to persons of study and research may be formed from the great
                    number of references and citations to be found in the works of some authors,
                    particularly in those of Strabo, Pliny, and some others.</p>

                <p part="N">General epithets and figurative expressions frequently convey a meaning
                    which is calculated to mislead. Hearing constantly of “the dark ages,” “the
                    period of intellectual night,” and “the season of winter in the history of man,”
                    we are apt to imagine that, during the time thus designated, the human mind was
                    utterly palsied, and all learning extinct. But in fact, throughout that period,
                    reason, though misdirected, was not asleep; philosophy was rather bewildered
                    than inert; and learning was immured, but not lost. In no part of that long
                    period which extends from the reign of the Emperor Justinian, when Greek and
                    Roman literature everywhere lay open to the light of day, to the fall of
                    Constantinople and the revival of learning in the fifteenth century, do we
                    entirely lose the traces even of the classic authors, much less of sacred
                    literature; for in each intervening age, and in every quarter of Europe, there
                    were writers whose works, being still extant, afford abundant evidence of their
                    acquaintance with most of the principal authors of more remote times.<note

                    under the overwhelming pressure of barbarian invasion, those institutions which
                    hadbeen founded and nurtured in the midst of civilization, were, no doubt, swept
                    away by the torrent which desolated Italy, and spread its ravages over all parts
                    of the empire. But learning, though expelled from her ancient establishments,
                    and forced from her favourite haunts, found a safe asylum in the monasteries,
                    which, amidst all the violence and anarchy that reigned without, remained in
                    undisturbed tranquillity, respected even by the barbarians who had overthrown an
                    empire.</p>
                <p part="N">It is doubtless true that little comparatively is recorded of the
                    libraries of those ages which intervened between the fall of the Roman empire
                    and the revival of letters in Europe about the middle of the fifteenth century.
                    But, as we shall immediately have occasion to show, every age produced learned
                    and inquisitive men, by whom books were highly prized, and industriously
                    collected. Cassiodorus, minister of Theodore, king of the Goths, retired to a
                    monastery which he had built, and there founded a library for the use of the
                    monks, about the middle of the sixth century. At a later period, Charlemagne,
                    distinguished as a patron of learning, instituted, near Lyons, a library, which,
                    according to the statements of historians, contained books bound in a
                    magnificent manner. After this the monasteries almost exclusively possessed
                    libraries, which were increased by the accessions of centuries; and had the zeal
                    of religious reformation been as little destructive to learning as the invasions
                    of the northern barbarians, numberless monuments of ancient learning which are
                    now irrecoverably lost might have been in the hands of every scholar.</p>
                <p part="N">The monastic institutions seemed as if framed for the special purpose of
                    transmitting the remains of ancient literature, sacred and profane, through a
                    period in which, except for so extraordinary a provision, they must inevitably
                    have perished. Though there were considerable diversities in the rules and
                    practices of the different orders of monks, the elements of the monastic life
                    were in all orders and in every country the same; and, generally speaking,
                    wherever there was a monastery there was also a manufacture of books. The
                    transcription of ancient works, the only mode in which, anterior to the
                    invention of printing, they could be multiplied and preserved, was a favourite
                    employment among the inmates of these peaceful retreats; and an opinion of
                    meritoriousness attached to the labour, served to animate the diligence, and to
                    encourage the perseverance, of the labourer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Such is the subscription of many of the manuscripts of the middle ages;
                            and to us, we confess, there is something almost affecting in iţs pious
                            simplicity.</p></note> If in some monasteries the monks employed
                    themselves in transcribing nothing but missals, legends, and romances, others
                    enriched their libraries with splendid copies of the works of the fathers of the
                    church, and of the Holy Scriptures; and not a few laboured to reproduce such of
                    the classical authors as they were acquainted with or could obtain access to.
                    This system of transcription, to which alone we arc indebted for all that
                    remains of ancient learning, was carried on to an extent of which those who are
                    unacquainted with the history of the middle ages can form no conception. We have
                    already had occasion to advert to the occupation of the inmates of the monastic
                    establishments on Mount Athos, the lofty promontory which stretches from the
                    Macedonian coast far into the AEgean Sea; and we have also noticed the immense
                    number of manuscripts which have at different times issued from these
                    establishments. Many manuscripts still extant prove that the copying of books
                    was likewise practised to a great extent during the middle ages, in the
                    monasteries of the Morea, and in those of Euboea (Negropont), and of Crete
                    (Candia). The latter island seems indeed to have been a place of refuge for
                    learned men during the disastrous period which preceded the fall of the eastern
                    empire; in its monasteries they found an asylum and the means of subsistence. In
                    Calabria and the kingdom of Naples, fifty religious establishments have been
                    mentioned, from which proceeded a large number of the books afterwards collected
                    in the libraries of Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan.<note anchored="true"

                    those of the British islands, the same system of transcription was carried on.
                    Books were multiplied, and, by their multiplication, preserved, whilst the
                    knowledge of their contents was extended. In a word, it is mainly to the labours
                    of these establishments, that we are indebted for the remains of the classic
                    authors, and the preservation of the sacred books, which they so carefully
                    transcribed.</p>

                <p part="N">Under the impression produced by certain loose modes of speaking in
                    relation to the deep and universal ignorance which is said to have prevailed in
                    Europe during seven centuries, the existence of a large number of manuscripts of
                    the classical authors, executed during those very ages, presents a great
                    apparent difficulty. From what motive, it may be asked, or for whose use, were
                    these works transcribed so frequently as to be found in all parts of Europe on
                    the revival of learning? Was this an employment which ignorance would have
                    selected, or which ignorance could have encouraged and promoted? A rapid survey
                    of those ages of darkness, as they are called, will to some extent furnish a
                    solution of the difficulty, by proving that, during these times of general
                    intellectual lethargy, there were not a few individuals who cultivated letters
                    with ardour, and to whom the preservation of books was a matter of the most
                    lively interest. The names which wc are about to mention bear but a small
                    proportion to the total number which might be produced, it being sufficient for
                    our purpose to refer to one or two writers in each century; but brief as our
                    exposition must necessarily be, it will nevertheless serve to show that learning
                    was not then comp'ete-ly abandoned to neglect and oblivion.</p>

                    Procopius, the historian; Agathias, his continuator; Boethius, author of the <hi

                    Scholasticus, an ecclesiastical historian; Simplicius, the commentator of
                    Aristotle and Epictetus; Ammianus Marcellinus, a critic and historian whose
                    works contain very copious references to ancient literature; and Stephen of
                    Byzantium, a grammarian and geographer. The seventh century produced fewer
                    writers than perhaps any other period of equal extent within the compass of
                    history. The only names deserving to be mentioned are those of Theopbylact of
                    Simocatta, who wrote a history of the Emperor Mauritius; and Isidore, an

                    flourished the Venerable Bede, whose writings afford a proof of the general

                    profound learning, the whole of which he had acquired from the sources
                    ordinarily accessible to monastic students. He was a poet, a rhetorician, an

                    still continued to write, his works were, by the ordinance of the British

                    monks. According to Trithemius, he was well versed in the Holy Scriptures, and
                    thoroughly learned in profane literature. He enriched the monastery of Fulda, on
                    the Rhine, with a large collection of books; founded a school there; and trained
                    in every branch of learning two hundred and seventy monks belonging to the
                    establishment. He was created archbishop of Mayence in 847, and died in 856. One
                    of the first professors in the university of Oxford was John Scot, a man of
                    considerable acquirements. He afterwards went to France, where he translated
                    some Greek authors into Latin, but so literally that his versions were almost
                    unintelligible. His writings display various learning; but they were condemned
                    as heretical by the church, on account of his opinions relative to the
                    eucharist. Being forced to leave France, he took refuge in an English monastery,
                    which, however, afforded him no asylum. At the instigation of the monks, he was,
                    like Cassianus, killed by his scholars, with their iron styles. Contemporary
                    with Scot was Photius, with whom no author of that, or of several succeeding
                    agcs, can be compared. Educated for secular employments, and for some time
                    engaged in the service of Michael III., he was by that emperor forcibly invested
                    with the dignity of patriarch of Constantinople (856), in the room of Ignatius;
                    and, that he might pass regularly to this office, he was made monk, reader,
                    sub-deacon, deacon, priest, and patriarch, all in the course of six days. From
                    the office thus violently thrust upon him he was expelled by Basilius, the
                    successor of Michael; but, at the head of a band of soldiers, he repossessed
                    himself of the patriarchate, of which, however, he was at length finally <hi

                    fabulous narratives, displays considerable learning.</p>
                <p part="N">The eleventh century is much richer in distinguished names. Avicenna, an

                    predecessors, and was, besides, well versed in Greek literature. Michael
                    Psellus, a Greek physician, wrote upon subjects of all kinds, and was celebrated
                    for the extent of his acquirements both in sacred and in profane <pb break="no"

                    Lanfranco, an Italian, created archbishop of Canterbury by William the Norman,
                    promoted learning amongst the clergy, and was esteemed accomplished in the
                    literature of his age. Anselm, the disciple and successor of Lanfranco, was also
                    in repute for general learning. The works of Suidas, like those of Photius,
                    contain a treasure of various learning upon points of criticism and literary
                    history; whilst his lexicon, besides the definitions of words, includes accounts
                    of ancient authors, and quotations from works whieh have since perished.
                    Sigibert, a monk of Brabant, has left a chronicle of events from the year 381 to
                    his own time, and a work containing lives of illustrious men; he was, besides,
                    profoundly versed in the Scriptures, and inferior .to none of his countrymen in
                    general learning.</p>
                <p part="N">The name of Anna Comnena distinguishes the early portion of the twelfth
                    century. She wrote a history of the reign of her father, the Emperor Alexius
                    Conmenus; a work which displays a masculine understanding, and an extensive
                    acquaintance with literature and the sciences. During this century England
                    produced several eminent writers, particularly William of Malmesbury, Geoffrey

                    somewhat later, Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, esteemed the most learned man
                    of western Europe in those times. Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica,
                    flourished towards the close of the twelfth century. His commentaries on Homer,
                    besides serving to elucidate the Greek language by important criticisms, contain
                    innumerable references to the Greek classics, and thus furnish the means of
                    ascertaining the integrity and genuineness of the text of those authors, as it
                    has descended to our times. John and Isaac Tzetzes, critics and grammarians of
                    Constantinople, are still consulted as commentators upon some of the Greek

                    in England; and his reputation for learning <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> and
                    virtue enabled him to effect a considerable reformation in many of the English
                    monasteries. He died in the year 1259. The works of Albert, surnamed the Great,
                    a Dominican friar, and afterwards (in 1260) bishop of Ratisbon, fill twenty-one
                    volumes, forming a sort of encyclopaedia of the learning and science of the age.
                    Like Roger Baeon, Albert of Ratisbon incurred amongst his contemporaries the
                    suspicion of dealing in magic. Learning, in the more restricted sense of the
                    term,, that is, the knowledge of books, was too common to excite wonder or envy;
                    but science, or a knowledge of nature, acquired by experimental investigation,
                    was so rare, that it seldom failed to engender both, and to occasion perilous
                    accusations of a correspondence with infernal agents.</p>
                <p part="N">The revival of learning is usually reckoned to have commenced in the
                    fifteenth century; but even in the fourteenth a decided advancement in almost
                    every department of literature is discernible. Gross and degrading <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> g∏orance was wearing away from the bulk of the
                    community in several parts of Europe; the educated classes were acquiring a
                    better taste and more expanded views; and a general awakening of the energies of
                    the human mind was perceptible. This needs no other evidence than is afforded by
                    the works of Dante, Petrarch, Boccacio, Chaucer, and Gower, whieh were not
                    merely produced in that period, but extensively read and admired. During no part
                    of that long tract of time which extends from the decline of learning in the
                    sixth century till its revival in the fifteenth, had there been a total
                    extinction of the knowledge of ancient literature; and those inestimable
                    treasures which the religious houses had saved from the ravages of revolution,
                    anarchy, and barbarism, now began to be drawn forth and studied. The continuance
                    of the eastern empire till the middle of the fifteenth century, afforded an
                    uninterrupted protection to Greek learning during those periods when western
                    Europe was laid waste by the Gothic nations; and hence, on the revival of
                    letters, the study of the Greek authors first engaged the attention of those
                    individuals whom an awakening impulse now directed to the cultivation of
                    learning. But that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the kindred authors of Rome soon
                    followed; and the monuments of ancient wisdom and genius which had been
                    preserved in the monasteries, furnished ample materials for laying the
                    foundations of a new and more extensive, if not more perfect, edifice of
                    civilization.</p>
                <p part="N">More than half a century before the taking of Constantinople by the
                    Turks, the learned men of the imperial city, apprehending the approaching ruin
                    of the empire, began to emigrate into Italy, where they opened schools, and
                    became the preceptors of princes, as well as the guides of the public taste,
                    which they directed towards the study of the classical writers of Greece and
                    Rome. The fall of Constantinople, in 1453, filled the Italian cities with these
                    learned strangers. At this period the Italians required only to receive some
                    kind of direction, and to be provided with the means of study. They had for some
                    time been placed in those peculiar circumstances which have almost always proved
                    favourable to the advancement of the human mind. A number of independent states
                    were crowded upon a narrow space, throughout which the same language,
                    diversified by dialects, prevailed, exhibiting, in a sort of reflected or
                    secondary form, that of ancient Italy'. The energy’, rivalry, and munificence
                    which accompany commerce, kept the whole mass of society in movement; whilst the
                    influence of a religion, which seeks to recommend itself by every embellishment
                    that the genius of man can devise or execute, overruled the debasing tendency of
                    successful trade, and directed the ambition of princely merchants towards
                    objects more refined and intellectual than those which wealth usually selects as
                    the means of distinction.</p>
                <p part="N">The formation of libraries, suggested or favoured by the mportation of
                    manuscripts from Constantinople, proved the means not only of making more widely
                    known the works of the Greek authors (which had never fallen into oblivion), but
                    of prompting those researches which issued in the recovery of the Latin writers,
                    many of whom had long been forgotten. The appetite for books being thus revived
                    and quickened, neither labour nor expense was spared in accumulating them;
                    learned men were despatched in all directions throughout Europe, Western Asia,
                    and Africa, to collect manuscripts; and, in the course of a few years, most of
                    the authors now known were brought together in the libraries of Rome, Naples,
                    Venice, Florence, Vienna, and Paris. Aided by the munificence of princes and
                    popes, the scholars of the fifteenth century applied themselves to the
                    discovery, restoration, and publication of the remains of Greek and Roman
                    literature; and, in the course of sixty or eighty years, most of the <pb

                    works now known were committed to the press. Since that time additional
                    discoveries have been made; but the principal improvements of a subsequent date
                    have consisted in the emendation of the text of ancient authors, partly by a
                    more extensive collation of manuscripts than the first editors possessed the
                    means of instituting, and partly also by the lights and aids of a cautious and
                    judicious criticism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">The invention of printing, by virtually exempting books from the
                    operation of the law which subjects all human things to decay, has also greatly
                    promoted the process of their renovation. By giving to the issue of an edition
                    of a standard work a degree of importance several hundred times greater than
                    that which belonged to the transcription of a single copy, it has called for a
                    proportionally larger amount of learning, diligence, and caution, in the work of
                    revision; and, by enabling each successive editor to avail himself of the
                    labours of his predecessors, all the advantages resulting from the concentration
                    of many minds upon the same subject have further been secured. Since the
                    fifteenth century, therefore, the lapse of time, instead of gradually impairing
                    and corrupting the literary remains of antiquity, has incessantly contributed to
                    their renovation; what was then unknown or doubtful, imperfect or corrupted, has
                    been ascertained, restored, and completed; and the learning and industry of the
                    four centuries which have since elapsed, being constantly directed towards the
                    same object, have left but few questions of literary antiquity open to
                    controversy. Books are no longer liable to the hazard of extinction from
                    political changes or the decline of learning in this or that country. Unless an
                    universal devastation should overtake every region of the civilized world, the
                    body of learning and science now extant can neither perish nor suffer
                    corruption. And thus it is that the written records of distant ages, as well as
                    the products of modern genius, industry, and research, are secured from
                    extinction by a mode of conservation less liable to extensive hazard than any
                    other that can be imagined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    under the great seal, added the library of the kings of England, the printed
                    books of which had been collected from the time of Henry VIL, and the
                    manuscripts from a much earlier date. This collection was very rich in the

                    libraries of Archbishop Cranmer, of Henry prince of Wales, and of Isaac

                    publication entered at Stationers’ Hall. The same department was further
                    enriched, in 1763, by a donation from George HI. of a collection of pamphlets
                    and periodical papers published in England between 1640 and 1660, and chiefly

                    extended generally throughout the whole revolutionary period; and the fourth
                    consisted of a collection of tracts published during the reign of the hundred
                    days in 1815; forming altogether a body of materials for the history of the
                    revolution as complete in regard to France as the collection of pamphlets and
                    tracts already mentioned is with respect to that of the civil wars of England in
                    the time of Charles I. Another feature of the Museum Library is its progressive
                    collection of newspapers from the appearance of the first of these publications
                    in 1588. Sir Hans Sloane had formed a great collection for his day. But to this

                    purchased at the estimated value of L.1000; and since that period the
                    commissioners of stamps have continued periodically to forward to the Museum,
                    copies of all newspapers deposited by the publishers in their office.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1823, the Royal Library collected by George III. was presented to the
                    British nation by his successor, George IV., ιnd ordered by parliament to be
                    added to the library of the British Museum, but to be kept for ever separate
                    from the &gt;ther books in that institution. The general plan of its formation
                    appears to have been determined on by George III. soon after his accession to
                    the throne; and the first extensive purchase made for it was that of the library
                    of Mr Joseph Smith, British consul at Venice, in 1762, for vhich his majesty
                    paid about L.10,000. In 1768, Mr (afterwards Sir Frederick) Barnard, the
                    librarian, was despatched o the Continent by his majesty; and, as the Jesuits’
                    houses vere then being suppressed, and their libraries sold, through-nιt Europe,
                    he was enabled to purchase, upon the most <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    dvantageous terms, a great number of valuable books, including some very

                            part="N">Amongst these may be mentioned the Florence Homer of 1488,
                            which formerly brought L.120, but was purchased by Sir Fre-erick Barnard
                            for 10s.</p></note> in France, in Italy, ιnd in Germany. Under the
                    judicious directions of Mr Bar-ιard, the entire collection was formed and
                    arranged; it was cd, during a period of sixty years, by an annual expenditure
                    &gt;f about L.2000; and it is in itself perhaps one of the most :omplete
                    libraries of its extent that was ever formed. It ontains selections of the
                    rarest kind, particularly of scarce looks which appeared in the first ages of
                    the art of print-ng; it is rich in early editions of the classics, in books rom

                    topography, ιnd of the transactions of learned academies. The num-ιer of books

                    the establishment of the British Museum, was formed by the Harleian, the Sloane,
                    and the Cottonian collections. The next addition made to this department was
                    that of the manuscripts of the ancient royal library of England, conferred by
                    George II. in 1757. In this last collection, which contains the acquisitions of
                    our kings from the time of Richard II. to the date of the grant by George II.,
                    there are a number of valuable manuscripts. Of these, one of the most remarkable
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexandrinus,</hi> a
                    present from Cyril, patriarch of Constantinople, to King Charles I. It is in
                    four quarto volumes, written upon fine vellum, probably between the fourth and
                    sixth centuries, and is believed to be the most ancient manuscript of the Greek
                    Bible now extant, in uncial characters. Many of the other manuscripts came into
                    the royal collection at the time when the monastic institutions of Britain were
                    destroyed; and some of them still retain upon their spare leaves the honest and
                    hearty anathemas which the donors denounced against those who should alienate or
                    remove the respective volumes from the places in which they had been originally
                    deposited. This collection abounds in old scholastic divinity, and possesses
                    many volumes, embellished by the most expert illuminators of different
                    countries, in a succession of periods down to the sixteenth century. In it are
                    also preserved an assemblage of the domestic music-books of Henry VHI., and the
                    Basilicon Doron of James I. in his own handwriting. The <hi rend="italic"

                    I. It likewise contains the numerous registers of English monasteries; the
                    charters of Edgar and of Henry I. to Hyde Abbey, near Winchester, written in
                    gold letters; and the manuscript called the <hi rend="italic">Durham Book,</hi>
                    being a copy of the Latin Gospels, with an interlinear Saxon gloss, written
                    about the year 800, illuminated in the most elaborate style of the Anglo-Saxons,
                    and believed to have once belonged to the Venerable Bede. This collection is
                    also rich in royal and other original letters, and comprises the correspondence
                    of most of the great personages, not only of this country,‘but throughout
                    Europe, from the earliest periods at which letters were written until the
                    commencement of the seventeenth century. The <hi rend="italic">Harleian</hi>
                    collection is still more miscellaneous, though historical literature in all its
                    branches forms one of its principal features. It is particularly rich in
                    heraldic and genealogical manuscripts, in the visitations of counties, and in
                    English topographical collections; in parliamentary and legal proceedings; in
                    originals, copies, and calendars of ancientrecords; in abbey registers; in
                    manuscripts of the classics, amongst which is one of the earliest known of the
                    Odyssey of Homer; in missals, antiphonars, and other service-books of the
                    Catholic church; and in ancient English poetry. It possesses two very early
                    copies of the Latin Gospels, written in gold letters; and also contains a large
                    number of splendidly illuminated manuscripts, besides an extensive mass of
                    correspondence. It further includes about three hundred manuscript bibles or
                    biblical books, in Hebrew, Chaldaic, Greek, Arabic, and Latin; nearly two
                    hundred volumes of writings of the fathers of the church; and works on the arts
                    and sciences, amongst which is a tract on the steam-engine, with plans,
                    diagrams, and calculations by Sir Samuel Morland. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sloane</hi> collection consists principally of manuscripts on natural
                    history, voyages and travels, on the arts, and especially on medicine. It
                    comprises the chief of Kaempfer’s manuscripts, with the voluminous medical
                    collections of Mayerne, including the annals of his practice at the court of
                    England from 1611 to 1649; and it also contains a collection of medical and
                    other scientific correspondence, with numerous manuscripts on history, poetry,
                    and miscellaneous subjects. Some of the drawings of animals in this collection
                    are exceedingly rich and accurate; two volumes upon vellum are from the pencil
                    of Madame Merian; and one relates entirely to the insects of Surinam.</p>

                    Lansdowne was added to these libraries, having been purchased by parliament for

                    the Cottonian collection, but principally of a large assemblage of Bishop

                    rolls. A collection of manuscripts, chiefly of the Greek and Latin classics,
                    which had been formed at a vast expense by the Rev. Dr Charles Burney, was
                    purchased in 1818. Amongst these is the Townley Homer, a manuscript of the

                    collectionshave also been added. One of these, made by Mr C. J. Rich whilst
                    British consul at Bagdad, and purchased by parliament in 1825 contains, amongst
                    other rare manuscripts, several copies of the Syriac version of the Scriptures,
                    which are believed to be of great antiquity. The other, a collection made in
                    different countries of the East, and consisting chiefly of Arabic and Persian
                    manuscripts, was bequeathed to the Museum in the year 1827, by the collector, Mr
                    J. F, Hull. In 1829, a small but valuable collection of manuscripts, partly
                    relating to French history, and partly of a literary character, was bequeathed
                    to the Museum by the Earl of Bridgewater, accompanied by a small real estate,
                    and a sum of L∙7000 to be invested, and the interests, as they became available,
                    applied in the purchase of manuscripts. The last distinct collection is that of
                    the Howard-Arundel manuscripts, acquired from the Royal Society in 1831, partly
                    by exchange, and partly by purchase at an estimated value of L.3560. It consists
                    of more than five hundred volumes, contains many manuscripts of interest in
                    almost every branch of learning, and is rich in materials for the history of our
                    own country and language. The ancient rolls and charters of the Museum, many
                    thousands in number, form another division of the department of manuscripts,
                    with a distinct catalogue. These records and deeds partly belong to the
                    Cottonian, Harleian, and Sloane collections, and partly are accumulated
                    additions, being chiefly illustrative of English history, and of monastic and

                    contains the best and most useful edition of almost every Greek and Roman
                    classic, with the best translations in English, and some in other modern
                    languages; the class of mathematical science in all its branches is very full,
                    including the best scientific journals, and transactions of learned societies;
                    and the historical department, founded on the collection of Mr Astle, which was
                    purchased by the managers at the formation of the library, is, in its various
                    divisions and subdivisions, exceedingly interesting. A catalogue, methodically
                    arranged, with an alphabetical index of authors, by William Harris, was printed
                    in 1809, in 8vo. The library of the <hi rend="italic">London Institution</hi>
                    was commenced under the direction of Professor Porson, and has been admirably
                    selected. Next to that of topography, the departments of classical literature,
                    mathematics, and history, are the most amply stocked. It is also rich in
                    bibliography, there being few works absolutely necessary to be consulted by the
                    bibliographical student, which may not be found in this valuable collection. In
                    the “introductory preface” to the methodical catalogue of the library, recently
                    published, there are some judicious remarks as to the importance of classed
                    catalogues. The library of the <hi rend="italic">Surrey Institution,</hi> though
                    less numerous than either of the two preceding ones, presents a choice
                    collection of the most useful books in the different departments of literature,
                    together with some rare and curious works. The catalogue is systematically
                    arranged, with an alphabetical index of authors.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">The library of printed hooks founded by Archbishop Bancroft in the reign
                    of King James I. occupies the four galleries over the cloisters of Lambeth
                    Palace. The number of volumes contained in this library is estimated at upwards
                    of 25,000, many of which are of extreme rarity. In ecclesiastical history and in
                    biblical literature, few collections contain so large a number of scarce and
                    curious editions. The class of English topography is also extensive and
                    valuable. The first catalogue of printed books was drawn up by Bishop Gibson; it
                    was afterwards transcribed in a fair hand by Dr Wilkins, and has been continued
                    hy his successors to the present time. The manuscripts, many of which are
                    extremely valuable, are arranged in seven sets or divisions, distinguished as

                    Hours of the Holy Virgin; a number of papal bulls; various treatises of
                    Wickliffe; manuscripts relating to the history of France, and other European

                    several letters to and from Charles II.; and certain manuscripts on heraldry and
                    genealogy, written or corrected by Lord Burghley. But perhaps the two greatest
                    curiosities in this collection are the ancient French version and exposition of
                    the Apocalypse, ornamented with miniature paintings; and the Latin copy of the
                    Apocalypse, also beautifully illuminated, which is supposed to have been written
                    in the thirteenth century. A catalogue of these manuscript treasures, compiled
                    by the Rev. H. J. Todd, the keeper, was printed in 1812, in one volume folio, at

                <p part="N">The different colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have all libraries of
                    various extent attached to them; but in each university there is at least one
                    great or principal library, as the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and that of
                    Trinity College, besides the Public or University Library, at Cambridge.</p>
                <p part="N">The Bodleian Library, so called from the name of its illustrious
                    founder, was instituted towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth, by Sir
                    Thomas Bodley, who, having become disgusted with some court intrigues, resigned
                    all his employments about the year 1597, and immediately afterwards undertook
                    the generous task of restoring the public library at Oxford, which had been
                    despoiled of its contents in the reign of Edward VI. With this view, he
                    despatched from London a letter to the vice-chancellor, offering not only to
                    restore the building, but to provide a fund for the purchase of books, and the
                    maintenance of proper officers. This offer being thankfully accepted, he
                    commenced his undertaking by presenting to the library a large collection of
                    books purchased on the Continent, and valued at L.l0,000. He also collected 1294
                    rare manuscripts, which were afterwards increased to G818, independently of 1898
                    in the Ashmolean Museum. Other collections and contributions were also, by his
                    example and persuasion, presented to the new library. The most important of
                    these, perhaps, was a considerable portion of the very valuable library which
                    had belonged to Jerom Ossorius, the Cicero of Portugal, successively bishop of
                    Sylvas and of Algarve, in which last see he died in 1580. This library having
                    fallen to the share of the Earl of Essex, amongst the booty which had been
                    takeιf in the expedition against Cadiz in 1598, part of it was by him presented
                    to Bodley, in order to enrich the collection he was then forming. The additions
                    thus made soon swelled to such an amount that the old building was no longer
                    sufficient to contain them. The edifice was accordingly enlarged; and when
                    Bodley had succeeded in enriching his collection beyond his most sanguine
                    expectation, he drew up for its government a body of statutes, which have since
                    been incorporated with those of the university. The Bodleian Library was first
                    opened to the public on the 8th of November 1602; and, since 1780, a fund of
                    more than L.4C0 a year, arising from a small addition to the matriculation fees,
                    and a moderate annual contribution by such members of the university as are
                    admitted to the use of the library, have been established for the purchase of
                    books. It would require a volume to contain an enumeration of the many important
                    additions which have been made to this library by its numerous benefactors, or
                    to admit even a sketch of its ample contents in almost every branch of
                    literature and science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    exceedingly rich in many departments in which most other libraries are
                    deficient, and it forms altogether one of the noblest collections of which any
                    university can boast; but a complete catalogue of the valuable stores of
                    literature contained in it is still, we regret to say, a desideratum;<note

                    general utility of the collection is materially abridged. The first catalogue of
                    the printed books was published by Dr Hyde in 1674, and another of the
                    manuscripts was printed in 1697. A fuller catalogue of the books, compiled by
                    Bowles, Fisher, and Langford, was printed in 1738, in two volumes folio; but,
                    from the'immense increase of the collection since that period, this, as well as
                    the others, has become of little use. A catalogue of the manuscripts relating to
                    oriental history, drawn up by Professor Urie, was printed in 1787, in one volume
                    folio. In 1795, there was also printed a <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> of
                    first, early, or Aldine editions of certain Hebrew, Greek, and Latin works
                    contained in the library, the articles indicated being all of the greatest
                    rarity; and, in 1812, appeared the first part of a catalogue by Professor
                    Gaisford, of the manuscript collection purchased by Dr Edward Daniel Clarke, in
                    his travels through various parts of Europe and Asia. But no complete or general
                    catalogue, either of the printed books or the manuscripts, has yet been
                    published; and for this reason it is impossible to give any specific or
                    satisfactory account of this magnificent collection.</p>
                <p part="N">The riches of the Bodleian Library are very imperfectly known to the
                    world, and its stores are increasing faster than they can be catalogued; yet the
                    library is not generally accessible, even to the students of the university; and
                    the arrangements are such, that the very persons engaged in teaching have but a
                    limited use of it. The average number of daily readers is stated to be about
                    half a dozen; whilst, in the British Museum, it is at least one hundred and
                    fifty. The books of the Bodleian Library are not allowed to go out, and, by this
                    restriction, its utility is greatly abridged. The use, to a reasonable extent,
                    of a collection which is certainly one of the best in the world, would of itself
                    form a strong inducement to study at Oxford; and it is inconceivable how this
                    advantage should have been withheld, considering that the terms in which Sir
                    Thomas Bodley made his donation to the university present no obstacle whatever
                    to the lending out of books.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">The libraries of the different colleges are many of them considerable,
                    some of them extensive, and not a few of them enriched with much that is both
                    curious and rare. Bishop Rede contributed the first part of the collection of
                    books in Merton College, which has since been augmented, both in manuscripts and
                    in printed books, by the liberality of succeeding benefactors. University
                    College Library possesses a considerable collection of printed books and
                    manuscripts, together with some works of art. Baliol College Library suffered by
                    the depredations of the visitors appointed by’ Edward VI.; but the damage was
                    afterwards repaired by a supply of books from Durham College, and by successive
                    donations. The library of Queens College contains some curious manuscripts,
                    chiefly heraldic and political, a valuable series of coins, a collection oí
                    numismatical works, and a fine orrery. The books of New College occupy two
                    spacious apartments, and there is also a collection of manuscripts. The library
                    of Lincoln College is chiefly remarkable for a collection of Greek and <pb

                    Latin manuscripts made by Sir George Wheler in his travels. That of All-Souls’
                    College is an excellent collection; it was admirably arranged, under the
                    superintendence of Sir William Blackstone; and the greatest facility is
                    consequently afforded in consulting any class. In the library of Brazen-nose
                    College, the ancient custom of chaining the books to the shelves was strictly
                    observed until the year 1780, when this conservative practice was abandoned.
                    This collection is of considerable extent and value. The library of Corpus
                    Christi College is enriched with a valuable set of Aldine classics, with many
                    manuscripts and printed books, of great rarity and in excellent preservation,
                    and with the manuscripts of Twyne and Fulman, the Oxford antiquarians. The
                    Aldines were collected by the founder, Richard Fox. In 1755, Lord Coleraine gave
                    to this library a large and valuable collection of Italian literature. The
                    library of Christ Church would probably have exceeded that of any contemporary
                    establishment, had Wolsey been able to complete his original design, which was,
                    not only to supply it with such books as had appeared since the invention of
                    printing, but also with copies of the most valuable manuscripts in the Vatican.
                    This collection is principally composed of the extensive and valuable library
                    bequeathed by the Earl of Orrery, amounting to 10,000 volumes; of that left to
                    the college by Wake archbishop of Canterbury, consisting of printed books and
                    manuscripts, with a collection of coins and medals; and of the contributions of
                    a number of benefactors. In 17G7, the numismatical series was further enriched
                    by the collection of British and English coins belonging to Dr Barton, and, in
                    1780, by that of oriental coins collected by Dr R. Brown, canon and regius
                    professor of Hebrew. The library of Trinity College was instituted by the
                    founder, Sir Thomas Pope, who was also the first contributor of books. The
                    collection was afterwards enlarged by various benefactions, and is now one of
                    considerable extent. The library of St John’s College contains a valuable
                    collection of printed books and manuscripts given by Archbishop Laud; many
                    specimens of natural and artificial curiosities, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi>
                    and relics of antiquity; with a collection of Greek, Roman, and English coins,
                    bequeathed by Dr Rawlinson, along with his books. In the library of Wadham
                    College are many early printed books, and a good collection of classics and
                    works on theology, together with French, Italian, and Spanish literature. The
                    library of Worcester College is a considerable collection, and particularly rich
                    in architectural books and manuscripts. The Radcliffe Library, so called from
                    the munificent founder, Dr Radcliffe, who left L.40,000 for the erection of a
                    public library in Oxford, with an endowment of L.150 a year to a librarian, and
                    L.100 for the purchase of books, is an extensive and valuable collection, and
                    contains some valuable but neglected manuscripts.<note anchored="true"

                            oriental manuscripts in England is not satisfactory, and that things
                            least used are not always best cared for. 1 he following is his own
                            account of the matter :—“We commenced a diligent search; at last we drew
                            forth from a press which had long been unvisited, the separate and tom
                            portions of manuscripts, covered with dust and dirt, and leaves rolled
                            up together promiscuously. Oh, what destruction did I then see! Nothing
                            was ever scattered more confusedly from the Sybil’s cave into every
                            quarter of the heavens, when the leaves on which she used to write her
                            oracles were carried away by a sudden storm. I was not able to examine

                    much that is valuable or curious both in the department of printed books, and in
                    that of manuscripts. The printed books comprise a fine series of <hi

                    considerable proportion of the productions of Caxton’s press. The most important
                    acquisition made by this library was that of the collection which had belonged
                    to Dr Moore, bishop of Ely, amounting to 30,000 volumes, which were munificently
                    purchased for six thousand guineas by his majesty King George I., who presented
                    them to the library, and further gave L.2000 towards fitting up the apartments
                    destined for their reception. Bishop Moore’s collection, which is singularly
                    rich in the productions of the early English printers, was offered to the Earl
                    of Oxford for L.6000, and on his refusal was purchased and presented as has just
                    been mentioned. A method of arranging the books in the public library of
                    Cambridge was long ago proposed by Dr Middleton, but no catalogue of them has
                    yet been printed. The number of volumes in this library must now considerably
                    exceed 100,000. Amongst the manuscripts contained in it are, 1. the celebrated
                    manuscript of the four Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, known by the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex Bezoe,</hi> which was presented to the university by

                    St John’s College Library contains one of the most valuable and extensive
                    collections of books in the University, particularly in biblical and classical
                    literature, and is also enriched with some first editions which came originally
                    from the Harleian collection. The Pepysian Library, Magdalen College, is so
                    called from the founder, Samuel Pepys, secretary to the admiralty in the reigns
                    of Charles II. and James II. who bequeathed to this college his valuable
                    library, together with his prints and drawings. It is remarkable for a
                    collection of old English ballads, in five volumes folio, begun by Mr Selden,
                    and continued to the year 1700; and two volumes of Scottish poetry, consisting
                    of pieces by Gawin Douglas, Dunbar, Lindsay, Drummond, James I. and other poets.
                    Dr Percy, in his <hi rend="italic">Reliques,</hi> has made a judicious selection
                    from the former; and, in 1776, Mr Pinkerton published copious extracts from the
                    latter. Pepys’s collection of prints and drawings, illustrative of the history
                    of London, and his rare British portraits, are particularly valuable.<note

                <p part="N">The library of Earl Spencer, at Althorp, Nottinghamshire, though a
                    private collection, is eminently deserving of notice here, not so much by reason
                    of its extent, which is very considerable, as on account of the unrivalled
                    treasures which it contains in several departments of literature, sacred as well
                    as profane. This library, amounting to not less than 45,000 volumes, exclusively
                    of the Cassano collection purchased in 1820, was entirely formed by the late
                    Earl Spencer, within a period of time not exceeding twenty-four years; and it is
                    unquestionably the richest private collection in Britain, perhaps in

                    fifteenth, and of valuable first editions published in the sixteenth century,
                    was laid by the purchase of the collection of Count Reviczky, a foreign nobleman
                    who had occupied himself in accumulating rare and curious works of a peculiar
                    description. But many scarce and valuable impressions of the classical authors
                    were afterwards obtained; and in the departments of literature and the
                    belles-lettres it was enriched with some magnificent acquisitions. Impressions
                    of Bibles and Testaments, and of portions of the sacred text in almost all
                    languages, are to be found in this extraordinary collection; the departments of
                    classical literature, in the Greek, Latin, and Italian languages, are of equal,
                    if not greater extent and value; whilst the choice, condition, and splendour of
                    the entire collection are such as render it quite unique and unrivalled.<note

                    But, perhaps, its most remarkable feature is the unexampled assemblage to be
                    found in it of works illustrating the origin and progress of typography. It
                    contains several books, consisting of impressions taken from carved wooden
                    blocks previously to the invention of metallic types, and thus exhibiting the
                    earliest specimens of stereotype printing. In others, engraved figures
                    constitute the principal part, to which is added a small proportion of text, and
                    only one side of the leaf is employed, the other being left blank. Such is the

                    as the earliest specimen of block-printing. Amongst the early printed and scarce
                    biblęs in the Althorp Library, may be mentioned the Mazarin Bible, printed
                    between 1450 and 1455; one supposed to be the work of Albert Pfister, prior to
                    1460; Fust and Schoeffer’s Bible, 1462; that by Sweyheym and Pannartz, 1471; a
                    Dutch Bible, 1477; Prince Radziviľs Bible in Polish; besides other early copies
                    in the .different languages of Europe. The same collection contains the Latin
                    Psalter of Fust and Schoeffer, printed in 1457, being the first printed to which
                    a date is affixed; and another of nearly equal rarity, printed in 1459. Many of
                    the earliest editions of the classics, beautiful copies on vellum, and the works
                    of all the celebrated printers of the fifteenth century, add to the value of
                    this unrivalled collection. The Cassano Library,<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">We come now to Scottish libraries, and shall commence with the largest
                    as well as richest of the number; that of the Faculty of Advocates. The plan of
                    forming a library appears to have been adopted by the Faculty as early as the
                    year 1680. The author and active promoter of the scheme was Sir George Mackenzie
                    of Rosehaugh. It was originally intended that it should consist merely of the
                    works of lawyers, and of such other books as were calculated to advance the
                    study of jurisprudence. This may be inferred from the inaugural address
                    delivered by Sir George Mackenzie when the library was first opened, and from
                    several other papers relative to the subject. At its commencement, this library
                    had no certain fund allotted for its maintenance. It depended upon and owed its
                    increase to the donations of benefactors, together with such sums as the Faculty
                    from time to time placed at the disposal oí the curators. In the year 1700, the
                    apartment where the library was kept being nearly destroyed by fire, it was
                    removed to the place which it partly still occupies, namely, the ground floor of
                    the Parliament House. During the nine years immediately following, it must have
                    increased considerably,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">In 17θ7, the library received a large donation of books in

                            on that branch of science have since been added.</p></note> since by the
                    act passed in the eighth year of Queen Anne’s reign, the privilege of receiving
                    a copy of every book entered at Stationers’ Hall was conferred upon it, alongst
                    with eight other libraries, four of which were Scotch, being those attached to

                    jurisprudence, literature, and the arts. As might be expected, the collection of
                    law-books is extensive; but it is much more complete in ancient than in modern
                    works, many important treatises on foreign jurisprudence being still wanting.
                    The historical collection, which is exceedingly valuable, contains almost every
                    work of consequence that has been published in Great Britain, France, Italy,
                    Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden. This department alone comprehends upwards
                    of 20,000 volumes. The collection of Greek and Roman classics, though it cannot
                    vie with some others, is also choice and extensive, including several first and
                    many early editions. The library is rich in modern poetry and belles-lettres,
                    and, besides the miscellaneous department, contains a very considerable

                    mathematical and physical science; in archaeology or antiquities; in early as
                    well as modern Italian literature; and, generally, in foreign literature of a
                    recent date. Amongst the separate collections are, the Astorga library, the
                    Thorkelin collection, and that of old Scottish books. A collection of Spanish
                    books, amounting to about 3400 volumes, which had formerly belonged to the
                    library of the Marquis of Astorga, was purchased from a London bookseller in
                    1824, for the sum of L.3000. It consists principally of works on Spanish
                    history, including the old chronicles, as well as of books on law and theology,
                    with a sprinkling of the old Spanish poems and romances. The Thorkelin
                    collection, so called from Professor Thorkelin, to whom it originally belonged,
                    contains about 1200 volumes, chiefly on northern law, history, and antiquities.
                    Of the Scottish books, those relating to old Scottish poetry are exceedingly
                    rare and curious. They amount to between three and four hundred volumes, and
                    their number is likely tó be still further increased by the zeal and research of
                    the present librarian, Dr Irving, who has already made many important additions
                    to this collection, partly by the acquisition of new articles, and partly by
                    detaching curious pieces from other collections, and putting them in a distinct
                    and more accessible form. His labours in this department, with which he is
                    intimately conversant, have been beyond all praise; and he is constantly on the
                    watch to take advantage of every opportunity that offers for augmenting its
                    treasures. There is also a collection of German dissertations, amounting to
                    upwards of 100,000, called Count Diedrich’s collection, which was purchased by
                    Sir William Hamilton, on account of the library, for the trifling sum of L.80.
                    This library is not rich in typographical rarities. It contains few Caxtons,
                    and, with the exception of the Mentz Bible, and some specimens of early printing
                    in Scotland,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >The first production of the Scottish press preserved in this library
                            should not pass unnoticed. It is a breviary composed by he bishop of
                            Aberdeen for the use of his cathedral, and printed in the year 1509; and
                            it consists of two volumes in small octavo, but of he first volume the
                            title-page and some leaves at the end are wanting. The second volume,
                            printed in 1510, has at the beginning a calendar, and at the end these
                            words: “Opido Edinburgensi impresso jussu et impensis honorabilis viri

                            stands a tree, from which is suspended a shield with W. C. in

                    printed volumes contained in the library does not, it is thought, fall much

                <p part="N">The department of manuscripts, though not so extensive is in some other
                    libraries of the same class, is neverthe-ess of great interest and value with
                    reference to the civil, and particularly the ecclesiastical history of Scotland.
                    Soon after the foundation of the library, the Faculty appear to have turned
                    their attention to the collection of manuscripts; and this important department
                    now consists &gt;f nearly 1700 volumes, of which about 250 have been added
                    within the last fifteen years. The most valuable portion of the manuscripts is
                    that which relates to the ecclesiastical state of Scotland immediately preceding
                    the era of the Reformation, and includes, amongst other things, thirteen
                    chartularies or volumes of records of the different religious houses, which
                    escaped the general destruction in which the edifices themselves were then
                    involved. Considerable light is also thrown on the civil and ecclesiastical
                    history of Scotland at a later period, by the documents and other materials
                    contained in the collections of Sir James Balfour, Sir Robert Sibbald, and
                    Wodrow the historian. Balfour’s collection, which consists of upwards of sixty
                    volumes, was purchased at a considerable expense in 1698. About the half of it
                    consists of original state papers, and several very curious royal letters
                    written in the times of James VI. and Charles I. From these, selections were
                    made by Lord Hailes, and printed in 1762 and 1765. The Annals of Scotland,
                    compiled by Sir James Balfour, were also printed in 1824, 1825, in four volumes
                    8vo. But there still remain unprinted some manuscripts on genealogy and
                    heraldry, besides a considerable number of curious documents. Sir Robert
                    Sibbald’s collection, consisting of upwards of thirty volumes, was purchased by
                    the Faculty in 1723. It is chiefly of a topographical and literary character;
                    but the substance of the greater part relating to topography has already been
                    published. Wodrow’s collection is by far the most voluminous, consisting of
                    upwards of 160 volumes. It was chiefly from this immense mass of materials that
                    that laborious writer compiled his History of the Sufferings of the Church of
                    Scotland; but by far the greater portion of the collection, containing many
                    curious original documents not to be met with elsewhere, is still unprinted. His
                    correspondence with many eminent literary characters, embracing a period of more
                    than thirty years (from 1694 to 1726), and extending to about thirty volumes, is
                    also full of curious information respecting the literature and history of the
                    period to which it refers. A collection of original documents belonging to the
                    reigns of James V., Queen Mary, and James VI., was presented to the library by
                    the Earl of Balcarrasin the year 1712; these papers have lately been arranged
                    and bound, and now consist of nine volumes folio. This department also contains
                    Lord Fountainhalľs collections, in his own handwriting, including his decisions,
                    historical notices, diary,and other matters. We may likewise notice the curious
                    and interesting papers of Paton, Murray, Anderson, and Hutton, all of which have
                    recently been arranged and bound in several folio and quarto volumes; and also
                    those collected by Mr Scott of Perth, consisting of about twenty volumes folio,
                    and comprising the Blackfriars charters, in three volumes, extracts from the
                    records of the Church of Perth, in four volumes, the records of the Hospital
                    from 1577 to 1732, extracts from the records of the Kirk-session, a chronicle,
                    and a register of baptisms and deaths. Amongst the Scottish historical records
                    are, letters-from James V., and the Earl of Arran, governor of the kingdom in
                    the infancy of Queen Mary, to the kings of England, France, Norway, and
                    Portugal, to the Duke of Guise, the Earl of Suffolk, and others, from 1539 to
                    1542: also original letters by Queen Mary, addressed to her mother the
                    queendowager, during the early years of that beautiful but ill-fated princess;
                    by Anne of Denmark, queen of James VI.; by Prince Henry and Prince Charles, his
                    sons; by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205349?mode=fullsize"

                <p part="N">The same department includes a number of manuscripts on heraldry,
                    genealogy, and Scottish law, besides many of a miscellaneous nature. It also
                    contains several early manuscripts of the classics, and a few illuminated
                    missals. Amongst the former may be mentioned a very fine copy of Horace,
                    belonging to the thirteenth century; the plays of Terence, executed in the year
                    1436; a copy of the Epigrams of Martial, in perfect preservation, which, from
                    the style of the writing, has been ascribed to the ninth century, and is
                    supposed to be one of the most ancient manuscripts of the Epigrams extant;<note

                    adorn this department of the library. It was from the Bannatyne collection that
                    Allan Ramsay selected the poems which were printed in the Evergreen; and from
                    the same source Lord Hailes extracted a volume, which was printed in the year
                    1770. In 1825, about a hundred volumes of Icelandic manuscripts, amongst which
                    are several ancient Sagas, were purchased of Professor Magnuson of Copenhagen,
                    and added to the collection; and in the following year, Mr Elρhinstone, and Mr
                    Erskinc, formerly of Bombay, presented to the library some valuable Persian and
                    Sanscrit manuscripts. Not long ago a beautiful manuscript of the Hebrew Bible
                    was purchased in Germany; it is in two large folio volumes; and the Pentateuch,
                    besides the original, has also the Chaldaic paraphrase. A manuscript of the <hi

                <p part="N">The building which contains the bulk of the Advocates’ Library is not
                    only confined, but is in several parts exceedingly dark and inconvenient. The
                    historical department, however, has been separated from the rest of the
                    collection, and arranged in a spacious and elegant apartment, with convenient
                    side-rooms, recently provided for its reception, being intended to form the
                    grand entrance to a large building which it is proposed to erect for the
                    reception of the great body of the library, as soon as the necessary funds can
                    be obtained. The library is governed by five curators, one of whom goes out of
                    office annually by rotation, and another is elected in his stead from amongst
                    the body of the Faculty. Under the curators are a principal keeper or librarian,
                    and several assistants. The library is supported partly by the acquisitions
                    which it is continually making in virtue of the right conferred upon it by the
                    copy-right act, and partly by an annual sum paid to the curators for the use of
                    the establishment out of the revenue of the Faculty. No public institution in
                    Great Britain, or perhaps in Europe, is conducted with greater liberality than
                    the Advocates’ Library. Strangers arriving in Edinburgh are freely admitted
                    without introduction; and any one who is at all known is never denied the
                    privilege of resorting to, and of reading or writing in, the library. Very
                    eminent men have been keepers of this collection, particularly Thomas Ruddiman,
                    David Hume and Adam Ferguson. The present librarian, Dr Irving, well known by
                    his Life of Buchanan and other works, is a distinguished scholar, a learned
                    civilian, and eminently skilled in ancient Scottish history, biography, and
                    poetry.</p>
                <p part="N">The first volume of the general catalogue was begun in 1735, and printed
                    in 1742, under the superintendence of the learned Ruddiman and Mr Walter
                    Goodall; the second, consisting of later acquisitions, was compiled by Mr
                    Alexander Brown; and this was followed by a third volume, printed in 1807, all
                    in folio; but the manuscript additions which have since been made are at least
                    equal to other two printed volumes of the same size. There are manuscript
                    catalogues of the Astorga and Thorkelin collections; but as yet there exists no
                    separate catalogue of the manuscripts. A catalogue of the law-books was printed
                    in 1831, in one volume 8vo. There is no classed catalogue of the Advocates’
                    Library, nor even a classed index to the general catalogue, which would be a
                    great convenience to those engaged in scientific or literary pursuits.</p>
                <p part="N">The library of the Writers to his Majesty’s Signet is an excellent and
                    valuable miscellaneous collection of books in science, law, history, geography,
                    statistics, antiquities, literature, and the arts; and it has recently been
                    rendered much more accessible by the ample and spacious accommodation provided
                    for it. It is contained in two large and beautiful apartments, both under the
                    same roof, with small rooms adjoining. The accommodation altogether is perhaps
                    superior to that of any library in Britain. The books arc arranged in classes or
                    departments, not in conformity to any particular bibliographical system, but
                    with reference simply to the nature and extent of the collection, and the
                    circumstances necessary to be attended to in placing it in the particular
                    apartments which it occupies. The arrangement, however, is such as to afford
                    facilities for reference, and to exhibit, in a general way, the component parts
                    or branches of the collection. The upper apartment, in which about 14,000
                    volumes have already been placed, contains the following classes, viz. theology
                    and ecclesiastical history; general and particular history, biography, and
                    antiquities; arts and sciences; transactions of learned societies,
                    encyclopaedias, and dictionaries; polygraphy, or the collected works of authors
                    who have treated on various subjects; classics, translations, and works
                    illustrative of the classics; .and, lastly, belles-lettres and miscellaneous
                    literature in the learned as well as in foreign languages. The lower apartment,
                    and the adjoining small rooms, contain the classes of civil, Scottish, English,
                    and foreign law; British and Irish history, biography, antiquities, topography,
                    and statistics, with all works relating to these heads; geography, voyages and
                    travels; bibliography; belles-lettres, in the English language, and the
                    miscellaneous productions of British literature; besides collections of
                    periodical publications, parliamentary reports, and parliamentary debates, with
                    a collection of maps suspended in spring cases. The class comprising works
                    relating to the history, biography, antiquities, topography, and statistics of
                    the British empire, forms the most extensive department of this collection, and
                    is, in fact, nearly complete in most of its subdivisions. The choice and
                    condition of the books generally, and the rarity, value, and splendour of many,
                    deserve particular notice; and, indeed, this library, though supported
                    exclusively from the funds of the Society to which it belongs, possesses some

                    expensive works ever published, either abroad or at home. The number of volumes
                    may be estimated at nearly 50,000. There is a classed catalogue, formed on De
                    Bure’s system, and very skilfully executed, which was printed in the year 1805;
                    but this applies only to a small portion of the collection, which has been very
                    greatly increased since the catalogue in question was prepared. An alphabetical
                    catalogue of the whole collection has been printed, in progressive parts; and to

                    which will, in a great measure, supply all the advantages of a catalogue
                    raisonné. The government of the library is vested in a body of curators, elected
                    by the Society; and under them are a principal librarian and several assistants.
                    Here, as is the case of the Advocates’ Library, the utmost liberality is shown
                    to strangers, and to literary men generally.</p>
                <p part="N">ļ Like most other college libraries, that of the University !of
                    Edinburgh was founded by a donation; and, for a long period, the casual
                    contributions of benefactors constituted its principal means of support as well
                    as of increase. In 1580, Mr Clement Little, commissary in Edinburgh, bequeathed
                    his library, consisting of about 300 volumes, chiefly theological, to Edinburgh
                    and the Kirk of God; and this small collection was, not long afterwards,
                    transferred by the Town Council to the College, which they were then
                    instituting. Little’s bequest thus laid the foundation of the University
                    Library. But it was subsequently augmented, partly by the donations of citizens,
                    and still more by the benefactions of persons who had received their education
                    in the College. Amongst the latter may be mentioned, Dr Robert Johnston, the
                    Rev. James Nairne, and, above all, Drummond of Hawthornden, i∣one of the
                    favourite sons of the Scottish muse. Drummond bequeathed to the College his
                    whole library, consisting of about 500 volumes; and the gift is the more
                    valuable, because, independently of the high reputation of the donor, the
                    collection is enriched with many rare specimens of our early literature, and may
                    indeed be considered as altogether unique and unrivalled. In 1763, the library
                    of the incorporation of surgeons was added to that of the &gt;College, in
                    consequence of an agreement, which has event-aally proved eminently advantageous
                    to the former body, whatever may be the case in as far as regards the interests
                    )f the University. This collection consisted of about 500 'volumes, almost
                    entirely professional, and now of very little "value. The principal bequest
                    which the library has more recently received is that of Dr William Thomson, who,
                    in 1808, left it about 600 volumes, chiefly on medical subjects, hi a
                    testamentary bequest by the late General Reid, who was educated at this
                    university, mention is made of the ibrary, as an object to the improvement and
                    extension ∣∣bf which, his munificent legacy is, amongst other things, '.o be
                    applied. The funds by which the library is maintained, and its progressive
                    enlargement secured, are, ma-riculation fees, fees on graduation in three
                    faculties, a lonation of L.5 from each professor on his induction, an <hi
                        rend="superscript"> i</hi> mnual payment of L.20 by the College of Surgeons,
                    occasional donations of books, and its acquisitions as one of the privileged
                    libraries; but from the sums tlļus realized ire of course to be deducted the
                    salaries of the persons employed in the establishment. The ordinary managenent
                    of the library is vested in nine curators appointed annually by the Senatus
                    Academicus, four of whom retire from office every year, and are immediately
                    succeeded by an equal number of professors next in seniority, who are willing to
                    undertake the duty. Four of these curators are from the medical, one from the
                    theological, and four from the general department, including classes neither
                    medical nor theological.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    90,000 printed volumes, including some great typographical rarities; and the
                    accommodation now provided for it is of the most magnificent description, the
                    library-hall being by far the most spacious and noble apartment in Scotland. As
                    to the collection generally, it contains much that is valuable, and a good deal
                    that is both curious and rare; but, considered as a repository of varied
                    information in science and literature, it is unequal and defective, being
                    redundant in some branches and deficient in others. Its most ample department is
                    that of medicine, a purely professional one, and more largely replenished than
                    any other with obsolete matter. Those of natural philosophy and natural history
                    are tolerably supplied with the works belonging to them. But the case is
                    different in the departments of metaphysical, ethical, and political science, in
                    all of which the deficiencies are still great, though, happily, in the way of
                    being gradually supplied. In classical literature, too, including under that
                    head all that relates to the exposition and illustration of the ancient authors,
                    there are perhaps few great libraries more defective.<note anchored="true"

                    exertion will be made, not only to supply obvious and glaring deficiencies, but
                    also to give to the collection that character of generality, founded upon the
                    possession of all that is most useful and interesting in every branch of
                    knowledge, which constitutes the best recommendation of a great public library.
                    This it is which has imparted to the library of Göttingen its great and
                    acknowledged excellence. The only catalogue yet printed is one of the books
                    relating to medicine, arranged alphabetically according to the names of the
                        authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    attached to the university a theological library, founded towards the close of
                    the seventeenth century, and now containing about 5000 volumes.</p>
                <p part="N">The history of the library of Glasgow College, though curious and
                    interesting, is chiefly a register of the numerous successive donations by which
                    it was gradually formed. Amongst the names of its early benefactors we find that
                    of George Buchanan, who, it appears, presented to the college twenty volumes,
                    consisting entirely of Greek works, chiefly classics,<note anchored="true"

                    now be ascertained. This library is said to contain upwards of 30,000 volumes;
                    and the funds for its support are derived from the interest of certain small
                    sums bequeathed by individuals, from graduation fees, and from the contributions
                    of students, including the interest accruing from the deposit money. It also

                <p part="N">There was very early a library in each of the colleges at St Andrews;
                    but no mention is made of an university library until about the commencement of
                    the seventeenth century. At that period, there occurs a notice of such a <pb

                    collection; and a catalogue of its contents, made at the time, is still extant,
                    the books being chiefly presents from James VI. and the members of his family.
                    With this public university library, those of St Salvator’s and St Mary s
                    Colleges came, in process of time, to be incorporated; and, rather more than
                    half a century ago, that of St Leonard s College, the best of the collections,
                    was conjoined with the rest. As now constituted, the library is supported by the
                    interest of money made up out of the excess of the receipts above the
                    expenditure of its funds, the surplus rent of some teinds and lands held in
                    lease from the exchequer, certain fees on graduations, and an annual payment by
                    every student of the university, exclusively of its right to receive books from
                    Stationers’ Hall.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    printed volumes, and is, upon the whole, an excellent collection. There is a
                    printed catalogue to the year 1826, and a progressive manuscript one since that
                    time.</p>
                <p part="N">There is reason to believe, that from the first institution of the
                    university of Aberdeen there was a collection of books at King’s College, but no
                    particular record of the library or its management, prior to the year 1634, is
                    now to be found. The collection is considerable, containing from 15,000 to
                    20,000 printed volumes, and a number of manuscripts. Amongst the latter are, a
                    splendid copy of the Koran, said to have belonged to Tippoo Sahib; a work on
                    Hindu theology, written upon fine vellum, and rolled on a piece of ivory like
                    the <hi rend="italic">volumina</hi> of the ancients; and a Shaster in Sanscrit,
                    written on the leaves of trees. This library is entitled to a copy of every book
                    entered at Stationers’ Hall. Its funds, however, arc altogether inadequate, not
                    only for the purchase of new, and particularly foreign publications,· but even
                    for binding the books obtained from Stationers’ Hall, in the way proper for a
                    public library. The library of Marischal College had its origin in a collection
                    of books made at the time of the Reformation by the magistrates of Aberdeen, and
                    partly procured from the suppressed monasteries of that city.<note

                            of which was to be applied as a salary to a librarian. Reid’s collection

                <p part="N">The library of Trinity College, Dublin, owed its establishment to a very
                    curious incident. In the year 1603, the Spaniards were defeated by the English
                    at the battle of Kinsale. Determined to commemorate their victory by some
                    permanent monument, the soldiers collected amongst themselves the sum of L.1800,
                    which they agreed to apply in the purchase of books for a public library, to be
                    founded in the then infant institution of Trinity College. This sum was placed
                    in the hands of the celebrated Usher, who immediately proceeded to London, and
                    there purchased the books necessary for the purpose. It is a curious
                    coincidence, that</p>
                <p part="N">Usher, whilst occupied in purchasing these books, met in London Sir
                    Thomas Bodley, engaged in similar business, with a view to the establishment of
                    his famous library at Oxford. From this commencement, the library of Trinity
                    College was at different periods increased by many valuable donations, including
                    that of Usher’s own collection consisting of 10,000 volumes, until at length its
                    growing magnitude requiring a corresponding increase of accommodation, the
                    present library-hall, a magnificent apartment of stately dimensions, was erected
                    in the year 1732. In 1787 the entire collection consisted of 36,047 volumes of
                    printed books, and 1111 volumes of manuscripts and prints. But since that time
                    great additions have been made to the library. When the French invaded Holland
                    in 1794, the collection of Pensionary Fagel, amounting to upwards of 20,000
                    volumes, was removed to England, where, in 1802, it was purchased by the College
                    for the sum of L.8000, granted for the purpose by the trustees of Erasmus
                        Smith.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Vι,

                            being at first intended for sale by public auction, a classed catalogue
                            by Mr Samuel Paterson was printed nı the beginning &lt; 1802. Speaking
                            generally of this collection, in the preface Mr Paterson says, “It is
                            one genuine library, which has been accumulating in the family of Fagel,
                            a name of the first respectability, and which has borne in succession
                            the highes dvι offices in the united states of the Netherlands upwards
                            of one hundred and twenty years. It abounds in many of the choicest
                            books in theology and ecclesiastical history, in classical and
                            philological learning, and in most branches of polite literature, arts,
                            and sciences; it inc udes almost all the great <hi rend="italic"

                            are very numerous), are commonly of the best impressions: as an

                            justly rank among the most distinguished.”</p></note> Another important
                    addition was made to the original collection by the acquisition of the valuable
                    classical and ltalian books which had belonged to Mr Quin; and, altogether, the
                    library of Trinity College now forms one of the first order, at least in this
                    country. In the department of printed books, the total number of volumes is now
                    supposed to fall little short of 100,000. The Usher manuscripts amount to 693,

                    persons to upwards of 200 volumes. Usher’s manuscripts may be classed into
                    Bibles, and parts of Bibles, with commentaries; breviaries, missals, Roman
                    rituals, the works of the fathers, and oriental writers; systematic, scholastic,

                    lastly, Irish histories and genealogies, civil and ecclesiastical. The subjects
                    of the Stcarne manuscripts are somewhat similar to these, with the exception
                    that some of them treat of forensic subjects.<note anchored="true"

                    endeavour to give some account of the principal collections in France, Spain,
                    Italy, Germany, Poland, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden. This account, however, must

                    capital are, the Royal Library, the Mazarin Library, the library of the Arsenal,
                    the library of St Genevieve, the City Library, and the libraries of the Chamber
                    of Peers, the Chamber of Deputies, the Institute, and the University. The
                    libraries of the departments are two hundred and fifty in number, exclusively of
                    those which are specially annexed to learned bodies, to establishments of public
                    utility, to colleges, and other institutions.</p>
                <p part="N">The Royal Library of Paris is justly considered as the finest in Europe.
                    It was commenced under the reign of King John, who possessed only <hi
                        rend="italic">ten</hi> volumes, to which 900 were added by Charles V., many
                    of them superbly illuminated by John of Bruges, the best artist in miniatures of
                    that time. Under Francis I. it had increased to 1890 volumes, and under Louis
                    XIII. to 16,746. In 1684 it possessed 50,542 volumes; in 1775 it amounted to
                    150,000; and by 1790 it had increased to about 200,000. At present it contains
                    about 700,000 printed volumes, and 80,000 manuscripts. In 1667, Louis XIV.
                    having ordered all the medals and curiosities contained in the royal residences
                    to be collected together, caused them to be deposited in the library. Learned
                    antiquarians, sent into foreign countries, augmented this collection; rare and
                    precious objects were successively acquired; and the library at present
                    possesses the richest and most varied collection that exists in Europe. The
                    cabinet of engravings, also founded by Louis XIV., is composed of paintings on
                    vellum, designs, and an immense collection of prints and maps, from the
                    discovery of engraving to the present time. It contains 1,400,000 prints or
                    engravings, and 50,000 maps and charts.</p>
                <p part="N">The Royal Library is at present divided into the following departments:
                    viz. Isŕ, printed books; <hi rend="smallcaps">2ćZ,</hi> manuscripts, charters,
                    and diplomas; 3űř, coins, medals, engraved stones, and other antique monuments;
                    4Λ⅞, engravings, including geographical charts and plans. These four departments
                    form four distinct establishments, which, by their importance and the richness
                    of their treasures, exceed every thing of the kind that is to be found in other
                    countries. It is indispensable that the library should every year make the
                    acquisition either of foreign books or of French works in which it is deficient;
                    and it is equally obliged to purchase manuscripts, prints, charts, and medals. A
                    decree of 1556, which fell into desuetude during the troubles of the Fronde, but
                    was renewed in 1689, imposed on publishers the obligation of furnishing to the
                    Library of the King copies of all works printed by privilege; and each copy
                    required to be bound. At present the law prescribes the deposit of copies of all
                    books printed; but the other condition is dispensed with. In consequence of this
                    privilege, the Royal Library receives annually about 9000 volumes stitched; and
                    the number of foreign books sent to it, or acquired by purchase, may be
                    estimated at from 2000 to 3000 volumes. Now, as the price of the binding of each
                    volume is, on an average, three francs, it follows that a sum amounting to about
                    36,000 francs, or L.1450, would be necessary, every year, to defray the expense
                    of binding alone. But as the funds have for many years been insufficient to meet
                    the whole of this expense, the library has at present more than 120,000 volumes
                    stitched or in boards, and of these there are about <hi rend="superscript">
                        ot</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 000 which urgently require binding.
                    There are likewise 15,000 manuscripts which either require to be bound, )r of

                <p part="N">The additions from the Vatican Library, selected by the French
                    commissioners in 1797, were particularly valuable, amounting to 501 manuscripts.
                    Of these, twenty were Hebrew; forty Syriac; nineteen Coptic; eleven Chinese; 133
                    Greek, amongst which were the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi> of the Septnagint; 176 Latin, including the

                    eleventh, Caesar of the twelfth, Plautus of the eleventh, Pliny of the tenth,
                    and Ovid of the twelfth centuries; besides many other manuscripts illustrative
                    of the history of the ninth and tenth centuries. Numerous manuscripts in modern
                    languages were also seized in virtue of the compulsory treaty of Tolentino,
                    particularly the Commedia of Dante, transcribed by Boccacio, the Arcadia of
                    Sannazaro, Michel Angelo’s letters, and also those of Henry VIII. and Anne
                    Boleyn; besides 136 early printed books, thirteen Etruscan vases, and 737
                    ancient coins. To these must further be added the manuscripts collected by the
                    French in other parts of Europe, to which their victorious eagles had
                    penetrated. But the events of 1814 and 1815 were followed by as complete a
                    restitution of the literary treasures as of the works of art acquired by right,
                    or rather by abuse, of conquest. Of the contents of this magnificent, nay
                    matchless collection, it would far exceed our limits to give any details, or
                    even to enumerate the choicest articles. It is rich in every branch and
                    department, unique in some, scarcely surpassed in any, unrivalled in all taken
                    together. Of books printed on vellum, it contains at once the finest and most

                    Excepting on Sundays and holidays, the Royal Library is open daily, from ten
                    until two o’clock; every book is brought that is required; and literary men of
                    known respectability are permitted to take books to their own residences. The
                    annual expense of the establishment is 274,000 francs, or nearly L.11,000
                    sterling, which is provided for in the budget. The principal librarian is the
                    celebrated Hellenist, Μ. Letronne, with the title of director-president; the
                    conservators, or keepers, are MM. Van-Praët, Magnin, Champollion-Figeac, Hase,

                    printed in 1653. in 4to, treats of some manuscripts, which are divided into
                    historical and chronological, biblical and theological, epistolary and
                    diplomatic, technical and philological. Anicetti Mellot’s catalogue of the
                    manuscripts in the Royal Library was printed at Paris, 1739-1744, in four vols,
                    folio. The first volume contains the oriental manuscripts; the second, the Greek
                    manuscripts; the third and fourth comprise those in the Latin language. The

                    of it was intrusted to the learned Gabriel Naudé, who, having first selected all
                    that suited his purpose in the booksellers’ shops in Paris, travelled into
                    Holland, Italy, Germany, and England, where the letters of recommendation of
                    which he was the bearer enabled him to collect many very rare and curious works.
                    In 1648, this collection consisted of 40,000 volumes, and was already a public
                    library, though that of the king did not become one until 1737. Cardinal Mazarin
                    by his will bequeathed it to the college which he founded, and which, until the
                    epoch of the Revolution, hore the name of the founder. At present it contains
                    90,000 printed volumes, and 3437 manuscripts. It is remarkable for a great
                    number of collections containing detached pieces, and small treatises, which
                    date as far back as the fifteenth century, and exist nowhere else; nor has any
                    other library so complete a body of the ancient books of law, theology,
                    medicine, and the physical and mathematical sciences. It also possesses a most
                    precious collection of the Lutheran or Protestant authors. In one of the halls
                    are placed models in relief of the Pelasgic monuments of Italy and of Greece; in
                    another is a terrestrial globe, eighteen feet in diameter, formed of plates of
                    copper, and executed by order of Louis XVI. This monument, which is unique in
                    Europe, is unfortunately not finished; a sum of 25,000 francs (L.1000) would be
                    necessary to provide it with the requisite circles. The Mazarin Library is
                    habitually frequented by more than an hundred readers. It is supported by an
                    annual grant of about L.1400, provided for in the budget.<note anchored="true"

                    more than 175,000 volumes, of which about 6000 are manuscripts. It possesses the
                    most complete collection extant of romances, since their origin in modern
                    literature; of theatrical pieces, or dramas, from the epoch of the moralities
                    and mysteries; and of French poetry since the commencement of the sixteenth
                    century. It is less rich in other branches, but it has all works of importance,
                    and, in particular, contains historical collections which are not to be found
                    elsewhere. The library of the Arsenal has always attracted the attention of the
                    learned from all parts of Europe. It is constantly frequented by more than sixty
                    readers, who there apply themselves to scientific and literary researches. The

                    Cardinal de Rochefoucauld, having reformed the Sainte-Geneviève, made it a
                    present of 600 volumes. In 1687, the abbey had already 20,000 printed volumes,
                    and 400volumesof manuscripts. In 1710, Letellier, archbishop of Paris,
                    bequeathed to it all his books. At the epoch of the Revolution it possessed
                    90,000 printed volumes and 3000 manuscripts; at present it contains 160,000
                    volumes and 3500 manuscripts. In it may be found all the academical collections,

                    its most remarkable manuscripts are Greek and oriental. Its typographical
                    collections of the fifteenth century are not more valuable for their number than
                    the high state of preservation in which they are found. This fine library is
                    daily frequented by upwards of two hundred persons, of whom more than a half are
                    students in the different faculties. It is supported by an annual grant from the
                    public treasury of</p>

                <p part="N">The foundation of the library of the Institute was the old City Library

                    scarcely 20,000 volumes. At present this excellent and useful collection amounts
                    to nearly 80,000 volumes. It is not yet complete in any department; but it
                    nevertheless exhibits the best possible selection of the principal works in all
                    the important branches of human knowledge; and it may be truly said that it is
                    kept up to the actual state of science and learning. In the acquisitions which
                    are made, the objectis not to search for rare editions, but to obtain such as
                    possess some peculiar merit. Academical collections of all kinds and of all
                    countries, magazines and journals of science and literature in all languages,
                    are to be found in it in greater number than any where else. The library
                    increases daily. Numerous works are presented to the Institute, which, on its
                    part, is constantly making new acquisitions; and the premises allotted for its
                    accommodation have become insufficient to contain its accumulations. This
                    collection is reserved for the members of the five academies of which the
                    Institute is composed; but all strangers presented by them are admitted, and it
                    is <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> public. As it is open everyday during seven
                    hours, the service therein is more severe than in the other libraries, which are

                    conservators and assistants remains the same. The annual expense of the
                    establishment, though arranged with the strictest economy, amounts to 46,500
                    francs, or about L.1860.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">The provincial libraries of France, as they are supported at the expense
                    of the different cities, are naturally placed under the immediate direction of
                    the mayors and municipal councils'; but they are not the less on that account
                    under the superintendence of the superior authority of the minister of public
                    instruction. Their number, as already stated, exceeds 250, exclusively of those
                    attached to societies, colleges, and other institutions. Amongst the most
                    considerable are those of Bordeaux (115,000), Lyons (100,000), Aix (75,000),
                    Besançon (56,000), Amiens (48,000), Versailles (40,000), Marseilles (35,000),
                    Toulouse (30,000), &amp;c. The catalogue of the manuscripts in the library of
                    Lyons, 1518 in number, is one of the most interesting which has issued from the
                    French press (Paris et Lyon, 1812, in three vols. 8vo). The preliminary
                    disquisition contains notices of the ancient libraries of Lyons; the historical
                    essay on manuscripts contains a neat account of the materials anciently used in
                    writing; the biography of writers who have treated of the subject, though brief
                    is worthy of attention; and the manuscripts are classed and described with equal
                    judgment and learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">The number of public libraries in Spain is much greater than has
                    commonly been supposed; nor have the science and literature of that country sunk
                    to sueh a state of depression as some have been pleased to represent. Few
                    nations, it is true, have ever been doomed to pass through so long and dreary a
                    course of misgovernment; in none have bad laws corruptly administered, and a
                    system of civil polity at variance with every sound principle, done more to
                    cramp the energies and debase the general character of the people. But in spite
                    of the evils which have thus been entailed upon her, Spain is by no means the
                    degraded and benighted country which many have been led to suppose. Her
                    scientific and literary institutions are respectable; several of her
                    establishments are admirable; and some of her collections are unique. The very
                    extravagance and absurdity of her fiscal regulations and expurgatory
                    prohibitions have served to defeat their own operation; and the contrabandistas
                    have ministered to those wants which, under a better and more healthy system,
                    would have been supplied by the regular dealer.<note anchored="true"

                    kind in general circulation has at all times been mueh greater than persons
                    unacquainted with the real state and condition of that country could have
                    imagined. But our business here is with the public and permanent collections of
                    Spain, which are, the Royal Library at Madrid, the library of the Escurial, and
                    the libraries of the provinces.</p>
                <p part="N">There are in Madrid four public libraries, which are constantly open
                    from nine in the morning until two in the afternoon, holidays excepted. Of
                    these, the principal is the <hi rend="italic">Bïblioteea Peal,</hi> which was,
                    several years ago, removed to a building erected for the purpose in the square
                    beside the palace. This noble collection is open to all, as far at least as the
                    printed books are concerned. The reading-tables are placed in three spacious
                    apartments, corresponding to as many sides of the edifice, which is built round
                    a court, with a fine stair-ease in the eentre; in the middle of these rooms are
                    rows of tables provided with writing materials and chairs; and against£the walls
                    are the book-shelves, numbered and tastefully ornamented. The catalogues are
                    kept in a small room apart, where there are two or three persons in attendance
                    to answer the inquiries of the stranger, and to furnish him with the number and
                    shelf where any particular work may be found. The service of the library is
                    excellent. The principal attendants, ten in number, are respectable literary
                    men, who find here a maintenance, and leisure to follow their different
                    pursuits. The Royal Library contains 200,000 printed volumes, and from 4000 to
                    5000 manuscripts, amongst which are many valuable Greek, Latin, and Arabic
                    manuscripts, and unedited works, ehiefly Spanish. The establishment of the
                    library consists of one principal librarian, D. Joaquin Patino, six keepers, and
                    the ten attendants already mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Monetario,</hi> or
                    cabinet of medals, is arranged in an elegant and beautiful apartment, and
                    contains an unrivalled collection of</p>
                <p part="N">Celtic, Phoenician, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Gothic, Arabic, and
                    modern coins and medals, in excellent preservation. “Le cabinet des médailles de
                    Madrid,” says Μ. Faure, “est sans doute le plus remarquable de l’Europe. Tandis
                    que Paris, qui l’emporte si incontestablement sur la capitale des Espagnes par

                    there are about 130,000 printed volumes, and between 4000 and 5000 manuscripts,
                    of whieh 567 are Greek, 67 Hebrew, and 1800 Arabic. The Arabie manuseripts were

                    particularly one of the Four Gospels, written on 160 leaves in gold letters, and
                    supposed to be of the tenth eentury; a treatise by St Augustin, <hi

                    was the practice of Arias Montanus, whose library formed the basis of that of

                <p part="N">Italy is rich in literary institutions of all kinds, particularly in
                    noble collections of books and manuscripts. Indeed there is scarcely a city in
                    the whole peninsula without its library; and many of those which are considered
                    as small collections in that country would be differently estimated in most
                    others. It is to be regretted, however, that of some of the larger collections,
                    as for instance the Ambrosian Library at Milan, no adequate account can be
                    given, owing to the inaccessibility of the necessary materials.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the libraries of Italy, that of the Vatican, at Rome, stands
                    pre-eminent, not more for its grandeur and magnificence, than for the
                    inestimable treasures with which it is enriched. The origin of this library is
                    attributed by some to Pope Hilarius, who, in the fifth century, founded one in
                    the Lateran Palace. But although it is probable, that, even prior to that
                    period, the Roman church must have possessed a considerable stock of books for
                    the use of its clergy, yet it may be supposed that the pontiffs were too much
                    occupied with the dangers and difficulties of the times, to have either the
                    leisure or the means necessary for the formation of libraries. That a good many
                    volumes, however, had been collected at an early period, seems pretty certain;
                    nor is it less so, that Pope Zacharias considerably augmented their number about
                    the middle of the eighth century. Still Nicholas V., learned himself, and a
                    distinguished patron of letters, is justly considered as the founder of the
                    Vatican Library; for of the collections of his predecessors little remained when
                    he ascended the papal throne, the books having been either lost or destroyed by
                    the frequent removals from Rome to Avignon, and from Avignon to Rome. This
                    pontiff added above 5000 manuscripts to the original collection, placing all in
                    the Vatican; and Calixtus III. is said to have enriched it with many volumes
                    saved from the libraries of Constantinople, when that city fell into the hands
                    of the Ottomans. From this period, it continued to increase in a regular
                    progression, receiving almost every year vast additions, sometimes even of whole
                    libraries, owing not only to the favour of the pontiffs and various princes, but
                    also to the well-directed zeal of its librarians, many of whom have been men of
                    eminent talents as well as of high rank and extensive influence.<note

                    a most valuable addition was made by the purchase of the library at Heidelberg,

                    Christina queen of Sweden, were likewise annexed to the collection in the
                    Vatican. The same pontiff despatched Leo Allatius into Germany for the purpose

                    ante-room is appropriated to the two keepers of the library, and the
                    secretaries, or rather interpreters, seven in number, who can speak the
                    principal languages of Europe, and who attend for the convenience of learned
                    foreigners. In this apartment are also accommodated those engaged in translating
                    from the Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin languages; and it is open
                    daily for the use of students, Thursdays and holidays alone excepted. Passing
                    from the ante-room, the visitant enters a double gallery of two hundred and
                    twenty feet in length, which strangers at first conceive to be the whole
                    library; but at its extremity there opens upon the astonished visitant, in

                    occasioned partly by the want of a catalogue, and partly also by the books being
                    kept in close cases; but when we take into view the successive accumulations of
                    so many centuries, and consider the number of entire libraries which have, at
                    different times, been combined with this vast collection, we shall not probably
                    err in estimating the total number of printed volumes at upwards of 500,000,
                    amongst which is a choice collection of books printed in the fifteenth

                <p part="N">But the superiority of this library consists not so much in the quantity

                    Gospels of St Luke and St John, written in the tenth century, and bound in
                    ivory. Amongst the rare manuscripts in this splendid collection may also be
                    mentioned, several Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and Armenian Bibles; a very large
                    Hebrew Bible presented to the library by the Duke of Urbino, for which the

                    of the Apostles, written in gold letters, and presented to Innocent VIII. by the
                    queen of Cyprus; a Missal written in 1118; another adorned with miniatures by
                    Giulio Clovio, the scholar of Giulio Romano, and the finest miniature-painter of
                    his time; a large Breviary, ornamented with beautiful miniatures, and presented

                    compulsorily restored, after the events of 1814 and 1815. There is also attached
                    to it a chamber filled with a fine collection of prints, to which admission can

                    connection with antiquity, and owes its existence entirely to the munificence of
                    Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, nephew of Charles Borromeo, and his successor in the
                    see of Milan. This prelate began to collect books, when a student at Rome; and
                    enlarging his plan as he advanced in age and dignities, he, when raised to the
                    archbishopric of Milan, erected an edifice, placed in it his collection, and
                    opened it to the public under the title of <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                        Ambrosiana.</hi> This library contains between 40,000 and 50,000 printed
                    volumes, and upwards of 15,000 manuscripts; and there is annexed to it a gallery
                    of pictures, statues, antiques, and medals, comprising many articles of great
                    rarity and value. In the department of manuscripts is a collection of the
                    various works of Leonardo da Vinci, enriched with his drawings and designs: it
                    was presented by a citizen of the name of Galeas Arconati, who generously
                    refused a vast sum for the precious treasure, and, to secure the possession of
                    it to his country, consigned it to the Ambrosian Library as to an inviolable
                    sanctuary. The sanctuary, however, was violated by the French—“di Pa-rigile
                    vagabonde belve,”—in 1791, who seized the cherished relic of Leonardo’s genius,
                    and sent it off to Paris, tumbled and tossed in the common massy&gt;f

                    the fortune of war at length compelled them to restore. The same department also

                    name it is distinguished; the Marucelliana; the Riccardiana, which was purchased

                <p part="N">The Mediceo-Laurentian Library, which is contained in the convent
                    annexed to the church of San Lorenzo, was commenced by Cosmo de’ Medicis, the
                    father of a line of princes whose name and age are almost synonymous with the
                    restoration of learning. “His credit,” says Gibbon, “was ennobled into fame; his
                    riches were dedicated to the service of mankind: he corresponded at once with
                    Cairo and London; and a cargo of Indian spices and Greek books were often
                    imported by the same vessel.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                Empire,</hi> vol. xii. p. 136.</p></note> As the natural disposition
                    of this princely merchant led him to take a very active part in collecting the
                    remains of classical antiquity, so his wealth and extensive commercial
                    intercourse enabled him to gratify his taste to the fullest extent. Fie enjoined
                    his friends and correspondents, as well as the missionaries who travelled into
                    remote countries, to search for and procure ancient manuscripts in every
                    language and upon every subject. He availed himself of the services of the most
                    learned men, his contemporaries; and the situation σf the eastern empire, then
                    falling into ruins, afforded him an opportunity of obtaining many valuable works
                    in the Hebrew, Greek, Chaldaic, Arabic, and Indian languages. After the death of
                    Cosmo, his son pursued the same object with steady perseverance, and added
                    considerably to the treasures which had been accumulated by his father. But
                    although the ancestors of Lorenzo de’ Medicis had laid the foundation of the
                    Laurentian library, the honour of raising the superstructure belonged to Lorenzo
                    himself, whose assiduity and liberality in enlarging his collection of books,
                    manuscripts, and antiquities, were unbounded. To this object his time and his
                    fortune, exceeding that of princes, were equally devoted. Shortly after the
                    death of Lorenzo, however, this matchless collection was dispersed by the French
                    troops under Charles VIII. in resentment of some imaginary insult; and in the
                    perpetration of this sacrilegious deed, “the Gallic herd” were joined by the
                    Florentines themselves, who openly carried off, or secretly purloined, whatever
                    they could discover that was most rare, curious, and valuable. The library,
                    however, was subsequently restored by the perseverance and liberality of Leo X.
                    who caused it to be removed to Rome; but it was reconveyed to Florence by his
                    successor Clement VII., who, by a bull dated the 15th of December 1532, made
                    provision for its future security. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    himself to the honourable office of librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany at
                    Florence, and became one of the most eminent literary characters of his time.
                    The force of natural talent overcame all the disadvantages of the humble
                    condition in which he had been born, and placed him in a situation to make his
                    name known and respected. But he endeavoured to deserve still better of his
                    countrymen, by presenting them, some time before his death in 1714, with his
                    large and valuable collection of books, together with what remained of his
                    fortune, as a fund for its support. This constituted the foundation of the
                    Magliabechian Library, which, by the subsequent donations of several
                    benefactors, and the bounty of some of the grand dukes, was so much increased
                    both in number and value, that it may now vic with some of the most considerable
                    collections in Europe. The books printed in the fifteenth century have been
                    described by the Abbate Follini, the present librarian, who dedicated his

                    accuracy of detail; and to these are added brief notices of the lives of the
                    different authors, derived from the most authentic sources. The Magliabechian
                    Library is supposed to contain 150,000 printed volumes, and 9000 manuscripts;
                    and the public are admitted to it every day of the year, except on Sundays and
                    festivals. The Librarian has an annual stipend of 240 scudi, but not more than
                    100 scudi are expended annually in the purchase and binding of books.<note

                    Friday. The Riccardi collection is managed by the Canon Bianchi and a

                    control of the minister of the interior; the sums expended, however, are but
                    trifling. The libraries of the universities of Pisa and Sienna are valuable,

                <p part="N">There are five public libraries at Naples, viz. the Royal Library, the
                    Brancacciano Library, the library of the University, the library of the Military
                    Staff, and the library of the Monks of St Jerome. The Royal Library contains
                    about 300,000 printed volumes and 6000 manuscripts; the University possesses
                    50,000 volumes; the Convent of St Jerome has an equal number; the Brancacciano
                    contains 10,000; and the Military Staff has 10,000. The public have free
                    admission to read in these libraries, but no books are allowed to be taken away.
                    They are all open every day, for about six hours, excepting on holidays, when
                    they are closed. The expenses of the Royal Library arc included in those of the
                    Museum, of which it forms part. It is entitled to two copies of all books
                    printed in the kingdom of Naples; and 4000 ducats (L.687) are annually
                    appropriated to the purchase of foreign books. The expenses of the library of St
                    Jerome are defrayed out of the funds of the Convent to which it belongs; but,
                    like the Brancacciano, the Military Staff, and the University Libraries, it is
                    entitled to one copy of every book printed in the kingdom of Naples. This
                    collection is singularly rich, chiefly in ancient books. There are no public
                    libraries in any of the provincial towns, excepting Foggia and Lucera; but in
                    every diocese there is a library belonging to the see, to which, upon
                    application, admission may at all times be readily obtained.<note

                <p part="N">The remaining libraries in Italy are numerous, and some of them
                    considerable, particularly those of Venice and Turin. In the library of St Mark
                    at Venice, there is a copy of the Gospel of the evangelist of that name, which
                    is affirmed to have been written by himself. This library was founded in the
                    fourteenth century, the ςpllection having been begun by Petrarch, who bequeathed
                    his books to the republic. Cardinal Bessarion, by his will, added to the library
                    the curious collection of manuscripts which he had formed in Constantinople, in
                    Egypt, and in Greece; and further additions were subsequently made to it by
                    other cardinals. The library of St Mark is deposited in two apartments, one of
                    which is appropriated to manuscripts, whilst the other contains the printed
                    books. Though small when compared with other libraries of the Continent, this
                    collection includes many rare and valuable articles.<note anchored="true"

                    except festivals. Connected with the university are several museums,
                    particularly that of Egyptian antiquities, purchased by the king, of Mr
                    Drovetti, which is one of the richest and most valuable in Europe. Attached to
                    the university of Genoa, which now belongs to the king of Sardinia, is a
                    library, consisting of about 45,000 volumes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">The libraries of Germany, taking that name in its widest acceptation,
                    are, some of them, of the first order, and many of them extensive and important;
                    but, from the length to which this article has already extended, we must confine
                    our notices exclusively to the principal collections, which we shall describe in
                    the order, not of place or of time, but of their relative magnitude and
                    value.</p>
                <p part="N">The Imperial Library at Vienna is perhaps inferior only to that of the
                    Vatican and the Royal Library at Paris, for the rarity and value of its
                    contents. It was founded by the Emperor Frederick III. who spared no expense to
                    enrich it with printed bocks as well as manuscripts in every language. By the
                    munificence of succeeding emperors, numerous important and valuable accessions
                    were made to the collection; amongst which may be mentioned the large and
                    interesting library of Prince Eugene, and a considerable portion of the Buda
                    Library, founded by Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. The Imperial Library
                    occupies eight spacious apartments; and a ninth is appropriated to a very
                    valuable collection of medals and other curiosities.<note anchored="true"

                    science, generals and renowned warriors, artists, and others. The sum allowed

                <p part="N">In Vienna, the University Library ranks next to the Imperial Library,
                    but the number of books in it is not stated by Balbi. It received the
                    collections which belonged to the convents suppressed by Joseph II.; and since
                    1806 it has had a right to a copy of every work printed in Lower Austria.
                    Amongst what are called the private libraries, the most important is that of
                    Military Archives, established in 1801, upon a plan devised by the Archduke
                    Charles. It contains 6626 works on military science and art; twenty large folio
                    volumes of bulletins, gazettes, and journals, with an index; seventy-three
                    atlasses, with about 3000 charts, maps, and plans, of various kinds; and a small
                    collection of manuscript military memoirs, amongst which are those of
                    Montecuculi, who commanded the imperialists opposed to Turenne, and of Prince
                    Eugene. The libraries of oriental literature, of natural history, of the
                    Philharmonic Society, and of the Imperial Archives, are also of great value. In
                    the last are preserved the archives of Venice, and Marino Sanudo’s original
                    history of that republic, in fifty-six volumes, which was unknown when Μ. Daru
                    published his celebrated work. Of the libraries belonging to individuals, the
                    most remarkable are those of Prince Metternich, Μ. Von Hammer, and Mr Castelli.
                    Von Hammer possesses an unrivalled collection of Turkish manuscripts. Mr
                    Castelli’s is a dramatic collection, containing upwards of 10,000 German dramas,
                    original and translated; about 500 manuscripts; 700 portraits of actors,
                    actresses, and dramatists; and an unique collection of play-bills from the year
                    1600. The total number of libraries, public and private, in Vienna, is
                    forty-five; and even the latter are accessible to students furnished with proper
                        introductions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    equalling it in the number of manuscripts. From a discourse on the origin and
                    increase of the library at Munich, delivered in 1784, by the Canon
                    Steigenberger, the librarian, and translated into Latin by Vitali, it appears
                    that the Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin manuscripts contained in this
                    library then formed a precious treasure; and, since the period to which this
                    discourse refers, numerous and important additionshave been made to all the
                    departments of the collection. The ancient manuscripts relative to the art of
                    music amount to a great number, and are exceedingly curious·<note

                <p part="N">The library attached to the university of Göttingen contains 300,000
                    printed volumes, and 5000 volumes of manuscripts. But its extent is its least
                    recommendation; for it is not only the most complete amongst the universities,
                    but there are very few royal or public collections in Germany which can rival it
                    in real utility; and if not in Germany, where else? It is not rich in
                    manuscripts, even including the acquisitions which it made from Helmstadt, when
                    the university of that place was dissolved; and many other libraries, as Mr
                    Russell justly observes, surpass it in typographical rarities, and specimens of
                    typographical luxury; but none contains so great a number of really useful
                    books, in almost every branch of human knowledge, This library is mainly
                    indebted for the pre-eminence it has obtained to the labours and exertions of
                    the illustrious Heyne. In the year in which he came to Göttingen as second
                    librarian, the entire control of the library was committed to him, and he became
                    chief. From this moment commenced at once its extension and its improvement.
                    When Heyne went to Göttingen, it already possessed a library of from 50,000 to
                    60,000 volumes, which, compared with those of most universities, was a
                    considerable collection. At his decease it had, according to the most moderate
                    computation, increased, exclusively of extraordinary acquisitions, to upwards of
                    200,000 volumes. But this increase of number was its smallest claim to
                    admiration. At the commencement of this period entire departments of learning
                    were wholly wanting; at its close not only were these deficiencies supplied, but
                    the library had become proportionally rich in every department, and, in point of
                    completeness, unrivalled. It would be interesting to trace the manner in which
                    this change was effected; but neither our plan nor our space admits of such
                    details. The system of catalogues appears to be somewhat complete. There are, in
                    fact, four catalogues connected with each other. Every addition to the library
                    is first entered in the <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> of the year, in which are
                    concisely written the title and date of the book, and the day of its reception.
                    Then the book is entered with its full title in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Accession-Catalogue,</hi> which is also commenced with every year, and
                    forms at its close four volumes; the first containing entries of books on
                    theology; the second, of books on jurisprudence; the third, of those on history;
                    and the fourth, miscellaneous works. These two catalogues are intended more
                    particularly for the use of the librarians; the remaining two are for readers.
                    The third of the series is a complete <hi rend="italic">Alphabetical
                        Catalogue,</hi> in which every book is entered under the author’s name, when
                    given, or, when not given, but known, with a reference thereto under the chief
                    word of the title. Every book of which the author’s name is not known, is
                    entered under such chief word of title; and, on one side, are also entered the
                    date and form, with reference to the entries of the same book in the Manual and
                    the Accession-Catalogue; on the other is entered the head of the classed
                    catalogue to which the book belongs. Lastly, the book is entered in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Classed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scientific Catalogue,</hi>
                    according to its subject, and is then placed in that division of the library to
                    which it belongs. The alphabetical catalogue answers the question, whether a
                    certain book is in the library, and where it is to be found; and the scientific
                    or classed catalogue shows what books are contained in the library upon any
                    given subject. Such is a brief account of the mechanism of this very extensive
                    library. A full exposition of it would require the scientific <hi rend="italic"

                    purchase and binding of books, the keeping of catalogues, and other duties. The
                    general government of the library is vested in directors, who endeavour, as far
                    as their means allow, to procure every thing that is of real worth or value.
                    Recommendations from any of the authorities of the state, for the purchase of

                    celebrated throughout Europe for the many valuable specimens of Greek and
                    oriental literature with which it abounds. To it Joseph Scaliger bequeathed his

                    fortunes, having been successively burned, buried under ground, and decimated by
                    French commissaries on the capture of Brussels. Though restored to its ancient
                    splendour by the care of Count de Cobentzel and of Prince Stahremberg, minister
                    plenipotentiary of the empress-queen, its prosperity was of short duration. For,
                    when the French armies overran the Netherlands, and occupied Brussels, in 1797,
                    Laurent, the representative of the people, caused seven waggon-loads of books
                    and manuscripts to be taken from the Burgundy Library; and some time afterwards,
                    Wailly, Leblond, and others, deputed to commit a second spoliation, selected
                    about 200 manuscripts for the National (Royal) Library at Paris. In 1797, a
                    place was provided for the reception of the books belonging to the. Burgundy
                    Library; and in 1798, the collection was enriched with all that was most
                    valuable from the great depot of the Cordeliers, which was then broken up. Since
                    that period the Brussels Library has, by gradual acquisitions, become more
                    extensive than ever, and at present contains 140,000 volumes of printed books.
                    The library of the government, as it is called, comprises 15,000 volumes of
                    manuseripts, which, however, have not been particularly described. The city
                    library is open four days in the week, from ten o’clock in the morning until two
                    in the afternoon, and the public have free access to the collection. The
                    ordinary annual expense of this establishment amounts to 4800 francs (a mere
                    trifle), but additional sums are from time to time granted for the purchase of
                    books. The library of the government is open every day from nine in the morning
                    until four in the afternoon; and the annual expense amounts to 10,000 francs.
                    The first of these establishments is supported by the city, the second by the
                    government out of the public treasury. The provincial libraries of Belgium are
                    those of Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Liège, Louvain, Mons, Namur, and Tournay, three
                    of which (those of Ghent, Liège, and Louvain) are under the direction of the
                    universities established at these places, whilst the others are under the
                    superintendence of the local authorities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    have gone to enrich its principal spoiler; and it is at Petersburg rather than
                    at Warsaw that we must seek for evidence of what it originally possessed. What
                    is called the King’s Library at Warsaw does not much exceed 20,000 volumes, most
                    of which are modern; but it contains a manuscript, in three folio volumes, with
                    nearly two hundred fine drawings, descriptive of the antiquities excavated at
                    Velleia between the years 1760 and 1765. The university of Warsaw, founded by
                    the Emperor Alexander in 1816, had accumulated a library of about 150,000
                    volumes; but, since the events of 1830 and 1831, every book and pamphlet in it,
                    conceived to be hostile to the Russian government, have been removed, and
                    numbers of scientific works have likewise been abstracted and sent off' to St
                    Petersburg. The university of Cracow has also attached to it a library,
                    containing about 4000 manuscripts, amongst which is a Latin encyclopaedia, in a
                    large folio volume, written by Paul of Prague in 1459. But the most extensive
                    and valuable collection in Poland was that which Count Zaluski and his brother
                    had formed, and which, in 1747, was devoted to the public. The Zaluski Library,
                    called also the Library of the Republic, originally consisted of 300,000
                    volumes, including upwards of 50,000 duplicates, which were subsequently
                    disposed of; and by the sale of these, together with the losses sustained by
                    various depredations, the collection was supposed, in 1791, not greatly to
                    exceed 200,000 volumes. At length, in 1795, this library was unceremoniously
                    seized by Suwarof, hastily packed up, and despatched to St Petersburg, to
                    aggrandise the conqueror with the literary spoils of Poland.</p>

                    here employed by him. A robber docs not surely create the wealth which he
                    forcibly appropriates. Considerably more than half the actual contents of the
                    Imperial Library were obtained by one act of wholesale spoliation. The French,
                    when they conquered Italy and Belgium, decimated the libraries of those
                    countries. But the Russians, when they triumphed over the independence of
                    Poland, carried off entirely the largest collection of books which that country
                    could boast of. The original founder of this library was Joseph, count de
                    Zaluski, bishop of Kiof. In the space of forty-three years he had acquired, at
                    his own expense, above 200,000 volumes. His brother, Andrew Zaluski, bishop of
                    Cracow, enriched this numerous collection, as well with books drawn from the
                    museum of John HI. king of Poland, as with those which he collected from the
                    libraries of his uncles, Andrew Olszofski, primate of the kingdom of Poland,
                    Prince Andrew Chrysostom, bishop of Warmia, and Louis Bartholomew, bishop of
                    Plock; and after having joined to these the collection in his own cabinet, he
                    transferred the whole, in 1742, to a house which had previously belonged to the
                    family of Danilovitch, and had probably come to him by inheritance. In 1747 he
                    rendered it public, and fixed an annual income or endowment for its support and
                    increase. After thedeath of this prelate, his brother, Joseph Zaluski, still
                    further augmented it by the addition of a great number of volumes, and, by his
                    will, made in 1761, bequeathed it, along with the house in which it was
                    deposited, to the college of Jesuits at Warsaw.<note anchored="true"

                            carried off, particularly during the late troubles. In 1747, the
                            laborious librarian, Ianozki, made notices of the rare books printed in
                            Polish; and, in 17ð2, he published a catalogue of the manuscripts in
                            this library. After the death of its founder, the Bishop of Kiev, the
                            king and the commonwealth took possession of this treasure, in spite of

                    suppression of that order in 1773, it was placed under the care of the
                    commission of education, and at last transferred to St Petersburg in 1795, as
                    already mentioned. This transportation being made by land, and along roads which
                    the late season of the year rendered impracticable, several cases suffered much
                    from the inclemency of the weather, others were broken or damaged, and the books
                    which they contained spoiled, misplaced, or separated, and the sets broken. The
                    collection was conveyed to the imperial cabinet in two convoys, and after the
                    inventory had been completed on the 23d of February 1796, it was found that the
                    collection still amounted to 262,640 volumes, and 24,573 prints. This library,
                    thus seized and carried off, and which had been packed in such haste at Warsaw,
                    that the books had been huddled in without any order, so that the volumes of the
                    same work were found dispersed in different cases, comprised in general all that
                    relates to the sciences, the arts, and the belles-lettres. The theological, and,
                    after it, the historical and literary branches, were the most considerable. The
                    theological department alone comprehended above 80,000 volumes. It was also rich
                    in topography, especially the histories of towns; and the literary branch
                    included a precious collection of classical books and works on bibliography; but
                    the departments of philosophy, mathematics, physics, voyages, and antiquities
                    were very incomplete.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    Great, who, in his travels, had observed the benefits resulting from public
                    societies for promoting the advancement of knowledge. The library of the Academy
                    originated in 2500 volumes which the Czar had, <hi rend="italic">more

                    library and cabinet of Count Boutourlin, purchased by the Emperor Alexander.
                    This collection is now open to the public two days in the week, and contains

                <p part="N">There are three public libraries at Copenhagen, viz. the King’s Library,
                    the University Library, and Classen’s Library. The “King’s Library contains
                    400,000 volumes of printed books, and 20,000 volumes of manuscripts. The
                    University Library contains about 110,000 printed volumes, all collected since
                    the year 1728, when the original library was destroyed by fire; together with
                    1761 Icelandic, 202 oriental, and 1228 other manuscripts, partly classical,
                    partly connected with Danish history, besides manuscript collections of the
                    classics. Classen’s Library contains about 35,000 printed volumes, but possesses
                    no manuscripts. These libraries, consisting of 568,000 volumes printed and
                    manuscript, are accessible to all respectable householders, and likewise to
                    strangers introduced by such; and, besides, the books are, under certain
                    restrictions, allowed to circulate. The King’s Library is general, and about
                    equally complete in all the branches of human knowledge. The University Library
                    is also to a certain extent general, but the main body of the collection has
                    been made chiefly with reference to academical education. Classen’s Library
                    consists principally of books of geography, travels, natural history, and
                    agriculture. The administration of these libraries seems to be equally
                    economical and efficient, and is conducted solely with a view to public utility,
                    which, in this case, means public instruction.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">The public libraries, in Sweden are the Royal Library, situated in the
                    northern wing of the king’s palace at Stockholm, and the library called
                    Benzielstjerna-Ľngeström, founded by private individuals, but to which admission
                    is readily granted on recommendation. The Royal Library, which was founded by
                    Gustavus Vasa, and enlarged by the liberality of succeeding sovereigns, contains
                    70,000 volumes of printed books, with 2500 volumes of manuscripts, besides
                    16,500 diplomas, and isopen to the public every day excepting Saturdays,
                    Sundays, and holidays; besides, books are lent out on respectable
                    recommendation. The library of Benzielstjerna Engeström contains about 12,000
                    volumes of printed books, and 3000 volumes of manuscripts, rich in materials for
                    Swedish biography. Besides these, there are libraries attached to the different
                    academies. The number of provincial libraries in Sweden, including those of the
                    universities of Upsala and Lund, is thirteen. That of Upsala, which was founded
                    by Gustavus Adolphus, is the largest in Sweden, and contains 100,000 printed
                    volumes, with 600 volumes of manuscripts. A catalogue of the collection, by
                    Professor Aurivi-lius, was printed in the year 1814, in two vols. 4to.<note

                            The deposit alluded to consists of a large box, upon which stands
                            another of smaller dimensions, both of which are secured by means of
                            strong chains and locks. These were presented to the university by

                    as that university, by Charles X., and possesses about 40,000 volumes. These
                    libraries are supported and increased by an annual grant from the state, and by
                    a fee paid by each student on entering the universities. They are open every
                    day, and each student can borrow books, on the responsibility of a professor, or
                    of some other respectable person. In those provincial towns where large public
                    schools, called <hi rend="italic">gymnases,</hi> are established, there are also
                    public libraries, to the number of about eleven in all. These libraries, which
                    have been founded by private individuals, are kept up much in the same way as
                    those belonging to the universities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">In the United States of North America there are forty-three incorporated
                    colleges or universities, of which thirty have libraries of greater or less
                    extent, containing altogether 128,118 volumes. The largest college library is
                    that of Harvard, which contains 30,000 volumes; and the next is that of St
                    Mary’s College, Baltimore, which possesses 10,000 volumes. Besides these, there
                    are four colleges which have libraries to the amount of about 8000 volumes each.
                    A catalogue of the library at Harvard College, Massachusetts, was printed in
                    1830, in three volumes 8vo; from which it appears that the number of books,
                    which, in 1790, amounted to only 12,000 volumes, now exceeds 30,000, besides
                    several thousands of tracts. The first and second volumes of this catalogue
                    contain a list of the books in alphabetical order; and the third consists of a
                    systematic or classed index to the alphabetical catalogue. There are several
                    other considerable libraries in the United States, as the Public Library at
                    Philadelphia, the Congress Library at λVashington, and a few others ofless note.
                    The Loganian Library, which, in 1791, was incorporated with the Philadelphia
                    Public Library, contained about 15,000 volumes, amongst which were many rare
                    works in classical literature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">At Constantinople there are, within the walls of the seraglio, two
                    libraries, which were founded by Achmed III. and Mustapha HL, and enriched with
                    books acquired by themselves or their successors. These libraries contain
                    upwards of 20,000 volumes, and are gradually increased, cither by purchase, by
                    donations made to the sultan by his grandees, or by confiscations of the effects
                    of public officers, amongst which books are commonly to be found.<note

                    erroneous reports have been circulated, respecting the contents of these
                    libraries. The Abbé Sevin, who arrived at Constantinople in December 1728,
                    failed to obtain admission into the sultan’s library; and, deterred by the
                    assurances he had received, that Amurath IV. had caused all the Greek
                    manuscripts to be burned, he deemed any further research or inquiry to be
                    hopeless; whilst succeeding travellers, relying on statements of a different
                    kind, have confidently asserted that in these libraries were preserved the
                    ancient collections of the Greek emperors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    those which are open to the public. Commentaries, explanations, marginal notes,

                    commentaries), on philosophy, logic, astronomy, arithmetic, medicine, and
                    ethics. The historical works are few in number, and chiefly confined to the
                    Ottoman empire. There are some manuscripts in the Greek, Latin, and other
                    European languages; but no traces whatever have been discovered of the lost
                    decades of Livy, of the writings of Homer or Tacitus, or of those parts which
                    are wanting to complete the works of other ancient authors.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">Besides those of the seraglio, Constantinople possesses thirty-two
                    public libraries, all varying in extent, but more or less celebrated for the
                    number and value of their manuscripts, which are neatly bound in red, green, or
                    black' morocco. The Mahommedans have a peculiar method of indorsing, placing,
                    and preserving their books. Each volume, besides being bound in morocco, is
                    preserved from dust in a case of the same material; and on it, as well as on the
                    edges of the leaves, the title is written in large and legible characters. The
                    books are placed one upon another in presses ornamented with trellis-work, and
                    arc disposed along the wall, or in the four corners of the library. All these
                    collections are open to the public throughout the year, excepting on Tuesdays
                    and Fridays; the librarians are as polite and attentive as Turks can be, to
                    those whom curiosity or love of study attract thither; and every one is at
                    liberty, not merely to peruse, but to make extracts from, the books, and even to
                    transcribe them entirely, provided this be done within the walls of the library.
                    To facilitate literary researches, each library is furnished with a catalogue,
                    containing the title, and giving a short account of the subject of each volume.
                    Theology, including the Koran and commentators thereon, jurisprudence, medicine,
                    ethics, and history, are the sciences chiefly cultivated by the Osmanlecs. The
                    books are all written with the greatest care, on the finest vellum; the text of
                    each page is enclosed in a highly ornamented and gilt frame-work; the beginning
                    of each chapter or section is splendidly illuminated; and the prices of the
                    manuscripts vary in proportion to the beauty of the characters.<note

                    contain a great number of Arabic manuscripts, and some Greek books; but the
                    former proved to be of little literary value; and of the latter, Burck-bardt
                    carried away two beautiful Aldine editions, a Homer, and an Anthology. The
                    priests refused to show him their Arabic memorandum-books previous to the
                    fifteenth century; but from those which he was permitted to inspect, he copied
                    some very interesting documents concerning the former state of the country.<note

                <p part="N">Of the libraries in India, whether composed of European or of native
                    works, the want of the requisite information prevents us from attempting to give
                    any details. The following account of the largest library at Goa, that of
                    theAu-gustinian monks, extracted from the journal of a tour made by Sir James
                    Mackintosh, is almost the only notice of the kind that we have met with, and it
                    is certainly by no means flattering, “The books,” says he, “are about 10,000,
                    chiefly Latin and Portuguese, with a few Spanish, a very few Italian and Greek,
                    no French, and of course no English, and none of any other language. There are
                    not above twenty printed since the close of the seventeenth century. There are a
                    few bad editions of classics, but not a complété edition even of Cicero himself;
                    a great many schoolmen, casuists, and canonists, with some jurists; very little
                    history, scarcely any of modern times, except a little Portuguese; about ten
                    volumes of Portuguese and</p>
                <p part="N">Spanish poetry; no morals, but as the handmaid or rather slave of
                    superstition; no politics, no political economy, no astronomy, no chemistry, no
                    zoology, no botany, no mineralogy, and no book even on mathematics by Euclid. I
                    did not know before that the world had produced 10,000 such useless and
                    pernicious books, or that it had been possible to have formed a large library,
                    with so curious an exclusion of whatever is instructive or elegant.”<note

                    less extensive and valuable, of European and native productions; but they have
                    not been particularly described. Of the native libraries of India, we know but
                    little. That of Tippoo Sahib, which fell into the hands of the British when his
                    capital was taken, consisted, according to Stewart’s catalogue, of nearly 2000
                    volumes, many of them highly ornamented. In China and Japan, and likewise in the
                    capital of the Burman empire, there are considerable collections, though of the
                    precise nature of their contents we still remain entirely ignorant.</p>
