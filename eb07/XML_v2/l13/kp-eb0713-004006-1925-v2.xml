                    general use amongst the Jews, Greeks, and Romans. The candlestick with seven
                    branches, placed in the sanctuary by Moses, and those which Solomon afterwards
                    prepared for the temple, were crystal lamps filled with oil, and fixed upon the
                    branches. The lamps or candlesticks made use of by the Jews in their own houses
                    were generally put into a very high stand on the ground. The lamps supposed to
                    be used by the foolish virgins, in the gospel, were of a different kind.

                    to time with oil. (Matth, xxv. 1, 2.) The lamps of Gideon’s soldiers were of the
                    same kind. The use of wax was not unknown to the Romans, but they generally
                    burned lamps; and hence the proverb <hi rend="italic">Tempus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">oleum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >perdidi,</hi> I have lost my labour. Lamps were sometimes burned in honour
                    of the dead, both by Greeks and Romans. The testimony of Pliny, St Austin, and
                    others, have led many to believe that the ancients had the invention of
                    perpetual lamps; and some moderns have absurdly attempted to find out the
                    secret. The curious may read Dr Blot’s conjectures on the subject in the <hi

                <p part="N">Lamps are usually fed by expressed oils from vegetable or animal
                    substances. In Britain, whale-oil, boiled from the subcuticular fat of the
                    whale, is used for common lamps.</p>
                <p part="N">Tallow is onc of the most common substances employed for giving light.
                    The spermaceti, which is found within the cavity of the cranium of the
                    spermaceti whale, is also used. There is a substance resembling spermaceti,
                    formed by the decomposition of the muscular flesh of animals in moist places,
                    which has been employed. Bees’ wax, a vegetable substance collected by the bee,
                    and which, in some of its qualities, resembles the essential oils, is one of the
                    best materials for giving light.</p>
                <p part="N">In no region of the globe are human beings found to exist without a
                    supply of oil derived from animals or from vegetables; and in the more fertile
                    regions several different plants, peculiar to each region, are cultivated on
                    account of the fixed oil which is extracted from their seeds by pressure. These
                    oils vary in quality. The oils fit to be employed in food are the most valued.
                    Of the rest, many have the qualities which fit them for burning in lamps.</p>
                <p part="N">At Paris, oil of rape-seed and oil of poppy-seed are clarified for the
                    lamp by filtering through cotton wool, and other processes. In the south of
                    France and Italy the inferior kind of olive oil is used in lamps, and sometimes
                    the oil of the plant called <hi rend="italic">Arachis hypogaea,</hi> or
                    earth-nut. In Italy, lamp oil has been expressed from the stones of the grape.
                    In Piedmont, walnut-oil is used for lamps. On the eastern and southern coasts of
                    the Mediterranean, and in China, they use oil of sesamum seed, called in Arabic
                        <hi rend="italic">semsom.</hi> In tropical countries, cocoa-nut oil, which,
                    in the temperature of Britain, is solid and white like tallow, is burned in
                    lamps made of the shell of the cocoa-nut and of bamboo. Much of the oil used in
                    China is obtained by expression from the seeds of the tree called by botanists
                        <hi rend="italic">Camellia oleifera,</hi> which is extensively cultivated
                    for that purpose, as is the shrub called <hi rend="italic">Croton
                        sebi-feruηι,</hi> on account of the solid oil or tallow which the Chinese
                    express from its fruit. Essential oils, extracted from plants by distillation,
                    are too volatile, and, in consequence of their volatility, are too easily
                    inflamed, to be used in lamps.</p>
                <p part="N">Petroleum and naphtha issue from the earth in several places, and these
                    sources are generally in secondary strata, and originate from fossil vegetable
                    matter, in a state approaching to that of pit-coal. A source of petroleum
                    existed some years ago near Colbrook Dale, and there is one at St Catherine’s
                    near Edinburgh. The greatest natural deposits of petroleum and bitumen are in
                    the island of Trinidad, and in the Dead Sea in Judaea. Naphtha is the most
                    liquid of the oils proceeding from fossil vegetable matter, and possesses
                    qualities very fit for burning in lamps. It is employed for this purpose at
                    Genoa, where the streets are lighted with naphtha from Amiano in the adjacent
                    territory. Naphtha, obtained in the state of a clear, colourless liquid, by
                    distillation from pit-coal, has of late been employed for burning, in street
                    lamps, in London.</p>
                <p part="N">Alcohol or spirit of wine, being cleaner than oil, is convenient for
                    feeding a lamp that serves to heat a liquid in a small vessel; but the flame is
                    blue, and therefore it is not suitable for giving light. In a spirit lamp, the
                    surface of the spirit must be covered to exclude the air, for the spirit would
                    catch fire if its surface were exposed.</p>
                <p part="N">Sulphuric ether is too easily inflamed, and too costly tobe used for
                    feeding lamps.</p>
                <p part="N">In a lamp for the purpose of giving light without a considerable
                    quantity of heat, it is required that only a small portion of the oil shall be
                    inflamed at once; therefore, by means of the wick, a small portion of oil,
                    minutely divided so as to expose a large surface, is subjected to the action of
                    the heat; the heat decomposes the oil, and the gas resulting from the
                    decomposition is burned by the atmospheric air which surrounds the wick. In the
                    gas lights, which have come into general use in manufactories and cities in
                    Britain, the operations of producing the gas and inflaming it, which take place
                    at one time in the wick of a lamp, arc performed separately. The gas is obtained
                    from pitcoal, oil, or wood, but best from pit-coal or from oil, by heating these
                    substances strongly in a retort; and, when extricated, is conveyed away in pipes
                    to the place where it is to be inflamed. The capillary attraction of the
                    filaments of the cotton which compose the wick of a lamp, raises up a small
                    portion of oil into a situation where it may be exposed to the degree of heat
                    necessary for producing flame.</p>
                <p part="N">In lamps of the most common structure, the wiċk should not be elevated
                    too high above the surface of the oil; for, in that case, the capillary action
                    by which the oil rises between the filaments of the cotton will not be able to
                    raise it to so great a height. If the wick is too little elevated above the
                    surface of the oil,’ there will not be a sufficient quantity of the oil
                    converted into the gas, whose combustion constitutes the flame, and the flame
                    will be too small.</p>
                <p part="N">Many lamps used by the Greeks and Romans have been found in the ruins of
                    ancient towns. These ancient lamps are of pottery, painted and sculptured with
                    various ornaments, and of bronze. The surface of the oil in the reservoir is
                    nearly on a level with the lighted part of the wick, which emerges from a
                    projecting beak at the side of the reservoir.</p>
                <p part="N">The lamp commonly used in rooms at Florence consists of a round
                    reservoir, with four beaks projecting from four opposite points of its
                    circumference; through the middle of the reservoir a vertical stalk passes; and
                    on this stalk the lamp may be raised or slid down. The stalk is fixed in a foot
                    that rests on the table, and the whole is made of brass.</p>
                <p part="N">A lamp, which affords a faint light, is made of a waxed wick, an inch
                    long, passed through the centre of a thin round piece of cork, and of a piece of
                    card placed above the cork. Some oil is placed on the surface of water in a
                    glass tumbler, and the cork, with its wick, is laid upon the surface of the oil.
                    This lamp, called a <hi rend="italic">veilleuse,</hi> is commonly used in Paris
                    for burning in bed-rooms during the night, as rush-lights are in London.</p>
                <p part="N">The lamp with a hollow cylindrical wick, which receives a current of
                    air, both on the outside and the inside of the cylinder, is called in England an
                        <hi rend="italic">Argand lamp,</hi> from the name of one of the first
                    makers. The wick in Arganďs lamp, as first constructed, was raised by a rack and
                    pinion; but the method now employed to raise the wick consists in a spiral
                    notch, which goes round outside of the interior tube. The inside of the ring to
                    which the wick is attached has a tooth which fits into this notch.</p>
                <p part="N">At fig. 2, Plate CCCXXI., is a representation of the most usual form of
                    the Argand lamp. A is a reservoir, which is air-tight at top, and has the neck
                    immersed in oil, so that oil flows out of it only when the external air is
                    admitted to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201951?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-1951-0042"/>ascend through the neck: it contains a short
                    column of liquid, from the top of which the pressure of the atmosphere is
                    excluded, and therefore the column is sustained by the weight of the atmosphere
                    pressing on its base, on the same principle as a bird-cage fountain.</p>
                <p part="N">Oil is introduced into the reservoir A, by taking it off, and holding it
                    with the neck uppermost. The sliding tube Q. is pushed so as to uncover the hole
                        <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the oil is poured in by the holer; when this
                    is done, the hole is again covered by the sliding tube, and the reservoir A is
                    replaced in F. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hen the lamp is to be lighted,
                    the hole <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is opened by depressing the sliding tube by
                    its handle <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> and the oil will flow out of A till it rise
                    in F, and in the annular cavity that ċontains the wick, to the level of the top
                    of the hole <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> When the oil in F is lowered by the
                    burning of the lamp, so that the surface of the oil in F is below the upper part
                    of the hole; then a bubble of air ascends into A, and a quantity of oil descends
                    into F, till the surface of the oil rises again to cover the upper part of. the
                    hole. It sometimes happens that the air in A is heated by the warmth of the
                    room, and then too great a quantity of oil descends into F, in consequence of
                    the expansion of the hot air in the upper part of A, so that the oil not being
                    all consumed in the wick, falls down through the tube <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    and may even run over from the cup P. This is a considerable inconvenience
                    attending oil reservoirs of the construction here mentioned. The hole <hi
                        rend="italic">t</hi> is closed by drawing up the sliding tube Q,, when the
                    lamp is not burning, in order that the lamp may be inclined, without making the
                    oil descend from the reservoir.</p>
                <p part="N">The cylindrical part, where the flame is produced, is composed of three
                    tubes <hi rend="italic">d, f g. '</hi> The tube <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is
                    soldered to the bottom of the tube <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> just above <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and the inner surface of the tube <hi rend="italic"
                        >d,</hi> is an annular cylindrical cavity closed at bottom, containing the
                    cylindrical cotton wick immersed in oil. The wick is fixed to the wick tube,
                    which is capable of being moved spirally; within the annular cavity is also the
                    tube/, which is capable of being moved round, and serves to elevate and depress
                    the wick. P is' a cup that screws on the bottom of the tube <hi rend="italic"
                        >d,</hi> and serves to receive the superfluous oil that drops down from the
                    wick along the inner surface of the tube <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> The air
                    enters through the holes <hi rend="italic">ο o,</hi> and passes up through the
                    tube <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to maintain the combustion in the interior of the
                    circular flame. The air which goes to perform the combustion on the exterior
                    part of the wick enters through the holes <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> with which
                        <hi rend="italic">r n</hi> is perforated. When the air in the chimney is
                    rarefied by the heat of the flame, the column of the atmosphere, of which the
                    chimney is the base, becomes lighter than the surrounding columns; and the
                    surrounding columns, pressing with their excess of weight, enter the lower part
                    of the chimney, and pass upward, with a rapid current, to restore the
                    equilibrium between the adjacent columns of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p part="N">In some lamps, above the orifice of the tube <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    and nearly at the height of the top of the flame, there is placed a circular
                    plate of metal, of the same diameter as the tube: this has the effect of turning
                    the current of air into that part of the flame where smoke would otherwise be
                    produced. The same effect is obtained by the contraction of the cylindrical
                    glass chimney at R G: the contraction of the chimney was commonly employed in
                    Paris before it was used in England.</p>
                <p part="N">The oil flows from the reservoir A and F through N, and occupies the
                    cavity between the exterior surface of the tube <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and
                    the inner surface of the tube <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The oil rises in the
                    annular cylindrical cavity between these two tubes to the level of the opening
                        <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> The part <hi rend="italic">w i</hi> is a short
                    tube, which receives the circular wick, and slides freely on the tube <hi

                    is capable of being moved round. When <hi rend="italic">n r</hi> is turned

                    wire <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and the tube ∕ and thereby operates the elevation
                    and depression of the wick.</p>
                <p part="N">The glass chimney which rests on R N is wider at bottom, and then is
                    contracted at R G, for the purpose of making the air rush upon the external part
                    of the circular flame in a denser current.</p>
                <p part="N">In the most simple construction of lamps, the surface of oil in the
                    oil-reservoir is nearly on a level with the flame, because the capillary
                    attraction of the wick can only raise the oil a little above the surface of the
                    reservoir. The surface of the reservoir also is considerable, that the lamp may
                    burn for a sufficient length of time, before it has consumed so much oil as to
                    reduce the level of the oil below the reach . of the action of the capillary
                    attraction of the wick. Mechanists have contrived and .executed lamps of various
                    forms, with the view of removing the inconvenience of the shadow of the
                    reservoir, which is inherent in the common lamp with one lateral beak.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the contrivances for diminishing the bulk of the part in which
                    the wick is immersed, and for obtaining a supply of oil, is the bird-cage
                    fountain reservoir described above as being usually applied to Argand lamps.
                    This kind of reservoir is described by Cardan, and a lamp fed by it is mentioned
                    by several writers under the name of Cardan’s lamp.</p>
                <p part="N">Baptista Porta, in treating of oil reservoirs of the kind just now
                    mentioned, proposes that, for large lamps with many wicks, the reservoir should
                    be placed above and without the room, and should communicate with the lamp
                    within by a pipe. In this way, the oil would not be liable to be pressed out too
                    rapidly by the expansion of the air in the reservoir, occasioned by the heat of
                    the room; and several methods have been contrived for the purpose of placing the
                    luminous part of the wick on the upper end of a stalk, so that very little of
                    the sphere of rays proceeding from the lighted wick may be intercepted by the
                    opaque part of the lamp. The following are some of these methods:</p>
                <p part="N">A. lamp called the Amiens lamp, commonly used in Paris by the poorer
                    classes, is in the form of a candle. The lighted part of the wick is at top. The
                    lower part of this cylinder, which is of tin, has a valve opening upwards, and
                    is moveable up and down in another cylinder, which has a valve opening upwards.
                    This valve is plunged in the reservoir of oil; when the wick is in want of oil,
                    the oil is pumped up by moving vertically the tin cylinder which contains the
                    wick. Lamps of this kind are described in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of
                        the Academy of Sciences</hi> for 1755, p. 139; and for 1760, p. 158.</p>
                <p part="N">A lamp for reading is made by Carcel of Paris, in which the oil is
                    raised to the wick by means of a pump. The pump is moved by watch-work, composed
                    of wheel and pinion, and a spring, which is wound up when the lamp is to be
                    lighted.</p>
                <p part="N">In the twentieth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions,</hi> St Clair, in a letter to Hooke, describes a lamp, in
                    which the oil floats on water. A tube passes from the upper part of the vessel
                    down to the water; and through this tube water is dropped, by means of which the
                    surface of the oil is always maintained at the same level, whilst it is consumed
                    by the flame in the wick.</p>

                <p part="N">In the lamp constructed by Mr Keir of Kentish Town, the oil is raised to
                    the wick, and sustained by a column of a solution of salt in water. This liquid
                    being of a great&gt; er specific gravity, a column of it counterbalances a
                    longer column of oil. The solution of salt is made of such a specific gravity
                    that it will support a column of oil four thirds of its own height. This is
                    nearly the specific gravity of the heaviest saline solution that is known to
                    exist in any great body of natural water, namely, in the Dead Sea; the weight of
                    the waters of this sea, of distilled water, and of oil, being in the relative
                    proportions of 120, 100, 92. To have an idea of this lamp, imagine a syphon with
                    two upright branches, and the junction of the branches at the bottom. The
                    shortest branch has a bulb at top. The longest branch has a bulb near its lower
                    extremity. The shortest branch is filled with a solution of salt, whose upper
                    surface is in the superior bulb. The longer branch contains the oil, and in its
                    upper extremity the wick is placed. In the lower bulb the surface of the oil
                    rests upon the surface of the solution of salt.</p>
                <p part="N">The bulbs serve as reservoirs, prolonging the action of the machine; by
                    means of the bulbs and the greater specific gravity of the solution, it is
                    effected, that the abstraction of a considerable quantity of oil by the
                    combustion in the wick occasions but a small depression in the upper surface of
                    the solution; the height of the sustaining column of solution will become
                    shorter in proportion as the column of oil which it counterbalances is consumed;
                    but this diminution of the height of the column of oil will be slow, and
                    therefore the column of oil will for a considerable time be of sufficient length
                    to reach the wick. Suppose an inverted syphon, of equal diameter throughout, the
                    shorter leg of which contains a column of solution of salt, whose height is 75,
                    and this counterbalances a column of oil, whose height is 100, in the longer
                    leg; if now the column of oil in the longer leg be diminished in height by 10,
                    the counterbalancing column of solution will diminish to 67∙5, being 7∙5 shorter
                    than at first. But if the syphon, instead of being of equal diameter, has two
                    dilatations or reservoirs, whose horizontal section is ten times the area of the
                    tube of the syphon, one of the reservoirs being placed at the top of the short
                    branch, so as to contain the upper surface of the solution of salt, and the
                    other at the bottom of the long branch, so as to contain the surface where the
                    oil rests upon the solution; then, if the same quantity of oil, as in the former
                    example, is taken from the top of the longer leg of the syphon, the column of
                    oil will only fall one tenth of what it did in the undilated syphon of equal
                    diameter, and the solution of salt will diminish one tenth of what it did in the
                    syphon of equal diameter.</p>
                <p part="N">The oil-reservoir and the wick remain stationary, and do not descend as
                    the oil is consumed. This descent takes place in two lamps now to be mentioned,
                    because in these two lamps the oil-reservoir swims in a liquid that acts as a
                    counterpoise.</p>
                <p part="N">In the lamp contrived by the Chevalier Edelkrantz of Stockholm, the
                    oil-reservoir floats in mercury, and the column of oil is maintained at the
                    requisite height by the counterpoise of a column of mercury; in proportion as
                    the oil is consumed, the oil-reservoir, and the wick which is connected with it,
                    sink.</p>
                <p part="N">The general structure of this lamp may be understood by conceiving a
                    flask, with a long narrow neck, and enlarged at the under part. The flask is
                    heavy enough to swim, when it is placed in mercury, with its under part
                    immersed. The bottom of the flask is open. The flask being placed in mercury, is
                    made to float with its neck perpendicular. Oil is poured in at the neck till the
                    flask is full. Then the surface of the mercury at the bottom of the flask and
                    within the flask will be depressed by the weight of the column of oil that rests
                    upon it; and the surface of the mercury on the outside of the bulb or lower part
                    of the flask will stand higher than the surface of the mercury within the flask.
                    The height which measures the difference of level of the two surfaces of mercury
                    will be the height of a column of mercury of equal weight with the column of oil
                    that is in the flask; and as mercury is about 14^θ times the weight of oil, the
                    difference of level of the two surfaces of mercury will be ) + of the height of
                    the oil in the flask. In proportion as oil is abstracted from the upper end of
                    the tube by the combustion in the wick, the height of the column of oil is
                    thereby diminished, and the two surfaces of mercury will come nearer to each
                    other, the flask sinking a little in the mercury. As the area of the horizontal
                    section of the lower part of the flask is much greater than the area of the
                    section of the neck, and as the specific gravities of mercury and oil are very
                    different, it follows, that, to restore the equilibrium after the abstraction of
                    a column of oil from the neck, the surface of the mercury within the lower part
                    of the flask will rise by a much shorter column.</p>
                <p part="N">In the lamp invented by Mr Barton, comptroller of his majesty’s mint, a
                    solution of salt and water is used as a counterpoise to the oil. The combination
                    consists of a light flask, open at the bottom, floating in a solution of salt,
                    so that when oil is poured into the flask, the surface of the oil in the neck of
                    the flask stands at a higher level than the surface of the saline solution in
                    which the flask swims. The wick is at the upper end of the neck of the flask;
                    and as the area of the horizontal section of the bulb or lower part of the flask
                    ⅛ much greater, suppose twenty times greater, than the area of the section of
                    the neck of the flask, it will happen, that when a column of oil an inch high is
                    abstracted from the neck of the flask, the height of the rise of the surface of
                    the solution in the bulb or lower part of the flask will be only one twentieth
                    of an inch. This lamp is represented at fig. 3, Plate CCCXXI.</p>
                <p part="N">T is the oil-reservoir, from which the oil passes upwards to the wicks
                    rø, <hi rend="italic">w, w.</hi> The oil-reservoir is open at bottom, at <hi

                    w ith a perforated bottom that screws off for the purpose of cleaning the
                    reservoir. The fluid B, in which the oil-reservoir is immersed, is a solution of
                    salt in water. This liquid is contained in a vessel RMO, which can be unscrewed
                    at O, for the purpose of taking out the oil-vessel. N and Y are two floats fixed
                    to the oil-reservoir and its tube. The column of the solution of salt <hi
                        rend="italic">c, h,</hi> presses against the oil at the open bottom of the
                    reservoir, and maintains a column of oil in the tube to the height <hi

                    fibres. The specific gravities of the oil and the solution of salt must be
                    inversely as the heights c, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h,
                        e;</hi> that is, the specific gravity of the solution of salt must be made

                    the perpendicular height <hi rend="italic">c, h.</hi> As the oil is consumed,
                    the water enters the hole at the bottom of the oil-vessel; the surface of the
                    water at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> sinks, and the oil-reservoir, with the tube
                    and wicks attached to it, sink also. The upper part of the vessel R should be of

                    oil-reservoir, so that, when the water has displaced the oil, and filled the
                    oil-reservoir, the float Y may be at the bottom of the enlarged part of the
                    water-vessel R. To prepare the lamp, the exterior vessel is filled with solution

                <p part="N">An inconvenience affecting Barton’s lamp is, that the solution of salt,
                    by the gradual evaporation of the watery part, becomes more dense, and capable
                    of supporting a higher column of oil than it did at first. The lamp of
                    Edelkrantz, which floats on mercury, is not liable to this inconvenience,
                    because the mercury does not alter in density by evaporation. Both these
                    floating lamps have the inconvenience, that the oil is made to run over at the
                    wick by any accidental shock which depresses the floating part of the lamp.</p>
                <p part="N">Several lamps have been constructed, in which the oil is raised by the
                    principle of the fountain of Hero of Alexandria, which is known as being
                    employed to raise water in the mines of Chemnitz, in Hungary. In Hero’s
                    writings, the application of this machine to raise oil to a lamp is described.
                    Lamps of this construction were made some years ago in Paris by Girard de
                    Marseille. Of this kind is the hydropneumatic lamp made by King, tin and japan
                    manufacturer, of Snowhill, London. This lamp is formed externally like a column
                    eighteen inches high and four inches in diameter; it is made to contain oil
                    enough to last for five or six hours. An idea of its general principle may be
                    formed by means of the diagram at fig. 5, Plate CCCXXI. in which there is a
                    descending tube, with a bulb A at top. The upper part of this bulb is open. The
                    tube, at its lower part, is curved upwards, and dilated into a second bulb B.
                    The tube contains oil, the upper surface of which is in the upper bulb A, and
                    its other surface is in the lower bulb B~ From the top of the lower bulb B a
                    tube proceeds to the top of another bulb C, placed higher than the upper bulb A
                    of the first tube. This third bulb C contains oil, and from the bottom of this
                    third bulb the oil rises in a tube. At the upper end W of this tube the wick is
                    placed. The whole machine is closed and air-tight, except at the openings of A
                    and W; and at these openings the pressure of the atmosphere acts. Thus the
                    column of oil contained in the first tube and bulbs A, B, presses, with its own
                    weight and the weight of the atmosphere, on the confined air contained between
                    the second bulb B and the third bulb C, and raises up a column of oil from that
                    third bulb. The top of this column, so raised, is at a higher level than the top
                    of the oil in the first tube, because the bottom of the column, which is raised,
                    is at a higher level than the bottom of the column in the first tube. The whole
                    machine is a syphon, in which a first column of oil of the perpendicular height
                    AB supports a second column of oil CW’, not of a greater height than the first
                    column, but, by means of the column of air BC interposed between the two columns
                    of oil, it is effected that the extremity W of the second column of oil is much
                    higher than the upper surface A of the first column of oil. In the lamp
                    constructed on this principle by King, there is a plug and valve which serve for
                    introducing the oil, and other particular contrivances. When the oil is to be
                    poured in, the lamp is inverted.</p>
                <p part="N">A lamp, of which the reservoir for the oil is in the form of a hollow
                    ring, was contrived by Count Rumford, and is described by him in Nicholson’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal,</hi> vol. xiv. 1806, p. 23. The lamp is in the centre
                    of the ring, with which it communicates by three straight tubes, in the
                    direction of radii of the ring. The stoppers, which close the apertures by which
                    the oil is poured into the ring, have a small hole, which allows the atmosphere
                    to press on the surface of the oil in the ring, and thereby permits it to flow
                    freely to the wick. This small hole may also be placed in some other part of the
                    ring, and not in the stopper. The ring supports an hemispherical shade of
                    roughened glass or of gauze. These glass shades are made rough, not by grinding,
                    but by laying a coat of powdered glass on the smooth surface of the shade, and
                    then exposing it to the heat of a furnace, so that the powdered glass becomes
                    adherent, and produces a rough or frosted surface. This method of frosting glass
                    is practised in some glass-houses situated in that district of Staffordshire
                    called the Potteries. Lamps of this construction may be suspended from the
                    ceiling, or placed on a stand, and are now frequently used in rooms and shops in
                    London and Paris. They are called in London French lamps.</p>
                <p part="N">Hooke, in his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Lampas,</hi> published
                    in 1677, describes eight contrivances for supplying oil to a lamp equably, and
                    as long as there remains any oil in the reservoir. This he effects by different
                    methods of counterbalancing the oil. These inventions display Hooke’s ingenuity
                    and great knowledge of mechanics, but require nice workmanship, and are not
                    applicable to practical purposes. These counterpoises of Hooke also serve to
                    form a vessel so that the whole liquid may be drawn from it in an equable
                    stream, by tapping the vessel at the top, and to make the descent of the surface
                    of a liquid and its discharge constant and equable in a clepsydra for showing
                    the hour.</p>
                <p part="N">Porter’s automaton lamp, constructed in London in 1784, is something
                    similar to some of Hooke’s contrivances for producing an equable supply of oil
                    to the wick as long as there remains any oil in the reservoir. It does not
                    require such delicacy of execution as Hooke’s counterpoised lamps. Porter’s lamp
                    is a tin box, the vertical and longitudinal section of which is a rectangular
                    parallelogram, elongated horizontally, of which call A, B the two upper angles,
                    C, D the two lower. This parallelopipedal box is suspended on an axis near the
                    upper surface of the box, at a place which may be denoted by X. The axis is
                    nearer A than B; at A is the wick, and a tube going down to the bottom of the
                    box, along the side of the box AC. When the box is full of oil, then the space
                    XB, behind the axis, being full of oil, counterpoises the shorter space XA. AB,
                    the long side of the box, is horizontal; and the line drawn from the axis of
                    suspension down to the centre of gravity is perpendicular to AB. But when the
                    surface of the oil falls below the axis, then the box turns on its axis, the
                    side A falls, and B is elevated; A being heavier, by reason of the wick and
                    wicktube, and the side AC assumes a lower position, in proportion as the oil is
                    consumed; the line drawn from the axis down to the centre of gravity becoming
                    more and more oblique to AB. The operation of this lamp depends upon the
                    position of the axis X, and the weight of the wick-tube, which must be
                    accurately proportioned, the one to the other, by trial.</p>

                <p part="N">Light-houses are now generally lighted with Argand lamps, which have
                    hollow cylindrical wicks placed before reflecting mirrors. Several of these
                    lamps are fixed on a frame, and protected from the weather by glass windows. The
                    lamps of light-houses are fed with oil, and in some places with pit-coal gas, as
                    in a light-house near Trieste.</p>
                <p part="N">In many of the light-houses on the British coast, the frame on which the
                    lamps are fixed is made to revolve by means of clock-work, so that to a
                    spectator situated in the circle of which the light-house is the centre, the
                    light appears at its brightest at the end of a stated period of time, which is
                    generally one or two minutes. The revolving of the light enables seamen to
                    distinguish the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201990?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-1990-0045"/> light-house from the light of lime-kilns or
                    other fires upon the coast. This distinction is of great importance; for
                    shipwrecks have happened in consequence of mistaking the light of lime-kilns for
                    the light of a light-house. The light is in some light-houses made of a red
                    tinge, to distinguish it from some other light-house not far distant. The red
                    colour of the light is produced by placing windows of red glass before the
                    lamps. Red is the only colour that can be given to the light in this way. When
                    stained glass of other colours is placed before the lamp, it is not found to
                    produce a change in the colour of light seen at a distance; the blue or green
                    colour of the glass becomes insensible when seen through a great body of air,
                    which has itself a blue colour.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">LAMPS FOR LIGHTING STREETS.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Till within the last six years, the street-lamps used in London and in
                    other parts of Britain consisted almost uniformly of a deep inverted bell-shaped
                    glass lantern, blown of one piece, and suspended by the edge in an iron ring,
                    with a tin conical cover perforated to give issue to the smoke, and within the
                    lantern a flat oil-vessel, with two or more wick-holders or beaks projecting
                    from its circumference. Many districts of London are lighted with lamps of this
                    form; other districts employ several kinds of street-lamps of a different form.
                    The first of these new kinds was made under the direction of Lord Cochrane, and
                    employed to light the streets in the parish of Saint Anne, Soho, London.</p>
                <p part="N">The lanterns which serve to protect the light from wind and weather in
                    the new lamps in one district of London, are composed of four lateral panes and
                    a bottom of glass, joined together by sheet iron, -so that the lantern is in
                    form of a truncated pyramid, inverted like the lanterns of the street-lamps in
                    Paris. In lanterns of this form some light is intercepted, and a shadow is
                    thrown on the street by the metal that unites the panes. This defect does not
                    occur in the lanterns of street-lamps most commonly used in England, and made of
                    one piece of glass blown into the form of a spheroid. The spheroidal lanterns
                    deflect the light more, because they are more unequal in thickness, but this is
                    a smaller inconvenience; the lanterns blown of one piece of glass are more
                    easily cleaned. Many of the lanterns for gas-lights are also made of panes in
                    the above-mentioned form; some are cylindroids blown of one piece, with a hole
                    in the bottom to admit air. In some of the new lamps in London which have
                    lanterns of one piece of glass, the form of the lantern is nearly cylindrical;
                    in others the lantern is not so deep as the lanterns of the old form. The new
                    lamps have reflectors placed above the light, for the purpose of reflecting the
                    light downwards on the foot pavement. These reflectors are of various forms in
                    some of the lamps, the four plane surfaces of the inside of the pyramidal cover
                    of the lantern are made bright, and serve to reflect the light downwards. In
                    other lamps the ceiling of the lantern is a reflector in form, having a'small
                    portion of a large curved surface, with a chimney in the middle to give issue to
                    the smoke. Others have two, and sometimes three, concave conoidal reflectors,
                    whose vertices meet over the light, the axes of two of the reflectors being
                    parallel to the direction of the street; at the point where the reflectors meet
                    there is a chimney, through which the smoke ascends. The reflectors require to
                    be frequently wiped in order to keep them bright.</p>
                <p part="N">The oil-vessels of the new lamps in London are of various forms; the
                    beak or part of the oil-vessel under the wick is made as narrow as possible; for
                    as it is very near the flame, its shadow thrown on the street by the rays
                    diverging from the flame is several feet in breadth. If the beak be an inch
                    broad, and situate an inch under the flame, the shadow of the beak on the
                    pavement under the lamp will be ten feet broad if the flame is situate ten feet
                    above the pavement. In some of the new lamps the reflector placed above the
                    light is made with its concavity so disposed at the edges that the reflected
                    light is thrown upon that part of the pavement whįch is under the oil-holder. In
                    Major Cochrane’s lamps the oil-vessel consists of a bird-cage fountain
                    reservoir, which allows a supply of oil to come down to the wick when the
                    surface of the oil in which the wick is placed has sunk to a certain point. The
                    wick is double, consisting of two pieces of flat cotton web; between the wicks
                    is a slit, through which a current of air ascends to the flame; on the outside
                    of each wick is another slit; and these slits admit currents to the exterior
                    surface of the wicks. Each time that the lamp is trimmed two pieces of wick are
                    inserted, just sufficiently long to last the time that the lamp is required to
                    burn. Naphtha distilled from pit-coal is burned in these lamps, and the light is
                    brilliant like the light of coal-gas. But the gas-lights have the advantage of
                    being unencumbered by the opaque substance of the oilvessel, which intercepts
                    light, and casts a shadow on the street.</p>
                <p part="N">The street-lamps in London are fixed at the end of iron rods which
                    project from the walls of the houses. The lamp is, over the middle of the foot
                    pavement, ten feet from the ground. There is a row of lamps on each side of the
                    street, the principal streets being fifty feet in width. In Paris, where many of
                    the principal thoroughfare streets are not above twenty-five feet in breadth,
                    the lamps are suspended over the middle of the street. A strong rope is made
                    fast to the walls on each side of the street, and to this rope a smaller rope
                    with the lamp is attached. The smaller rope passes'over-pullies, and its enc(
                    comes down into an iron box, whereat is fixed on a hook. The iron box is
                    unlocked, and’the'lamp is let down and lighted with a candle. The light is
                    placed before a silver-plated reflector. In Vienna, the street-lamps are fixed
                    on the upper end of a post. The lamp is taken out of the lantern by means of a
                    pole, and lighted at the foot of the post. This saves the inconvenience which
                    results to passengers from the mode of lighting lamps by a man with a ladder and
                    torch, as practised in Britain. In most of the towns of Italy the streets are
                    but sparingly lighted. The lamps are fixed at the end of iron rods which pro
                    ject from the walls of the houses. In some of them the light is placed in the
                    focus of a parabolic reflector, or at the meeting of the vertices of two concave
                    conoidal divergent reflectors situated above the light. The French, when masters
                    of Italy, made regulations to improve the lighting of the streets.</p>
                <p part="N">In England, whale-oil is used as the combustible material in the
                    street-lamps; of late naphtha, obtained from the distillation of pit-coal, has
                    been used in a district of London which is lighted with Major Cochrane’s lamps.
                    This naphtha is a clear and colourless liquid, and is found to give a good
                    light; it requires to be prepared with particular attention; that made at the
                    gas-light work is said to be too easily inflammable. In Paris, rape-seed oil and
                    poppy-seed oil arc used; these expressed oils are made in the north-eastern part
                    of France, and in Flanders. In the south of Europe, olive-oil of inferior
                    quality, and walnutoil, are used. Street-lamps lighted with the gas distilled
                    from pit-coal were in 1821 employed in the principal streets of London,
                    Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and other
                    cities in Britain. The use of coal-gas for giving light had made very little
                    progress in France in 1818, being scarcely employed even in Paris, and we
                    believe not at all at Lyons, although pit-coal is abundant, and commonly used as
                    fuel <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202003?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-2003-0046"/>there. In 1818, pit-coal gas was used for
                    lighting a light-house on the Adriatic, in the dominions of the house of Austria
                    near Trieste, the gas being obtained from the coal wrought in the adjacent
                    country.</p>
                <p part="N">SAFETY LAMP.</p>
                <p part="N">This lamp was constructed for the purpose of giving light in mines where
                    fire-damp prevails. In many of the collieries of Britain, Flanders, and other
                    countries, firedamp, consisting of carburetted hydrogen, issues from different
                    parts of the strata of coal when the coal is worked; and when the fire-damp is
                    mixed with a certain proportion of atmospheric air, it explodes by the flame of
                    the miner’s candle, burning the workmen severely, and often depriving them of
                    life. Vegetable substances, in the slow decomposition which takes place in them,
                    in the process of putrefaction, give out inflammable gas. This is seen when the
                    leaves of plants fall into water and become putrid; inflammable gas then rises
                    to the surface in bubbles, and is inflamed if a light be applied to the surface
                    of the water. Vegetable matter gives out inflammable gas also in the rapid
                    decomposition occasioned by fire. The flame of vegetable substances consists of
                    the inflammable air resulting from their decomposition, and burning with the
                    addition of the air of the atmosphere. Pit-coal consists of the remains of large
                    quantities of vegetable substances; and the fire-damp of coal-mines may be
                    considered as the produce of the putrefaction which the vegetable· matter has
                    undergone, or of some decomposition that the coal is still undergoing. Sir
                    Humphry Davy found that, on breaking some masses of coal under water,
                    inflammable gas was given out. In some places blowers of fire-damp issue out at
                    the surface of the earth. A quarter of a mile from Pietra Mala in the Apennines,
                    on the road from Bologna to Florence, there is a blower of inflammable gas
                    issuing from the ground, and proceeding from strata of schistus, and perhaps of
                    coal. Sir Humphry Davy analysed this gas, and found it to be carburetted
                    hydrogen, like the fire-damp <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the coal mines. Another
                    blower of the same kind exists on the side of a mountain near the shore of the
                    Gulf of Adalia, in Lycia, on the south coast of Asia Minor. In mines wrought to
                    obtain metals and salt, where there are no strata of vegetable matter like coal,
                    it does not appear that the fire-damp occurs.</p>
                <p part="N">The merit of that very ingenious and most useful contrivance, the Safety
                    Lamp, is wholly due to Sir Humphry Davy. After having made many experiments for
                    the purpose of forming a lamp to give light in coal mines affected with
                    fire-damp, without occasioning explosions, which frequently proved fatal to the
                    miners, he found that wire-gauze, of which the apertures occupy more space than
                    the cooling or radiating surface of the wire, so as to be permeable to air and
                    light, offered a perfect barrier against explosion; because, although the gas
                    was inflamed within the enclosures formed by the wire-gauze, yet the heat being
                    communicated to the numerous surfaces of the wire, the gas on the outside of the
                    wire enclosure was not inflamed. Wire-gauze is the best material for safety
                    lamps, as it affords the greatest extent of radiating surface, and, by cooling,
                    prevents all explosions that require a temperature higher than the temperature
                    of the atmosphere. An example of the radiating and cooling action of wire is
                    seen in the fire-guards of wire, which are hung upon the ribs of fire-plaćes in
                    rooms to prevent sparks from being thrown into the room. These fire-guards,
                    although they arc very near the fire, do not become hot. The apertures of the
                    wire-gauze must be smaller, and the wire, which is the radiating and cooling
                    surface, must be in greater quantity, in proportion as the gas in which the lamp
                    is to be used is more inflammable. The fire-damp in coal-mines is in almost all
                    cases carburetted hydrogen; and for excluding explosion from a lamp in that gas,
                    it is found that the wire-gauze should contain 784 apertures in a square
                    inch.</p>
                <p part="N">The wire-gauze should be of iron or copper. -Fine brass wire is
                    improper, because it is too easily combustible by reason of the zinc it
                    contains. The iron wire should not bc tinned, tin being too easily combustible.
                    The body of the lamp should bc of copper riveted together, or of massy cast
                    brass or cast iron. The screws should fit tight; no aperture, however small,
                    should be suffered to exist in the body of the lamp; and the trimming wire
                    should move through a long tight tube.</p>
                <p part="N">The safety lamp is represented in Plate CCCXXI. fig. 4. A is the cistern
                    containing the oil; B the brass rim to which the bottom of the wire-gauze
                    cylinder is fastened by a serew, to prevent it from being separated from the
                    lamp; C is the safe feeder through which oil is poured into the lamp; E the safe
                    trimmer, a wire which passes through a safe tube, for the purpose of raising and
                    trimming the wick; F the wire-gauze cylinder. The longitudinal suture where the
                    two edges of the piece of wiregauze that forms the cylinder meet, must be well
                    doubled and fastened with wire. If the cylinder is of twilled wiregauze, the
                    wire should be of iron or copper, at least of the thickness of ţŋth of an inch;
                    if of plain wire-gauze, the diameter should not be less than g <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of an inch. The number of apertures in a
                    square inch should not be less than 786. The wire-gauze cylinder F is closed at
                    top by a circular piece of wire-gauze, and above this is placed a second top, G,
                    which fits on the cylinder like a cap. In the figure the circular wire-gauze top
                    of the wire-gauze cylinder is seen at G through the wire-gauze of the cap. The
                    circular top of this wire-gauze cap is įths of an inch above the top of the
                    wire-gauze cylinder F. II are thick wires surrounding the wire-gauze cylinder,
                    to prevent it from being bent by external force. Ķ is a ring to hang up the
                    lamp, or to hold it by. The most convenient size for the safety lamp is a span,
                    that is, from 8 to 10 inches high, the wire-gauze cylinder being 2 to 2⅜ inches
                    in diameter.</p>
                <p part="N">The wire-gauze, when choked with coal-dust, requires to be cleaned by
                    means of a brush, in order to transmit the light.</p>
                <p part="N">In figure 4, a lens of glass, L, is placed before the light; sometimes a
                    piece of tin is placed within the cylinder to act as a reflector.</p>
                <p part="N">The light of the safety lamp, without a reflector, was found to be
                    nearly equal to the light of a common miner’s candle.</p>
                <p part="N">Flame produced by the combustion of explosive gases may be extinguished
                    by colder metal. The temperature of mctal, even when heated to a white heat, is
                    less than the temperature of flame, and therefore red-hot wirc-gauze in
                    sufficient quantity, and of the proper degree of fineness, will abstract
                    sufficient heat from the flame of carburetted hydrogen or fire-damp to
                    extinguish that flame.</p>
                <p part="N">Flame, in all cases, is considered to bc the combustion of an explosive
                    mixture of inflammable gas and air. If a piece of wire-gauze is held over the
                    flame of a lamp, it prevents the flame from passing. The air that passes through
                    is very hot, and is in the state of an explosive mixture, for it will be
                    inflamed if a lighted taper be presented to it. But it is cooled below the
                    exploding point, by passing through the wires, even if the wires are red hot; it
                    is also cooled by being mixed with a considerable quantity of air comparatively
                    cold. The temperature of visible flamc is very high, as is seen by the fusion of
                    a small filament of that difficultly fusible metal platinum, which happens when
                    the filament is held in the flame of a candle. A considerable mass of heated
                    metal is required<pb break="no" facs="nls:193202016?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-2016-0047"/> to inflame fire-damp. An iron wire of ⅛th of
                    an inch in diameter, and 8 inches long, red hot, when held perpendicularly in a
                    stream of fire-damp, did not inflame it. But wire of the same size, when six
                    inches of it were red hot, and when it was held perpendicularly in a bottle
                    containing an explosive mixture, so that successive portions of the gas were
                    heated by the wire, produced an explosion.</p>
                <p part="N">The action of the safety lamp may be exhibited in the chemist’s
                    laboratory, by pouring some ether into the bottom of a large jar; the vapour of
                    the ether mixing with the air, produces an explosive atmosphere. When the safety
                    lamp is lighted and placed in the jar, the explosive mixture from the ether will
                    burn within the wire-gauze lamp, without inflaming the gas that is without
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">The workman who has only a single gauze lamp, and finds the temperature
                    of the wire increasing rapidly by the fire-damp from a blower, can easily
                    diminish the heat by standing between the current and the lamp, that is to say,
                    to the windward of the lamp, or by sheltering the lamp from the current by
                    interposing his clothes; or, by bringing the lamp nearer the orifice from which
                    the firedamp issues, he may extinguish it. There never can be any occasion for
                    the workmen to place the lamp in the exact place, when two currents, one of
                    common atmospheric air, and the other of fire-damp, meet each other.</p>
                <p part="N">When the fire-damp is inflamed in the w ire-gauze lamp, coal-dust thrown
                    into the gauze cylinder burns with strong flashes; but the explosion is not
                    communicated to the external fire-damp by this means.</p>
                <p part="N">Phosphorus, sulphur, pyrites, or gunpowder, would produce explosion by
                    being applied to the outside of the wire-gauze cylinder; and sulphur, to produce
                    this effect, must be applied in large quantities, and blown upon by a current of
                    atmospheric air. But there is little danger of these substances being
                    accidentally applied to the safety lamp in mines.</p>
                <p part="N">When a wire-gauze lamp is made to burn in a very explosive atmosphere at
                    rest, the heat of the wire-gauze, when the fire-damp is burning within the lamp,
                    soon arrives at its maximum, and then diminishes. The coally matter also, from
                    the decomposition of the oil, chokes the upper apertures of the wire-gauze, and
                    thus gradually diminishes the heat, by diminishing the quantity of gas consumed.
                    Wire-gauze lamps which had been used by workmen for several months, and which
                    had been often red hot in explosive atmospheres, were nevertheless still
                    unimpaired and perfect.</p>
                <p part="N">Where the lamp is placed in a current of explosive gas, a greater heat
                    is produced; and in this case the radiating or cooling surfaces should be
                    increased. Twilled gauze or a double or triple fold of wire gauze on one side of
                    the lamp, or a skreen of metal between the lamp and the current, or a
                    semi-cylinder of glass or mica within, answers the object of preventing the heat
                    from rising to redness.</p>
                <p part="N">If the heat of the iron wire-gauze rose to that of a strong welding
                    heat, a circumstance which never could happen in a colliery, then the iron wire
                    would burn, and the lamp would be no longer safe.</p>
                <p part="N">From a mine of Lord Durham’s there is a violent blower of fire-damp
                    conveyed to the surface, upon which the following experiment was made: A brass
                    pipe was fixed upon the blower-tube, so as to make the whole stream of fire-damp
                    pass through an aperture of less than half an inch in diameter. The fire-damp,
                    when inflamed, issued from this with great violence and noise, forming a flame
                    of five feet long. This blow-pipe was exposed at right angles to a strong wind.
                    The double gauze lamps soon became red hot at the point of action of the two
                    currents; but the wire did not burn, nor did it communicate explosion. The
                    single gauze lamp did not communicate ex plosion as long as it was red hot, and
                    slowly moved through the currents; but when it was fixed at the point of the
                    most intense combustion, it reached a welding heat; the iron wire began to burn
                    with sparks, and the explosion then passed.</p>
                <p part="N">In other experiments on this blower of fire-damp, single wire-gauze
                    lamps, with slips of tin-plate on the outside or in the inside, to prevent the
                    free passage of the current, and double lamps, were exposed to all the
                    circumstances of the blast; but the heat of the wire never approached near the
                    point at which iron wire burns, and the explosion was not communicated. The
                    flame of the fire-damp flickered and roared in the lamps, but did not escape
                    without the limits of the wire-gauze.</p>
                <p part="N">The sparks from a flint and steel mill, a machine which sometimes has
                    been used to give light in mines affected with fire-damp, would most probably
                    inflame such a current as the blower above mentioned; because the sparks
                    elicited from steel by the collision of flint, are small portions of the steel
                    in a burning state, as may be seen by collecting these sparks on a sheet of
                    paper, and viewing them with a microscope.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">lamp without flame,</hi> which is sold as an
                    object of amusement and curiosity, consists ofa fine wire of platinum of the γ⅜Q

                    round the wick of a lamp fed with the spirit of wine, and a little above the
                    wick; when the flame of the lamp is blown out, the heat which the wire has
                    acquired is sufficient to keep up the slow combustion of the vapour of the
                    spirit of wine, and this combustion continues to keep the platinum in an ignited
                    state. The principle of this lamp without flame may be usefully applied to the
                    safety lamp. By hanging some coils of fine wire of platinum above the wick of
                    the lamp, it is believed that the coal-miner will be supplied with light in
                    mixtures of fire-damp, which, from the small proportion of atmospheric air, are
                    no longer explosive; and should the flame of the lamp be extinguished by the
                    quantity of fire-damp, the glow of the incandescent platinum will continue to
                    give light, and the incandescence will cease when the air becomes unrespirable.
                    Sir Humphry Davy found, that a spiral wire of platinum of the ∙ <hi

                    safety lamp, yields light in a mixture of fire-damp with atmospheric air, in
                    which the atmospheric air is in so small a proportion that the mixture is not
                    explosive. In this situation, the heat is not sufficiently great to produce
                    combustion with flame, and combustion without flame takes place. The platinum
                    wire, heated by the flame of the lamp, retains its heat after the flame is
                    extinguished, and this heat is sufficient to occasion a slow combustion or
                    combination of the elements of the fire-damp with the oxygen of the atmospheric
                    air: this slow combustion produces sufficient heat to keep the platinum in a
                    state of ignition. Platinum and palladium are the only metals found to produce
                    this effect, because these two metals are of a slow’ conducting power and
                    capacity for heat. This phenomenon takes place in mixtures of gas where there is
                    common air enough to support the respiration of human beings.</p>
                <p part="N">At Wallsend, and other extensive collieries near Newcastle, in
                    Northumberland, the following regulations respecting the safety lamps are
                    observed: A steady man is employed to take charge of the lamps, and he is
                    responsible for keeping them in good order. A chamber is allotted him, in which
                    he keeps oils, cotton, and spare lamps; the chamber is in a secure part of the
                    mine, as near the workings as possible. The brass collar of the wire-gauze
                    cylinder is secured to the bottom of the lamp by a lock, which can be opened
                    only by the lamp-keeper; so that the workmen cannot separate the wire-gauze
                    cylinder from the bottom of the lamp. After finishing their <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193202029?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2029-0048"/>day’s work,
                    the colliers bring the safety lamps to the lampkeeper’s cabin. The lamp-keeper
                    unlocks the lamps, keeps the bottom, and allows the colliers to take the
                    wire-gauze cylinders home for the purpose of cleaning them. When the colliers
                    return to their work next day, the lamp-keeper, having replenished the lamps
                    with oil and cotton, lights the wicks, screws on the gauze cylinders, and
                    examines them carefully; if any defect appears in the gauze, the lamp is set
                    aside to be repaired. The lamp-keeper’s business, during the day, is to walk
                    leisurely through amongst the workmen, carrying some spare lamps with him to
                    replace those which happen to be extinguished.</p>
