                <p part="N"><label type="entry">LEVEL</label>, an instrument which enables us to
                    find a line or surface exactly level; that is, such as shall be everywhere
                    parallel to the true horizon, or at right angles to the plumb-line or direction
                    of gravity. It also enables us to find the difference between the heights of two
                    or more places on the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the great variety of instruments which have been invented for
                    these purposes, and which are all guided by the agency of gravitation, the
                    following are the most important and useful.</p>
                <p part="N">Levels in which the plummet or plumb-line forms the most essential part
                    have been constructed in many different forms, and under as many names, to suit
                    the purpose or fancies of the various artificers who employ them; such as
                    masons, bricklayers, paviors, carpenters, and others. But the general principle
                    of the construction is to attach a thread and plummet to the upper part of a
                    board or flat frame of wood or metal, in such a manner that, when the thread of
                    this plummet, hanging freely, coincides with, a fiducial line marked on the
                    frame, it is at right angles to the base of the instrument; so that when this
                    occurs, the thing to which the base is applied must obviously be level; but if
                    the thread declines from the mark, the thing is lower on one side than the
                    other. In some of these levels, the fiducial line or mark is at the middle of
                    the base, in others at or near the end. But though it is easy to see, that the
                    longer the base, and the farther down the thread the fiducial line extends, so
                    much the more accurate or sensible is the instrument likely to be; yet little or
                    no regard is generally had to this in practice. The vibrations of the lead,
                    which are troublesome in nice operations, may be in a great measure prevented by
                    having it immersed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204764?mode=fullsize"

                    Sometimes the plummet is enclosed in a glass cover to protect it from the
                    agitation of the wind, and sights or even a telescope are occasionally applied.
                    For a telescope may be added to any kind of level, by applying it upon or
                    parallel to the base of the instrument when there is occasion to take the level
                    of remote objects. One of the simplest forms of a plumb-level is shown in fig.
                    1, Plate CCCXXII.; and the next we shall describe is another.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">Artillery Foot-Level</hi> is in the form of a
                    carpenter’s square, having its two legs or branches of equal lengths; at their
                    juncture is a little hole, whence hangs a thread and plummet playing on a
                    quadrant, which is divided into twice forty-five degrees from the middle, as
                    shown in fig. 2.</p>
                <p part="N">By placing the feet or ends of its two branches on a plane, in such a
                    manner that the thread may play perpendicularly over the middle division of the
                    quadrant, the plane is assuredly level. To use it in gunnery, place the two ends
                    on the piece of artillery, which may be raised to any proposed height, as
                    indicated by the plummet, whose thread will give the degree above the level.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Gunners Level,</hi> for levelling cannons and mortars,
                    consists of a triangular brass plate about four inches high (fig. 3), at the
                    bottom of which is a portion of a circle, divided only into forty-five degrees,
                    as this number is sufficient for the highest elevation of cannons and mortars,
                    and for giving shot the greatest range. On the centre of a segment of a circle
                    turns a piece of brass A B, which may be fixed by a screw at pleasure. Its lower
                    end B serves for a plummet and index, to show the different degrees of elevation
                    of pieces of artillery. This instrument has also a brass foot, not shown in the
                    figure, to set upon cannons or mortars; so that when those pieces are
                    horizontal, the instrument is perpendicular. The foot is to be placed on the
                    piece to be elevated, in such a manner that the point of the plummet may fall on
                    the proper degree; this they call <hi rend="italic">levelling the
                    piece.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">Balance-Level</hi> is wholly suspended as a
                    pendulum. It is furnished with sights, which, when the instrument hangs at rest,
                    show the line of level, and sometimes even a telescope is applied to it. Levels
                    of this sort have been made in various forms. They have but little sensibility,
                    and are liable to be sadly disturbed by the wind.</p>
                <p part="N">Desagulier’s level, described at considerable length in almost every
                    treatise on this subject, is essentially the same with the method of measuring
                    heights by the barometer, to which, as a mode of levelling, we therefore beg to
                    refer.</p>

                    long surface of water representing the same object inverted which we see erect
                    by the eye; so that the point where these two objects appear to meet, is on a
                    level with the place where the surface of the water is found.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another reflecting level, consisting of a mirror of steel, or
                    the like, well polished, and placed a little before the object-glass of a
                    telescope, suspended perpendicularly. This mirror must make an angle of 45° with
                    the telescope, in which case the perpendicular line of the telescope is
                    converted into a horizontal line, which is the same with the line of level.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Water-Level,</hi> that which shows the horizontal line
                    by means of a surface of water or other liquor, founded on this principle, that
                    a liquid always places itself level.</p>
                <p part="N">The most simple water-level is made of a long wooden trough or canal,
                    whose sides are parallel to the base; so tnat, being equally filled with water,
                    its surface shows the line of level. This is the chorobates of the ancients,
                    described by Vitruvius.</p>
                <p part="N">It is also made with two cups fitted to the two ends of <hi
                        rend="superscript"> a</hi> pipe three or four feet long/ bout an inch in
                    diameter, by means of which the water communicates from the one cup to the
                    other; and this pipe being moveable on its stand by means of a ball and socket,
                    when the two cups become equally full of water, their two surfaces mark the line
                    of level.</p>
                <p part="N">This instrument, instead of cups, may also be made with two short
                    cylinders of glass three or four inches long, fastened to each extreme of the
                    pipe with wax or mastic. Into the pipe is poured some common or coloured water,
                    which shows itself through the cylinders, by means of which the line of level is
                    determined; the height of the water being the same in both cylinders, whether
                    these are themselves perfectly level or not. This level, though very simple, is
                    yet very commodious for levelling at small distances. Various instruments
                    constructed on this principle with water, mercury, and other liquids, have aimed
                    at great perfection; but, as refined levels, we consider them so inferior to the
                    spirit-level, shortly to be noticed, as not to merit a particular description
                    here.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Air-Level,</hi> that which shows the line of level by
                    means of a bubble of air enclosed with some liquor in a glass tube which is
                    slightly convex upward, and has its two ends hermetically sealed. When the
                    bubble fixes itself at a certain mark in the middle of the tube, the plane or
                    ruler whereon it is fixed is level. When it is not level, the bubble will rise
                    to one end. This glass tube may be set in another of brass, or in a piece of
                    wood, having an aperture in the middle, through which the bubble of air may be
                    observed. The liquor with which the tube is filled is most commonly alcohol or
                    spirit of wine. This application of a bubble of air is said to be the invention
                    of Dr Hooke; but some ascribe it toj <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    Γhevenot.</p>
                <p part="N">One of these instruments made with sights, is an improvement upon that
                    last described,Zand, by a little additional apparatus, becomes more commodious
                    and exact. It consists of an air-level AB (fig. 4), about eight inches long, and
                    seven or eight fines in diameter, set in a brass tube 2, with an aperture in the
                    middle C. The tubes are supported by a straight ruler a foot long, at whose end
                    are fixed two sights, 3, 3, exactly perpendicular to the tubes, and of an equal
                    height, having a square hole, subdivided by a cross of thin brass, in the middle
                    of which is drilled a very small hole, through which a point on a level with the
                    instrument is observed. The brass tube is fastened on the ruler by means of two
                    screws, one of which, marked 4, serves to raise or depress the tube at pleasure,
                    for bringing it towards a level. The top of the ball and socket is riveted to a
                    little ruler that springs, one end whereof is fastened with a screw to the great
                    ruler, and at the other end has a screw, 5, serving to raise and depress the
                    instrument when nearly level.</p>
                <p part="N">We should consider wires greatly preferable to sights with holes, which,
                    though very small, will take in too great a space to determine the point of
                    level precisely. But the principle of the air-level is brought to an
                    incomparably greater degree of perfection in the instrument next to be
                    described.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Spirit-Level.</hi> The most accurate levelling
                    instrument in use, and that possessed of the greatest essential advantages, is
                    the spirit-level, which was first constructed by Mr Sisson, and to which various
                    additions and improvements have been since made, particularly by Mr Ramsden. The
                    following is a description of one of the best of these levels. Fig. 5 represents
                    the instrument mounted on its staves, PQR. The telescope, AB, is made from
                    fifteen inches to two feet in length, as may be required. It is achromatic, of
                    the best kind, and shows the objects erect. By turning the screw <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> at the side of the telescope, the object-glass is
                    moved; and thus the telescope is exactly adapted to the eye. In the focus of the
                    eyeglasses are exceedingly fine cross wires, the intersection of which should be
                    so perfectly in the axis of the tube, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193204777?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4777-0258"/>that by
                    turning it round on its two supporters D, E, and looking through the telescope,
                    the intersection of the wires may constantly cut the same part of the object
                    viewed. They are easily adjusted to this state by means of the four screws <hi
                        rend="italic">bbbb</hi> placed on the telescope, near the end for the eye.
                    These screws act in directions perpendicular to one another, so that, by
                    unscrewing one and tightening the opposite one, the wire perpendicular to them
                    may be moved either way at pleasure; and in this manner the other wire may be
                    moved, and thus the intersection of the wires is brought exactly into the axis
                    of the tube.</p>
                <p part="N">To the telescope is fixed, by two small screws, the level tube <hi
                        rend="italic">cd</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> containing the
                    spirits, with a small bubble of air: this bubble, when the instrument is well
                    adjusted, will settle exactly in the same place, in or near the middle of its
                    tube, whether the telescope be reversed or not on the supporters, which in this
                    case are kept unmoved. To render the level truly parallel to the telescope, the
                    screw at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> adjusts it vertically, and that at <hi
                        rend="italic">d</hi> horizontally. The two supporters D, E, on which the
                    level rests and turns, are shaped like the letter Y. The telescope rests within
                    the upper part of them; and the inner sides of each of these Y’s are tangents to
                    the cyîindric tube of the telescope, which is turned to a true cylinder, and
                    each side touches it only at one place. The telescope can be confined in the Y’s
                    by means of two jointed arches or rims, <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> which fasten
                    with pins, <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> as shown in the figure.</p>
                <p part="N">The lower ends of these supporters are inserted into a strong brass bar
                    F G, so as to stand perpendicularly on it. To one of these is applied a fine
                    threaded screw, H, to adjust the tube, when on its supporters, to a true level;
                    and to the same supporter D is sometimes applied a line of tangents as far as
                    ten degrees, in order to take an angle of depression or elevation to that
                    extent. Between the supporters is also sometimes fixed a compass-box I, divided
                    into 360°, and again into four times 90°, having a centre pin and needle, and
                    trigger to throw off the needle from the centre when not used; so as to
                    constitute a perfect circumferentor, connected with all the foregoing
                    improvements. This plate is fixed on a conical brass ferrule, which is adapted
                    to the axis or bell-metal frustum of a cone at top of the brass head of the
                    staves, having a ball and socket, with three bell-metal joints, two strong brass
                    plates LL, four screws <hi rend="italic">eeee,</hi> for adjusting the conical
                    axis of the stand to be truly vertical, a regulating screw Μ to the motion on
                    this axis, and a fastening screw N to tighten it on the cone when necessary. The
                    fastening screw N, and the regulating screw Μ, by which the whole instrument is
                    moved steadily round the vertical axis through a small <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> space, were an addition of Mr Ramsden’s. It is to be observed that,
                    since the lower of the two plates LL generally partakes of the inclination of
                    the ground, while the upper should always be level, they are almost never
                    parallel, though usually called “the parallel plates.”</p>
                <p part="N">The whole level being now placed steadily on its staves, we must
                    gradually adjust the axis of the stand to be truly vertical, if it is not so
                    already. For this purpose the telescope must be placed in a line with two of the
                    screws e e, and then levelled by these, if-necessary, till the bubble of air in
                    the spirit-tube keeps its position in the middle. It is next to be turned into a
                    line with the other two screws e <hi rend="italic">e</hi> at right angles to the
                    former, and to be also levelled in that position.</p>
                <p part="N">The horizontal motion on the vertical axis being thus far adjusted, the
                    rims <hi rend="italic">ffoĩ</hi> the Y’s are to be opened, the telescope is to
                    be taken off and laid the contrary way upon these supporters. If the bubble of
                    air then rests exactly the same as before, the level and telescope are already
                    adjusted rightly to one another; but if the bubble does not remain the same, the
                    end to which it goes must be noticed, and its position altered; correcting the
                    error partly by the screws c, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and H, and partly by
                    repeating the adjustments above described, upon the screws e <hi rend="italic"
                        >eee.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The intersection of the wires being now directed to any distant object,
                    it may be one of the vanes of the staves or poles hereafter described. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Levelling</hi><hi rend="italic">Staves.)</hi> If they
                    continue to be against it precisely, while the telescope is turned round its
                    axis on its Y’s, it proves, as before mentioned, that the axis coincides with
                    the intersection of the wires. In this easy mode of adjustment consists the
                    excellence of the instrument; for it is hereby capable of being adjusted by only
                    one station and one object, which will at the same time determine it to be in a
                    true level. If, by change of weather, accident, or other cause, the instrument
                    should have lost its level or adjustment, it may thus be readily restored and
                    re-adjusted at the first station; which is an advantage many levelling
                    instruments do not possess.</p>
                <p part="N">Since it is often of great importance to execute levelling with
                    accuracy, and the best instrument when out of its adjustment being of little
                    use, it is quite necessary that every person using such an instrument should ∙
                    have it readily in his power to correct it; and the above, which is Ramsden’s
                    construction, is well adapted for this purpose. There are no doubt simpler
                    instruments, as, for instance, some of Troughton’s; but none of these simple
                    ones admit of anything like such perfect adjustments as the one just described,
                    though they may suit fully as well in the hands of a person not capable of
                    making the adjustments, and of course not capable of taking a nice level at
                    all.</p>
                <p part="N">It is well known, that when a plummet or pendulum vibrates freely in a
                    circular arc, the tendency of gravity to bring it to the resting position is
                    everywhere as the sine of the angular distance from that position. Now, if the
                    bubble in the spirit-level moves in a circle, it is obviously acted on by a
                    force precisely similar to that which gravity exerts upon the plummet; and
                    therefore it would seem that a spirit-level should measure small angles with the
                    same accuracy as a sector whose radius is equal to that of the curvature of the
                    glass tube, or a plumb-line of the same length; but there are some causes which
                    diminish its accuracy. When the bubble of air has been brought to the middle of
                    the glass tube, and when the tube, after being deranged, is restored to the very
                    same position, we cannot be sure that the bubble of air will return to the very
                    middle of the tube. This irregularity is produced by the friction of the
                    included liquid against the sides of the tube, and depends on the magnitude of
                    the bubble and the quantity of liquid. In a good level, where the bubble moves
                    about five lines for a minute of inclination, this uncertainty does not exceed
                    half a line, which may be ascertained by pointing the telescope to any object.
                    The coincidence of a plumb-line with a particular mark will, on account of the
                    insensible oscillation of the thread, leave about double the uncertainty which
                    is left by the index of a sector, and which may be estimated at about a
                    hundredth of a line. A variety of interesting researches on this subject by Mr
                    Nixon will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> for
                    April and May 1827, March 1829, and June 1831.</p>
                <p part="N">Levels are commonly made of glass tubes in the state they are obtained
                    at the glass-house. Of these,, the straightest and most regular are selected and
                    examined, by filling them nearly with spirit of wine, and ascertaining by trial
                    that side at which the bubble moves most regularly, by equal inclinations of the
                    instrument upon a stage called the bubble trier, which is provided with a
                    micrometer screw for that purpose. The most regular side is chosen for the upper
                    part of the instrument, the others being of little consequence to its
                    perfection. Spι∙</p>

                <p part="N">rit of wine is used, because if pure it does not freeze at natural
                    temperatures, and is more fluid than water. Sometimes, indeed, though very
                    rarely, ether is employed. The tube and the bubble must be of considerable
                    length. The longer the bubble, the more sensible it is to a small inclination. A
                    very small bubble is scarcely sensible, appears as if attaehed to the glass, and
                    moves but slowly.</p>
                <p part="N">In the use of a level of this kind constructed by Langlois, it was
                    remarked, that when it was properly set in the cool of the morning, it was no
                    longer so in the middle of the day, or when the weather became hot; and that
                    when it was again rectified for the middle of the day, it became false in the
                    evening, after the heat had diminished. The bubble was much longer in cold than
                    in hot weather, and when longer it was too much so, and could not be kept in the
                    middle of the tube, but stood a little on the ope or the other side, though the
                    inclination was precisely the same. These defects were small, and such as claim
                    the notice of careful observers only; but they appeared of too much consequence
                    not to produce a wish to remedy them. It was observed that they arose from
                    inequalities in the interior surface of the tube; and by examining a great
                    number of tubes, selected for levels of the same kind, there was reason to
                    conclude that all these levels would have more or less of the same defects,
                    because there was not one tube of a regular figure within. They were at best no
                    otherwise cylindrical than plates of glass ean be said to be plane before they
                    are ground. The irregularities were easily diseernible.</p>
                <p part="N">It was therefore eoneluded that it would be advisable to grind the inner
                    surfaces of the tubes, and give them a regular cylindrical or rather spindle
                    form, of which the two opposite sides should correspond with portions of circles
                    of very long radius. To accomplish this, a rod of iron was taken of twiee the
                    length of the glass tube, and on the middle of this rod was fixed a stout tube
                    of brass of the same length as the tube of glass, and nearly filling the bore.
                    The rod was fixed between the centres of a lathe, and the glass gently rubbed on
                    the brass cylinder, with fine emery and water, causing it to move through its
                    whole length. The glass was held by the middle, that it might be equally ground,
                    and was from time to time shifted on its axis, as was also the brass cylinder,
                    in order that the wear might be everywhere alike. The operation had scarcely
                    commenced before the tube broke; and several others experienced the same
                    misfortune, though they had been well annealed. It was supposed that the emery
                    whieh became fixed in the brass might contribute to split the glass, each grain
                    continuing its impression with the same point, in a straight line, and in some
                    instances might be disposed to cut the glass as diamond. Yet it is curious that
                    some artists find a wooden cylinder to suit pretty well, probably because it
                    does not hold the emery so firmly as brass does. But when a cylinder of glass
                    was substituted instead of the brass, the emery, rolling on the surface of the
                    glass instead of fixing itself, had better success; so that the tube and
                    cylinder touched each other through their whole length. The same operation was
                    continued, using finer and finer emery to smooth the tube, and prepare it for
                    polishing; after which the tube and cylinder having been well washed, thin paper
                    was pasted round the cylinder, and very equally covered with a small quantity of
                    Veniee tripoli. The tube was then replaced and rubbed as before, till it had
                    acquired a polish.</p>
                <p part="N">A level thus ground may be either of the proper sensibility, or be too
                    much or too little sensible. It will be too sluggish, if, before grinding,
                    exclusive of the inequalities of the tube, its diameter in the middle of the
                    length should much exceed the diameter of the extremities; or it will be too
                    sensible if this diameter should not suffieiently exeeed the other; ór, lastly,
                    if the middle diameter be smaller than that of the extremes, the bubble will be
                    incapable of continuing in the middle, but will, in every case, either run to
                    one or the other end, or be divided into two parts.</p>
                <p part="N">To correct these defects, and to give the instrument the required degree
                    of perfection, it is proper to examine its figure before the grinding is
                    entirely finished. For this purpose, after cleaning it well, a sufficient
                    quantity of spirit of wine must be put into it, and secured by a cork at eaeh
                    end. The tube must then be placed on the forks or Y’s of a bubble trier, and its
                    sensibility, or the magnitude and regularity of the space run over by the
                    bubble, by equal changes of the micrometer screw, must be ascertained. If the
                    run or spaces passed over be too great, they may be rendered smaller by grinding
                    the tube on a short cylinder; but if they be too short, they may, on the
                    contrary, be enlarged, by grinding on a longer cylinder. It is necessary,
                    therefore, to be provided with a number of these cylinders of the same diameter,
                    but of different lengths, which it is advisable to bring to a first figure, by
                    grinding them in a hollow half cylinder of brass. By means of these it will be
                    easy to regulate the tube of the level to any required degree of sensibility,
                    after which the tube may be very quiekly smoothed and polished.</p>
                <p part="N">A level thus ground was one foot in length, and so was the cylinder on
                    which it was first worked. When finished it was found to be too sensible. It was
                    therefore worked on another cylinder between nine and ten inches long, which
                    diminished its sensibility so far, that the bubble, which was nine inches and
                    four lines long, at the temperature of 68° Fahrenheit, was carried from the
                    middle of the tube exactly one line for every second of inclination. This
                    sensibility was thought sufficient; but if greater is required, it may be
                    obtained by the process here described. For more on this subject, we again beg
                    to refer to Mr Nixon’s papers already cited.</p>
                <p part="N">It may be remarked, that a glass tube is very subject to be split by
                    grinding its inner surface; the same tube will not be endangered by grinding its
                    external surface, even with eoarse emery; and when once the polish of the inside
                    is ground off, the danger is over, and coarser emery may be used with safety.
                    Thiek glass is more subjeet to this misfortune than thinner. The coarsest emery
                    used in grinding the tube here spoken of was sufficiently fine to employ one
                    minute in descending three inehes in water.</p>
