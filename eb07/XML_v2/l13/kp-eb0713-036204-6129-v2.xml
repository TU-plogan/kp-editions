                    contents of the whole is 121 square miles, or 77,440 statute acres.</p>
                <p part="N">So large a portion of the surface of this county is either level or
                    gently undulating, that only a fifth part of it is stated to be unfit for
                    cultivation. Yet a considerable space is occupied by hills. A ridge extends
                    across it from northwest to south-east, of which Cairnpapple, the most elevated
                    point, is about 1500 feet high. The highest ground is in the middle, and towards
                    the west; on the south there is much moor and moss; but the hills for the most
                    part yield good pasturage, and some of them are planted. The climate, though
                    variable, is not severe. The prevailing winds are from the south-west, which
                    blow for about two thirds of the year. According to a register of the weather,
                    kept at Duddingston on the coast of the frith, about the middle of the northern
                    boundary, the greatest number of rainy and snowy days, in any one year, for a
                    period of thirty years, from 1778 to 1808, was 111 (in 1780), and the smallest
                    number 22 (in 1803); but days on which slight showers fell are not included. The
                    greatest heat in that period was in June 1785, when the thermometer stood at 87°
                    in the shade, in a northern exposure. In June 1787, there was a week of frost,
                    with ice one sixteenth of an inch in thickness.</p>
                <p part="N">Though there is a great variety of soil in this district, with
                    considerable tracts of gravel and sand, yet clay is the most general. The
                    coldest soil is chiefly on the south and south-western parts, which have also
                    the coldest climate. The following estimate will show the quantity of the
                    different kinds of soil found in the county :—Clay of good quality, 20,000
                    English acres; clay on cold bottom, 24,500; loam 10,000; light gravel and sand,
                    10,000; moors and high rocky land, 15,220; mosses, 1700; water, 500: total
                    81,920 English acres.</p>
                <p part="N">The only streams of any note are, the Almond, which rises on the border
                    of Lanarkshire, and flows north-east for about twenty-four miles between this
                    county and Edinburghshire; and the Avon, which forms the western boundary for
                    about twelve miles. Both these rivulets fall into the Frith of Forth. On the
                    north side of the town of Linlithgow there is a lake about a mile long and half
                    a mile broad, occupying about 150 acres, which contains pike, perch, and eels;
                    and a smaller one on the south, called Loch Coat, which occupies about
                    twenty-two acres, stocked with the same kinds of fish. In the parishes of
                    Linlithgow, Ecclesmachan, and Abercorn, there are several sulphureous springs;
                    and a strong chalybeate is found in the parish of Torphichen; but none of them
                    are much resorted to.</p>
                <p part="N">Silver and lead were at one time got in the hills of Bathgate, in the
                    parish of Linlithgow; and in the neighbourhood a small vein of silver ore was
                    found several years ago in a limestone quarry. Ironstone is wrought occasionally
                    in the parishes of Borrowstownness and Carriden. Sandstone, in some places of an
                    excellent quality, prevails along the coast of the Forth; and in the interior,
                    whinstone, granite, and basalt, are also found; and there is an inexhaustible
                    store of limestone. On Dundas Hill there is a basaltic rock 250 yards in length
                    and about sixty feet in height, withan almost perpendicular front, consisting of
                    a bluish granite of a very fine texture. There is also abundance of potters’
                    clay, brick clay, red chalk, and marl. Shell marl was dragged in considerable
                    quantities from the lake at Linlithgow, as a manure, till the benefits of lime
                    superseded the use of it. But the chief mineral production is coal, which
                    abounds in almost every part of the county, and is wrought in the parishes of
                    Borrowstownness and Carriden on the Forth, in Up-hall and Whitburn on the east
                    and south, and in the parish of Bathgate in the middle. An excellent kind of
                    coal has been wrought near Cultmuir, on the south-western border. The Union
                    Canal, which passes through this county, affords excellent means of transporting
                    the coal of the interior to the city of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p part="N">Linlithgowshire is for the most part divided into estates worth from
                    L.200 to L.3000 a year; but there are a few above, and several below, these
                    extremes. In the neighbourhood of the burghs of Linlithgow and Queensferry there
                    are properties of only a few acres. Four of the greatest estates, rented at from
                    L.4000 to L. 10,000, belong to as many noblemen. The valued rent, taken in 1649,
                    was L.75,027. 12s. 2d. Scots; in 1806, the real rent was L.64,518. 18s. 7d.
                    sterling; and, in 1811, the real rent of the lands and mines was L.82,947. 2s.,
                    and of the houses, L.5798. 8s. Almost half the county is entailed. The principal
                    seats are, Hopetoun House, Earl of Hopetoun, two miles west of Queensferry;
                    Barnbougle Castle and Livingston House, Earl of Rosebery; Craigiehall, Mr Hope
                    Vere; Duddingston, Mr Dundas; Hallyards, Mr Ramsay; Houston, Mr Sharp; Kinneil,
                    Duke of Hamilton, near Borrowstownness; and Polkemmet, Mr Baillie.</p>
                <p part="N">The size of the farms is from fifty Scotch acres to 600, but the greater
                    part consist of between 100 and 300 English acres. The rent of the better soils,
                    which extend over half the county, varies from L.2 to more than L.5 the acre;
                    that of the inferior clays is from 14s. to 20s., and of the high grounds from
                    6d. to 10d.; the average rent of the whole, in 1811, being rather more than 23s.
                    the English acre. The common term of leases is nineteen or twenty-one years;
                    but, in some instances, they are for twenty-four, thirty-eight, and even
                    fifty-seven years: grazing farms are let on short leases, from one to four
                    years. The crops raised are the same as in the other counties in this part of
                    Scotland, which have already been described; and the general system of husbandry
                    is not materially different, except that the dairy is more an object here than
                    in the counties to the east and south-east. The county has two royal burghs,
                    Linlithgow and Queensferry, and the towns of Bathgate and Borrowstownness;
                    besides a number of thriving villages. It is divided into fourteen parishes,
                    which, with two in Mid-Lothian, and four in Stirlingshire, form one presbytery.
                    It sends one member to parliament, the constituency, according to the latest
                    census, being 692. The annexed table contains an abstract of the population for
                    1811, 1821, and 1831.</p>
