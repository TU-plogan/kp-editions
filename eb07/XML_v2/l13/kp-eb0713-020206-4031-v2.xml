                            Baron de</hi></label>, a philosopher and mathematician of the first
                    order, and the most universal scholar of modern times, was born at Leipsig on
                    the third of July 1646. At the age of six he lost his father, Frederick
                    Leibnitz, professor of law, and secretary to the university. After this event
                    his mother placed him in the school of St Nicolas at Leipsig. Here he learned
                    the principles of the Greek and Latin languages; but soon breaking through a
                    routine ill suited to his precocious disposition, he applied himself to the
                    study of the classic writers of both languages. Titus Livius and Virgil became
                    his favourite authors; and in his old age he could still repeat entire cantos of
                    the Roman poet. Early distinguished by a rare facility in performing his tasks,
                    he often assisted such of his companions as dulness or idleness prevented from
                    completing their own; and he himself informs us, that when scarcely fourteen, he
                    composed in this way three hundred Latin verses in one day, without any
                    elisions; but he takes care to add, “Credo a lectore non quaeri quam cito, sed
                    quam bene.” At fifteen he entered on his academical career in the university of
                    Leipsig, and, under the direction of Thomasius, devoted himself to the study of
                    philosophy and the mathematics. He then passed a year at Iena, and returned to
                    Leipsig, where he occupied himself with law and philosophy. Having soon mastered
                    the details of the philosophical and mathematical sciences, the genius of
                    Leibnitz now took a grander flight, directing him to the writings of Plato and
                    of Aristotle. These he not only read and thoroughly comprehended, but used to
                    pass entire days in a wood near Leipsig, endeavouring to reconcile the doctrines
                    of the Academy with those of the Lyceum. He was scarcely twenty when he wished
                    to be received as doctor of laws; but although some <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>
                    petty jealousies prevented his want of the requisite standing or age being
                    dispensed with at Leipsig, this favour was granted him without difficulty by the
                    university of Altorf, which at the same time offered him the situation of
                    extraordinary professor of law.</p>
                <p part="N">This, however, he declined; and leaving Altorf, he proceeded to
                    Nuremberg, where a considerable number of men of science and learning were then
                    assembled. At that time a society of chemists in that city occupied themselves
                    with researches, the object of which was to discover the philosopher’s stone.
                    Tormented with a continual desire of acquiring something new, Leibnitz hoped to
                    find, even in the reveries of these visionaries, some aliment for his mind. With
                    this view he wrote to the society soliciting admission, and craving to be
                    initiated into their mysteries. This letter, which was full of abstruse terms
                    extracted from books of chemistry, and so conformable to the style of these
                    mystics that he himself did not understand it, had prodigious success. Leibnitz
                    was admitted a member of the society, and immediately appointed secretary
                    thereto. His duty in this capacity consisted in registering their processes and
                    experiments, and in extracting from the books of the chemists such things as
                    might be of use to his associates in prosecuting their researches.</p>
                <p part="N">But happily for himself and the sciences, Leibnitz, whilst at Nuremberg,
                    chanced to make the acquaintance of the Baron de Boineburg, chancellor to the
                    elector of Mayence, who, being struck with his merit, and conceiving a high
                    opinion of his talents and learning, recommended to him to apply himself
                    particularly to history and jurisprudence, and expressed a desire to see him
                    established at Frankfort, at the same time promising to obtain him some
                    employment under his sovereign. Leibnitz followed the judicious counsel thus
                    given him; and from this epoch, 1667, may be dated the real commencement of his
                    literary career. It was at Frankfort that he brought out his <hi rend="italic"

                    objects necessary for the double purpose expressed in the title; and in it he
                    already displayed that practical spirit which enabled him to produce so much
                    that is really useful. But that which placed its author in the first rank of
                    philosophical writers, was the new manner in which he treated his subject, and
                    the profound and ingenious views which he presented in regard to a science so
                    long abandoned to routine and pedantry. The order, the clearness, the precision
                    of the ideas, and the style which makes books live, contributed to give great
                    popularity to this production, which, at a subsequent period, the author himself
                    judged with impartiality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    published in 1669 in favour of the Prince of Neuburg, whom Leibnitz endeavoured
                    to recommend to the Poles, as uniting, in a higher degree than all his
                    competitors, the qualities they required in their king. This piece, which is
                    somewhat lengthy, is written in Latin, and consists of sixty propositions,
                    proved by a rigorous series of axioms, supported sometimes by expositions full
                    of erudition, amongst which maybe mentioned that under the head, <hi

                    always follow in a necessary order; some of them are superfluous; and the form
                    is a little fatiguing, especially since the interest of the subject has
                    altogether ceased. The Prince of Neuburg was not elected king. But the work of
                    Leibnitz did not on that account make a less sensation, and may, in fact, be
                    regarded as a sort of <hi rend="italic">tour de force.</hi> Boineburg, at whose

                    satisfaction that Leibnitz justified the idea which he had conceived of his
                    talents, attached him to the service of the elector, by eausing him to be
                    appointed counsellor of the chamber of revision in the ehancery of the
                    electorate of Mayenee.</p>
                <p part="N">The material occupations of this offiee, however, eould not shackle a
                    genius so vast and so aetive as that of Leibnitz. He held it during three years;
                    and it was in this interval that he conceived the design of re-easting or
                    new-modelling the Encyclopaedia of Alstedius. It is not well known what his
                    ideas then were respecting this project; but in some subsequent writings he
                    explains himself in a manner sufficiently spécifié. He defines the Eneyelopaedia
                    to be the “system of all the true and useful propositions then known.” He thinks
                    that, to be complete, it should contain definitions of all words; explanations
                    of every fundamental and useful proeess in the liberal and meehanie arts; and,
                    lastly, a summary of universal history. He then enumerates the different
                    branches of human knowledge; indicates, as models to be followed in eaeh, the
                    principal existing works, amongst which he eites some of his own, and points out
                    what remains to be done; and, finally, he recommends the order of the materials
                    or subjects, in preference to the order of the alphabet.<note anchored="true"

                    another passage he recommends subjoining to the treatise on each seienee a
                    succinct aeeount of its origin and progress, together with a list of the authors
                    who have treated of it in detail. This was one of the predominant ideas of his
                    life, one to which he appeared to attaeh great importance, and which occupied
                    his mind as long as he lived.</p>
                <p part="N">Leibnitz now began to evinee a mastery in almost all the sciences. He
                    already enjoyed a great reputation as jurisconsult and philosopher; and he m⅛de
                    himself known in physics by the publication of two treatises, viz. <hi
                        rend="italic">Thearia</hi><hi rend="italic">Motus abstracti</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Theoria Motus concreti,</hi> which appeared in 1671. These
                    theories were not admitted by philosophers, and did not deserve to be so; but
                    they nevertheless exeited astonishment by the boldness and originality of genius
                    displayed in the eoneeption of them. The year following he brought out, at the
                    request of Boineburg, a small treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Sacrosancta
                        Trinitas</hi><hi rend="italic">per nova</hi><hi rend="italic">argumenta
                        logica defensa.</hi> In this work, intended to refute the attacks of a Pole
                    named W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> issowatius against the doctrine of the
                    Trinity, the author endeavours to show that sound logie is not contrary to
                    orthodoxy. Thus each year Leibnitz produeed some work, whieh served as a new
                    title of distinction, and enabled him to rank successively amongst the masters
                    in the different seienees.</p>
                <p part="N">He had long entertained a desire to visit Paris. Franee then fixed the
                    attention of the learned world, and extorted the admiration of Europe by the
                    victories and the influence of the great monarch to whom she also owed an
                    extraordinary development of military and literary glory. Leibnitz felt the
                    importance of forming a connection with the learned men of that country; and
                    Boineburg procured him the means of attaining this objeet, by proposing to him
                    to accompany bis son, whom he was then sending to Paris. Delighted with the
                    proposal, and at the same time anxious to testify his gratitude to so zealous a
                    patron, Leibnitz gladly accepted the offer, and set out for Paris in 1672.
                    Plaeed amongst the illustrious men of that capital, and already worthy of them,
                    he felt that ardour whieh leads to the distinction conferred by useful
                    discoveries burn with redoubled foree in his bosom. He now applied himself more
                    especially to the mathematics, in whieh he had not as yet made any considerable
                    progress; and this choice, in the midst of distractions of every kind in a new
                    society, and of studies apparently much more attractive, is not one of the least
                    proofs of the foree and energy of his character. He found at Paris the
                    illustrious Huygens; and he afterwards confessed, with that ingenuousness whieh
                    is so becoming in great men, his obligations to the work <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Horologio</hi><hi rend="italic">Oscillatοriο,</hi>
                    which had just appeared, and which, of all modern works, after those of Galileo
                    and Descartes, proved the most useful to Leibnitz. The learned men whose society
                    he frequented soon recognized his superior genius; and he confirmed this lιigh
                    estimate of his powers by the exposition of his ideas on the reform of the
                    arithmetical machine of Paseal, or rather by the invention of a new machine,
                    whieh he has deseribed in the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea
                        Be-rοlinensia.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                            73. In 1763 he had exhibited this machine to the Royal Society of
                            London; and, in fact, it appears to have occupied his attention at
                            intervals during the whole of his life. It is still preserved in the
                            Museum of Göttingen, and is thought superior to other machines of the
                            same kind. (Gersten, xvii. 232.)</p></note> He obtained the suffrages of
                    the Academy of Seienees, the members of which signified to him that he might be
                    admitted into that illustrious body as pensionary, provided he ehose to embrace
                    the Catholie religion; but although the proposition was equally honourable to
                    Leibnitz, as a proof of the estimation in which his talents were held, and to
                    the Academy, which knew how to appreciate them, he did not think it proper or
                    right for him to accept the offer.</p>
                <p part="N">His protector Boineburg died in 1673; and having no longer any business
                    to detain him at Paris, he passed over into England, where he was received with
                    the same distinction as in Franee. He had the satisfaction of making the
                    aequaintanee and enjoying the society of Boyle, Oldenburg, Collins, and other
                    celebrated men, who disputed the palm in several of the seienees with the
                    philosophers of the Continent; and it was from Collins that he received some
                    hints concerning the invention of the method of fluxions, which had been
                    discovered by Newton as early as the year 1664 or 1665, and by him communicated
                    to Dr Barrow in 1669. But he had not been long in England when he received
                    intelligence of the death of the elector ofMayenee, by whieh he lost his
                    pension. As this event made an entire change in his position, he resolved to
                    eommunieate his embarrassments to the Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg. This prinee,
                    who had always testified mueh regard for him, availed himself of the opportunity
                    thus afforded him to assure Leibnitz of his favour, and to offer him the
                    situation of counsellor, with a salary, at the same time granting him permission
                    to prolong at pleasure his stay abroad. Overjoyed with this reply, ’ whieh
                    removed all eause of uneasiness as to his circumstances, Leibnitz returned to
                    Paris, where he remained fifteen months buried in the depths of geometry. He
                    quitted Paris in 1674, revisited England where he spent fifteen days, and
                    proceeded by way of Holland to join his new benefactor. Leibnitz was still under
                    thirty. At an age when great men are in general only beginning to distinguish
                    themselves, eaeh in his respective career, he had entered upon almost all in
                    succession; had received, in the three countries whieh he had visited,
                    testimonies of the highest esteem; and had established, with a great number of
                    learned men, literary connections, whieh proved very advantageous to the
                    seienees. We shall soon see him attain a still more commanding eminence, and at
                    length arrive at that species of supremacy whieh he acquired over his age by the
                    universality of his genius and talents.</p>
                <p part="N">Soon after his arrival at Hanover, he published his treatise on the
                    Right of Sovereignty and of Embassy claimed by the Princes of Germany, who
                    demanded the same privilege<pb break="no" facs="nls:193204057?mode=fullsize"

                    kings. This work, which appeared under the name of <hi rend="italic">Coesarinus

                    states of the West, as the pope is the spiritual head, possesses little interest
                    at the present day; but it displays a profound knowledge of public law and of
                    history, gives minute details of titles and ceremonial, and is written in that
                    decorous and measured style which distinguishes all the writings of Leibnitz. He
                    continued to cultivate all the sciences. He likewise supported, by every means
                    in his power, the project -of publishing the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi> the first volume of which appeared at Leipsig
                    in the year 1682. The celebrity which this journal acquired from its very
                    commencement was in a great measure owing to Leibnitz, who enriched it with a
                    great variety of curious pieces, from extracts of rare books, to problems in the
                    higher geometry.</p>
                <p part="N">The Duke of Brunswick died in 1679; but his successor, Ernest Augustus,
                    afterwards George I. of England, inheriting the same esteem for Leibnitz,
                    extended to him the same favour, and engaged him to write the history of the
                    house of Brunswick. Leibnitz, anxious to obey this honourable call, resolved to
                    visit the south of Germany and Italy, that in these countries he might make the
                    necessary researches, and collect materials for the work. He devoted no less
                    than three years to these journeys, consulting learned men, exploring libraries
                    and archives, perusing old charters and manuscripts, and examining other
                        monuments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                            the crew observing to the pilot, that as the man was not a heretic, it
                            would be of no use to throw him into the sea.</p></note> The fruit of so
                    many researches was a prodigious collection of materials of all kinds. Besides
                    the documents necessary for his history, it comprehended an immense multitude of
                    political and diplomatic acts, as declarations of war, manifestoes, contracts of
                    marriage, treaties of peace, bulls, and other public pieces. Leibnitz put these
                    materials in order, and with their aid produced a work altogether different
                    from, and independent of, the principal, and indeed one of much greater
                    importance, entitled <hi rend="italic">Codex Juris Gentium Diplomatìcus,</hi>
                    the first volume of which appeared in 1693, and the second in 1700, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Mantissa</hi><hi rend="italic">Codicis.</hi> This
                    collection contains a great number of acts which had never before appeared, and
                    many others which, though previously published, had become very scarce. Read
                    with discernment, it exhibits great knowledge, not only of history, but also of
                    the genius of nations and languages, as well as of other subjects of inferior
                    interest and importance. In other respects, any methodical mind might have been
                    capable of a similar effort. What the genius of Leibnitz could alone produce is
                    the preface to the work, in which, ascending to the principles of natural law
                    and the law of nations, he expounds his ideas on both with great depth and
                    originality. But that which distinguishes this book, and the preceding ones
                    published by him on the same subjects, particularly his project for compiling a
                    new body of law,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    that reasonable reform of jurisprudence which was afterwards effected, in a
                    great measure owing to the influence of Leibnitz, by whom its necessity was
                    first pointed out; and likewise the union, recommended throughout, of the study
                    of jurisprudence with that of religion and philosophy, which he regarded as the
                    most solid basis of human happiness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">In the midst of labours so various, he did not lose sight of the
                    principal object of his recent travels, and occupied himself diligently in
                    collecting the historians of Brunswick. He even composed for that house several
                    writings, one of which, intended to establish its connection with the house of
                    Este, procured for him the place of privy councillor of justice; a sinecure
                    appointment destined to recompense his zeal without withdrawing him from his
                    ordinary labours, amongst which the history, with its collateral branches,
                    occupied an important place. The immense researches Leibnitz had made for the
                    history of Brunswick, however, furnished him with materials for other works of a
                    secondary kind. Thus in 1698 he published a new collection under the title of
                        <hi rend="italic">Accessiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Historicoe</hi> (in two
                    vols. 4to), containing a great number of rare and curious pieces, which had
                    escaped the observation of his predecessors. But nothing attests so much the
                    extent of his views as what he did for the history he had undertaken. He
                    commenced by collecting all the writers who had spoken of the house of
                    Brunswick. The first volume appeared in 1707, the second in 1710, and the third
                    in 1711; and subjoined were extracts from all the ancient authors relative to
                    the tribes inhabiting the banks of the Elbe and the Weser, with notes
                    explanatory of obscure passages. This collection, therefore, like those of
                    Muratori, Duchesne, and others, had a merit independent of the object for which
                    it had been compiled. But it was still, so to speak, only a preliminary work.
                    The history even of Brunswick has not appeared. The learned Eckhard found
                    amongst the papers of Leibnitz only the plan of it, which he published in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi> of 1717. This
                    history was to have been preceded by a dissertation on the primitive state of
                    the globe, and particularly of Germany. A curious monument of the ideas of
                    Leibnitz on this subject is contained in his <hi rend="italic">Protogaea,</hi> a
                    sort of essay, which, in 1693, he caused to be inserted in the Leipsig journal,
                    and which was afterwards published separately by Scheidius (Göttingen, 1749, in
                    4to). In this production he attempts to explain the formation of the earth, and
                    of the different substances which it includes. He admits a conflagration of the
                    globe, then a general submersion, which, independently of the testimony of
                    Scripture, is sufficiently established by the animal and vegetable remains that
                    are frequently met with, and at different heights. This double hypothesis
                    enables him to assign to the solid bodies <hi rend="italic">(corpora firma)</hi>
                    a double origin, that is, cooling after the fusion, and consolidation after the
                    subsiding and evaporation of the waters; and in these ideas he finds the germ of
                    a new science, which he calls <hi rend="italic">Natural Geography.</hi> He
                    enters into some details on minerals, and speaks of crystals, which he considers
                    as the geometry of inanimate nature. Further, Leibnitz thought it incumbent on
                    him to prove that animal and vegetable petrifactions were not a freak or sport
                    of nature <hi rend="italic">(jeu</hi><hi rend="italic">de lα nature),</hi> and
                    also to rebut forcibly the opinion as to the productive power of matter. This
                    short exposition will suffice to give an idea of the immensity of the plan of
                    Leibnitz, and of the prodigious variety of subjects which it embraces; a plan in
                    many respects similar to that which has been followed by Herder and some other
                    authors posterior to Leibnitz. It is much to be regretted that this design was
                    not carried into execution, seeing it would probably <pb break="no"

                    people, he conceives, came originally from the shores of the Baltic Sea. He
                    founds his opinion on the authority of the anonymous writer of Ravenna, and of
                    Ermoldus Nigellus, a French poet of the ninth century, and on passages in
                    several authors; alleging, moreover, that some of the ancients have confounded
                    the Palus Maeotis with the Baltic Sea. This opinion was attacked by Father
                    Tournemine, who combated it with much urbanity, saying, amongst other things,
                    that, even in espousing a contrary hypothesis, the French did not disclaim being
                    the countrymen of Leibnitz, since he appeared to have proved that the Franks had
                    occupied the countries situated between the right bank of the Rhine and the
                    Ocean. Gundling also published a refutation of the assertions of Leibnitz. The
                    latter, who did not hold himself beaten, replied to both his antagonists; but,
                    far from pretending to decide in the last resort, he appealed to the judgment of
                    several learned men of his time, and, amongst others, to that of Huet and
                    Montfaucon, whom he highly respected on account of their learning.</p>
                <p part="N">This seems the proper place to speak of the correspondence which
                    Leibnitz for a long time maintained with Bossuet, in regard to the project for
                    the re-union of the Protestants with the Catholics; a project which had for some
                    time been pushed with activity, and which gave Leibnitz occasion to display
                    attainments in theology which no one could ever have suspected in a
                    mathematician of the first order. The details may be seen in the History of
                    Bossuet by Μ. Bausset.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N"><hi rend="italic">Histoire de Bossuet,</hi> torn· iv. p. 144,
                            2d edit.</p></note> It is sufficient to state that this négociation, in
                    which Leibnitz did not take part till the year 1692, was carried on with a
                    degree of good faith very rare indeed in affairs of this description; that at
                    one time it encouraged the hope of a successful and happy termination; and that
                    it ultimately failed, owing to circumstances altogether independent of the
                    matters which had formed the subjects of discussion. Amongst these may be
                    reckoned the new political situation in which the elector of Hanover, to whom
                    Leibnitz was altogether devoted, found himself placed in the year 1701. This
                    prince saw reason to apprehend, that were he to labour longer in endeavouring to
                    effect a reconciliation between die two communions, he might alienate the
                    English people, who then manifested the greatest aversion to Catholicism, and
                    might even bar his accession to the throne of England, to which he saw himself
                    eventually called. From the <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Theologicum</hi> of Leibnitz, however, it is clear that this philosopher
                    had personally little disinclination to the doctrines of the Catholic church. To
                    effect the re-union desired, he had reckoned much upon the influence of Louis
                    XIV.; and it is curious to observe how this prince is judged by a man as
                    independent of France as Leibnitz then was.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">Having been admitted a member of the Royal Society of London during his
                    second visit to England in 1674, and associated to the Academy of Sciences at
                    Paris since 1699, Leibnitz too well appreciated the advantages which academies
                    owe to tlιis combination of labours directed towards a common centre, not to
                    second, by all the means in his power, the project for establishing a Royal
                    Academy at Berlin, formed in 1700 by the elector of Brandenburg, who, the
                    following year, assumed the title of king of Prussia. This prince had solicited
                    the advice and assistance of Leibnitz. The reply of the latter is equally
                    remarkable for the excellence and wisdom of its views, and the great simplicity
                    by which it is throughout distinguished. “The object,” says he, “ought to be to
                    advance the happiness of men, which consists principally in wisdom and in
                    virtue, and next in health and the comŕbrts of life.” He points out, as the
                    first object, “the good education of youth, which includes also the regulation
                    of studies; nothing being more important than to give a good cast to the mind as
                    well as to the body.” He then indicates summarily the plan of study which the
                    Academy ought to recommend, and which is in the main that presently followed in
                    the universities of Germany. The elector, as may well be supposed, adopted the
                    views of Leibnitz. But he did more; he appointed him president of the new
                    society, with the most unlimited powers, and without any restraint as to
                    residence, or requiring that he should quit the service of the elector of
                    Brunswick. The patent by which this office was conferred forms one of the most
                    honourable titles ever bestowed on a man of learning and science.</p>
                <p part="N">Eleven years later, Leibnitz received marked proofs of confidence on the
                    part of Peter I. of Russia, who, during his travels in Saxony, consulted him as
                    to the execution of his vast projects relative to the civilization of his
                    empire, and to whom Leibnitz in his turn communicated views with which that
                    monarch expressed hi nself highly satisfied. In reward of this service he
                    received the title of privy councillor. Lastly, the king of Prussia having died
                    in 1713, Leibnitz, who foresaw the fall of the Academy of Berlin under his
                    successor, repaired to Vienna to propose to the Emperor Charles VI. the
                    institution of a similar body, wherein the sciences, which were about to be
                    banished from Berlin, might find an asylum. Owing to several circumstances
                    unconnected with Leibnitz, this project did not succeed; but every mark of
                    consideration was lavished on the author. The empęror had already named him an
                    aulic councillor; to this he now added a pension of two thousand florins, and
                    employed every means to induce him to enter the imperial service. But Leibnitz,
                    having declined these offers, went to fix his abode at Hanover, the elector of
                    which had just been called to the throne of England.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1710 there appeared a volume of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea
                        Eerolinensia,</hi> in which Leibnitz amply acquitted his debt as founder and
                    president, and showed himself under forms so varied, that this volume alone
                    would have been sufficient to insure him the reputation of universal genius. In
                    proof of what is here said, it is only necessary to refer to his Essay on the
                    Origin of Nations. This production exhibits the principal points of his system,
                    a complete know ledge of which may be obtained by the perusal of his voluminous
                    correspondence. By the aid of etymologies, and by means of analysis, Leibnitz
                    endeavours to distinguish, through the successive alterations of languages, the
                    origins of different nations, whom he divides into two great principal
                    races,—that of the North and that of the South; then, by way of synthesis, he
                    attempts to recompose the primitive language; and, finally, by means of this
                    last operation, he labours to discover the relations between the signs of
                    language and the ideas expressed by them. A great part of his labours had for
                    their object to obtain these different results; he had himself plunged into the
                    chaos before which almost all those who are more occupied with ideas than with
                    words usuallyrecoil: it formed one of the principal objects of his
                    correspondence with the learned, as well as with travellers and missionaries;
                    and new views on the language of the Copts or the Hottentots afforded him as
                    much pleasure as the demonstration of a metaphysical truth, or the solution<pb

                    of an important problem in geometry. He is not always of the same mind with
                    other learned men, and often contradicts received opinions. Like all
                    etymologists, he has placed too much reliance upon fanciful coincidences and
                    strained derivations; but, as he himself observed, errors are often useful to
                    truth, and the search after the three great chimeras <hi rend="italic">(tria
                        magna inania),</hi> the philosopher’s stone, the perpetual motion, and the
                    quadrature of the circle, materially contributed to enrich the sciences.<note

                <p part="N">We have seen that Leibnitz succeeded in stamping the impression of his
                    genius upon almost all kinds of knowledge. Natural history alone did not
                    specially occupy his attention. His <hi rend="italic">Protogaea</hi> is the only
                    essay which he published on the subject; but in his works we often meet with
                    proofs of the interest with which that science had inspired him; and it is not
                    forgotten either in his general plans of education, or in his encyclopedical
                    schemes. He was even a poet, and wrote verses in both the languages which he
                    habitually employed; but it is right to add, that he acquired no illustration by
                    his poetry, particularly his French verses, which are below mediocrity. Leibnitz
                    is justly obnoxious to the literary reproach of having neglected his
                    mother-tongue. But few of his writings appeared in German; and, what is not a
                    little singular, the object of one of these pieces, which is very ill written,
                    but exceedingly curious, is to recommend the study, practice, and improvement of
                    the German language.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    the more to be regretted that he did not himself labour in the execution of the
                    plan which he proposed for attaining this object, as he might, by his influence,
                    have effected that which was not accomplished until half a century afterwards,
                    by the united efforts of the poets and literary men who distinguished that
                    epoch. Besides, although he attaches great importance to that language, he does
                    not appear to have understood its resources or its flexibility; for, in citing
                    French Sapphic verses, he adds, that he does not believe a similar attempt would
                    succeed equally well in German, although he had himself composed German
                    anapests, in imitation of those of Seneca. In justification of Leibnitz,
                    however, it is proper to add, that, being in correspondence with men of all
                    nations, he naturally adopted the two languages, Latin and French, which were
                    then in general and almost exclusive use.</p>
                <p part="N">His Latin style is neither elegant nor agreeable. Sometimes, however, he
                    rises with his subject, and assumes a certain degree of majesty; but what may
                    appear singular is, that we frequently meet with Gallicisms in his Latin
                    compositions. We are less surprised to find Germanisms in his French prose; but
                    these, however, are of rare occurrence. What strikes us most in his general
                    style, is that grand and noble simplicity which distinguishes the French writers
                    of the same period, and which is equally suited to pure reason and to sublime
                    conceptions. In his works, as in his correspondence, there is an almost total
                    absence of ornament. The most simple literary correspondence of the present day
                    would exhibit more brilliancy and point than that of this great man; but, on the
                    other hand, there is not one of his letters which does not contain the germ, the
                    expression, or the development of some great or useful idea. Those of greatest
                    extent commonly exhibit a sort of abridged or epitomized encyclopedical view of
                    the state of the sciences, or the labours of the learned. But what we are never
                    weary of admiring is his constant urbanity towards his correspondents, as well
                    as the moderation and propriety exhibited in the expression of his judgments,
                    whatever may be their occasional severity. No personal predilection, no national
                    prejudice, ever disturbs the impartiality of that genius which viewed every
                    thing as it were from on high. Embracing, so to speak, entire humanity, he
                    incessantly recommends sending European missionaries into foreign countries, for
                    the triple purpose of augmenting the amount and variety of our knowledge,
                    establishing new commercial relations, and, above all, propagating the faith and
                    the doctrine of Christianity. “Peu lui importe,” says his French biographer,
                    “que cette doctrine soit enseignée aux étrangers avec moins de pureté (on ne
                    doit pas oublier que c’est un Luthérien qui parle), pourvu qu’elle se répande;
                    et pour le succès des missions aux Malabar, entre autres, il conseille d’amener
                    en Europe des habitants de cette côte, qui puissent y enseigner leur langue à
                    des missionnaires Européens.”</p>
                <p part="N">Leibnitz had a sweet expression of countenance, blended with a studious
                    air; he possessed considerable gaiety, and his conversation was equally easy and
                    instructive. His temper was naturally choleric; but, like most passionate men,
                    he soon recovered his equanimity. Affable and communicative, he conversed freely
                    with all who came in his way, and even carried his complaisance so far as,
                    according to Fontenelle, to read a multitude of worthless books, out of
                    politeness to their authors. He was never married. At the age of fifty he had
                    some thoughts of forming a matrimonial connection; but as the lady he wished to
                    espouse desired time to consider his proposal, Leibnitz also made his own
                    reflections on the subject, and unluckily came to the conclusion that, though
                    marriage is a good thing, a wise man ought to consider of it all his life. Much
                    has been said of his avarice, but apparently without any sufficient reason.
                    There is no doubt that his expenditure was exceedingly frugal; but he had no
                    expensive passions or tastes to satisfy, and it is probable that his money
                    accumulated without his being aware of it. The reproach of not having attended
                    the service of his religion appears to be better founded. Nevertheless, he was
                    equally attached to the forms and the substance of religion; and though he may
                    have been wanting in punctuality of attendance, there is no ground whatever for
                    questioning the sincerity of his sentiments. De Murr, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journal of Nuremberg,</hi> of the 1lth March 1779, gives entire the Memoir
                    of Eckhard, from which Fontenelle has derived most of the particulars inserted
                    in his Eloge de Leibnitz. It is there stated, that Leibnitz was of a middle
                    stature, and had black hair, a large head (which early became bald), and small
                    eyes. He was short-sighted, but his vision continued excellent even until his
                    last moments. He read the smallest charaeters, and his hand-writing was very
                    minute. He had on the crown of his head an excrescence of the size of a pigeon’s
                    egg; and he always walked stooping, with his head projected, which gave him the
                    appearance of being hunch-backed. He was of a thin habit, but of a vigorous
                    temperament; he drank little, supped plentifully, and went to rest immediately
                    after. He remained in bed only a few hours; sometimes he contented himself with
                    sleeping in a chair, and, awaking about six or seven in the morning, instantly
                    resumed his labours. When deeply immersed in study, he was known to have
                    scarcely quitted his chair for weeks. But, however strong his constitution might
                    be, it could not, in the long run, escape being undermined by a life so
                    sedentary; in fact, the result was an ulcer in one of his legs. He was, besides,
                    subject to the gout, the attacks of which became more frequent and painful tow
                    ards the close of his life. He consulted few physicians; and his death appears
                    to have been occasioned by blindly using a remedy which he had received from one
                    of his friends, and which, producing violent spasms, terminated his existence in
                    little more than an hour after he had swallowed it. He died on the 14th of
                    November 1716, at the age of seventy. His <pb break="no"

                    constructed in the form of a small temple, at the extremity of the great alley

                        >Ossa Leibnitii.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This extraordinary man is, beyond contradiction, one of those who have
                    most highly exalted and ennobled the human understanding. But if he has merited
                    our admiration by the astonishing variety of his labours, he is still more
                    deserving of our gratitude on account of that practical activity which had
                    always for its object the good of his fellow-creatures. Along with his most
                    profound meditations, are presented the means which indicate their utility, and
                    facilitate their application. His letters to Madame Brinon, his judgments on
                    Shaftesbury, the whole of his correspondence, and a thousand passages in his
                    writings, attest his profound respect for religion and morality; and he crowned
                    his glorious life by giving, in his <hi rend="italic">Theodicaea,</hi> the
                    support of his influence to ideas at once the most sublime and the most
                    necessary to the welfare of humanity. None of his labours was without glory to
                    himself, or without advantage to society. His reputation would perhaps have been
                    more solid and permanent had he less ambitiously grasped the whole circle of
                    human science; yet it is difficult to name any department of human knowledge
                    which has not profited by his labours, or received fresh illustration from his
                    genius. As a theologian, he successively contended with the sceptics who
                    believed too little, and with the Catholics, who, in his opinion, believed too
                    much; with the heretics, who believed otherwise than was inculcated by the
                    confession of Augsburg; and with the Arminians, who contended for the liberty of
                    indifference. Yet the philosopher betrayed his love of union and toleration. In
                    conjunction with the illustrious Bossuet, he laboured zealously to effect a
                    reconciliation between the Catholic and Protestant churches; and if he failed in
                    this truly Christian enterprise, his sincerity and good faith remain
                    unimpeach-cd; for, whatever may be thought of the selfish and worldly policy of
                    the elector of Hanover, there can scarcely be but one opinion as to the purity
                    of the motives which actuated Leibnitz. In an intolerant age, however, his
                    orthodoxy did not escape suspicion; and the moderation which reflects so much
                    honour on his memory was construed as indifference. His faith in revelation
                    itself was accused, because he attempted to prove the doctrine of the Trinity by
                    the principles of logic; and in the defence of the attributes and providence of
                    the Deity, he was suspected of a secret correspondence with his adversary Bayle.
                    As a metaphysician, he expatiated in regions too elevated ever to be explored by
                    human genius and intellect. His pre-established harmony of the soul and body, if
                    an untenable, is at least a sublime conception, and, as such, might have excited
                    the jealousy of Plato himsclť; whilst his optimism, or the best of all possible
                    worlds, seems an idea too vast for a mortal mind, and too beneficent for the
                    actual condition of humanity. He was a natural philosopher, in the large and
                    genuine acceptation of the term; and if, like some others, he amused himself
                    with cndcavouring to penetrate the mysteries of cosmogony, his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Protogaea,</hi> or primitive earth, has not been useless to Buffon, and
                    those who have succeeded him, in investigating the changes which have taken
                    place in the constitution of the globe, and tracing the causes or agents to
                    which these are to be attributed.</p>
                <p part="N">“I am not worthy,” says Gibbon, “to praise the mathematician; but his
                    name is mingled in all the problems and discoveries of the times; the masters of
                    the art were his rivals or disciples; and if he borrowed from Sir Isaac Newton
                    the sublime method of fluxions, Leibnitz was at least the Prometheus who
                    imparted to mankind the sacred fire which he had stolen from the gods. His
                    curiosity extended to every branch of chemistry, mechanics, and the arts; and
                    the thirst of knowledge was always accompanied with the spirit of improvement.
                    The vigour of his youth had been exercised in the schools of jurisprudence; and
                    while he taught, he aspired to reform the laws of nature and nations, of Rome
                    and Germany. The annals of Brunswick, and of the empire, of the ancient and
                    modern world, were presented to the mind of the historian; and he could turn
                    from the solution of a problem to the dusty parchments and barbarous style of
                    the records of the middle age. His genius was more nobly directed to investigate
                    the origin of languages and nations; nor could he assume the character of a
                    grammarian without forming the project of an universal idiom and alphabet. These
                    various studies were often interrupted by the occasional politics of the times,
                    and his pen was always ready in the cause of the princes and patrons to whose
                    service he was attached; many hours were consumed in a learned correspondence
                    with all Europe; and the philosopher amused his leisure with the composition of
                    French and Latin poetry. Such an example may display the extent and powers of
                    the human understanding, but even <hi rend="italic">his</hi> powers were
                    dissipated by the multiplicity of his pursuits. He attempted more than he
                    could-finish; he designed more than he could execute: his imagination was too
                    easily satisfied with a bold and rapid glance on the subject, which he was
                    impatient to leave; and Leibnitz may be compared to those heroes, whose empire
                    has been lost in the ambition of universal conquest.”</p>
                <p part="N">Variety in unity, or unity varied, the expressive sign of every
                    masterpiece of nature and of art, characterizes happily enough the productions
                    of the genius of Leibnitz: extreme variety in the number and the species of the
                    ideas with which he enriched the intellectual world, of the truths which he
                    discovered or demonstrated, and of the elements of every order which he
                    combined: absolute unity of principle, of method, of plan, and of object or aim,
                    in this great and beautiful system, which connects and harmonizes the two
                    worlds, spiritual and material, by subjecting them to the unity of a monarchy
                    constituted under the government of the greatest and best of sovereigns. If we
                    consider the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> under which the different productions
                    of this fertile genius present themselves, as detached pieces, or as fragments
                    disseminated in vast collections, the mind is at first struck with their
                    prodigious variety; and it is in this point of view that they most commonly
                    appear, not only to biographers, but frequently to the historians of philosophy.
                    But he who regards them in this light alone, will absolutely fail to discover
                    the total and harmonious effect of this grand and beautiful scenography, or will
                    only obtain partial views, and glimpses without any sequence or connection. The
                    philosophical works of Leibnitz form a body of <hi rend="italic">doctrine,</hi>
                    the parts of which, whatever be their number or diversity, are nevertheless
                    intimately connected, and all referrible to the same principles, as well as
                    animated by the same spirit. This spirit, diffused throughout each of his
                    numerous productions, pervades equally the works of the jurisconsult, the
                    historian, the theologian, the natural philosopher, and the mathematician.<note

                <p part="N">In like manner, with reference to the mathematical labours of Leibnitz,
                    and more particularly his claim to the discovery of the differential calculus,
                    it is only necessary for us to direct the reader to the Third Preliminary
                    Dissertation (part second, sect. i. p. 517, et seq.) where the subject generally
                    is treated with profound science and consummate ability, and the claims of
                    Leibnitz to the discovery in question are weighed and judged with that perfect
                    candour and judicious discrimination, which ought ever to guide such decisions.
                    In recent times, however, a new competitor for the honour of this discovery has
                    been brought forward by no less distinguished a personage than Laplace. “Il
                    paraît,” says he, in his <hi rend="italic">Essai Philosophique sur les
                        Probabilités, “</hi> que Fermat, <hi rend="italic">le véritable inventeur du

                    celui des différences finies.” Against this affirmation, however, Professor
                    Playfair, in his review of Laplace’s <hi rend="italic">Essai,</hi> enters a
                    strong and solemn protestation. “The age in which that discovery was made,” says
                    he, “has been unanimous in ascribing the honour of either to Newton or Leibnitz;
                    or, as seems to us much the fairest and most probable opinion, <hi rend="italic"
                        >to both</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, to each independently of the
                    other, the priority in respect of time being somewhat on the side of the English
                    mathematician. The writers of the history of the mathematical sciences have
                    given their suffrages to the same effect;— Montucla, for instance, who has
                    treated the subject with great impartiality, and Bossut, with no prejudices
                    certainly in favour of the English philosopher. In the great controversy to
                    which this gave rise, all the claims were likely to be well considered; and the
                    ultimate and fair decision, in which all sides seem to have acquiesced, is that
                    which has just been mentioned. It ought to be on good grounds, that a decision
                    passed by such competent judges, and that has now been in force for a hundred
                    years, should all at once be reversed.” He then proceeds to show that there are
                    no such grounds, and concludes by observing, “Great as is the merit of Fermat,
                    which nobody can be more willing than ourselves to acknowledge, and near as he
                    was to the greatest invention of modern times, we cannot admit that his property
                    in it is to be put on a footing with that of Newton or of Leibnitz ;—we should
                    fear that, in doing so, we were violating or* of the most sacred and august
                    monuments that posterity ever raised in honour of the dead.”<note

                    connection with Leibnitz, is immense, and therefore precludes any attempt at
                    enumerating them. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
