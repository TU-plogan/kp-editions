            <div facs="nls:192945953?mode=fullsize" org="uniform" part="N" sample="complete"
                type="entry">
                <p part="N"><label type="entry">JUGGLERS</label>, a kind of people whose profession,
                    namely, to perform slight-of-band tricks, has not often been deemed either
                    respectable or useful. Yet Professor Beckmann, in the third volume of his <hi
                        rend="italic">History of Inventions,</hi> defends them, and pleads ably the
                    cause of the practitioners of legerdemain, including rope-dancers, and such as
                    exhibit feats of uncommon strength. He places all these under the general
                    denomination of jugglers; and taking it for granted that every useful employment
                    is full, he contends, strangely enough, that there would not be room on the
                    earth for all its present inhabitants, did not some of them practise the art of
                    juggling.</p>
                <p part="N">These arts, he observes, are not unprofitable, for they afford a
                    comfortable subsistence to those who practise them, which they usually spend
                    upon the spot; and this he considers as a good reason why their sojourning in a
                    place ought to be encouraged. He is also of opinion, that if the arts of
                    juggling served no other end than to amuse the most ignorant of our citizens, it
                    is proper that they should be encouraged, for the sake of those who cannot enjoy
                    the more expensive deceptions of an opera. They convey instruction in the most
                    acceptable manner, and serve as an antidote to superstition. We scarcely think,
                    however, that it is innocent to entice the labouring poor, by useless
                    deceptions, to part with their hard-earned pittance to idle vagabonds, whose
                    life cannot be comfortable, being passed amidst scenes of the most grovelling
                    dissipation.</p>
                <p part="N">Juggling is certainly of very great antiquity. The deception of
                    breathing out flames was practised by some of the slaves in Sicily about 150
                    years before the commencement of the Christian era. It is, however, practised in
                    modern times with much greater dexterity. The ancients made use of naphtha, a
                    liquid mineral oil, which kindles when it only approaches a flame. According to
                    Plutarch, Alexander the Great was astonished and delighted with the secret
                    effects of naphtha, which were exhibited to him at Ecbatana. Wonder has been
                    excited in modern times by persons walking over burning coals or red-hot iron;
                    but this is easily done by rendering the skin of the feet callous and
                    insensible, so that the nerves under it are secured from injury. We are told by
                    Beckmann that the Hirpi, who dwelt near Rome, jumped through burning coals; that
                    women were accustomed to walk over burning coals at Castabala, near the temple
                    dedicated to Diana; that the exhibition of cups and balls is often mentioned in
                    the works of the ancients; and that the various feats of horsemanship exhibited
                    in our circuses passed, in the thirteenth century, from Egypt to the Byzantine
                    court, and thence over all Europe.</p>
