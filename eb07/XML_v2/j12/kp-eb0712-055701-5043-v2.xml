                <p part="N"><hi> JESUS</hi>, the Divine Author of the Christian religion, was born
                    at Bethlehem, a city of the tribe of Judah, about six miles south-east from
                    Jerusalem. His mother was a Jewish virgin named Mary, the betrothed wife of
                    Joseph, both in the humblest rank of life, though both of the royal race of
                    David. The date of his birth is not mentioned in the sacred record; and there
                    has been a difference of opinion among the learned who have engaged in the
                    inquiry, respecting the precise period when it took place. It is now, however,
                    generally agreed upon, that it must be fixed a few years earlier than is
                    indicated by the epoch of our era, which, according to the common computation,
                    corresponds with <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> u. 754. We know that Jesus was
                    born before the death of Herod the Great;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    celebrating the festival of Christmas, does not in any way affect the truth of
                    the gospel history; and cannot indeed appear strange, when it is considered that
                    several centuries elapsed before the method of computing time by the birth of
                    Christ was introduced, and that the festival of the nativity was not observed in
                    the primitive church. During the first three centuries, the Christians adopted
                    the ordinary modes of reckoning time, which prevailed among the heathen around
                    them. Different methods were afterwards employed; and it was not till the sixth
                    century that a Roman abbot named Dionysius the Less was induced, by motives of
                    religion, to have recourse to the expedient of determining dates by the number
                    of years from the period when the Son of God was born of a woman. The
                    commemoration of the day of the nativity was not generally observed throughout

                    of this day. Sir Isaac Newton, in his work on Daniel, supposes that it was
                    agreeably to the principle by which the chief feasts were fixed at the cardinal
                    points, without regard to historical accuracy; as the annunciation at the vernal
                    equinox, and St John the Baptist’s day at the summer solstice. Hospinian and
                    others have been of opinion that the festivities connected with the celebration
                    of Christmas were intended to make up for the Saturnalia, conformably to the
                    practice which had been acted upon from an earlier period, of smoothing the way

                    their idolatrous ceremonies under a new form. And there is not wanting reason to
                    suppose, that from the winter solstice being observed as the birth-day of the
                    sun, when that luminary, returning from the south, seemed to be restored to the
                    world, the transition was suggested to the celebration of the birth of him who

                <p part="N">The circumstances connected with the birth of Jesus corresponded in a
                    remarkable degree with the predictions of the Jewish prophets respecting the
                    Messias. He belonged to the tribe of Judah, and was of the house of David.
                    Events, over which .his earthly kindred had no control, fixed his birth at
                    Bethlehem, from which place the promised Deliverer was to spring. The seventy
                    prophetic weeks of Daniel were approaching to their termination. And so
                    determinate were these and other predictions, that a general opinion prevailed,
                    even in heathen countries, that the tide of time was bringing our race to a
                    mighty epoch, and that a prince was to arise in the East who was to obtain the

                    Africa, and connected by the Mediterranean with the whole of Europe, the Jews
                    enjoyed the best opportunities of diffusing the knowledge of their principles.
                    And the intercourse between remote nations, occasioned by the conquests of
                    Alexander and the progress of the Roman arms, afforded increased facilities for
                    propagating new opinions, while it forced upon men’s notice the different forms
                    of national worship, and led to an examination βf the great principles of

                    Jesus while in Egypt, which woere frequently referred to by some of the early
                    philosophic opponents of the Christian faith. The malignant insinuations of
                    Celsus, however, and the absurd legends which long found currency among the
                    Jews, are wholly inconsistent with the authentic narrative of the return from

                <p part="N">In this lowly situation, and in the midst of these servile employments,
                    a character was silently maturing, such as the world had never before witnessed;
                    and those lofty designs were conceived, the accomplishment of which was to give
                    a new impress to the condition of society, and to alter the destiny of our race.
                    Frequent attempts have been made to explain by the operation of natural causes,
                    how, in circumstances so unfavourable, a character like that of our Saviour’s
                    could have arisen; and various theories have been framed respecting the manner
                    in which the plan to which he devoted himself was suggested to his mind. The
                    insufficiency of these attempts we shall afterwards consider. In the mean time,
                    however, it may be remarked, that, though no explanation can be given, from
                    circumstances merely external, of the growth of such a mind as that of Jesus,
                    which must be sought only in the seed of the immortal plant itself, it is by no
                    means inconsistent with the highest ideas that can be entertained of the
                    divinity of his nature, to suppose a progression in the development of his
                    humanity. External influences must to a certain extent modify the character of
                    every man. We are told, accordingly, that “he <hi rend="italic">grew</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">wisdom'</hi> as weH as “stature.” And the commanding situation
                    and romantic beauty of the city of his dwelling, the instructions of his mother,
                    intercourse with the heathen, which, from the proximity of Nazareth to Galilee
                    of the Gentiles, must have been frequent, may have proved among the subordinate’
                    aids for awakening that sense of the loveliness and majesty of external nature
                    to which we find so many references in his discourses, and that susceptibility
                    of every tender emotion which his whole history manifested, and that enlarged
                    philanthropy which looked beyond the distinctions of Jew and Gentile, of sect
                    and class, of rank and station, and considered the whole human race as members
                    of one great family, as children of the same heavenly parent. Such influences,
                    however, are matter of conjecture rather than of positive knowledge; for no
                    reference is made to them by any of the Evangelists. The piety of his mother and
                    of Joseph renders it certain that he would from infancy be made acquainted with
                    the Old Testament Scriptures; and these not only contain the germ of all that is
                    pure and elevating in religious sentiment, but also are, more than any other
                    study, calculated to awaken the curiosity and stimulate the powers of the
                    opening mind. His conversation and discourses everywhere show that he must have
                    made a constant study of the sacred records. It appears that he never attended
                    any rabbinical school, nor did he receive a learned education.<note

                    from heaven declaring him to be the Son of God, and claiming for him the
                    attention of mankind. Immediately after his initiation, he was impelled to
                    retire into the solitudes of a wilderness, with a view, probably, of meditating
                    on the work before him; and, by fasting and prayer, after the example of former
                    prophets, to prepare himself for his great undertaking. A higher purpose was
                    also accomplished during this retirement, an opportunity being afforded him for
                    proving the purity and sinlessness of his nature, and establishing his fitness

                    attached themselves to his cause; of their curiosity, their doubts, their
                    conferences with him, the influence he gained over their minds, and their
                    eagerness to communicate to others the wondrous tidings, that they had found the
                    promised Messias in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. The first two individuals
                    who joined themselves to him were diseiples of John the Baptist, who pointed out
                    Jesus when walking ata little distance, as the “Lamb of God who taketh away the
                    sins of the world.” Upon this they introduced themselves to his notice, and on
                    his invitation accompanied him to the house where he lodged. What took place at
                    this memorable interview, or how a solitary and almost unknown stranger attached
                    to his cause the first two disciples, we are not informed; whether by some token
                    of supernatural knowledge or power, or by the natural influence of a superior
                    mind; the conviction was produced; and with it was imparted the spirit, which
                    was at the foundation of the indefinite extension of the new cause, viz. the
                    desire of imparting their own impressions of the new doctrines to others. One of
                    the two individuals was Andrew, brother of Simon, who afterwards became so
                    eminent in the primitive history of Christianity. “Andrew firstfindeth his own
                    brother, and saith, we have found the Messias; and <hi rend="italic">he brought
                        him to Jesus?</hi> These three were the converts of the first day; and in a
                    short time, without any advantages of birth or station, or human learning,
                    without the aid of powerful relations or influential patrons, he had a
                    considerable number of attached followers, who listened to his teaching, and
                    aeeompanied him from place to place. At the feast of the Passover, along with
                    the rest of his countrymen, Jesus went up to Jerusalem, where he increased the
                    number of his disciples by his doctrines and miracles. He seems to have
                    continued in the land of Judea about six or seven months; when the success of
                    his preaching, exciting the attention and envy of the Scribes and Pharisees, led
                    him to withdraw into Galilee, where the power of the Jewish Sanhedrim was less
                    to be dreaded. In passing through Samaria, where the political circumstances of
                    the inhabitants freed them from some of the prejudices of the Jews<note

                    place, or outward ceremony, the Deity was to be worshipped in purity of spirit,
                    and in faith on the promised Messias.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Saviour’s ministry is derived almost exclusively from John. The other
                            Evangelists confine themselves to his preaching in Galilee, with the

                            crucifixion.</p></note> He then visited the whole of Galilee, everywhere
                    accompanying the instruction he gave, in synagogues, or in private houses, or in
                    the open fields, with miraculous proofs of his divine character and commission.
                    ln Nazareth he was first subjected to personal violence, his townsmen taking
                    offence at his lowly origin. To avoid their malice, he passed on to Capernaum,
                    which henceforth became the place of his general residence, and from which, as
                    from a centre, he visited the whole surrounding country. The first year of his
                    ministry seems to have been attended with almost universal success. He met with
                    no outward obstruction in his work, except in Nazareth; his approach was
                    everywhere welcomed, and increasing multitudes followed him in his progress.</p>
                <p part="N">During the second year of his ministry, his followers became so numerous
                    that he chose twelve persons who might assist him in his work, and be prepared
                    to propagate his religion when he should leave the world. These he named
                    Apostles, an appellation which was appropriated at that time among the Jews to
                    certain public officers who were the ministers of the high priests, and who were
                    occasionally despatehed on missions of importance to foreign parts.<note

                    the twelve tribes, as the seventy whom he afterwards chose might be from the
                    number of the Jewish Sanhedrim. The increasing success of Jesus raised up
                    against him a host of enemies, and from this time he was continually subjected
                    to the eavilsof the Sadducees, and still more of the Scribes and Pharisees,
                    whose objections were of such a nature as might be expected from unprincipled
                    and hypocritical men, who witnessed with jealousy any proceeding likely to
                    diminish their influence among the people, and who were inflamed with resentment
                    at the exposure which was made of their true character.</p>
                <p part="N">It has already been observed that Galilee was the chief scene of our
                    Saviour’s ministerial labours. He did not, however, confine himself wholly to
                    that province, but occasionally visited other parts. We find him at one time on
                    the coasts of Tyre and Sidon; at another beyond Jordan; and at the passover he
                    uniformly went up to Jerusalem. As the Evangelists do not relate events in
                    chronological order, we are without any precise information as to the exact
                    degree of success that from this period attended his labours; it seems probable
                    that his followers continued to increase, and that a deep and general impression
                    was made upon the public mind. His proceedings at last excited the attention of
                    all classes in Judea. Herod Antipas was haunted with the idea that he must be
                    John the Baptist restored to life, and was desirous to have a personal interview
                    with him; and there is not wanting reason to suppose that he received the homage
                    of princes more remote. The eyes of the ehief men of Judea were now upon him.
                    The subject of his miracles was discussed in the Sanhedrim, and frequent
                    attempts were made to seize and bring him before the council, though without any
                    settled purpose, perhaps, how they were to proceed against him. At last, after
                    the restoration of Lazarus to life, whieh led to the conversion <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> a multitude of the Jews, a meeting of the Pharisaic
                    party was held, when it was finally determined that he should be put to death.
                    The resuitis well known. In the dead of the night he was surprised in the midst
                    of his secret devotions, hurried before the Sanhedrim, and, after the mockery of
                    a trial, in which even his judgeaeknowledged his entire innocence, he was
                    adjudged to suffer death. He was then carried to the usual place of execution,
                    on a small hill named Calvary, on the west of Jerusalem, a little without the
                    walls, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945082?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-5082-0560"/> and there he was crucified. This dreadful
                    scene was accompanied with signs and wonders which proclaimed the dignity of the
                    sufferer. A supernatural darknessoverspread the land of Judea, “and behold the
                    veil of the temple was rent in twain, and the earth did quake, and the rocks
                    rent, and the graves were opened.” After his death his body was taken down from
                    the cross, and laid in a tomb hewn out of a rock, after the manner of the Jewish
                    sepulchres. Every precaution was used to prevent the removal of the body by the
                    disciples. A great stone was rolled upon the door of the tomb, and a watch of
                    Roman soldiers, consisting of sixty men, was appointed to guard it. This was on
                    our Friday. The following day was the Jewish Sabbath; the stone remained in its
                    place fixed and secure, and the soldiers continued their watch undisturbed. But
                    on the morning of the third day, amidst a display of supernatural agency that
                    mocked the precautions of the Jewish rulers, Jesus arose from the dead. After
                    this he continued some time on earth, affording the most indubitable evidence of
                    his identity, and of the reality of his resurrection from the dead, and
                    instructing his disciples in the nature of the doctrine they were to teach
                    mankind. At last, at the end of forty days, he led forth his disciples to
                    Bethany, and there, while giving them bis blessing, “he was parted from them,
                    and carried up into heaven.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    extreme points, however, can be mentioned, within which that event must have
                    taken place. The one is the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius,<note

                    other, the year in which that emperor died, when Pilate had left the province of
                    Judea. As Jesus entered upon his ministry soon after the public appearance of
                        John,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">John,

                    approximation to the date sought for, could we say how many pass-overs were
                    celebrated by our Saviour. Even this, however, cannot be determined with
                    certainty. The most probable opinion seems that of those who fix the number at
                    three, and this would bring us to <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> u. 783. Irenaeus
                    states that Jesus was forty or fifty years of age when he was put to death;<note

                    The chief notices of him by the fathers have been embodied in the preceding
                    narrative. There is a passage in Josephus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        3.</p></note> where his life and character are referred to in the following
                    terms: “At that time lived Jesus, a wise man [if he may be called a man], for he
                    performed many wonderful works. He was a teacher of such men as received the
                    truth with pleasure. He drew over to him manv Jews and Gentiles. [This was the
                    Christ.] And when Pilate, at the instigation of the chief men among us, had
                    condemned him to the cross, they who before had conceived an affection for him
                    did not cease to adhere to him [for on the third day he appeared to them alive
                    again, the divine prophets having foretold these and many wonderful things
                    concerning him]. And the sect of the Christians, so called from him, subsists to
                    this time.” This remarkable passage is referred to by Eusebius,<note

                    called in question from his time till the sixteenth century, when Gifanius and
                    Osiander refused to receive it. Since that period it has afforded matter for
                    much controversy among the learned. In favour of the genuineness of the passage,
                    it has been argued, that we have the undisputed fact that it is found in all the
                    copies of the works of Josephus from the time of Eusebius. It also exists in a
                    Hebrew translation in the Vatican; and there is an Arabic version preserved by
                    the Maronites of Mount Libanus. In addition to this external evidence, it is
                    urged that the number of Christians in the time of Josephus was too great to
                    admit of the supposition that he should pass them over altogether unnoticed, an
                    improbability which is increased by the fact that he makes mention of John the
                        Baptist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                                ><hi rend="italic">Antiq.</hi> xviii. 5.</p></note> and of the death

                            9, 1.</p></note> On the other hand, it is certain that Josephus was not

                    the profession of belief in the divine mission of Jesus. It is farther to be
                    remarked, that this testimony in favour of Christ is not quoted by any of the
                    apologists of Christianity who preceded Eusebius; and in particular,
                        Origen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi

                    allusion made by Josephus to the death of James, and to his account of John the
                    Baptist, passes over in silence the passage in question, though it would have
                    afforded a more decisive answer had it been contained in the copies of the
                    Jewish historian then in circulation. The arguments on both sides appear
                    plausible, and the difficulties upon either supposition cannot perhaps be
                    removed but by the conjecture, that Josephus did introduce into his work a
                    notice of Jesus, though without admitting him to be the Messias, and that some
                    over-zealous Christian about the time of Eusebius had inserted some additional
                    clauses. This opinion is now generally gone into by the continental critics.

                <p part="N">It was scarcely possible that the appearance of so remarkable a
                    character as that of our Saviour should not have induced many individuals, from
                    various motives, to commit an account of him to writing. Accordingly, it
                        appears,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Luke, i. 1.</p></note> that from the earliest period many histories of
                    his life were in circulation. The words of St Luke seem to imply that these
                    narratives were.defective or erroneous; but there is nothing to prevent us from
                    supposing that some of them might be the productions of men of good intentions,
                    though deficient in the talents or information requisite for so important an
                    undertaking. It was otherwise, however, in succeeding times. After the four
                    gospels had been written by the Evangelists, and had been generally received as
                    of divine authority in the Christian church, heretics and others, who departed
                    from the true faith, had recourse to the expedient of forging gospels, epistles,
                    &amp;c. under the name of some of the apostles, or that of our Lord himself, to
                    which they might refer in support of their tenets. These works were frequently
                    formed out of the genuine gospels, with such additions and omissions as the
                    purposes of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945095?mode=fullsize"

                    members of the true church who followed the same practice, with the mistaken
                    idea that the piety of the faithful might thus be promoted, or that an answer
                    might be afforded to some of the objections of Jews and Heathens. In the second
                    century, Irenaeus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    that the Gnostics had an innumerable multitude of spurious and apoeryphal books;
                    and in the following age they were greatly inereased. The greater part of these
                    writings perished in the eourse of ages. Of such of them as remained, a
                    collection was published by Fabricius, about the beginning of last eentury, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Apocryphus</hi><hi

                    them is given, with translations, in Jones’well-known work on the Canon. Several

                <p part="N">That these works are not to be received as genuine, may be proved by
                    their vast inferiority to the canonical gospels, and still more decidedly by the
                    faet, that they were not recognised by the Fathers. In <hi rend="italic">The

                    ranked by them among the inspired writings. It is worthy of remark, that it was

                    of the East in general concerning our Lord are all from apocryphal sources.<note

                    who had heard of the miraeles of Jesus, and who requested him to come and cure
                    him of a malady with which he was afflicted. It is added, that our Saviour wrote
                    to him a letter, in which he promised to send one of his disciples to heal him.
                    A translation of this correspondence from the Syriac original, contained in the
                    arehives of the ehureh of Edessa, is given by Eusebius. Additions were
                    afterwards made to the story,— as that Thaddeus, one of the seventy, was deputed
                    by Thomas, after the resurrection, to fulfil the promise of the Saviour; and
                        Evagrius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                                ><hi rend="superscript"> Eva</hi> g. iv. 26.</p></note> mentions,
                    that our Lord not only wrote a letter, but that he sent a handkerchief also,
                    with his picture drawn upon it. There ean be no doubt that the letters mentioned
                    by Eusebius actually existed among the records of Edessa, and that they were
                    seen by that historian. But, in addition to the external evidence from the
                    letters themselves, the fact that they are taken notice of by no preceding
                    Christian writer affords demonstration that they are forgeries, which owe their
                    existence probably to the national vanity of some of the early Christians of
                    Edessa. We are not informed that our Saviour ever committed anything to writing,
                    and we may be assured that if he had, it would not have passed unnoticed by his
                    first followers.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another statement contained in Eusebius, deserving of more
                    attention. He mentions that Pontius Pilate, after the crucifixion of our Lord,
                    wrote such an account of his character and miracles to the Emperor Tiberius, as
                    induced that prince to propose to the senate that a plaee should be assigned to
                    Jesus among the deities worshipped by the Romans, but that the senate opposed
                    the wishes of the emperor. It was certainly the custom of the governors of
                    provinces to write memoirs of the remarkable occurrences of the plaees where
                    they presided; and there is nothing improbable in the idea that Pilate, who was
                    convinced of the innocence of Christ, should send an account of him to Tiberius.
                    It is certain also that Justin Martyr,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his Apology for the Christians, presented to the Emperor Antoninus Pius, refers
                    to the aets of Pilate, as containing an account of the eireumstances connected
                    with the crucifixion; and Tertullian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    records. Still, however, we conceive that the evidence for the existence of
                    these acts is defective; and the proposal alluded to by Tiberius to the Roman
                    senate, though mentioned by Tertullian, and repeated by writers who succeeded
                    him, is irreconcilable with the character of Tiberius, and the state of the
                    Roman empire at that period. At a later period, a spurious work, entitled <hi

                    among them that there was a mystic word which enabled those who had learned it

                    saered word, by pronouncing which he performed miraeles at will, healed the

                    gained over many converts, and would have been still more suecessful had not
                    another Jew disabused the minds of his countrymen by learning the same word, and
                    disclosing to the people how the same miracles eould be performed. The work
                    terminates with an account of the death of Jesus, and of his body being stolen
                    away by his diseiples. It was published, with a Latin translation and learned

                    correct by many who refuse to acknowledge the truth of our religion. The

                    been called in question. Even the miracles were admitted by the earliest
                    opponents of Christianity, Celsus, Philostratus, and Hierocles. These
                    individuals did not deny the reality oí the works performed by Jesus; they only,
                    upon internal evidence, objected to the idea that a person in circumstances so
                    lowly should be supposed to be divine, or explained away the supernatural

                    the Evangelists, have rejected altogether the supernatural machinery. In setting
                    aside the miraculous part of the gospel history, the chief difficulty has been
                    found in giving a consistent view of the character of Jesus. If the miracles
                    performed by Christ were not real, the conclusion seems irresistible that he
                    must have been either a deliberate impostor, or a self-dc-ceived enthusiast. By
                    some writers, accordingly, Jesus has been held up to ridicule and contempt, as
                    exhibiting many weaknesses, and even vices—as a pretended miracleworker and
                    false prophet. Several of the deistical writers of our own country took up this
                    position, and were followed by Voltaire and other French authors. The

                <p part="N">The notices of the English deists of the last century, respecting the
                    miracles and character of Jesus, in many instances at least, were little more
                    than incidental, and formed merely a part of their general argument against the
                    truth of our religion. In Germany the work has been more systematically pursued.
                    With the characteristic industry of that learned people, the writings of the
                    Evangelists have been considered in every possible form. Different theories have
                    been framed as to the secret views of Jesus, as to the real causes of his
                    success, and as to the true character of the alleged miracles which were
                    performed. Voltaire, after our English authors, had endeavoured to account for
                    the exalted morality taught by Jesus, by supposing that it was borrowed from the
                    self-denying tenets of the sect of the Essenes.<note anchored="true"

                    Alexandrian Pla-tunists, and the liberal spirit of Sadduceism, were referred to
                    by others as sufficient to originate in an enthusiastic mind the system taught
                    by Jesus. Some, like Edelmann, while they have not disputed that a virtuous Jew
                    named Jesus actually existed, have refused to acknowledge the genuineness and
                    authenticity of the Gospels. 1leimarus, in a posthumous tract<note

                            as an able critic, and the author of a work on natural religion. He was
                            born at Hamburg in 1694, and died in 1765. He published nothing
                            respecting his views as to the subject of revealed religion during his
                            life, but he left various manuscripts of an anti-christian character,
                            some of which falling into the hands of Lessing, who at that time had
                            the superintendence of the ducal library at Wolfenbiittel, were
                            published by him in the <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur Geschichte und

                            than any other work, led to the neologian spirit that has since so much
                            prevailed in Germany. Various answers were called forth. Of these, by
                            far the ablest was that by Reinhard, a celebrated German preacher, in a

                            entered into no other religious system; proves Jesus to have been a
                            messenger sent by God. This work by Reinhard is one of the most valuable
                            contributions to 'the evidences of the truth of Christianity. It has

                    acknowledges the excellence of the morals, and even of the doctrines, of the
                    Gospel, accuses Jesus of not observing the rules which he prescribed, and of
                    making use of his system as a means for promoting his political views; and while
                    he does justice to many of the high qualities of Jcsus, he represents him, upon
                    the whole, as actuated by ambition, and as aiming at the establishment of his
                    own power under the character of the triumphant conqueror to whom the Jews
                    looked forward in their promised Messias. His arguments are chiefly founded upon
                    the acknowledged ideas of the Jewish people respecting the Messias, upon the
                    caution exhibited by Jesus in arrogating that character, and upon his entering
                    Jerusalem in royal state, when be conceived that his cause was sufficiently
                    advanced to insure his success; while the grief he exhibited in the garden of
                    Gethsemane, and his exclamation on the cross, “My God, my God, why hast thou
                    forsaken me ?” are considered as tokens of his disappointed hopes. This view has
                    been taken by other writers, with various minor modifications, and with
                    different degrees of learning and presumption. Others have represented Jesus as
                    the dupe of his own imagination,—as one who, by the dreams of a fond mother, and
                    the workings of an unrestrained fancy, was led to believe himself to be the
                    Messias; and who, partly by his superior knowledge of the occult qualities of
                    matter, and partly by the sympathetic influence of a highly-wrought enthusiasm,
                    favoured occasionallyby accidental circumstances, performed many works that
                    seemed to exceed the limits of natural causes, which were afterwards exaggerated
                    into real miracles. Another class of the neologian school describe Christ as a
                    pure and exalted character, who was animated with the desire of raising the
                    condition of his degraded countrymen, and of promoting the general interests of
                    humanity; and who, in the lowly situation in which he was placed, found no other
                    means of accomplishing this end but by personating the character of the Jewish
                    Messias. As the Jews expected miracles to be performed by their long-looked-for
                    Saviour, Jesus accommodated himself to their views in this respect. According to
                    this class of writers, he is supposed sometimes to have availed himself of
                    fortunate contingencies, representing the restoration from a faint as a
                    resurrection from the dead, as in the case of the daughter of Jairus, and of
                    Lazarus, and sometimes to have succeeded, perhaps beyond his own expectations,
                    by the aids of animal magnetism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    for a few hours was insufficient to occasion death, though in a worn-out frame
                    it might occasion a temporary swoon, from which he might be restored by the
                    myrrh and aloesand odoriferous substances which his disciples brought to embalm

                            Heidelberg, who conceives that his opinion is strengthened by an attempt
                            to prove (which he has endeavoured to do in a separate tract upon the
                            subject) that only the hands of Jesus were nailed to the cross, his feet
                            being merely bound to it by a strong cord. But even supposing this to
                            have been the case, which we consider as by no means established, the
                            evidence of actual dissolution is decisive. ΛVe have in the first place

                            with a spear, which, from the account given of it, must have entered the
                            heart itself (v. 34.)</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">In regard to the theory which is founded on the idea that Jesus was
                    actuated by selfish or worldly or ambitious motives, it may safely be affirmed
                    that it is altogether inconsistent with the facts connected with every part of
                    his history. The whole tenor of his proceedings showed that his views were above
                    this world. He used none of the arts necessary for gaining a party among his
                    countrymen. He did not flatter one sect at the expense of another. He neither
                    courted the favour of his countrymen, by inflaming their prejudices against the
                    Romans, on the one hand; nor did he, on the other hand, artfully conciliate the
                    favour of the Romans to be employed as a means towards attaining the sovereignty
                    of Judea. He openly denounced the vices of the reigning sects; and though his
                    benevolence led him to such a course of conduct as could not but excite the
                    admiration of many among the lower orders, he made no attempt to render his
                    popularity subservient to his personal interests; he shunned the demonstrations
                    of popular favour, and unsparingly exposed the unworthy motives that led many to
                    pay court to him. Not a single instance can be mentioned in which he had
                    recourse to any means for establishing a temporal authority. His whole conduct
                    showed that he was animated with more exalted aims. From the commencement of his
                    ministry he asserted his divine commission, and spoke with undoubting confidence
                    of the success of his cause. But the success of which he spoke was not in
                    schemes of worldly greatness, but in the diffusion of truth and righteousness.
                    He availed himself of every suitable opportunity for correcting the erroneous
                    impressions that were entertained respecting the character of the Messias. And
                    so far was he from entertaining views of personal aggrandisement in the
                    character he assumed, that from the very first he intimated that the good he was
                    to render to mankind was to be procured by laying down his life for them. And
                    the tenor of the evangelical history proves, that in proportion to the
                    increasing clearness with which he communicated to his chosen followers the
                    information as to his divine character, was the expressness of his declaration
                    that his death was at hand.</p>
                <p part="N">There is only a single instance that can be adduced in which there was
                    any appearance on the part of Jesus, of the assumption of temporal authority,
                    viz. in the case of his last entrance into Jerusalem. This has been represented
                    by Reimarus as an unsuccessful attempt made by him, counting upon the support of
                    the populace, to take possession of the temple and of the city. But such a view
                    is inconsistent, not only with the proceedings of Jesus upon former occasions,
                    but also with his conduct in Jerusalem at that very period. There was no concert
                    between the people and Jesus or his apostles. The city of Jerusalem was filled
                    with strangers from all parts, who had come up to attend the passover; the
                    report of the resurrection of Lazarus had been widely circulated; when Jesus
                    approached, curiosity assembled multitudes to behold him, and, in the enthusiasm
                    of the moment, they rendered homage to him as a king. But Jesus did not avail
                    himself of the feeling that was excited. He addressed to the multitude nothing
                    calculated to rouse their passions. The jealousy of the Roman governor,

                    alarm at the approach of the procession to the temple, and Pilate made no
                    allusion to it when Jesus was brought before his tribunal. The same day that
                    Jesus entered into the temple he voluntarily left it for Bethany, though it is
                    obvious, that if he had entertained the views ascribed to him, he would have
                    availed himself of the advantages it presented to him, as the citadel that
                    commanded the whole of Jerusalem.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as could not fail to rouse those vengeful feelings of which he had foretold that
                    he was to be the unresisting victim.</p>
                <p part="N">The attempt to prove that Jesus was merely an ambitious adventurer is
                    now generally abandoned. But many, while they admit the excellence of the
                    personal character of Christ, endeavour to account for the supernatural parts of
                    the gospel history on what is called the principle of accommodation, supposing
                    that Jesus suited his proceedings to the expectations of the Jews respecting the
                    miraculous power of their Messias. But to act upon such a principle is surely
                    inconsistent with the simplicity and integrity of a spotless character. It is
                    admitted by the defenders of the hypothesis referred to, that we have in Jesus
                    Christ a character which stands single and alone in the history of mankind, free
                    from any defect, and combining every species of excellence. We have this same
                    Jesus, without advantage of education or outward condition, introducing a system
                    of religion and morals such as the world had never witnessed; the only system of
                    positive religion that does not bear on its face evidence of its falseness; a
                    system to which the most enlightened men in every age since its first
                    propagation have yielded their homage; and a system of ηnorals so pure in its
                    nature, and so comprehensive in its requirements, that while the most
                    extraordinary progress has been made in every other subject, it might easily be
                    proved that all that ethical inquirers have attempted is an analysis of the
                    principles of our nature, on which the rules of the New Testament are founded,
                    or an application of these rules to the circumstances of mankind in new
                    conditions of society. If such a sjstem had been originated by an individual who
                    made no claim to supernatural assistance, we would have been presented with a
                    moral phenomenon altogether inexplicable. But this is not the state in which we
                    find the question. Jesus declares that he received from God all that he reveals
                    to man. Had he offered no proof of this assertion, his moral qualities, even
                    supposing him to have been in error, might have remained unimpeached, and he
                    might have moved our compassionate respect, as the self-deceived enthusiast of
                    virtue or religion. But our Saviour not only demands credence on his own
                    authority; he makes an appeal<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">John xiv. 11.</p></note> to the miracles which
                    he wrought, in proof of his divine mission. Now, the miracles which our Saviour
                    refers to are of such a nature, that either they must have been performed or he
                    must have lent himself to a deceit. There is no other alternative. He could not
                    but know whether they were actually wrought, or whether they <pb break="no"

                    seeming and illusory. And if the miracles were not truly performed, then we have
                    the individual whose moral character stands in all other respects higher than
                    that of any other of the children of men, and who was made the instrument of
                    conferring the greatest boon that ever was made to mankind,—we have that
                    individual guilty of an artful and criminal imposture.</p>
                <p part="N">In regard to the theory that the apostles filled up the picture of the
                    character of Jesus from what they read in the Ohl Testament Scriptures
                    respecting the Messias, it may be remarked, that the conception of such a
                    character in such circumstances is a phenomenon as inexplicable upon ordinary
                    principles as the actual existence of the prototype. And that four different
                    writers, or that even two different writers, without having a common subject,
                    should have given so many points of resemblance of such an extraordinary natπre,
                    and in so many varied circumstances, is altogether incredible.</p>
                <p part="N">Among those who admit the divine commission of Jesus, different opinions
                    have been entertained as to the rank he holds in the scale of being. The general
                    doctrine of the Christian church, as expressed in ancient creeds and in the
                    confessions of reformed churches, is, that Christ exhibited in his person a
                    union of the divine and human nature; that the second person in the Trinity was
                    united to the man Jesus, who was God and man in one person. To avoid the
                    difficulties which have been supposed to be involved in this mysterious
                    doctrine, it has been maintained by some that the Son is not equal with the
                    Father, and did not exist from eternity, but that the first created being, the
                    highest angelic nature, was made flesh and dwelt on earth. The essence of this
                    theory is, that the Son of God was a <hi rend="italic">creature,</hi> but that
                    he existed in a separate state previously to his manifestation in the form of
                    man. It is variously modified according to the higher or lower character that is
                    given to the Son of God; and is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arianism,</hi> from the individual who in the early part of the fourth
                    century first brought the question into general discussion. According to a third
                    class, Jesus Christ was a mere man, distinguished from other men only by being
                    employed by God in making a revelation of his will to mankind, and superior in
                    no respect to the prophets who appeared among the Jewish people, except in
                    superior virtue, and in a more enlarged measure of divine countenance and
                    assistance. This view, in its essential features, was embraced by the Ebionites,
                    and also by Artemon and others during the second and third centuries; by Socinus
                    in the sixteenth century, from whose name those who adopt this opinion are
                    frequently named <hi rend="italic">Socinians,</hi> though they assume to
                    themselves the name of <hi rend="italic">Unitarians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    a title which is sometimes conceded by Trinitarians for the sake of distinction,
                    though they equally hold the doctrine of the unity of the Deity. In America the
                    name Unitarian is applied to all those who reject the doctrine of the Trinity.
                    The differences of opinion respecting the person of Christ are connected with
                    different views as to the object and nature of his commission. Trinitarians
                    consider him as not only teaching a purer system of morality than the world had
                    before known, but also as making an atonement for human guilt by his death;
                    while Socinians and many Arians deny the doctrine of the atonement, and look
                    upon Jesus merely as a teacher of religion and virtue.</p>
                <p part="N">The character of Christ, as exhibited in the Gospels, presents to us the
                    only example, anywhere to be found of the perfection of humanity; and the
                    contemplation of it has ever been considered by his followers as one of the most
                    edifying and delightful exercises of piety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">A catalogue of some of the most important
                            treatises upon this subject in English is given by Bishop Newcombe, in

                    A constant regard to the will of God, and a delight in doing it, form the
                    distinguishing features of his character. With this was connected the absence of
                    all sordid, or selfish, or ambitious aims, and an enlarged and enlightened
                    philanthropy. There is perhaps nothing more remarkable in the life of Jesus than
                    the apparently inconsistent qualities which are blended together in one
                    harmonious whole. We see in him the most unbending constancy united with great
                    tenderness of feeling—hatred of sin, and compassion for the offender—a heart
                    superior to all the allurements of pleasure, with a condescending indulgence for
                    the innocent relaxations of life—a mind of universal philanthropy, alive to all
                    the domestic charities·—views that extended to the whole human race, and a
                    generous compliance with national and individual peculiarities. It is difficult
                    to conceive that the portraiture presented to us in the sacred history can be
                    contemplated without benefit; but the chief benefit will be lost if it is
                    forgotten that he whose life was the model of every virtue laid down that life
                    for the sins of the world.</p>
                <p part="N">Those who hold the highest ideas of the divinity of Christ, admit to the
                    fullest extent that he was also man; and the curiosity is not unnatural as to
                    the personal appearance assumed by the Son of God. Upon this subject no direct
                    information is given in the New Testament. From incidental notices, it has been
                    conjectured that he was of a robust frame, and that there was nothing
                    particularly marked in his appearance;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">John, XX. 15, and xxi.∙</p></note> but it may
                    be doubted how far the passages referred to bear out these conclusions. There is
                    better evidence that the mixture of divine benignity and commanding authority
                    which he everywhere displayed in his character, were conspicuous also in his
                    voice and aspect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">The most judicious of the fathers agree that nothing was known of the
                    personal appearance of Christ, though inquiry upon the subject was not
                    prohibited. During the first ages of Christianity, the church, under
                    persecution, required a model of patient endurance; and the general opinion of
                    the fathers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    time seems to have been, that the personal appearance of Christ corresponded
                    literally with the description in Isaiah, liii. 2, 3. There was at the same time
                    a prohibition, founded on the second commandment, against attempting to frame
                    any pictorial likeness of the Son of God. We read, however, of pictures of
                    Christ in the hands of one of the Gnostic sects.<note anchored="true"

                    admitted into churches, the attempt to present a likeness of Christ was no
                    longer considered as unlawful; and full scope being given to the imagination of
                    the artist, attempts were made to embody the purity, and elevation, and
                    loveliness of the Saviour’s character, in lineaments of extraordinary beauty.
                    Certain theologians justified the attempt by explaining the description in Psalm
                    xlv. as literally applicable to Jesus. There is a minute description of the
                    personal appearance of Christ by the Greek ecclesiastical historian Nicephorus,
                    who flourished about the year 1330; and another in a letter purporting to be
                    addressed by Publius Lentulus, governor of Judea, to the Roman senate. Both of
                    these, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945147?mode=fullsize"

                        <hi rend="italic">prosopo-graρhia</hi> in the pretended letter of Publius is
                    from time to time brought before the public in various forms, without any hint
                    as to its real origin, it may be proper to state, that there is most decisive
                    evidence of its being a mere fabrication. No trace of it is to be found before
                    the fourteenth century. No such person as Publius Lentulus was ever governor of
                    Judea. From the style, it is probable that it was written by some monk in the
                    middle ages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >There are several manuscripts of this epistle, none of them, however,
                            older than the fourteenth century. One of these was brought forward
                            about twenty years ago as newly discovered in the library of the
                            Vatican, and treated as a matter of much importance. The subject was
                            taken up in a work entitled “In <hi rend="italic">àvSwna.</hi> Epistoìae

                    having been sent to the king of Edessa, there was another supposed to have been
                    imprinted upon a handkerchief belonging to Veronica. The legend is, that when
                    Christ was led to crucifixion, Veronica, who followed him, put a handkerchief to
                    his face, on which Christ impressed his likeness. This holy relic is still

                    picture of Christ by St Luke, and that there was an image of him cut out by
                    Nicodemus in cedar wood; but these traditions are without support from
                    antiquity, and inconsistent with many passages in the writings of the fathers. A
                    general resemblance is to be observed in all the pictures of the Saviour; but
                    though this has probably arisen from admiration of one traditional model, there
                    is no evidence whatever of its genuineness. After all our inquiries, while we
                    are warranted in supposing that the benignant majesty which distinguished his
                    character beamed forth in his countenance, yet, in regard to any thing more
                    definite, we must rest in the conclusion of St Austin, “qua fuerit ille facie
