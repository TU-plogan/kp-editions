                    celebrated Roman satirist, respecting whose personal history only a few scanty
                    notices have been preserved, chiefly in a life of the poet usually ascribed to
                    Suetonius. Juvenal was a native of Aquinum, now Aquino, a city of Latium, on the
                    Via Latina, a few miles from the left bank of the Liris; but whether he was the
                    son of a freeman by birth or by adoption, is a point which cannot now be
                    decided. Neither is the exact date of his birth or death known, though it seems
                    most consonant to the other facts stated respecting him, to conclude that he
                    must have been born about <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 42, in the reign of
                    the Emperor Claudius. Some have believed him to have been the pupil of
                    Quintilian, and Fronto, the preceptor of the two Antonines; but the time during
                    which they flourished disproves this supposition. Juvenal seems to have pursued
                    in his early years the study of rhetoric with much ardour, more as a recreation
                    than with the view of employing it in the practical affairs of the forum; and it
                    was not until he was far advanced in years that his genius for poetry fully
                    developed itself. It is said that a passage in one of his Satires (vii. 87-92),
                    which lashes with an unsparing hand the court of Domitian, was thought by the
                    favourite of the day to aim indirectly at the conduct of Hadrian; and the
                    emperor marked his displeasure by banishment from Rome to the most remote
                    district of Egypt, though under the pretext of an appointment as <hi

                    reached his eightieth year, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 121, and his age was
                    not suited to bear a change of climate or the fatigues of a camp. He is said to
                    have died in Egypt, though some make him return to Italy.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the works of Juvenal we possess a collection of sixteen satires,
                    divided by grammarians into five books. The last satire is considered by some as
                    not being the production of Juvenal. They were notwritten and published in the
                    same order in which we now possess them. The character of the Satires of Juvenal
                    is very different from that of the Satires of Horace. Whilst Horace laughs in a
                    good-natured tone at the follies of mankind, Juvenal pursues their crimes with
                    all the unmitigated bitterness of scorn. The picture which he at times presents,
                    is so hideous, that the mind revolts at its contemplation; and it is impossible
                    not to believe but the same effect might have been produced if the poet had been
                    somewhat less minute in his details. The corruption of manners which had at this
                    time pervaded every class of the Romans, was certainly of the most revolting
                    kind, and supplied ample materials for the pen of the satirist. Yet there is an
                    exaggerated tone, and an air of rhetorical declamation, throughout his satires,
                    which lessen greatly their effect. This is also the fault to be found with all
                    the writings of his age, produced evidently by a desire of astonishing the
                    imagination with bold and novel descriptions. The first edition of Juvenal was
                    probably that published along with Persius, at Rome, 1470. The best is that of
                    Ruperti, Lips. 1801, which has often been reprinted. It has been translated into
                    English by Holyday, Oxf. 1616, 1673; by Stapleton, six Satires, Oxf. 1644; by
                    Dryden, Lond. 1697; by Owen, Lond. 1785; and by Madan, Lond. 1789. The best
                    translation into French is said to be that of Dusaulx, Paris, 1770, 1816, 5th
                    ed., or of Raoul - Rochette, Paris, 1812.</p>
