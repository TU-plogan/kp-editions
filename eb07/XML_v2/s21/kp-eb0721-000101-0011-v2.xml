                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SURVEYING</label>.</p>
                <p part="N">THE system of rules and operations by which the relative position of any
                    number of points in a tract of country may be determined, so that it may be
                    delineated on a plane surface, is called surveying. When the extent of country
                    is not great, the subject involves little difficulty; but when a kingdom, such
                    as Britain or France, is to be surveyed, in addition to some of the more
                    profound theories of pure mathematics, the aid of astronomy, and other branches
                    of natural philosophy, is required; but such an extensive view of the subject
                    will not be expected in this work.</p>
                <p part="N">As a surveyor has perpetual occasion for calculation, it is necessary
                    that he be thoroughly master of arithmetic, and understand the nature of
                    logarithms, the use of logarithmic tables, and algebraic notation. As it is his
                    business to investigate and measure lines and angles, and to describe them on
                    paper, he should be well acquainted with the elements of geometry and
                    trigonometry, and with the application of their principles to the mensuration of
                    heights, distances, and surfaces. In particular, he should be familiar with the
                    best practical methods of solving the ordinary geometrical problems, and should
                    be expert in drawing lines and describing figures. He should know something of

                    drawing and painting.</p>
                <p part="N">In a survey, the most remarkable objects, such as the summits of hills,
                    spires, towers, &amp;c. must be chosen as stations, and, if necessary, marked by
                    signals. These must be considered as joined by straight lines forming a chain of
                    triangles, each connected with all the others. The angles of the triangles
                    should neither be very acute nor very obtuse; their sides should be as long as
                    possible, so as to admit of two of the stations, at the angles, being seen from
                    the third: the nearer each triangle approaches to the equilateral form, the
                    better. The three angles of each triangle should be measured, if possible, for
                    although two of them be sufficient to determine the third, yet it will conduce
                    to accuracy if all the three be taken; and if their sum hardly differ from 180°,
                    it may be supposed that they have been correctly determined. The principal
                    points should also be intersected as much as possible by lines from different
                    stations, to ascertain whether different data give the same position.</p>
                <p part="N">A theodolite is the most convenient instrument for measuring the angles,
                    because it gives them at once reduced to the plane of the horizon. When a
                    sextant is used, the angles, if out of that plane, must be reduced to it by
                    calculation.</p>
                <p part="N">Supposing a proper disposition of the triangles to have been made, when
                    their angles are known, if a side of any one of them were also known, then the
                    sides of all the others might be found by calculation, and a plan of the country
                    constructed. Therefore, a side of one of the triangles must be taken as a base,
                    and measured with great care, for upon this the just determination of the
                    absolute length of all the other lines depends; and if the survey be extensive,
                    it will be proper to assume another base, called a base of verification, and
                    compare its measured with its calculated length. The base should be as long as
                    possible, and lie on a flat surface; if it is not perfectly level, its slope
                    must be measured, and its horizontal length calculated. In ordinary cases, the
                    base may be measured by a chain or tape, but more accurately by stretching a
                    rope, 100 yards or more, tight in its direction, and applying repeatedly to it a
                    twenty-feet deal-rod. A pin may be stuck in the rope at the fore-end of the rod,
                    each time it is removed, and before the rope is removed to a new position: a
                    point directly under the end of the last rod may be marked on the top of a peg
                    fixed in the ground. In the trigonometrical survey of Britain, which has been
                    going on ever since 1784, under the direction of the Board of Ordnance, an
                    original base of about five miles was measured three times over, first with
                    twenty-feet deal-rods, then with glass rods of the same length, and at a later
                    period by a hundred feet steel chain of a particular construction. Several bases
                    of verification have<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=12" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0012-0002"
                    /> also been measured. The labour and ingenuity exerted in these operations have
                    been very great.</p>
                <p part="N">As, generally speaking, all bodies expand by heat and contract by cold,
                    a rod or chain varies in absolute length as it varies in temperature. A steel
                    rod at the temperature of water boiling is the one thousandth part longer than
                    at the temperature of water freezing. Hence, when great accuracy is required,
                    the temperature of the measure must be noted, that its precise length may be
                    known.</p>
                <p part="N">When the sides of the primary triangles are known, they serve as bases
                    by which the situation of objects near them may be determined. In this way, the
                    position of any number of points in a road, or the course of a river, also the
                    situation of towns, country-seats, the boundaries of enclosures, and every
                    feature of a country, may be found, and laid down in a plan or map: and to
                    construct it with accuracy, the principal points should be laid down by their
                    calculated distances from each other, rather than by the measures of the angles
                    formed by the lines joining them, because a point may be more correctly laid
                    down by the intersection of two arcs of circles, than by that of lines which
                    make given angles with a third line.</p>
                <p part="N">A small extent of the earth’s surface may be regarded as a plane, and
                    lines perpendicular to it as parallel to one another. However, in an extensive
                    survey, such as that of Britain, the curvature of the earth must be taken into
                    account, and then its figure and magnitude enter as elements into all the
                    calculations.</p>
                <p part="N">This connection between the figure of the earth and the magnitude and
                    position of lines traced on its surface affords, reversely, the means of
                    determining the former when the latter are known: so that such surveys, besides
                    their immediate object, are applicable to the solution of the still more sublime
                    problem of finding the magnitude and figure of the earth itself.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of Terrestrial Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It is a matter of experience, that the rays of light proceeding from the
                    heavenly bodies are bent from their original rectilineal direction in passing
                    through the atmosphere. A ray in its progress may be considered as passing
                    through a very great number of thin <hi rend="italic">strata</hi> of air, which
                    are denser the nearer they are to the earth; and these, by their action on the
                    particles of light, bend the ray downwards, so that, in fact, its path is a
                    curve line concave towards the earth, and situated in a vertical plane passing
                    through the luminous object and the eye of the observer.</p>
                <p part="N">To understand the nature of this effect, let AB (fig. 1) represent a
                    portion of the earth’s surface, and DFG the upper boundary of the atmosphere: a
                    succession of particles of light from the sun or a star S, proceed on a straight
                    line, until they arrive at F; afterwards, in their passage through the
                    atmosphere, their path is gradually bent into the curve FE, so that when they
                    reach the eye at E, the object S appears as if it were at S', in the direction
                    of a straight line which touches the curve at E.</p>
                <p part="N">This bending of the ray is called <hi rend="italic">refraction;</hi> it
                    increases the apparent elevation of the heavenly bodies above the horizon,
                    except when they are in the zenith, and in that position there is no
                    refraction.</p>
                <p part="N">The rays of light, by which terrestrial objects are rendered visible,
                    are, in their passage through the atmosphere, bent downwards, exactly as those
                    proceeding from the heavenly bodies; so that the apparent elevation of a remote
                    object is always greater than its true elevation. This incurvation is called <hi
                        rend="italic">terrestrial refraction;</hi> in the case of the heavenly
                    bodies, it is <hi rend="italic">astronomical</hi> refraction.</p>
                <p part="N">Terrestrial refraction varies with the state of the atmosphere, so that
                    an object appears more elevated at one time than at another: the displacement,
                    however, is always in a vertical plane, but never sensibly in a horizontal
                    direction. How it may be found for any case will appear from the following
                    problem.</p>

                    join AB; then the true zenith distance of B, as seen from A, is the angle ZAB,
                    and the true zenith distance of A, as seen from B, is the angle VBA. These,
                    however, cannot be directly measured, for, by refraction, the point B, as seen
                    from A, appears elevated to the position <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> and the point

                    great accuracy in a plan, independently of the others: also the distance between

                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of Surveying with a compass.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">When a tract of country is to be surveyed with expedition, and no great
                    degree of accuracy is required, the compass, notwithstanding its imperfections,
                    is preferable to any other instrument. Even in a correct survey, it may be
                    applied with advantage in filling up the less important parts of a plan.</p>
                <p part="N">The principle which renders the compass applicable to surveying is
                    generally known. The instrument should admit of being fixed in a horizontal
                    position on the top of a staff, and it should be furnished with two sights
                    diametrically opposite to each other. The circumference of a circle immediately
                    under or opposite to the point of the needle should be divided into degrees, and
                    it may be numbered both ways, beginning from the extremities of the diameter
                    that passes through the sights; or it may be numbered all one way from 0° to
                    360°, beginning at a point immediately under one of the sights.</p>
                <p part="N">The use of the instrument is to determine the bearings of objects as
                    seen from each other, or the angles which the lines joining them make with the
                    magnetic meridian. Thus, if the perimeter of a polygon is to be surveyed and
                    laid down on paper, the instrument must be placed at one of its angles, so that
                    an object at the next angle may be seen through the two sights. The needle of
                    the compass being then allowed to turn freely on its pivot, it will settle in
                    the magnetic meridian, and point out on the divided circle the number of degrees
                    the line deviates from the north or south and on which side of the meridian it
                    lies. If this be done at each angle, the positions of all the lines in respect
                    of the magnetic meridians passing through their intersections will be
                    determined. The sides of the polygon may be measured in passing from one angle
                    to another; and then, as the meridians may be supposed parallels, sufficient
                    data will be obtained for constructing a plan of the figure, and verifying the
                    accuracy of the survey; for any angle of the figure will manifestly be equal to
                    the sum or difference of the angles which the lines that contain it make with
                    the meridian passing through their intersection, according as they lie on
                    opposite sides or the same side of that meridian.<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=17" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0017-0007"
                    /> All the angles of the figure may therefore be found; and, if they have been
                    accurately observed, their sum, together with four right angles, will make twice
                    as many right angles as th figure has sides <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 21,
                    1). If the survey begin and end at the same point, the positions of the
                    beginning and end ought to coincide in the plan.</p>
                <p part="N">If the lines which join the objects do not form an enclosed figure,
                    still the manner of proceeding may be the very same; and the positions of many
                    points may be determined by observing their bearings from other points having
                    given positions in the plan, without the trouble of measuring distances on the
                    ground; and, in the whole process, the compass serves merely as an instrument
                    for measuring angles.</p>
                <p part="N">In practice, the figure may be constructed in the field, or else a mode
                    of registering the observations may be easily devised, from which a plan may be
                    afterwards made; and it may prevent mistakes, if the bearings of all the objects
                    be reckoned from the north quite round the circle in one direction, either to
                    the right or left. Thus, proceeding to the right, we may consider all lines on
                    the east side of the meridian between due north and due south as making with it
                    angles between 0° and 180°, and all lines on the west side between due south and
                    due north as making angles between 180° and 360°.</p>
                <p part="N">It must be recollected that the magnetic does not coincide with the true
                    meridian, and that the angle between them, called the variation of the compass,
                    changes. It varies at different times and in different places (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Magnetism).</hi> In 1823 it was 27° 48' at Edinburgh, and
                    24° 10' at London: the deviation was westerly.</p>
                <p part="N">This mode of surveying was applied by Richard Norwood, an English
                    mathematician of the seventeenth century, to determine the magnitude of the
                    earth. Having found the latitudes of London and York, he travelled from the one
                    place to the other, measuring along the road with a chain, and taking the
                    bearings with a compass. He says, “When I measured not, I paced; and I believe
                    the experiment has come within a scantling of the truth.”</p>
                <p part="N">In our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mensuration,</hi> we have explained
                    the principal problems by which heights and distances are determined by
                    trigonometry: these find continual application in surveying. The theory of
                    levelling is a branch of the same subject; this has been discussed in a
                    particular article (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Levelling).</hi> Maritime surveying
                    requires the solution of this problem: <hi rend="italic">Three stations being
                        given, and the angles which the lines joining them subtend at a fourth
                        station in their plane; to determine the position of that fourth
                        station.</hi> This is Problem V. in our article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    usual way. Since that was printed, Dr Wallace, emeritus professor of mathematics
                    in the University of Edinburgh, lias published a work entitled “Geometrical
                    Theorems and Analytical Formulae,” in which various new formulas and
                    constructions are given for this and other geodetical problems.</p>
