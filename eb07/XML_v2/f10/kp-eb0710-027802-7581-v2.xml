                <p part="N"><label type="entry">FUST, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a
                    goldsmith of Mayence, in the middle of the fifteenth century, and a man not more
                    distinguished for his riches than for his knowledge of the arts, shares with
                    Guttemberg and Schoeffer the glory of having invented printing. Guttemberg is
                    generally considered as the first inventor of this art; and, according to some,
                    Fust had only the merit, by no means a slight one, of supplying him with money;
                    whilst others are of opinion that the goldsmith contributed both his funds and
                    his industry towards the completion of the invention. But, however this may be,
                    a partnership was formed between them in 1450, and it appears that these
                    associates practised successively three sorts of impressions; first, the <hi
                        rend="italic">tabellary,</hi> that is, in carved tablets or plates, like our
                    engravings on wood; secondly, the <hi rend="italic">xylographie,</hi> or in
                    moveable characters of wood; and, lastly, the impression in characters cast in
                    moulds or matrices, analogous to, if not identical with, the stereotype founding
                    of the present day. There is reason to believe, however, that Fust,
                    notwithstanding his acquirements, contributed but little of his own invention to
                    the operations of the partnership contracted with Guttemberg; since the latter
                    appears to have been the first who thought of applying to regular compositions
                    the same mode which had been long practised at the foot of engravings for their
                    explanation; and since Schoeffer, iin inventing the punch, completed the
                    discovery, if indeed this ought not to be considered as the discovery itself.
                    Fust, zealous in favour of all that regarded his art, was so much delighted with
                    the invention of Schoeffer, that he gave the latter his daughter in marriage.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra Latina,</hi> without
                    date, in folio, and consisting of 637 leaves, is probably the first production
                    of printing, and seems to have been executed between 1450 and 1455, during the
                    partnership of Fust and Guttemberg; but some think that the impression was
                    struck from the characters invented by Schoeffer. In 1455, difficulties arose
                    between Fust and Guttemberg, who, in consequence, separated on the 6th of
                    November. But, in reimbursements of the sums he had advanced, Fust remained
                    proprietor of the establishment, which he now carried on with Schoeffer; and to
                    this new partnership we are indebted for the Psalter, <hi rend="italic"

                    until 1466, when Fust went to Paris, and is thought to have died of the plague
                    which then ravaged that city.</p>
                <p part="N">Fust, the goldsmith of Mayence, and the promoter of printing, has,
                    however, been sometimes confounded with Faust the magician, whose name is
                    associated with so many imaginary horrors. The latter, born about the
                    commencement of the sixteenth century, was the son of a peasant of Weimar, or,
                    as some say, of Rundling. He was educated by one of his uncles, who caused him
                    to study theology, and, notwithstanding a strong propensity to debauchery, he
                    completed his course, and obtained the degree of doctor. But having become
                    disgusted with this pursuit, he cultivated medicine and astrology, and in
                    particular applied himself to the study of magic. From this time his historians
                    are only insipid romancers, who relate a thousand absurdities respecting him.
                    They make him conjure up the devil himself; employ an infernal spirit named
                    Mephistopheles, with whom he made a paction for twenty-four years; descend into
                    hell, and travel through the celestial spheres, as well as through all the
                    countries of this sublunary world, everywhere surrounding himself with
                    illusions, playing mischievous pranks, having commerce with Helen the wife of
                    Menelaus, causing Alexander the Great to appear to Charles V., and, lastly, to
                    terminate the whole in a suitable manner, having his neck twisted by the devil
                    at the expiration of his compact with that personage. Muçh more infallible than
                    even the illustrious Mathew Laensberg, Faust yearly circulated in Germany
                    almanacks, which, being dictated by Beelzebub, could scarcely fail to have great
                    success. Such are the marvellous feats related by George Rodolph Widman, who
                    published at Franckfort, in 1587, 8vo, the history of John Faust, and
                    Christopher Wagner his valet. This history, or rather this romance, reprinted at
                    Berlin in 1590, and at Franckfort in 1591, re-appeared at Hamburg, 1598-1600, in
                    three volumes 4to, with historical, physical, and moral commentaries, filled
                    with ignorance and folly; and it was also translated into English, Dutch, and
                    French. Adelung has honoured Faust with an article at the end of his History of
                    Human Follies, where will also be found the <hi rend="italic">Conjurationes
                        Fausti,</hi> but without the mysterious figures which ought to have
                    accompanied them, and by means of which the reader might easily perform the same
                    prodigies as the magician of Weimar. The Germans, who are fond of the
                    marvellous, have often brought upon the scene the descent of Dr Faust to the
                    infernal regions. Of this number are the celebrated Goethe, Klinger, and J. F.
                    Schink; whilst Trithemus, the most ancient of all, J. Manlius, Schaller, Wier,
                    Del Rio, and even Camerarius and Gesner, have discoursed of Faust and his
                    enchantments, of which Peter-Frederick Arpe has favoured the world with a
                    catalogue. But notwithstanding the testimony of these writers, many others,
                    perhaps with reason, regard this personage as entirely imaginary, and consider
                    his history as a romance intended merely for amusement. Some, indeed, including
                    Conrad Durius, are disposed to think that the legend of Faust is a satire
                    fabricated by the monks against John Fust, one of the inventors of printing, who
                    had incurred the resentment of these cenobites by being concerned in a discovery
                    which superseded their useful functions as copyists of manuscripts; but others
                    have shown that this opinion is not well founded. Upon the subject of Faust, the
