                    Duke of Valentino, second natural son of Pope Alexander VI. by a Roman lady
                    named Vannozia, was a brave general, but a most cruel and profligate man. It is
                    incredible what numbers he caused to be taken off by poison or by 'the sword;
                    and swarms of assassins were constantly kept in pay by him at Rome, for the sake
                    of removing all who were either obnoxious or inconvenient to him. He experienced
                    various turns of fortune; and was sometimes prosperous, sometimes the reverse.
                    On one occasion he very narrowly escaped dying by poison; for having concerted
                    with the pope a design of poisoning nine newly-created cardinals at once, for
                    the sake of getting possession of their effects, the wine, drugged for the
                    purpose, was by mistake brought to and drank by themselves; even-handed justice
                    thus returning the ingredients of the poisoned chalice to their own lips. The
                    pope died of what he had drank; Caesar, by the vigour of his constitution, and
                    the force of antidotes, recovered. But this illness caused his ruin, and when he
                    recovered, it was only to find that he had outlived his fortune and grandeur, to
                    see himself depressed, and his enemies exalted; for he was soon after divested
                    of all his acquisitions, and sent as a prisoner to Spain, in order to free Italy
                    from an incendiary, and the Italian princes from those dangers which his
                    turbulent and restless spirit made them fear, even although he was unarmed. He
                    managed, however, to escape from confinement; and flying for refuge to John
                    d’Albret, king of Navarre, his brother-in-law, who was then at war with his
                    subjects, he served as a volunteer, and was killed by a ball fired from the
                    castle of Viano, on the 12th March 1507.</p>
                <p part="N">Borgia may be regarded as an almost literal incarnation of whatever is
                    most odious and infamous amongst mankind. Educated in an age when every petty
                    court was a school of immorality, falsehood, and perfidy; when the frequency of
                    political iniquities had utterly effaced all shame; when treaties afforded no
                    guarantee, and oaths inspired no confidence; he may be said to have systematized
                    crime, and to have carried impudence, bad faith, and utter disregard of all
                    ties, human and divine, to an extent previously unknown. Many princes have shed
                    more blood than Caesar .Borgia, many have exacted more cruel vengeance, some
                    have inflicted more atrocious punishments. But his name is nevertheless
                    attainted with a surpassing infamy; history has branded him with a peculiar
                    stigma; the public voice has been just towards him. Other monsters have been
                    hurried on by their passions. Borgia calculated every thing, even to ferocity;
                    judged every thing with reference to his own particular objects; sacrificed
                    every thing to his own immediate interest; and regarded religion, morality, and
                    humanity as tools or engines which might occasionally be serviceable, but which,
                    when no longer useful or convenient, were to be broken and cast aside. Nor were
                    the habits of the man unworthy of the principles of the politician. His manners
                    were excessively corrupt. He was sober, however, because his situation imposed
                    upon him the necessity of temperance; but in this is included every thing that
                    can be said in his favour; unless we give him credit for the smooth and
                    seductive eloquence of which he was an undoubted master, and which he employed
                    with but too great success in inveigling his intended victims into the toils. It
                    is not without reason, therefore, that Machiavel, in his book of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Prince,</hi> has taken Caesar Borgia as a model; he could not
                    have chosen a hero among men better qualified to inspire unmitigated horror and
                    detestation. The Duke of Valentino is a solitary figure in history; perfect in
                    all its proportions, and alike diabolical in every feature and lineament; an
                    apparent anomaly in the course of providence, but, doubtless, permitted for wise
                    though inscrutable purposes.</p>
