                    physician of equal eminence for his talents and philanthropy, was born at
                    Shiffnall, in Shropshire, on the 13th of April 1760, and was originally of Welsh
                    extraction. He received the first rudiments of his education at a school in his
                    native town, and afterwards at a seminary at Brood, in Staffordshire. The
                    strength of his intellectual powers was apparent at a very early period of his
                    life; and he was remarkable from his infancy for his insatiable thirst for books
                    and his indiffercnce to the common objects of amusement which usually captivate
                    the attention of children. His rising abilities were discerned and justly
                    appreciated by his grandfather, a man of great natural acuteness of mind, and
                    who by his industry and enterprise in trade had acquired a considerable fortune.
                    To this intelligent relation he was deeply indebted for many of the advantages
                    of his early education, and for prevailing on his father (who, wishing to retain

                    anxious about his literary acquirements) to fix his destination for one of the
                    learned professions. When he was only nine years old, the circumstance of an
                    accident which befell his benefactor, and which, after being followed by some
                    remarkable symptoms, terminated fatally, was calculated to make a deep and
                    lasting impression on a mind like that of young Beddoes, and was sufficient to
                    give it a decided direction. By the extraordinary acuteness and interest which
                    he manifested on this occasion, he attracted the notice of Mr Yongc, the surgeon
                    who attended the sufferer; and a foundation was thus laid for the friendship
                    which ever after subsiste between them, and which appears to have had a
                    eonsιder-able influence in his choice of that profession, in wind he was
                    destined to run so brilliant a career. Under t ı tuition of the Rev. Mr Harding,

                    Briđgenorth, he made rapid progress in classical learning, and was distinguished
                    by his great fondness for reading, by his facility in acquiring knowledge, and
                    by the possession of a memory surprisingly retentive, a faculty which he
                    retained through life. When about thirteen years of age, he was placed as a
                    pupil with the Rev. Mr Dickenson, rector of Plymhill in Staffordshire, with whom
                    he continued about two years, and who has given the following report of the zeal
                    with which he pursued his studies. “During the period that Dr Beddoes was under
                    my care,” observes Mr Dickenson, “his mind was so intent upon literary pursuits,
                    chiefly the attainment of classical learning, that I do not recollect his having
                    devoted a single day, or even an hour, to diversions or frivolous amusements of
                    any kind. His vacant hours were generally employ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    ed in reading reviews, of which he had access to a very numerous collection.” It
                    is singular, that, in giving a sketch of his mental powers, though he describes
                    his judgment as solid, he represents his genius as not “enlivened by any
                    remarkable brilliancy of fancy.” We shall soon have occasion to observe how
                    eminently he was afterwards gifted with the very quality, in which a near
                    observer of his character pronounced him to have been at that time deficient.
                    His moral conduct was ever irreproachable, and his docility and equanimity of
                    temper were in the highest degree exemplary.</p>
                <p part="N">He continued the same habits of sedulous application, and retained the
                    same independence and integrity of character, at the university, to which he was
                    removed on quitting Mr Dickenson. He entered at Pembroke College, Oxford, in
                    Michaelmas term 1776. The simplicity of his appearance, and the rusticity of his
                    manners and address, could not long conceal the superiority of his mental
                    powers, which became more conspicuous by extended competition, and soon met with
                    the respect and applause to which they had so high a claim. The themes and
                    declamations of young Beddoes were remarkable for their elegant Latinity; and he
                    soon acquired distinguished reputation as a classical scholar. Success in one
                    acquisition was to him but an inducement to the possession of another; and,
                    already versed in the ancient, he resolved to become master also of the modern
                    languages. He was found one morning by a friend, who casually entered his
                    apartment, very busily engaged with a French grammar and dictionary before him.
                    On inquiring what was the nature of his studies, Beddoes told him that he was
                    only learning French. His friend expressed surprise that he should attempt it
                    without a master. He replied that it was unnecessary, and that he should conquer
                    the difficulties of the language by himself in about two months. His friend
                    desisted from further interference; but, noting m his own mind the date of his
                    visit, called upon him again at the expiration of two months, and taking the
                    opportunity of turning the conversation to the subject, inquired whether he had
                    mastered the language. Beddoes answered in the’affirmative, and proved his
                    assertion by reading in English, with perfect fluency, and much to the
                    astonishment of the hearer, a French book which the latter presented to him.
                    From the French he proceeded to the Italian, which, from its analogy with the
                    former, he acquired with greater ease. The German language pre- <hi
                        rend="superscript"> s</hi> onted more serious difficulties; but his
                    perseverance triumphed over them without the aid of any master. Not content with
                    this, he afterwards added the Spanish language to his other acquisitions, as if
                    determined to possess every avenue by which useful or ornamental knowledge <hi
                        rend="superscript"> co</hi> ^ld possibly be attained.</p>
                <p part="N">V» hatever time he may have devoted to general literature while
                    attending the university, chemistry, and the other sciences more closely
                    connected with his future profession, were always his favourite objects of
                    pursuit. The splendid discoveries of Black and Priestley, which had opened a new
                    field of discovery, and promised to lead to the most important results, were
                    powerfully calculated to inflame the ardour of so inquisitive and sanguine a
                    spirit as that of Beddoes; and he accordingly soon became perfectly conversant
                    with the new doctrines of pneumatic chemistry, and used to exhibit with great
                    delight the experiments which supported them, to a circle of literary friends in
                    Shropshire, during his vacations. He was also much occupied with mineralogy and
                    botany; and for the former of these sciences, especially, retained throughout
                    life a remarkable fondness.</p>
                <p part="N">Having taken his bachelor’s degree at one and twenty, he repaired to
                    London, in order to commence the study of his profession, for which, as is well
                    known, the English universities do not provide the means. He became a pupil of
                    the celebrated Sheldon, and devoted his time to the details of practical
                    anatomy, and the physiological inquiries connected with it. It was while he was
                    engaged in these studies that he gave to the world, in 1784, a translation from
                    the Italian of Spallanzani’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on Natural
                        History;</hi> a work which, in the year 1790, went through a second edition.
                    In the year following, 1785, he published a translation of Bergman’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays on Elective Attractions,</hi> the first work to which
                    Beddoes affixed his name, accompanied by numerous original notes, which display
                    an accurate acquaintance with all the modern improvements in the physical
                    sciences. In 1786 he became again known to the public as the editor of Scheele’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Chemical Essays.</hi> Previous to this, in 1783, he took
                    his degree of master of arts; and, in the autumn of 1784, removed to Edinburgh,
                    where he remained during three successive winters and one summer. Shortly after
                    his arrival, he became a member of the Medical Society and of the Natural
                    History Society of that place, and took an active part in the series of
                    physiological experiments in which some of the members of the former were at
                    that period engaged; to the latter he contributed two papers, one on the <hi

                        rend="italic">Scale of Seing,</hi> both of which have been preserved at full
                    length in Dr Stock’s Memoirs of his Life. The high estimation in which his
                    talents were held at Edinburgh was shown, not only by his receiving every mark
                    of honourable distinction from his fellow-students which it was in their power
                    to confer, but also by their choosing him as the organ of their remonstrances
                    with the managers of the Infirmary, on the occasion of a misunderstanding which
                    had arisen between them as to the hours at which they should be permitted to
                    attend; and they were eminently indebted to him for the firmness with which he
                    on that occasion maintained their privileges.</p>
                <p part="N">After taking his degree of doctor of medicine at Oxford, in December
                    1786, he made, in the ensuing summer, an excursion into the Highlands, and also
                    spent a short time at Paris and Dijon, where he cultivated the acquaintance of
                    Lavoisier and Guyton de Morveau. Soon after his return he was appointed to
                    succeed Dr Austin in the chemical lectureship at Oxford, an office which he was
                    eminently qualified to fill. The success which attended his exertions to inspire
                    a taste for scientific researches was soon apparent, in the full and generally
                    overflowing audience attracted by his lectures, and by his communicating to most
                    of his hearers a large portion of that enthusiasm for the pursuit of which he
                    was himself possessed. Enjoying the reputation of distinguished talents, in a
                    place where so much deference is paid by all ranks to the possessor of so noble
                    a distinction, and surrounded by men of learning and abilities, who courted his
                    society, his situation at the university appears to have been truly <pb

                    enviable; and it is difficult to understand the motives which could have led him
                    to relinquish all these advantages for the uncertain prospects afforded by his
                    establishing himself in any other town.. The decided part which he took in the
                    political discussions that were agitated at the beginning of the French
                    revolution, seems to have had a principal share in this determination. His
                    opinions, which it was no part of his character ever to conceal within his own
                    breast, were on this occasion expressed with his usual freedom, and were of a
                    nature to give offence to many of his former admirers; and the circulation of a
                    political article which he inserted in a Shropshire paper, in reply to some
                    misrepresentations which had previously been made, in an advertisement
                    soliciting relief for the French emigrant clergy, excited a clamour against him,
                    which accelerated his adoption of the step he had previously determined upon,
                    that of resigning his lectureship, and quitting Oxford.</p>
                <p part="N">During his connection with the university, he published, at the
                    Clarendon press, in 1790, an analytical account of the writings of Mayow, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Chemical Experiments and Opinions, extracted from
                        a work published in the last century;</hi> in which he asserts the claims of
                    that extraordinary man to the discovery of the principal facts on which the
                    modern system of pneumatic chemistry is founded; discoveries which Mayow had
                    achieved at a very early period of life, and which had failed, for upwards of a
                    century, to attract any notice from the philosophic world. In the <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1791 and 1792 we also find
                    three papers by Dr Beddoes; the one containing <hi rend="italic">Observations on
                        the Affinity between Basaltes and Granite,</hi> in which he rejects the
                    common division of mountains into primary and secondary, and states some strong
                    arguments in favour of the volcanic origin of both; the other giving <hi
                        rend="italic">An Account of some Appearances attending the Conversion of
                        Cast into Malleable Iron,</hi> which he supposes to consist in its
                    purification from oxygen, charcoal, and hydrogen, which escape, during the
                    process, in the form of carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen gases; and, in a
                    paper which forms an appendix to the latter, he relates a variety of experiments
                    which he had made, confirming this theory. <hi rend="smallcaps">í</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The uncertainty of his future destination on his retiring from Oxford
                    does not appear to have interrupted his literary labours; for it was at this
                    period that he published his <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Nature of
                        Demonstrative Evidence, with an Explanation of Certain Difficulties
                        occurring in the Elements of Geometry, and Deflections on Language,</hi>
                    8vo, London, 1793. In this essay he contends, in opposition to the doctrines of
                    the ontologists, and particularly to that of Mr Harris, the author of <hi
                        rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> that geometry is essentially founded in
                    experiment; and that mathematical reasoning proceeds, at every step, upon the
                    evidence of the senses; or, in other words, that this science is a science of
                    experiment and observation, as much founded solely upon the induction of
                    particular facts, as mechanics, astronomy, optics, or chemistry. He endeavours
                    to show that Euclid sets out from experiment, and appeals constantly to what we
                    have already learned, or may immediately learn, from the exercise of our senses.
                    This paradox he attempts to support by a sophistical analysis of one of the
                    elementary theorems in the first book of Euclid, and of the leading definitions
                    and axioms prefixed to it. He is afterwards led to consider the origin of
                    abstract terms and the philosophy of language, and adopts on these subjects the
                    views which have been presented by Mr Horne Tooke, in his E-Tiα ∏τepoa <hi

                <p part="N">About the same period he published a work entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    commodious remedy for calculus, the exsiccated carbonate of soda made into pills
                    with an equal weight of soap; i∏ proof of the efficacy of which, he adduces a
                    number of in. teresting cases. He then proceeds to develope his favourite
                    pathological theories on the diseases which destroy so large a proportion of the
                    human species; theories on which he afterwards built so many specious but
                    unfortunately abortive projects for their cure. Sea-scurvy and pulmonary
                    consumption he conceived to arise from opposite chemical conditions of the body;
                    the former consisting in a gradual abstraction, the latter in a gradual
                    accumulation, of oxygen in the system. He supports these opinions by a variety
                    of ingenious and plausible arguments, and proposes submitting them to the test
                    of experiment, by administering to consumptive patients such gases as may
                    contain a smaller proportion of oxygen than is contained in common atmospheric
                    air. The new views of pathology which these speculations presented, and the
                    hopes of valuable practical results which they raised, excited great attention
                    in the medical world, and contributed much to increase the reputation of their
                    author.</p>
                <p part="N">On leaving Oxford, he retired to the house of his friend Mr Reynolds of
                    Ketley, in Shropshire. It was here that he published his admirable <hi
                        rend="italic">History of Isaac Jenkins,</hi> a story intended to impress the
                    most useful of moral lessons on the labouring classes, by exhibiting the
                    reformation of a drunkard, and his return to habits of sobriety and industry.
                    The execution of this work is worthy of the design. There is, probably, none of
                    Dr Beđdoes’s productions which unites so many peculiar excellencies as this
                    inimitable fiction, or which displays at once, in so favourable a light, the
                    vigour of his genius, his deep knowledge of the human heart, and the power with
                    which he could command the interest and sympathy of his reader. No work of its
                    kind has ever had the same success; repeated editions, amounting to above forty
                    thousand copies, were rapidly sold; and a large impression has since been issued
                    at the request of a society for promoting knowledge by the distribution of
                    useful popular books.</p>
                <p part="N">A prospect now opened to him of realizing a scheme to which his wishes
                    had for a long time been ardently directed, that of establishing a pneumatic
                    institution, where the medical efficacy of the permanently elastic fluids, the
                    fruits of the modern improvements in chemistry, could be fairly put to the test
                    of experiment, by being administered on an extensive scale. The metropolis first
                    suggested itself as an eligible spot for the formation of the projected
                    establishment; but several obstacles having occurred in the execution of this
                    plan, the neighbourhood of Bristol was at length fixed upon as the most proper
                    place for the purpose. In making the various arrangements required in the
                    infancy of such an institution, and which presented peculiar difficulties, he

                    man’s daughters, an event which took place in April 17"4. The pneumatic
                    institution continued to occupy his attention for many years, in the course of
                    which a great number of publications issued from his pen, illustrating the
                    principles on which he expected it to be useful, and detailing the experiments
                    and the results to which it gave rise. The principal of these are the following:

                    Letters from Dr Withering, Dr Ewart, Dr Thornton, &amp;c. together with an
                    analysis of a paper by Lavoisier, on the state of the air in crowded assemblies,
                    and of another by Vauquelin, on the liver of the skate; Considerations on the
                    Medical Use, and on the Production of Factitious Airs, in five parts, which came
                    out successively at different periods, from the year 1794 to 1796; in 1795, he
                    published an Outline of a Plan for determining the Medicinal Powers of
                    Factitious Airs; in 1797, Suggestions towards setting on foot the projected
                    Establishment for Pneumatic Medicine, and Reports relating to Nitrous Acid, in
                    confirmation of the efficacy of that remedy in syphilitic affections; in 1799,
                    Contributions to Medical and Physical Knowledge, collected principally from the
                    West of England; notice of some Observations made at the Pneumatic Institution;
                    a second, and afterwards a third, Collection of Reports relating to Nitrous
                    Acid. Considerable difficulty was at first experienced in the construction and
                    management of the apparatus required for carrying on the objects of this
                    institution; these were, however, in no long time entirely surmounted by the
                    friendly assistance of Mr Watt, whose exertions at this critical period were
                    eminently serviceable, and are acknowledged in a dedication prefixed to the
                    first part of the <hi rend="italic">Considerations.</hi> Mr William Clayfield
                    and Mr Read also contributed their assistance in the invention of different
                    parts of the pneumatic apparatus. At the opening of the institution in 1798, the
                    sums subscribed were found to be very inadequate to the purposes for which it
                    was designed; but every deficiency in this respect was amply supplied by the
                    liberality of Mr Thomas Wedgewood, who offered Dr Beddoes L.1000 to enable him
                    to carry the plan into immediate execution. All that was now wanted was to
                    procure a superintendent; and he had the good fortune to engage in that capacity
                    a young man who had already given proofs of extraordinary talents, and to whose
                    penetrating genius chemistry has since been so deeply indebted. There needs no
                    other indication to suggest the name of Davy,—a name that will descend to
                    distant ages as associated with so many important discoveries in philosophical
                    science. The history of the pneumatic institution indeed derives considerable
                    splendour from many of these discoveries, which were perfected in its
                    laboratory, and which were first announced to the world through the medium of
                    the publications above mentioned; and in the work entitled Researches Chemical
                    and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide, or Dephlogistreated Nitrous
                    Air, and its Respiration. By Humphry Davy, Superintendent of the Medical
                    Pneumatic Institution. London, 1800. The discovery of the chemical properties of
                    this gas, and of its astonishing effects on the system when respired, were among
                    the first, and must ever be esteemed the most brilliant, of the results of this
                    institution: it raised the most sanguine anticipations in the mind θf Dr
                    Beddoes, and called forth all his eloquence in the description of what it
                    already had and might be expected to accomplish. These, like the other splendid
                    visions in which his ardent imagination was but too prone to indulge, have never
                    been realized; and have even created, by their <hi rend="superscript"> sι</hi>
                    gnal failure, an unfortunate prejudice against future attempts to improve the
                    art of medicine by novel methods of treatment founded on chemical or
                    philosophical principles. The original objects of the institution being found
                    unattainable, were successively abandoned; and it assumed, by insensible
                    gradations, the form of the more common establishments for the relief of the
                    sick; and the prevention rather than the cure of diseases became the principal
                    aim of its conductors. In 1807 it was finally relinquished by Dr Beddoes to the
                    care of Mr King and Dr Stock.</p>
                <p part="N">A great variety of medical topics in the mean time engaged the active
                    mind of Dr Beddoes, and gave employment to his pen. In the strictly practical
                    branch of the art we may enumerate, in addition to the works above mentioned,—in
                    1793, A Letter to Dr Darwin on a new mode of treating Pulmonary Consumption; in
                    1795, an edition of Brown’s Elements of Medicine, with a preface and notes;
                    translation from the Spanish, of Gimbernaťs new Method of operating in Femoral
                    Hernia; in 1799, Popular Essay on Consumption; in 1801, Essay on the medical and
                    domestic Management of the Consumptive, on Digitalis, and on Scrofula; in 1807,
                    Researches Anatomical and Practical, concerning Fever as connected with
                    Inflammation. In this latter work he successfully combats the theory of Dr
                    Clutterbuck and of Ploucquet, in which fever is supposed to consist essentially
                    in topical inflammation or its membranes.</p>
                <p part="N">The object which Dr Beddoes had ever most at heart was, to excite a
                    lively and general attention to the means of preserving health, and of repelling
                    the first inroads of disease, by the diffusion of medical knowledge throughout
                    all ranks of the community, as far as they were capable of acquiring it. His
                    attention was uniformly directed to this favourite object, and he suffered no
                    opportunity to escape of enforcing those maxims which tend to prevent the
                    necessity of the interference of his art. His works on popular subjects, on the
                    improvements of medical education, and the exercise of the profession, and the
                    popular lectures which he promoted, and in which he himself took an active part,
                    all tended to this object. To this head may be referred the following
                    publications: in 1794, A Guide for Self-preservation and Parental Affection; A
                    Proposal for the Improvement of Medicine; in 1797, A Lecture introductory to a
                    Popular Course of Anatomy; in 1798, A suggestion towards an Essential
                    Improvement in the Bristol Infirmary; but more especially his Hygeia, or Essays
                    Moral and Medical, on the causes affecting the Personal State of the Middling
                    and Affluent Classes, in 3 vols. 1801-2, in which he embraces a great variety of
                    topics, and describes, with a glowing pencil, and occasionally with
                    extraordinary eloquence, the sufferings of patients under different diseases. In
                    1806, there appeared The Manual of Health, or the Invalid conducted safely
                    through the Seasons; in 1808, A Letter to Sir Joseph Banks on the prevailing
                    Discontents, Abuses, and Imperfections in Medicine; and, in the same year, Good
                    Advice for the Husbandman in Harvest, and for all those who labour hard in hot
                    Births; as also for others who will take it in Warm Weather; which was the last
                    production he ever wrote, his death happening soon after, of dropsy and
                    enlargement of the pericardium, in December 1808.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Beddoes has been very justly characterized as a pioneer in the road
                    to discovery. He was full of ardour and enterprise in the pursuit of knowledge,
                    and was easily captivated by every new project that seemed to lead towards any
                    practical improvement. He was more active, however, in exciting the labours of
                    others, than in labouring himself in the field of experiment. He had the
                    imagination of a poet, and could paint in the most vivid colours the sufferings
                    entailed by disease, and enforce with the most powerful eloquence whatever he
                    wished to impress on the minds of his readers. He has been accused of
                    versatility of opinion; but if he was, perhaps, hasty in publishing the first
                    conceptions which he formed, he has atoned for this fault by the remarkable
                    candour with which he retracted them the moment his confidence in them was
                    shaken. He took a decided line in politics, as appears in the following
                    political publications of his, which appeared in 1795, 1796, and 1797; viz. A
                    Word in Defence of the Bill of Rights against Gagging Bills; Where <pb
