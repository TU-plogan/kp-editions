                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BAHAR</label>, a large province of Hindostan, which
                    lies principally between the 22d and 27th degrees of north latitude.. On the
                    north it was, until the conquests from ^θpaul in 1815, bounded by a range of
                    hills and a low woody country; on the south by the ancient Hindoo province of
                    Gundwana; and on the west by Allahabad, Oude, and Gundwana. It comprehends an
                    area of51,973 square miles, of which one half, consisting of 26,000 square <hi
                        rend="superscript"> n</hi>}des, is an arable plain, fertile, populous, and
                    highly cul-ivated. This plain is divided into two nearly equal por- <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> °ns by the Ganges, which runs across the province
                    in an easterly course for 200 miles. The northern division extends 70 miles from
                    the Ganges, to the forests of Nepaul ' and Morung, on the upper streams of that
                    great river. It is one uninterrupted flat, which was subdivided by the emperor
                    Akbar into four districts, namely, Tirhoot, Hajypoor, Sarun, with Chumparun or
                    Bettiah, including four pergunnahs from Monghir. The central division of Bahar
                    extends south of the Ganges sixty miles, to the commencement of the hilly
                    country, which stretches southward; and it contains 18,000 square miles, not
                    nearly so productive as the plains. This central division contains the district
                    of Bahar, which is in the middle of it, and occupies about one half of the whole
                    level area; the plains ofMong-hir, one sixth more; and the restare mountainous.
                    Rhotas, the south-western district, lies between the rivers Soane and
                    Caramnassa; the remaining district Shahabad extends along the south side of the
                    Ganges. There is, besides, a straggling hilly country of 8000 square miles,
                    which is not productive. This province has great natural advantages, and it is
                    favourably situated, between Bengal and the upper provinces, for being the
                    medium of internal commerce. Its climate is temperate, and the soil is fertile,
                    well watered, and productive of the higher grains, as also of opium and other
                    luxuries, which arc in request in northern countries. Agriculture, as well as
                    commerce and manufactures, have always flourished in Bahar. Opium may be
                    considered the staple commodity of the country; but, according to the narrow
                    maxims of the East India Company, all that is produced in Bahar and Benares is
                    monopolized by the government, and disposed of in Calcutta by public sale. In
                    addition to those articles, the country yields the ordinary productions of
                    grain, sugar, indigo, oil, betel leaf, and a variety of flower essences,
                    especially roses. Saltpetre is principally manufactured in the divisions of
                    Hajypoor and Sarun, and it scarcely passes the eastern limits of Bahar. Cotton
                    cloths for exportation are manufactured everywhere. The climate is extremely
                    hot; and in Bahar Proper and the contiguous districts, the country is visited by
                    a parching wind from the westward, which prevails through a large portion of the
                    hot season, blowing with great strength during the day, and commonly succeeded
                    at night by a cool breeze in an opposite direction. Sometimes it ceases for days
                    and weeks, giving way to easterly gales. Farther westward, and in the interior
                    of the country, the climate is still hotter, owing to the parching winds which
                    prevail; and it is not so much tempered by refreshing breezes or cooling showers
                    of rain and hail. The Bahar province during the cold season is sometimes liable
                    to a blighting frost. The country is well watered. Its principal rivers are the
                    Ganges, the Soane, the Gunduck, the Dummoodah, the Caramnassa, and the Dewah,
                    besides numerous smaller streams, which supply the country with moisture, and
                    aid its cultivation. The chief towns arc Patna, Chuprah, Daoudnagur, Goya,
                    Boglipoor, Monghir, ' Arrah, Cbittra, and Muzufferpoor.</p>
                <p part="N">Ever since the British acquired possession of this province in 1764,
                    which is about sixty-six years, it has enjoyed the most profound tranquillity.
                    Hence its cultivation has been continually increasing, and in many parts it is
                    overflowing with people, owing to the predilection of the natives for the
                    settled districts rather than the contiguous wastes. The land in Bahar is
                    divided into smaller ze-mindarics than in Bengal, and a greater portion of it is
                    in jaghircs. The lands have always been let to farm; and from the time that the
                    British acquired the right of collecting the land revenue, no settlement had
                    been concluded with the proprietors of the soil until the final assessment in
                    1792. The tenantry, though they are left at the mercy of the zemindars or
                    landlords by the revenue settlement, are on the whole in a prosperous
                    condition.</p>

                <p part="N">Experience has taught the zemindars the necessity of treating them
                    justly; and, accordingly, one half of the produce is the usual allowance of the
                    cultivators, and there is such a demand for their industry, that in some cases
                    they are enabled even to make better terms. The hire of a ploughman, since the
                    year of the perpetual settlement in 1792, has nearly doubled, while the price of
                    grain has fallen. This territory was at an early period subdued by the
                    Mahommedan invaders. The large towns on the Ganges have always been their
                    favourite residences, and hence a considerable proportion of the population.
                    About one fourth profess the Mahommedan faith. The amount of the land tax is
                    6,152,435 rupees, and of the abkarry or excise duties on consumable articles
                    594,103.</p>
