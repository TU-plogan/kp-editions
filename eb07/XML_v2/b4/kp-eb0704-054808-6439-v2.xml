                    archdeacon of Moray, occupies a conspicuous place in the literary annals of
                    Scotland, but his personal history is still involved in some degree of
                    obscurity. It is evident ⅛at several writers have confounded him with Sir John
                    Bellenden of Auchinoul. Their names are indeed the same, but this is the only
                    circumstance to support their identity; and the judge appears to have survived
                    the archdeacon for so long a period as twenty-seven years. Dr Bellenden was
                    probably educated in the university of St Andrews: a student of the same name,
                    and described as belonging to the Lothian nation, was matriculated in 1508;<note

                    the poets of this age were too generally disposed to adopt terms of a French as
                    well as Latin origin; and that the practice eannot be considered as peculiar to
                    those who had been educated in France. Sir David Lindsay, in a poem supposed to
                    have been written in the year 1530, mentions him in the following terms:</p>

                <p part="N">The literary merit of Bellenden does not seem to have been disregarded
                    by the court; but he experienced the precarious fortune which so frequently
                    attends courtiers. For this information we are partly indebted to his poem
                    entitled the Proheme of the Cosmographe:</p>

                <p part="N">In the epistle subjoined to his translation of Boyce’s history, he
                    likewise states that he had been in the service of the king from his majesty’s
                    early infancy. It has been conjectured that he was employed in superintending
                    the young monarch’s education: but he makes no allusion to such an appointment,
                    of which it would have been very natural to remind the king, if they had ever
                    stood in the relation of tutor and pupil; and he very clearly informs us that
                    his place in the royal household was that of clerk of accompts. James’s
                    preceptor was Gavin Dunbar, afterwards promoted to the archbishopric of Glasgow.
                    Being dismissed from the king’s service, as he states in the verses last quoted,
                    Bellenden is supposed to have entered into that of Archibald earl of Angus,
                    because a person of the same name was the earl’s secretary in the year 1528. In
                    the course of that year, Angus and some of his relations were accused of
                    treason: John Ballentyne, who is described as his secretary, presented himself
                    at the bar of the parliament on the 4th of September, and delivered a written
                    protest in the name of the earl of Angus, his brother George Douglas, and his
                    uncle Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie, stating the reasons why they ought not to
                    be compelled to answer to the charge of treason which had been preferred against
                    them; and in the afternoon of the same day, the secretary again made his
                    appearance, probably because they found such a protest altogether unavailing,
                    and explained the conditions on which the earl was willing to surrender to his
                        trial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi

                    to find him employing a lawyer rather than a clergyman; and accordingly we are
                    informed by Hume that the individual who thus appeared for the Douglases was
                    “Sir John Ballandine, who was then one of their dependers, and afterward justice
                        clerk.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                <p part="N">Whatever may have been Bellenden’s employment at this period, it is
                    certain that he was soon afterwards an attendant at court; and that at the
                    request of the king he undertook a translation of the Roman history of Livy, and
                    the Scotish history of Boyce.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">It is not to be supposed that the king was able
                            to read Latin authors with much facility. Lindsay, vol. i. p. 259,
                            mentions that he was taken from school at the age of twelve; and the
                            metrical paraphrast of Boyce’s history has more particularly described
                            the state of his knowledge:</p><lg part="N">

                            ignorant of the Latin language. It may perhaps be considered as a

                            Franciscan friars, and to render his satire more poignant. “Igitur aenus

                    and the three ensuing years. The treasurer’s accounts contain various entries
                    respecting the remuneration of his labours ·. the sum total which he is there
                    stated to have received amounts to L.114; namely, L.78 for the translation of
                    Boyce, and L.36 for that of Livy. But this was not the only reward which he
                    obtained. The archdeaconry of Moray had become vacant during the vacancy of the
                    see; and two clergymen, Duncan and Harvey, having solicited the pope in favour
                    of James Douglas, were convicted of treason, and their property escheated to the
                    crown. The annual emoluments arising from the pensions and benefices of John
                    Duncan, who was parson of Glasgow, and from all the property belonging to
                    Alexander Harvey for the two successive years 1536 and 1537, were bestowed upon
                    Bellenden. For the first grant he paid a composition of 350 marks, and for the
                    second, of L.300.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    promoted to the archdeaconry, which had lapsed to the crown in consequence of
                    the vacancy in the bishopric: it was perhaps about the same period that he was
                    appointed a canon of Ross; and this appears to have been the full extent of his
                    preferment in the church, while many worthless and illiterate men were enjoying

                    not advance beyond the first five books, nor was his translation printed till
                    the vear 1822. From a manuscript in the Advocates Library, it was then published

                <p part="N">These two works exhibit the most ample specimen of ancient Scotish prose
                    that has descended to our times, and are distinguished beyond most others by
                    their fluency and neatness of style. Bellenden frequently surprises a modern
                    reader by the happy vivacity of his expressions; nor can we peruse these
                    translations without beinσ∙ convinced that his learning and talents had
                    qualified him for original composition. In his version of the Scotish historian,
                    he does not adhere very scrupulously to his author· he has assumed the liberty
                    of adding, as well as of retrenching, and may therefore+e considered as having
                    exceeded the proper limits of a translation. He has at all events produced a
                    very curious, and, to those who have a competent knowledge of the language, a
                    very entertaining work. To his version of Boyce’s history he has subjoined an
                    epistle, addressed to James the Fifth, and written in a strain of manly freedom:
                    of the distinction between a king and ą tyrant, and of the miseries to which
                    wicked princes have generally been exposed, he speaks in bold and unequivocal
                    terms, which may excite some degree of surprise, but which cannot fail of
                    exciting a high degree of respect for his character.<note anchored="true"

                            Bellenden takes occasion to suggest that it is impossible for a king to
                            possess at once the hearts and the goods of his barons.</p><lg part="N">

                        </lg></note> Bellenden was then a dignitary of the church, and might still
                    hope for preferment; and in all ages ambitious churchmen have been sufficiently
                    disposed to encourage sovereigns in their most flagrant attempts to encroach on
                    the liberties of their subjects; but the conduct of the worthy archdeacon, and
                    of some other beneficed clergymen of the ancient Scotish church, must completely
                    exempt them from this censure. John Mair, who was provost of St Salvator’s
                    College, and treasurer of the chapel royal, and Hector Boyce, who was principal
                    of King’s College, canon of Aberdeen, and rector of Tyrie, have each written the
                    history of their native country, and have each evinced a laudable zeal in
                    vindicating the unalienable rights of the people. If such sentiments were
                    cherished by some of the catholic clergy, it is not surprising that they should
                    animate the breast of Buchanan, who had never been accustomed to pace in the
                    trammels of the church, and who had more completely imbibed the spirit of
                    classical antiquity.</p>
                <p part="N">Whatever might be the liberality of his political sentiments, Bellenden
                    seems to have been unprepared for any change in the national religion.<note

                    attainments have even extorted applause from the zealous bishop of Ossory, John
                    Bale, who has so frequently treated the papists with unrelenting severity. In
                    his poetical remains, which are not numerous, he frequently displays an
                    excursive fancy, with considerable taste and skill as a versifier; and it is
                    therefore to be regretted that so few of his compositions have been preserved.
                    The most poetical of his works is the Proheme of the Cosmographe: the principal
                    incidents are borrowed from the ancient fiction of the choice of Hercules,<note

                    imparted to his copy the characteristic air of an original. Nor is his Proheme
                    of the History destitute of poetical merit. These two poems, as well as the
                    metrical prologue to his translation of Livy, bear internal evidence of having
                    been composed for the instruction of the young king. Two copies of his

                    evidently his translation of Boyce’s preliminary description of Scotland. It was
                    stated by Dr Campbell that many of his writings were then in the possession of
                    persons of distinction in Scotland; and he particularly mentions that several of
                    his poems were in the possession of Laurence Dundas, apparently the professor of

                    Scotish name familiarly known to those who have explored the recesses of modern

                    particulars have hitherto been discovered. Whether he belonged to any family of
                    distinction, we are not informed; nor is the gentility of his birth attested by
                    Dempster, who supplies the only biographical notices with which we are
                    acquainted. According to this contemporary authority, he was a professor in the
                    university, and an advocate in the parliament of Paris. We must apparently
                    conclude that he relinquished the functions of a professor, and betook himself
                    to the practice of the bar. The same writer has stated that both Queen Mary and
                    King James employed him in some diplomatic services, and that the latter

                    by Dempster in describing his appointment, seem rather to indicate honour than

                    former publication had been thought worthy of the attention of mighty princes.
                    Both these works partake of the nature of a cento. In the first of them, the
                    author has collected from the writings of Cicero the various precepts and
                    remarks which relate to the origin and principles of regal government, and with
                    no small labour has combined the whole in a regular and systematic form.
                    Adopting a similar plan in the other work, he has compiled a treatise on the
                    dignity and authority of the consuls, and on the constitution of the Roman
                    senate. Although this may seem an effort of mere diligence, it required both
                    learning and ability to present such materials in such a shape.</p>

                    very condensed form, a sketch of the history of philosophy and civil polity,
                    tracing its progress among the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Of this work very
                    few copies appear to have been separately published; for the author speedily
                    combined all the three tracts in a volume which bears the following title: “De
                    Statu libri tres. I. De Statu prisci Orbis in Religione, Re politica, et

                    1615, 8vo∙ Notwithstanding this notice on the title-page, we suspect that the
                    second and third treatises were not actually reprinted. Each treatise has a
                    distinct series of pages, and it was therefore easy to combine the whole. In its
                    separate form and in this volume, <hi rend="italic">Ciceronis Consul</hi>
                    exhibits the very same list of typographical errors. Dr Parr remarks, that in
                    all the copies which he had seen, the date seems to have been changed from <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">m.dc.xv.</hi> to <hi rend="smallcaps">m.dc∙xvi.</hi> by the
                    printer adding the letter ι after the impression had been finished: but in a
                    copy belonging to the Advocates Library, the additional letter is apparently
                    printed, not with a type, but with a pen; and in a copy belonging to the writer
                    of this notice, the original date remains unaltered. Another minute variation
                    may likewise be mentioned; in the latter copy, the plate in the second treatise'
                    is not impressed on the reverse of a printed page of the dedication. In a paper
                    written by Dr Bennet, the late bishop of Cloyne, we find the subsequent
                    statement respecting the books <hi rend="italic">De Statu.</hi> “The great work
                    being now completed, Bellenden looked forward with a pretty well-grounded
                    expectation for that applause which his labour and his ingenuity deserved. But
                    his views were disappointed, by one of those events which no art of man could
                    foresee or remedy. The vessel in which the whole impression was embarked was
                    overtaken by a storm before she could reach the English coast, and foundered
                    with all her cargo. A very few copies only, which the learned author either kept
                    for his own use, or had sent as presents by private hands, seem to have been
                    preserved from the destruction which awaited the others.”<note anchored="true"

                                rend="italic">Memoirs of Parr,</hi> p. 182.</p></note> We are not
                    aware of any early authority for such a statement; and the learned prelate,
                    misled by an imperfect recollection, seems to have misapplied Dr Warton’s
                    account of Bellenden’s larger work, which is likewise an account that requires
                    confirmation. There is a manifest fallacy in supposing that almost all the
                    impression of such a book must have been destined for England. After a long
                    interval, the fame oí the author was greatly extended by Dr Parr’s publication
                    of“Gulielmi Bellendem, Magistri supplicum Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae
                    Britanniae, &amp;c. de Statu libri tres. Editio secunda longe emendatior.” Lond.
                    1787,8vo. The preface, extending to seventy-six pages, is written in a style of
                    elegant and powerful Latinity, but is too much replenished with modern politics,
                    and, in the opinion of some readers, is not free from a considerable mixture of
                    pedantry. It is however such a composition as no other Englishman of that period
                    could perhaps have produced.</p>
                <p part="N">The last work which Bellenden himself published is of very small extent,
                    consisting merely of two short poems: “Caroli Primi et Henricae Mariae, Regis et
                    Reginae Magnae Britanniae, &amp;c. Epithalamium; et in ipsas augustissimas
                    Nuptias, celeberrimam que Legationem earum causa obitam, &amp;c. panegyricum
                    Carmen, et Elogia.” Paris. 1625, 4to. This little work has likewise been
                    republished by Dr Parr.</p>
                <p part="N">But the greatest labour of his life was a posthumous production, which
                    made its appearance under the title of “Guilielmi Bellendem Scoti, Magistri
                    supplicum Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae, de tribus Luminibus
                    Romanorum libri sex-decim.” Paris. 1633, fol. With respect to the date of this
                    publication, one bibliographer frequently contradicts another, and some minute
                    particulars require explanation. In the Advocates Library, that great repository
                    of Scotish literature, there are two copies of the book, which exhibit
                    considerable variations. In both of them we find the same extract of the royal
                    privilege, dated on the third of September 1631. The one bears, “Achevé
                    d’imprimer pour la premiere fois, lθ vingtseptiesme jour d’Aoust 1633.” Of this
                    copy the dedication, “Henrico Borbonio, Sacro-sancti Imp. Rom. Principi,
                    illustriss. Metens. Praesuli,” is subscribed by the author’s nephew, “Guilielmus
                    Bellendenus, Presbyter Scotus.” It consists of nearly four pages, but is not
                        followed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193196504?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-6504-0553"/> by a preface. The other copy has a similar
                    titlepage, but with the date of 1634; and the note subjoined to the privilege
                    bears, “Achevé d’imprimer pour la premiere fois, le vingtroisiesme jour de Mars
                    1634.” It contains a different and a shorter dedication, “Potentissimo et
                    invictissimo Principi Carolo Magnae Britanniae Regi, &amp;c.” subscribed by the
                    publisher, Toussaint du Bray. This dedication is followed by a brief preface,
                    “Lectori benevolo.” In other respects the two copies present a complete
                    resemblance; and it appears sufficiently evident that one set of copies must
                    have been intended for the French, and another for the British market.</p>
                <p part="N">Of this elaborate work, which consists of no fewer than 824 pages,
                    printed on a small type, the subject is very faintly indicated by the title. It
                    is the author’s object to combine, in an historical form, all the statements and
                    reflections of Cicero which relate to the civil and religious affairs of Rome;
                    and his plan is executed in such a manner as to display the essence of the Roman
                    history, from the foundation of the city to the extinction of the republic.<note

                            fin de chaque livre, dans lesquelles il explique plus amplement ses

                    expressing himself in no other words than those of Cicero; but he has
                    interspersed occasional observations, drawn from various sources of information.
                    The latter part of the work, relating to the times of his great prototype, is
                    very ample and satisfactory; and here it is evident that the materials must be
                    chiefly derived from the epistles. The reader cannot fail to perceive that this
                    is precisely such a digest as would be necessary for an historian of the life
                    and times of Cicero; it is such a digest as Dr Middleton professes to have
                    formed by his own unaided industry. “My first business therefore,” as he is
                    pleased to state, “after I had undertaken this task, was, to read over Cicero’s
                    works, with no other view than to extract from them all the passages that seemed
                    to have any relation to my design; where the tediousness of collecting an
                    infinite number of testimonies scattered through many different volumes; of
                    sorting them into their classes, and ranging them in proper order; the necessity
                    of overlooking many in the first search, and the trouble of retrieving them in a
                    second or third; and the final omission of several through forgetfulness or
                    inadvertency; have helped to abate that wonder which had often occurred to me,
                    why no man had ever attempted the same work before me, or at least in this
                    enlarged and comprehensive form, in which it is now offered to the public.”<note

                    must have been fully aware that this labour of collecting and digesting was
                    altogether superfluous; nor is it probable that such a book was unknown to Dr
                    Middleton, a man of extensive learning, and the keeper of a great public
                    library, that of the university of Cambridge. He has therefore been repeatedly
                    accused of plagiarism; and it must be confessed that the accusation does not
                    appear to be destitute of foundation. “It may be worth observing,” says Dr
                    Wanton, “that he is much indebted, without acknowledging it, to a curious book
                    little known, entitled <hi rend="italic">G. Bellendeni Scoti de tribus Luminibus

                    foundation of the city to the time of Augustus, drawn up in the very words of
                    Cicero, without any alteration of any expression. In this book Middleton found
                    every part of Cicero’s own history, in his own words, and his works arranged in
                    chronological order, without further trouble. The impression of this work being
                    shipped for England, was lost in the vessel, which was cast away, and only a few
                    copies remained that had been left in France.”<note anchored="true"

                    it might have been thought necessary to inspect all the materials which Cicero
                    had himself furnished.</p>
                <p part="N">Bellenden has bestowed upon his book a title which to many readers must
                    require explanation. It appears to have been his original intention to compose,
                    on a similar plan, three different works illustrative of the civil and literary
                    history of Rome. The first of his three luminaries is Cicero, who has supplied
                    him with the materials of civil history. According to Lenglet du Fresnoy, the
                    other two whom he had in his contemplation were Seneca and the elder Pliny;<note

                            dessein de faire la même chose sur Pline l’ancien, et sur Seneque; mais
                            il n’y a eu d’imprimé que ce qui regarde biceron, et l’ouvrage même
                            n’est pas commun.” (Lenglet du Fresnoy, <hi rend="italic">Méthode pour

                    we may conclude that, by means of the same laborious arrangement and digest of
                    their respective writings, he intended to exhibit a comprehensive view of the
                    moral and physical science of the Romans. (x.)</p>
