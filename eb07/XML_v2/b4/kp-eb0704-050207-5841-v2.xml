                    Punishments, was born at Milan in the year 1735. His early studies were carried
                    on in the college of the Jesuits at Parma. He possessed a quick apprehension;
                    but, being naturally taciturn, and inclined to reflection, he seldom

                    attainments, gave him, to common observers, a certain air of slowness, and even
                    of stupidity, and characterized his features and deportment during the whole of
                    his life. Having left college at the age of seventeen, he applied himself, with
                    unremitting diligence, to the study of mathematics, and the philosophy of
                    man.</p>
                <p part="N">His understanding appears to have been very early capable of embracing
                    the most general views, and his breast to have been warmed by those benevolent
                    wishes for the enlargement of human happiness, the sincerity and the strength of
                    which are often so severely tried by the events and passions of maturer life.
                    His propensity to the study of jurisprudence and political philosophy was first
                    excited or confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Personnes of</hi>
                    Montesquieu; a production capable, indeed, of alluring a less enthusiastic mind
                    than that of Beccaria. But his industry in the pursuit of knowledge appears to
                    have been chiefly stimulated by the patriotic and honourable desire of diffusing
                    instruction among his countrymen, particularly the inhabitants of Milan, whom he
                    represents, in one of his letters, as abandoned to a state of lamentable and
                    universal ignorance. In the prosecution of these laudable designs, he
                    fortunately possessed the confidence, and was encouraged by the protection, of
                    Count Firmι-ani, then governor of that part of the Austrian dominions; —an
                    accomplished nobleman, who, with comprehensive views of policy, concurred in
                    every plan which was calculated for improving the state of the provinces, and
                    the condition of their inhabitants.</p>

                    ethics, and physical science, were published during the years 1764 and 1765.</p>
                <p part="N">But by far the most remarkable production to which this society gave
                    rise, and that by which the reputation of Beccaria has been chiefly perpetuated
                    among other nations, was the treatise on Crimes and Punishments <hi

                    been undertaken at the earnest solicitation of Count Alexander Verri, who then

                    concert with him the author, every evening, revised and corrected what he had
                    written during the day. In this manner the work was completed within two months,
                    and was printed in the course of the year 1764, with the mark of the Lucca

                <p part="N">In this small but noted work the author appears as the advocate of
                    reason and sound policy no less than of humanity. It was his purpose, by
                    examining the foundation, the objects, and consequently the boundaries, of penal
                    law, to expose the inefficacy as well as injustice of many provisions in the
                    judicial code of his own country, and in those of other European nations, which,
                    derived from remote times, and established under a different order of society,
                    had been perverted and debased during successive ages of barbarism. The
                    authority of positive institutions formed almost the only basis of law, even in
                    countries the furthest advanced in civilization; and that authority was in many
                    of them drawn too servilely from the Roman system. Montesquieu had already
                    thrown many penetrating glances at the foundation and structure of these ancient
                    fabrics; but it was still reserved for others to scrutinize them more closely,
                    and to draw forth, and present to general view, those direct inferences which
                    that examination suggested. In no part were the existing codes more defective
                    and vicious than in the department of the criminal law; and it was to this,
                    accordingly, that Beccaria’s attention was exclusively directed. Nor does he
                    offer the work as a general system or theory even of penal law, in which light
                    it would be found every way imperfect, but only as an attempt to analyze parts
                    of a system which he found actually existing. Among the most prominent of those
                    points to which his reasoning is applied, are, the due proportion between crime
                    and punishment, and the violations of that proportion, whether by unnecessary
                    severity of punishments, or the want of a scale and distribution of them suited
                    to the amount and danger of particular offences; the inconsistency of certain
                    rules then established on the subject of legal evidence; secret accusations,
                    fictitious crimes, the use of torture as an instrument for the discovery of
                    truth; imprisonment not authorized by law, or of uncertain duration, and the
                    sale of offices of justice; along with other vices in the constitution of the
                    courts. In treating these various topics, he seldom deduces his argument from
                    remote sources, or pursues it to subtile refinements. That some propositions are
                    advanced in the course of the work which are of a questionable nature, cannot be
                    denied; and there are particular illustrations which have an exclusive reference
                    to certain forms of government then existing in the Italian states. But, in
                    general, the author reasons on few and acknowledged principles, and makes his
                    appeal to the universal feelings of mankind. As one of the most important
                    conclusions which result from his reasoning, or rather as concentrating a number
                    of these conclusions, he closes his book with the following proposition: “In
                    order that a punishment may not be an act of violence of one, or of many,
                    against an individual member of society, it is essential that it should be
                    public, prompt, and necessary, the least possible in the given case, and
                    determined by the law.”</p>
                <p part="N">FIis style in this work, with the exception of one or two passages,
                    where he intentionally addresses himself only to the lesser number, is uniformly
                    perspicuous, and, like that of all his other writings, though often eloquent, is
                    unadorned. He employs, in some parts of it, that species of ridicule which, on a
                    similar occasion, had been used with so great effect by Montesquieu. Thus, while
                    treating the subject of torture, he proposes, among others, the following query
                    in the form of a mathematical problem: “The force of the muscles and the
                    sensibility of the nerves of an innocent person being given, it is required to
                    find the degree of pain necessary to make him confess himself guilty of a given
                    crime ?” Peculiar traits of the writer’s dispositions and train of sentiment are
                    likewise to be found in other passages. Thus having, in a later edition, under
                    that part which relates to fraudulent bankruptcy, modified some sentiments which
                    he had originally expressed, but which, on reflection, appeared to himself too
                    severe, he adds, in a note, “I am ashamed of what I formerly wrote on this
                    subject. I have been accused of irréligion without deserving it; I have been
                    accused of disaffection to the government, and deserved it as little; I was
                    guilty of a real attack upon the rights of humanity, and I have been reproached
                    by nobody.”</p>
                <p part="N">If many of the views exhibited in this work are now divested of novelty,
                    and if, through the general adoption of them by the most cultivated nations, we
                    are led to forget that they were once hidden or excluded, such is the fate of
                    all improvement as well as of all discovery. Nor does it detract from the true
                    character of this interesting performance, that in some enlightened countries,
                    and in the more propitious climates of political liberty, many of the important
                    doctrines which it inculcated were already recognised in the systems of the
                        law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">In the
                            most favoured countries of liberty, however, the reception of some of
                            these principles had been comparatively recent; while of others, the
                            establishment seems even yet to be remote. That work which has tended
                            most to diffuse a knowledge of the progress and spirit of the English

                    publicly ' avowed, under a government in whose institutions they had no place,
                    and over whose judicial administration they exercised no influence; and, when
                    the age and country in which he wrote are considered, the boldness of his
                    statements is not less to be admired than the justness of his reasoning. It is
                    his honourable distinction, likewise, and that of the friends who shared his
                    labours and his views, to have preserved, in the prosecution of these objects,
                    an unblemished loyalty towards their prince, and, while combating, with manly
                    perseverance, the errors which prevailed in the fundamental principles of
                    legislation, to have abstained from all attacks which might either directly
                    weaken the authority of the laws, or disturb the administration of the
                    government.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the just exposition given by the author himself, the true
                    tendency of such a work is not to lessen the power of the law, but to increase
                    its influence, inasmuch as opinion has a greater command over the minds of men
                    than force. It has frequently been repeated, indeed, that national manners must
                    precede laws; and in the only allowable sense of that maxim, the same might be
                    said, perhaps, with equal truth, of opinions. But the authority of this <hi
                        rend="italic">dictum,</hi> and the extent to which it may be followed, are
                    not unfrequently mistaken. An important distinction is apt to be overlooked,
                    between those general laws, which, as they are founded in permanent principles
                    of our nature, admit of being drawn from the first springs, but which have been
                    disturbed by ignorance, or a barbarous policy, or the temporary dominion of some
                    prevailing passion—and those artificial or secondary arrangements, which the
                    circumstances and stages of political society may equally render necessary in
                    times of knowledge, and tranquillity, and civilization. It is to the latter
                    class only that the maxim referred to can have any just application. But it may
                    well be questioned, whether, in any case whatever, the popular feeling and
                    opinion should be allowed to precede, by any considerable interval, the act of
                    the legislature. It seems, on the contrary, to be a valuable secret in
                    legislation, and one of its most important ends, to seize the proper moment for
                    accomplishing that union. Above all, it is expedient, in those branches of the
                    law which are interwoven with and derive their support from the moral feelings,
                    that a legislator should seek to anticipate every better tendency of public
                    sentiment. Through want of a well-timed interference in such cases, many
                    advantages are relinquished, as well in the concocting and framing of the laws
                    themselves, as in that silent influence which a well-directed system of
                    jurisprudence carries into the opinions and habits of a community.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the prospects which Beccaria himself entertained as to the probable
                    influence of his work, a judgment may be formed from the sentence of Lord Bacon,
                    which he prefixed to some of the editions, “It is not to be expected in any
                    difficult undertaking, of whatever kind, that the same person who sows the seed
                    should also reap the harvest; but there must, of necessity, be a preparation,
                    and gradual progress to maturity.”</p>
                <p part="N">The book was received in foreign countries with avidity, and procured
                    for its author an immediate and high reputation. “Never,” says a writer in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle, “</hi> did so small a book produce
                    so great an effect.” I he medal given by the Academy of Bern was instantly
                    bestowed upon Beccaria; and the empress Catherine II. invited him to St
                    Petersburg, with the offer of an honourable station at her court; a proposal
                    which was partly the means of procuring him a similar distinction at home. Of
                    the reception which the work obtained in France, particularly among the literary
                    societies of Paris, evidence is afforded by the correspondence of the Baron de
                    Grimm. “This book,” he writes, in a letter dated 1st August 1765* “is by Μ.
                    Beccaria, a Milanese gentleman, who is said bγ some to be an abbé, by others a
                    lawyer, but who, I answer for it, is one of the best heads at this moment in
                    Europe." “You will not find in the Milanese philosopher,” he elsewhere observes,
                        <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> either the pitch or compass of genius which
                    characterize the writings of the President Montesquieu; but you will discover a
                    mind that is luminous, profound, correct, and penetrating.” And he justly adds,
                    that his is one of the few precious books, <hi rend="italic">qui font
                        penser.</hi> It was translated into French by the Abbé Morellet in 1766; and
                    Voltaire soon after published a commentary upon it, under the assumed title of
                        <hi rend="italic">Un Avocat de Besançon.</hi> With respect to the former
                    production, the translator took some liberties with the method and distribution
                    of the work, which were not altogether warrantable. Voltaire’s commentary is
                    written in the light style peculiar to him; and was evidently intended as a
                    vehicle for certain opinions of his own, with which the spirit and object of the
                    original publication are entirely unconnected. But the circumstance itself
                    sufficiently marks the impression which that publication had made, and the
                    prominence of the views which it developed. It was rapidly translated into
                    various other languages; its maxims became a species of current coin through a
                    great part of Europe; and the sanction of the author’s reasoning was thought not
                    unworthy of being resorted to in British tribunals.</p>
                <p part="N">Although followed by many others, Beccaria’s was the first work of note,
                    in which the application of a milder and more sound system of penal
                    jurisprudence was explicitly enforced. Nor would it be at all extravagant to
                    refer some of the great improvements which from this era were successively
                    introduced into the written laws of different European monarchies, to the direct
                    influence of the opinions thus generally diffused. Many such enactments, at
                    least, were from this time promulgated in a tone more consonant than heretofore
                    with the dictates of humanity and equitable rule. Of this description were,
                    among others, not only the <hi rend="italic">urbarium,</hi> or regulations
                    concerning villanage, issued in 1764, by the empress Maria Teresa, but also the
                    more extended designs which took effect, at a somewhat later period, in the
                    various reformed codes, published by the empress Catherine, the emperor Joseph
                    IL, the grand duke of Tuscany, and the Danish government under the
                    administration of the late Count Bernstorf.</p>
                <p part="N">At one period a storm seemed to be preparing against the marquis in his
                    own country, by those who probably intended, in this form, a service to the
                    government; but it was soon dispersed by the authority of the government itself.
                    Beccaria had considered it his duty to communicate to Count Firmiani the offers
                    which had been made to him by the empress Catherine, and the intelligence was
                    transmitted by the viceroy to his own court. The conduct of Prince
                    Kaunitz-Ritzberg, on the occasion, is highly honourable to that minister and to
                    his sovereign. Instead of treating the communication as a matter of no account,
                    he makes it the subject of a long dispatch, and of repeated instructions. In one
                    of these papers, dated 27th April 1767, after requiring particular information
                    respecting the personal character of Beccaria, he adds, “Supposing his good
                    qualities to preponderate, it would be desirable that the country should not
                    lose a man whose fund of knowledge is so considerable, and who, as appears from
                    his book, possesses a mind habituated to reflection, above all in our present
                    penury of thinking and philosophical men; besides that it would do little honour
                    to the whole administration to be anticipated by foreigners in the due <pb

                            part="N">The originals of these dispatches are among the state papers in
                            the public archives of Milan.</p></note> Nor were these merely empty
                    professions; they were almost immediately followed by an imperial order for
                    establishing, in the palatine college at Milan, a professorship of public law
                    and economics, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Scienze Camerali.</hi> To
                    this chair, expressly endowed for him by a distinction so honourable, the
                    marquis was appointed on the 1st of November 1768, and commenced the duties of
                    it in the month of January following. From the preliminary discourse <hi
                        rend="italic">(yproluzwne)</hi> which he pronounced on this occasion, and in
                    which he briefly sets forth the objects of the institution, and some of his own
                    leading opinions regarding them, it appears that the only instructions which he
                    received from the regency on his appointment, consisted in an order to deliver
                    his discourses in the vulgar tongue; an injunction of which the motives are
                    honourable to that government, in common with all the circumstances attending
                    this transaction. His lectures, which he received a special permission to
                    deliver in his own house, attracted much notice. They were not published during
                    his life; but have since appeared, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Elementi
                        di Economia Pubblieα,</hi> in the compilation of the <hi rend="italic"

                            1776.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">As he had, in his former work, set out with stating the object of
                    municipal law to be “the greatest happiness of the greatest number,” so here the
                    same universal principle serves him for a guide; and he assumes it as the aim of
                    public economy “to provide with peace and safety, things necessary and
                    convenient for the whole community.” He classes the objects of political economy
                    under five heads; agriculture, manufactures, comm’erce, finance, and policy;
                    comprehending, under the latter, those laws and institutions which have a
                    respect to the sciences, to education, to police in the modern sense of that
                    word, and to the various means of public defence and security. The design was
                    not completed; no trace, at least, appears in the work published under the above
                    title relative to the subjects of finance or public policy.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Some of the others, too, are
                            treated rather briefly. ITehas himself defended this method of teaching
                            by the following just and striking observations, in that part of the
                            work where he discourses of <hi rend="italic">Interest:</hi> “But woe to
                            the teacher who would say all that is to bε said, and leave nothing to
                            the penetration of the learner. What is heard slips away and vanishes
                            from the hearer’s mind, unless he has an opportunity of opposing the
                            re-action, as it were, of his own intellect, to the impressions of his
                            instructor; and more light is.thrown upon a science by one process of
                            exact reasoning which we carry on for ourselves, and it is more deeply
                            and firmly rooted in us by that single operation, than by many and
                            repeated trains of reasoning conducted by another.”</p></note> In
                    estimating the value of these speculations, it is no less necessary than in the
                    case of the former work, to consider them with a reference to the state of
                    science at the time, rather than to the present extension of knowledge in this
                    department. Under the first three divisions he enters at considerable length
                    into some of the most interesting discussions which have arisen in this wide
                    field; particularly as to the principles of public policy in regard to
                    agriculture, to the commerce of grain, and foreign commerce generally, and to
                    money and exchange.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Under the head of Agriculture, he proposes the scheme of an
                            experimental farm to be carried on at the public expense, as a school of
                            that science, and enters into some detail of its objects and
                            regulations.</p></note> In perspicuity of language, and distinct and
                    patient illustration, the style of these discourses bears a considerable
                    resemblance to that of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations;</hi> but the
                    coincidence between the two works, in some general and fundamental doctrines, is
                    still more remarkable and interesting. Beccaria does not appear to have adopted
                    the particular theory of the French economists, which was developed about that
                    time; although his practical doctrines on some of the most important points were
                    conformable to the conclusions deduced from that system.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">Among other inferences, to which the course of his reasoning leads him,
                    as it were, by many different roads, may be noticed one, which he has himself
                    ventured to state as a general proposition, and which marks the caution as well
                    as enlargement of his mind in subjects of complicated inquiry. “Every
                    restriction on freedom,” he observes, “whether in the case of commerce or any
                    other, ought to be a result from the necessity of preventing an actual disorder,
                    not the effect of a purpose or aim at amelioration.” And he has repeated the
                    same doctrine under different views in various other passages.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">For example,
                            “The operations of Economics amount only to not permitting, and most
                            frequently to letting alone.”</p></note> On all these subjects he
                    exercises, without ostentation, the privilege of examining and judging for
                    himself; and in doing so, although he expresses himself with plainness and
                        energy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >“Con un non fanatico vigore,” as he has himself somewhere expressed it.
                            But on occasions where he conceived that there might be a danger of
                            inflaming the passions, he has claimed the tribute due to him for
                            employing a style “beyond the reach of the uninormed and impatient
                            multitude.”</p></note> he is never dogmatical. He observes this further
                    dictate of a sound philosophy,—to refrain as long as possible from any very
                    general conclusions; and, although he appears to have disengaged his mind from
                    the power of common and hereditary notions respecting political economy, he does
                    not, by a transition too often made, substitute dangerous or extravagant
                    positions in their place. He is even more distinguished by the temperate use
                    which he makes of his liberty, than by the independence which secured him from
                    the chain.</p>
                <p part="N">During the same period in which he pursued these labours, Beccaria
                    undertook another literary task of a very different description, and commenced
                    an <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature of Style.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    this <hi rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> was published in 1770; but the author does

                    of the connection subsisting between the study of the fine arts, and that of
                    moral and political science, affords a pleasing proof of the natural
                    expansiveness of his mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p part="N">His scientific and literary studies were now to be interrupted, however,
                    by new and more flattering marks of distinction from his government. By an
                    imperial order of the 29th April 1771, he was appointed a member of the Supreme
                    Economic Council; on the suppression of which, he was transferred to the
                    magistracy of state; and, lastly, by a dispatch of the 17th January 1791, he was
                    named one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195893?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-5893-0506"/> of the Board for Reform of the Judicial Code,
                    civil and criminal. His activity and usefulness in the discharge of these great
                    trusts are best proved by the circumstance, that some of the most important
                    matters in those different departments were committed to his direction, and
                    regulated by his counsels. The most remarkable of his state papers were, various
                        <hi rend="italic">Ordinances</hi> relative to the grain; a very important
                        <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> transmitted to the Court in 1771, which gave
                    rise to the reform of the public money in 1778; a <hi rend="italic">Plan</hi>
                    proposed in 1780 for effecting a uniformity in the weights and measures; and
                    certain <hi rend="italic">Proposals,</hi> in 1786, founded on the tables of the
                    population. His writings of this description are characterized by method,
                    perspicuity, and precision. It deserves to be particularly noticed respecting
                    his scheme for the equalization of measures, that, of the different natural
                    bases for exact measurement, he explicitly recommends that which may be obtained
                    from the celestial bodies, and, in the Application of it, proposes to employ the
                    decimal method of division; being the same system which was afterwards adopted
                    by the late government of France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            this subject, he was assisted, as he himself states, by Frisi, Professor
                            of Mathematics at Pisa; and in the mechanical part by his brother
                            Annibale.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1776 Beccaria made a journey to France, in company with his
                    friend Alessandro Verri. He remained at Paris for about three weeks, which he
                    passed chiefly in the society of D’Alembert and other eminent men of letters;
                    and, on his return, he visited Voltaire. This journey seems to have been the
                    only considerable incident which, during a period of twenty-five years,
                    diversified his manner of life, or interrupted his official duties. He died of
                    apoplexy, in the year 1793. According to the editor of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elementi,</hi> in 1804, his death was unnoticed by his country, and his
                    tomb remained without a name or an epitaph.</p>
                <p part="N">Beccaria was twice married. He was steđfast in his friendships; modest,
                    but tenacious of his opinions. He took pleasure in the society of literary men,
                    and avoided that of the great. It is related of him, that the king of Naples,
                    while at Milan, twice attempted to visit him at his house; but that the marquis
                    found means, on both occasions, to escape the honour intended for him by his
                    majesty. His exertions in the service of the public, and, above all, his earnest
                    endeavours to promote, by every means, the cause of science, and a liberal
                    system of education, formed the chief feature of his life. On the latter topic
                    he has made many forcible and eloquent appeals, in the course of his different
                    writings; and some passages of this description, which are interspersed in his
                    discourses of Political Economy, are not less to be admired for their intrinsic
                    excellence, than they are interesting from the circumstances in which they were
                    written, and the contrasts which they indirectly exhibit.</p>
                <p part="N">One trait of his constitutional disposition or confirmed habit has been
                    recorded, as furnishing a remarkable exception to the general vigour of his
                    intellectual character, —that, notwithstanding the force with which he combated
                    the prejudices and unreasonable apprehensions of other men, he was himself
                    subject, when left alone, to an unconquerable timidity. We are not told whether
                    this tendency was ascribed to early habits and a faulty education, or supposed
                    to be the consequence of some sudden and fatal impression, which remained
                    indissolubly associated with certain outward circumstances, or in what other
                    manner it was formed and perpetuated. On a superficial view, it seems to denote
                    a mind radically weak. But this is not a necessary or a just inference. The fact
                    is, indeed, singular, and deeply impressive; but, in truth, it only serves as a
                    new example to prove how mixed is the nature of our frame; how imperfectly the
                    understanding acts upon the will, and the will upon the moral part; and how many
                    things appear to be within the jurisdiction of our reason which, nevertheless,
                    are superior to its control.</p>
                <p part="N">This is not the place to engage in a more particular examination of the
                    spirit and scope of Beccaria’s writings. He is said to have expressed, at least
                    during the early part of his life, too unqualified an approbation of the works
                    of Helvetius, and others belonging to the same school of philosophy. On this
                    score some excuse may, perhaps, be found for him in the attractions which the
                    style of the author now mentioned possesses for a youthful and ardent mind. It
                    is to be observed, likewise, that, when he expressed this admiration of the
                    productions alluded to, the <hi rend="italic">Systeme de la Nature</hi> had not
                    yet made its appearance. Nor is it to be supposed that he could be insensible to
                    the notice and the applause of such men as then held the stations of greatest
                    eminence in the scientific world. Yet whatever temptations he may have been
                    exposed to from the influence of some of his literary associates, it is
                    consolatory to reflect, that, neither in the works which he himself gave to the
                    public, nor in those which have been brought to light since his death, are
                    sentiments to be found which have a tendency to subvert any one foundation of
                    private or of public good. His labours were beneficent, and their natural fruits
                    the dissemination of useful knowledge, the increase of industry, and the
                    improvement of social order. But he was not fated to witness the spectacle which
                    ensued, or to be an observer of that moral crisis, of the results of which it
                    may be questioned, if, hitherto, they have less disturbed the calculations of
                    the friends of humanity, than baffled the counsels of its foes.</p>

                <p part="N">The accurate and elaborate experiments related in these works obtained
                    for their author the warm and repeated encomiums of the scientific historian Dr
                    Priestley, and the approbation and friendship of other contemporary
                    philosophers; although it must be confessed that, amidst the multitude of
                    important facts recorded in them, we sometimes observe a want of clearness of
                    arrangement and closeness of reasoning; nor must we attempt to claim for
                    Beccaria either the originality of a Franklin, the mathematical precision of an
                    AEpinus, the enlarged views of a Cavendish, or the neatness and inventive talent
                    of a Volta. The most remarkable novelties which deserve to be distinguished
                    among our author’s experiments and opinions relate to the limited conducting
                    power of water, to the electrification of the air and smoke, to the velocity of
                    electricity, to the reduction of metals by its powers, to the illumination of
                    the solar phosphori by the spşrk, to the light excited by the motion of thê air,
                    and to a variety of meteorological phenomena, especially lightning, storms,
                    rain, water-spouts, ' and atmospherical magnetism. The resistance exhibited by
                    water to the passage of the electric fluid is demonstrated by the luminous
                    appearance of its path, while it passes through more perfect conductors without
                    producing light, as well as by the explosion of glass tubes containing water,
                    through which the spark is taken; and this experiment is extended to the
                    construction of an electrical water-gun, which is said to have carried a small
                    bullet with considerable force.</p>
                <p part="N">Father Beccaria observed, about the same time with Mr Canton, that the
                    air surrounding an electrified body was capable of becoming electric by slow
                    degrees, and that it also parted slowly with its electricity; and, by means of
                    some property of this kind, he produced the appearance of a luminous atmosphere
                    about an electrified ball, to which another was presented, in a partial vacuum.
                    1he smoke of colophony, surrounding an electrified body, enabled it to give
                    longer sparks; but this smoke was little attracted by the body when the heated
                    spoon containing the colophony was insulated. Respecting the velocity of
                    electricity, he relates some experiments, which amply deserve to be confirmed or
                    confuted. He found the effect of a spark occupy at least half a second in
                    passing through 500 feet of wäre, and six and a half through a hempen cord of
                    the same length, although when the cord was wetted, it passed through it in two
                    or three seconds. It is well known, that, in the earlier experiments of Watson,
                    a shock was transmitted through a much longer circuit of wire, without occupying
                    any perceptible interval of time <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> its passage.
                    Many of the metals were revived from their oxyds, and mercury was reproduced
                    from cinnabar by the powers of electricity; and our author fancied that he had
                    discovered a common principle in the different metals, as several of them gave
                    the same colour to the urfące of the glass to which they were attached. The
                    brilliancy of the electric light was demonstrated by the permanency of its
                    effect on the solar phosphori; and this <hi rend="superscript"> su</hi> ⅛ect was
                    afterwards pursued by various experiments of Canton and others. The light often
                    exhibited by the air rushing into a vacuum is attributed by Beccaria to the
                    friction of the air against the sides of the glass. It may be remarked that the
                    phenomenon is, in all probability, of the same kind as the appearance of light
                    observed long ago in the air-gun by its first inventor, Ctesibius of Alexandria.
                    With respect to atmospherical electricity, Beccaria’s researches were most
                    laborious and extensive, and he made a great variety of experiments illustrative
                    of the nature of lightning, and of storms in general; showing, for instance, the
                    facility with which small bodies are forced into the course of the electric
                    current, as light clouds are made to assist in conveying a stroke of lightning;
                    and proving that evaporation, and the deposition of vapour, are always
                    accompanied by electrical changes. Thunderstorms, in general, he attributes to
                    terrestrial electricity, and supposes the clouds to be merely the channels by
                    which the fluid is carried from one part of the earth’s surface to another, the
                    equilibrium having been first disturbed by chemical changes within the earth;
                    and it must be confessed that this opinion is in some measure countenanced by
                    the frequent connection which is observable between these phenomena and those of
                    earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Water-spouts, he assures us on the authority
                    of several eye-witnesses, may certainly be dispersed by pointing swords and
                    knives at them; and, with respect to conductors erected for safety, though he
                    appreciates their utility very highly, he thinks that every large building
                    should be furnished with more than one or two. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >electricitas vindex,</hi> so often mentioned, is the electricity made
                    sensible in one body by the removal of another which has been situated near
                    it;—a property which afterwards led to the elegant inventions of the
                    electrophorus and the condenser of Wilke and Volta. Our author appears to be
                    somewhat disposed to exaggerate the importance of electrical changes as the
                    causes of other atmospherical phenomena, and, in particular, to overrate the
                    intimacy of the connection of electricity with magnetism. The appearance of the
                        <hi rend="italic">aurora borealis</hi> he attributes to the circulation of
                    electricity through the higher regions of the atmosphere, and he was well aware
                    of the magnetical changes which usually accompany this remarkable
                    occurrence.</p>

                    are all in Latin. The first is entitled <hi rend="italic">Experiments in
                        Electricity, in a Letter to Dr Franhliη. {Phil. Trans.</hi> 1760, p. 514.)
                    These experiments relate principally to the subject of electrical attractions
                    and repulsions, which the author attempts to reduce to the effect of currents of
                    air displaced by the immediate action of the electric fluid. He supposes the air
                    between two bodies, in dissimilar states, to be rarefied by the interchange of
                    their electricity, so as to produce the appearance of attraction; and when the
                    bodies are in similar states, he imagines the air interposed to be the immediate
                    object of their apparently mutual repulsion. The paper is accompanied by a note
                    of Dr Franklin, explanatory of the apparatus employed.</p>

                    been observed by Huygens. Beccaria seems to have imagined that it was not
                    discoverable when the surfaces concerned were parallel to each other; but later
                    observations have shown that his observations were defective in this respect, at
                    the same time that they have confirmed his conjecture respecting the existence
                    of a similar property in almost all crystallized substances.</p>

                    cases of the excitement of positive or negative electricity by the friction of
                    different substances with glass, hare-skin, a silk stocking, sealing-wax, and
                    sulphur.</p>

                    an account of a repetition of experiments on the modification produced in the
                    charge of two or more glass plates, by separating them, and by removing and
                    replacing their coatings. These investigations were principally suggested by the
                    well-known observations of the Jesuits, made at Pekin many years before, and by
                    some subsequent experiments of Mr Symmer. The author calls the effect an
                    oscillation of electricity; it depends on the same causes as the “vindicating
                    electricity,” which he has elsewhere described.</p>

                    discussed, but not with great precision: the author adverts, however, to the
                    Newtonian demonstration of the equilibrium of the force of a gravitating
                    substance, distributed through the surface of a sphere, with respect to a
                    particle within it, and gives somewhat clearer views of the theory of
                    electricity than his former works had exhibited, but still falls far short of
                    the perfection which AEpinus had attained more than ten years before.</p>

                    212. Our author admitted the sun’s light through green, red, and yellow glass,
                    and found that the pieces of sulphu-reted lime exposed to it emitted only a
                    light similar to that which had been thrown on them. A multiplicity of later
                    experiments have however shown, that the contrary result is by far the most
                    common; and Zanotti’s earlier observations have been fully confirmed by Wilson,
                    Grosser, and Seebeck.</p>
                <p part="N">11. In 1759 Beccaria received orders from his sovereign, in consequence
                    of a suggestion of Boscovich, to measure the length of a degree of the meridian
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of Turin: the measurement was completed in 1768,
                    and an account of it was published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Gradus
                        Taurinensis,</hi> Turin, 1774, 4to; prefaced by a proper compliment to the
                    memory of the monarch who patronized the undertaking, and to the virtues of his
                    successors, under whose auspices it was completed. The result did not, however,
                    exhibit the appearance of any great accuracy or good fortune; for there is not
                    only a difference of one seventieth of the whole in the lengths of the degree
                    computed from the northern and southern portions of the arc, of 27' and 4P
                    respectively, but the length deduced from the whole arc, which is 57468∙59
                    French toises, is 445 toises more than would be inferred from other measurements
                    in the neighbouring latitudes; hence it appears to have been thought necessary
                    by later astronomers to reject the northern portion altogether, and to make some
                    corrections in the calculation from the southern, by which the length of the
                    degree has been reduced to 57069 toises. The zenith sector employed for the
                    observations was made on Boscovich’s construction, the length of the tangent
                    being measured instead of that of the arc, a method by no means calculated to
                    lessen the chances of error. A portable syphon barometer is also described, by
                    means of which the elevations were ascertained; and a number of heights of
                    places in the mountains of Piedmont are recorded.</p>

                    have been little for a biographer to relate: his ambition having been in a great
                    measure limited, by the religious profession which he had adopted, to the
                    acquirement of literary celebrity, his taste was guided by his prevailing
