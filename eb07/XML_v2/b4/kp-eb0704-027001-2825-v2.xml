                    continent from the AEgean Sea to the Euphrates, bent his march towards Babylon.
                    Nabonadius, hearing of his march, immediately advanced against him with an army.
                    In the engagement which ensued, the Babylonians were defeated; and the king,
                    retreating to his metropolis, was blocked up and closely besieged by Cyrus. The
                    reduction of this city was no easy enterprise. The walls were of a prodigious
                    height, the number of men employed to defend them was great, and the place was
                    stored with all sorts of provisions for twenty years. Cyrus, despairing of being
                    able to take such a city by storm, caused a line of circumvallation to be drawn
                    quite round it, with a large and deep ditch; reckoning that if all communication
                    with the country were cut off, the besieged would be obliged to surrender
                    through famine. That his troops might not be too much fatigued, he divided his
                    army into twelve bodies, appointing each body its month to guard the trenches;
                    but the besieged, looking upon themselves as out of all danger by reason of
                    their high walls and magazines, insulted him from the ramparts, and looked upon
                    all the trouble he gave himself as so much unprofitable labour.</p>
                <p part="N">After Cyrus had spent two whole years before Babylon, without making any
                    progress in the siege, he at last thought of the following stratagem, which put
                    him in possession of it He was informed that a great annual solemnity was to be
                    held at Babylon, and that the inhabitants on that occasion were accustomed to
                    spend the whole night in drinking and debauchery. This he therefore thought a
                    proper time for surprising them; and accordingly sent a strong detachment to the
                    head of the canal leading to the great lake, with orders, at a certain time, to
                    break down the great bank which was between the lake and the canal, and to turn
                    the whole current into the lake. At the same time he stationed one body of
                    troops at the place where the river entered the city, and another where it came
                    out; ordering them to march in by the bed of the river as soon as they should
                    find it fordable. Towards the evening he opened the head of the trenches on both
                    sides of the river above the city, that the water might discharge itself into
                    them; by which means, and the breaking down of the great dam, the river was soon
                    drained. Then the two bodies of troops above-mentioned, according to their
                    orders, entered the channel, the one commanded by Gobryas and the other by
                    Ga-dates; and finding the gates all left open in consequence of the disorders of
                    that riotous night, they penetrated into the very heart of the city without
                    opposition, and meeting, according to agreement, at the palace, they surprised
                    the guards and cut them in pieces. Those who were in the palace opening the
                    gates to know the cause of this confusion, the Persians rushed in, took the
                    palace, and killed the king, who came out to meet them sword in hand. Thus an
                    end was put to the Babylonian empire; and Cyrus took possession of Babylon for
                    one called in Scripture Darius the Mede, most probably Cyaxares II., uncle to
                    Cyrus. From this time Babylonia never was erected into a distinct kingdom, but
                    has always followed the fortune of those great conquerors who at different times
                    have appeared in Asia. It is now subject to the Turks.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the manners, customs, and institutions of the Babylonians, and of the
                    nature of their country, a very clear account has been given by Μ.
                    Sabbathier.</p>
                <p part="N">“As all the nations under the dominion of Cyrus, beside the ordinary
                    tributes, were obliged to maintain him and his army, the monarch and his troops
                    were supported by all Asia. The country of Babylon alone was obliged to maintain
                    him four months of the year; its fertility, therefore, yielded a third of the
                    produce of Asia. The government of this country, which the Persians termed <hi
                        rend="italic">satrapy,</hi> was richer and more extensive than any of the
                    rest. It maintained for the king, besides the war-horses, a stud of 800
                    stallions and 16,000 mares. So great a number of Indian dogs were likewise bred
                    in this province for the king, that four of its cities kept those animals; and
                    in return, they were exempted from all taxes and tributes.</p>
                <p part="N">“It rained very seldom in this country, according to Herodotus. The
                    earth was watered by the river, which was here diffused by human industry, as
                    the Nile is over Egypt by nature; for all the country of Babylon was divided by
                    canals, the greatest of which was navigable, and flowed from south to north,
                    from the Euphrates to the Tigris. In short, it was one of the finest countries
                    for corn in the world; but for producing trees, the fig-tree, the vine, and the
                    olive, it was not famous. It was so luxuriant in grain, that it commonly yielded
                    a hundred times more than what was sown; and in good years it yielded three
                    hundred times more than it received. The leaves of its wheat and barley were
                    four inches broad. ‘ Though I know,’ says Herodotus, ‘ that the millet and the
                    sesame of that country grow to the size of trees, I will not describe them
                    particularly, lest those who have not been in Babylonia should think my account
                    fabulous.</p>
                <p part="N">“They had no oil but what they made from Indian corn. The country
                    abounded with palm-trees, which grew spontaneously; and most of them bore fruit,
                    of which the inhabitants made bread, wine, and honey. They cultivated these
                    trees and their fig-trees in the same manner. Some of them, as of other trees,
                    the Greeks called wιo⅛ ones. They tied the fruit of the male to the trees which
                    bore dates; that the musquitto, leaving the male, might cause the date to ripen,
                    by penetrating it; for without that assistance it did not come to maturity.
                    Mus-quittoes bred in the male palms as in the wild fig-trees.</p>

                <p part="N">"But we must not here omit to give an account of the peculiar and
                    surprising construction of their boats of skins, in which they sailed along the
                    river to Babylon. These boats were invented by the Armenians, whose country lay
                    north from Babylonia. They made them with poles of willow, which they bent, and
                    covered with skins; the bare side of the skins they put outwards; and they made
                    them so tight that they resembled boards. The boats had neither prow nor stern,
                    but were of a round form like a buckler. They put straw on the bottom. Two men,
                    each with an oar, rowed them down the river, laden with different wares, but
                    chiefly with palm wine. Of these boats some were very large and some very small:
                    the largest carried the weight of 500 talents. There was room for an ass in one
                    of their small boats; they put many into a large one. When they had unloaded,
                    after their arrival at Babylon, they sold the poles of their boats and the
                    straw, and loading their asses with the skins, returned to Armenia; for they
                    could not sail up the river, its current was so rapid. For this reason they made
                    their boats of skins instead of wood; and on their return to Armenia with their
                    asses, they applied the skins to their former use.</p>
                <p part="N">“As to their dress, they wore a linen shirt, which came down to their
                    feet. Over it they wore a woollen robe; their outer garment was a white vest.
                    Their shoes resembled those of the Thebans. They let their hair grow. On their
                    heads they wore a turban. They rubbed their bodies all over with fragrant
                    liquors. Each man had a ring on his finger, and an elegant cane in his hand,
                    with an apple at the top, or <hi rend="italic">a rose,</hi> a lily, or an eagle,
                    or some other figure; for they were not suffered to use canes without
                    devices.</p>
                <p part="N">“With regard to their policy, Herodotus thinks that their best law was
                    one which the Heneti, an Illyrian people, likewise observed in every town and
                    village. When the girls were marriageable, they were ordered to meet in a
                    certain place, where the young men likewise assembled. They were then sold by
                    the public crier: but he first sold the most beautiful one. When he had sold her
                    at an immense price, he put up others to sale, according to their degrees of
                    beauty. The rich Babylonians were emulous to carry off the finest women, who
                    were sold to die highest bidders. But as the young men who were poor could not
                    aspire to have fine women, they were content to take the ugliest with the money
                    which was given them; for when the crier had sold the handsomest, he ordered the
                    ugliest of all the women to be brought, and asked if any one was willing to take
                    her with a small sum of money. Thus she became the wife of him who was most
                    easily satisfied; and thus the finest women were sold, and from the money which
                    they brought, small fortunes were given to the ugliest, and to those who had any
                    bodily infirmity. A father could not marry his daughter as he pleased; nor was
                    he who brought her allowed i take her home, without giving security that he
                    would marry her. But, after the sale, if the parties were not agreeable to each
                    other, the law enjoined that the purchase-money should be restored. The
                    inhabitants of any of their towns were permitted to marry wives at these aucuns.
                    Such were the early customs of the Babylonians.</p>
                <p part="N">“But they afterwards made a law, which prohibited ne inhabitants of
                    different towns from intermarrying, and y which husbands were punished for

                    a sensible custom among the Babylonians, worthy to be related. They brought

                    horum, to consult those who passed on their diseases; for they had no

                    sick, if they had ever had the same distemper; if they knew any one who had had
                    it; and how he was cured. Hence, in this country, every one who saw a sick
                    person was obliged to go to him and inquire into his distemper.</p>
                <p part="N">“They embalmed their dead with honey, and their mourning was like that

                    lived only upon fish, and who prepared them in the following manner: they dried
                    them in the sun, and then beat them in a mortar to a kind of flour, which, after
                    they had sifted through linen, they baked into rolls.</p>
                <p part="N">“The Babylonians at first worshipped only the sun and the moon; but they
                    soon multiplied their divinities. They deified Baal, Bel, or Belus, one of their
                    kings, and Merodach-Baladan. They also worshipped Venus under the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Mylittα.</hi> She and Belus were the principal deities of the
                    Babylonians. They counted their day from sunrise to sunrise. They solemnized
                    five days of the year with great magnificence, and almost the same ceremonies
                    with which the Romans celebrated their Saturnalia.</p>
                <p part="N">“The Babylonians were very much addicted to judicial astrology. Their
                    priests, who openly professed that art, were obliged to commit to writing all
                    the events of the lives of their illustrious men; and on a fancied connection
                    between those events and the motions of the heavenly bodies the principles of
                    their art were founded. They pretended that some of their books, in which their
                    historical transactions and revolutions were accurately compared with the
                    courses of the stars, were thousands of years old. This assertion of their
                    judicial astrologers we may reasonably dispute; but that their astronomers had
                    made a long series of observations, is incontestably true. It is certain that
                    some of these were extant in the days of Aristotle, and that they were older
                    than the empire of the Babylonians.” (See <hi rend="italic">History of</hi><hi
