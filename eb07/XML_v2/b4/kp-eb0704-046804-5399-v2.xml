                <p part="N"><label type="entry">BAZEEGURS</label>, a tribe of Indians, inhabiting
                    different parts of the peninsula of Hindostan. The appearance and manners of
                    mankind are so much diversified in the various countries where they dwell, that
                    animated controversies have been excited, whether all have had a common origin;
                    or whether they have sprung from protoplasts whose conformation, at the
                    beginning of the world, was dissimilar. Some maintain, that, in consequence of
                    the changes produced by situation, climate, and circumstances, the present
                    generations may possibly exhibit figures and proportions altogether different
                    from those that distinguished their ancestors thousands of years ago; while
                    others hold that no such differences could appear, unless they had actually
                    formed part of the original conformation of a race. The partisans of either
                    theory have appealed to that uniformity of features and customs known to be
                    continued among tribes, who preserve their own descent pure and unmixed with
                    others, of which the Jews constitute a striking example; and a case something
                    similar, though not equally prominent, is that of the Bazeegurs. This class of
                    people is recognised by several appellations, as Bazeegurs, Panchperee, Kunjura,
                    or Nuts; they follow a mode of life distinguishing them from the Hindoos, among
                    whom they dwell; they also abstain from intermixing their families with the
                    Hindoos, and from any intereourse by which they can be united. The name Bazeegur
                    is said to signify a juggler; and some etymologists find a probable derivation
                    of conjuror from Kunjura, which might certainly find a corroboration from the
                    similarity of professions. In India they are dispersed throughout the whole
                    country, partly in wandering tribes, partly adhering to fixed residenees, but
                    the greater proportion lead a nomadic life. '</p>
                <p part="N">The Bazecgurs are divided into seven castes, Charee, Athbhyeea, Bynsa,
                    Purbuttee, Kalkoor, Dorkinee, and Gurgwar; but all these are the same people,
                    intermarrying as such, and avoiding alliances with other tribes. According to
                    their own traditions, they are descended from four brothers, who, finding it
                    difficult to provide for their numerous followers, resolved to separate, and to
                    direct their course respectively to each quarter of the world. In cotise-1
                    quence of this one of them, named Sa, arrived in Bengal from Gazecpour or
                    Allahabad. He took up his abode at Hoogly, and having governed his tribe
                    peaceably during many years, died at Uncourpoor, whither his posterity still
                    repair to offer up their prayers to his manes. Sa left three sons who succeeded
                    each other; and the succession having afterwards regularly passed through
                    several generations, at length devolved to Munbhungee, many years ago. At the
                    same time some of the castes considered a woman called Toota as the chief of the
                    whole; but the power ascribed to the chief seems merely nominal, scarcely
                    amounting to restraint, and not at all to coercion. Munbhungee only resisted the
                    entrance of any of the people acknowledging the superiority of Toota, to seek a
                    livelihood in the territory occupied by his own sect; and the latter were under
                    the same prohibition with respect to the places frequented by hcr and her
                    dependents. Besides those who are united into sets or castes, there are
                    individuals who wander about endeavouring to pick up a precarious
                    livelihood.</p>
                <p part="N">It is not evident, although the Bazeegurs are certainly distinguished by
                    their manners and customs from the natives of Hindostan, that thcir features
                    discriminate them as a separate race. Some of their women are reputed very
                    beautiful, and arc thence sought after in those temporary alliances common in
                    the East. The manners of the Panchperec are somewhat different from those of the
                    Bazeegurs, and some of the sects are more civilized than others. It has already
                    been observed that they are not in the exclusive occupation of any district in
                    particular, but their villages or respective quarters are found in the same
                    places as those of the Hindoos or British settlers. The Panchperec form neat
                    little encampments in the upper provinces; their huts are small and regular, and
                    each is surrounded by a small inclosure or court-yard, generally disposed in
                    such a manner that the whole hamlet, formed of portable matting, obtains a kind
                    of circumvallation by means of them.</p>
                <p part="N">The Bazeegurs, more especially distinguished by that name, are the most
                    civilized of the whole; they are Mahommcdans in food, apparel, and religion. The
                    Panch-pcree profess no system of faith in preference, adopting that of any
                    village indifferently, whither their wanderings may guide them. Some traverse
                    the country as Mahommedan Fakeers, and live on the ill-directed bounty of
                    devotees; and a particular association among them, of bad repute or abject
                    superstition, has been accused of sacrificing human victims. Notwithstanding
                    their ignorance of the established religions, they seem to venerate a female
                    deity, Kali, probably the sanguinary goddess of the Hindoos, and many perhaps in
                    this way seek to purchase her protection. The Bazcegurs arc circumcised, and
                    have priests to officiate at their marriages and funerals; but their knowledge
                    of the prophet Mahomet is very imperfect, for they can give little account of
                    him, except that he was a saint. They secm to acknowledge an omnipotent Being,
                    and conceive that all nature is animated by one universal spirit, which the
                    soul, as being part of it, will rejoin after death. At the birth of their
                    children, some Brahmin, supposed an adept in astrology, is called in to aid them
                    in choosing a propitious name.</p>
                <p part="N">Among the Panchperee, the marriage ceremony is commenced by the
                    bridegroom repairing to the hut of his elect, and calling aloud for her to be
                    delivered to him. A near relation, guarding the door, resists his entrance, and
                    rudely pushes him away, while he is the object of taunts and jocularity; but
                    when his patience is supposed to have been sufficiently put to the test, the
                    bride is brought out. Both receive an exhortation from the priest to p <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ril</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιs</hi>, <hi
                        rend="superscript"> e</hi> mutual kindness; and the bridegroom, marking the
                    bride s <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195412?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-5412-0469"/>face with ochre, declares her his wedded wife;
                    and she, on her part, does the same in return. The little fingers of their hands
                    are now joined, and a scene of merriment, from which the bride alone is
                    exempted, commences. But this consists chiefly in the progress to intoxication,
                    for all these people are addicted to the most immoderate use of spirits; and
                    after copious libations, a cavalcade, formed of the two parties, whose little
                    fingers are again joined, and their parents and friends, departs for the hut of
                    the bridegroom. Before the door there are some enigmatical ceremonies performed;
                    the mother of the bridegroom advances with a sieve containing rice, paint, and
                    grass, with which the foreheads of the couple are touched, after being waved
                    around them; and the bride is led into the house, before which there stands a
                    small fresh branch of the mango tree in an earthen pot of water. The meaning of
                    these ceremonies is not well understood; and it is to be observed, that the
                    origin of most of the customs of the modern races of mankind is lost in the
                    darkness of antiquity. Some of the peasantry in Britain have various ceremonies
                    both at marriages and funerals, such as breaking a cake above the head of the
                    bride, or strewing flowers on the bier of one deceased, which have descended
                    from remote ages, and arose from sources at this day unknown. When these
                    ceremonies are completed among the Bazeegurs, a new scene of mirth is resumed;
                    and towards evening, for the whole day from the breaking of dawn is thus
                    occupied, the bride is conducted to her own hut, when those who are able retire;
                    but the majority, and in general the bridegroom among them, pass the night in a
                    state of insensibility on the neighbouring plain.</p>
                <p part="N">From the earliest period they are accustomed to intoxicating draughts;
                    even infants of five or six months old are supplied with spirits, though their
                    mothers suckle them during five or six years; and it is not uncommon to observe
                    several children of different ages hanging on their mother, and struggling to
                    extract their scanty portion of nourishment, which is gradually diminished by
                    her own insatiable propensities to the same beverage. Many of the sects are very
                    indiscriminate in food; scarcely any thing is rejected; dead horses, jackals,
                    and bullocks, are alike acceptable; and it has been suspected that they can even
                    enjoy a repast of human flesh. However, this fact is not authenticated, and if
                    analogical reasoning may be admitted here, we should be inclined to deny it,
                    because there is no proof that any tribe, however savage, is addicted to
                    anthropophagy, if dwelling among a more civilized people.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief occupation of the Bazeegurs seems to consist in feats of
                    address and agility to amuse the public, in which both males and females are
                    equally skilful. The former are extremely athletic, and the women are taught
                    dancing, which, instead of the graceful motions seen in the north, consists
                    there principally in a display of lascivious gestures. Most, if not all, the men
                    are jugglers, tumblers, and actors, in which they are very adroit. The people of
                    each sect, or dramatis personae, are hired out by <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    sirdar or manager of a company, for a definite period, generally one year, after
                    which they are at liberty to join <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> y other party.
                    But no person can establish a set of actors without permission from the Nardar
                    Boutah, a chief θι the Bazeegurs, who receives a proportion of the profits, and
                    a tribute or tax from each female, somewhat analogous to what was called
                    milk-money, a revenue levied by Ce Holy See from licenses to prostitutes. On the
                    return θ a party from an excursion, this money is paid to the árdar Boutah, who
                    convenes his people, and they connue feasting until the whole is expended.
                    Should any <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> γ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>. <hi
                        rend="superscript"> e</hi> managers be suspected of giving an unfair account
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> his profits, a court is assembled, where the
                    accused must undergo the ordeal of applying his tongue to a piece of red-hot
                    iron. It thus appears that these tribes have a kind of civil government among
                    themselves; that each of five sets, at Calcutta at least, has a sirdar or ruler,
                    and that the whole are subject to the Nardar Boutah. These sirdars and the chief
                    apparently constitute a court for the trial of any infringement of their
                    regulations, which may be followed by punishment. Thus if, on application of the
                    red-hot iron, the suspected manager be burnt, he is declared guilty of a fraud,
                    which is expiated by a fine, and, if it be an aggravated offence, by the
                    additional punishment of having-his nose rubbed on the ground. The same penalty
                    is attached to disclosures to strangers of matters which it is the interest of
                    the tribe to conceal. The fine is generally converted into liquor; but should
                    the offender be either unable or unwilling to discharge it immediately, he is
                    banished from all society, or he is universally execrated, and even his wife and
                    children avoid him. He soon finds compliance indispensable, and although the
                    Bazeegurs pique themselves on their honesty, it is conjectured that on such
                    occasions they do not entertain many scruples in acquiring what is so essential
                    to avert the indignation of their fellows. The mulct being paid, is converted to
                    the general behoof, and affords a new opportunity for gratifying the strong
                    propensities implanted in these people for ardent liquors. All differences among
                    this set are the subject of reference either to a <hi rend="italic">punchy
                        at</hi> or a general assembly; but, before commencing the business, both
                    plantiff' and defendant must provide a quantity of spirits proportioned to the
                    importance of the case. The party non-suited ultimately bears the whole expense,
                    and the assembly is regaled with the beverage produced by the litigants.</p>
                <p part="N">Some of the Bazeegurs are owners of land, which they entertain a great
                    desire to obtain; but they are never cultivators. They are collected, as already
                    observed, into various associations in different parts of India. The dancing
                    girls, however, have no regular and settled habitations; they dwell merely in
                    temporary huts, erected near the place of their exhibitions. The duration of
                    their lives is supposed to be much abridged by the course of life which they
                    lead, particularly from the violent exercises practised from early youth, and
                    habitual indulgence in intoxicating draughts. Both males and females undergo
                    such a regular progress of debauchery, that few live beyond forty, and many do
                    not attain their thirtieth year. But from the pursuits of the females being
                    productive to their parents, their marriages are deferred to a later period than
                    is usual in India. There prostitution is free from that odium and contempt which
                    it incurs in Europe, and those females who are considered so unfortunate and
                    depraved by us are under the special protection of the laws. The female
                    Bazeegurs who are taught singing and dancing only are under no greater personal
                    restraint than the common dancing girls of Hindostan; but the chastity of those
                    whose particular department is tumbling is strictly enjoined until their place
                    be supplied by others more youthful. When this substitution comes they join the
                    companies of dancers alone; and the men, though quite aware of their
                    incontinence, do not scruple to select wives from among them. But after marriage
                    a total change of conduct is expected, and it is said that such expectations are
                    commonly realized. Nevertheless, among the Panchperee, the fidelity of those
                    employed in different vocations in the towns becomes suspected if they have not
                    returned to their homes when the cry of the jackal is heard, and their husbands
                    are by no means disposed to overlook the offence. It does not appear, however,
                    that they have either the power or the inclination of the Hindoos, who
                    sometimes, in such cases, decoy their own daughters to a lonely place for the
                    purpose of perpe-ι<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195425?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0704-5425-0470"/> trating a barbarous murder on them, as the
                    punishment of their indiscretion. The Bazeegur parents and husbands are content
                    with slighter expiations; but if the paramour be not of their own particular
                    caste, the incontinence of the female is judged a much more grievous fault.</p>
                <p part="N">The females now alluded to are those who do not attend the juggling
                    exhibitions of the men, or their feats of activity; they practise physic and
                    cupping, and perform a kind of tattooing on the skin of the Hindoos of their own
                    sex, called Godna. As the men, besides their usual occupations, collect
                    medicinal herbs, and a certain bud, the latter is dried, and the former prepared
                    by their wives as curatives, especially of the complaints of their own sex. Thus
                    they find employment in the towns, in such vocations, or by the sale of
                    trinkets, though both afford but a precarious subsistence. Some tribes also
                    exhibit wild beasts to the vulgar, or offer mats fabricated by themselves for
                    sale. Before the establishment of the British government in Bengal, the
                    Bazeegurs were subject to the arbitrary exactions of a tax-gatherer, whom they
                    greatly dreaded; and the apprehension of the renewal of that officer’s powers
                    has proved a considerable impediment to investigating their manners and
                    customs.</p>
                <p part="N">A general coincidence in the mode of life, the vocations, manners, and
                    language of all the different sects of these people, determines them as
                    belonging to the same race. The distinctions seen among them are too trivial to
                    admit of their being considered of separate and independent origin. They are
                    different from all the other tribes dispersed throughout Hindostan, and have two
                    dialects also peculiar to themselves, the one most probably a jargon, which is
                    spoken only among the public performers; the other in common use among the
                    whole. The Bazee- ’ gurs are supposed to present many features analogous to the
                    gipsies scattered over Europe and Asia, where they subsist as a distinct race
                    from all the other inhabitants of the countries frequented by them. The
                    Bazeegurs, as well as gipsies, have a chief or king; each has a peculiar
                    language, bearing some reciprocal analogy, and different from that of the people
                    among whom they reside; and this analogy is so decided, that it is difficult to
                    deny that in both cases it has had a common origin. In India and in Europe they
                    are equally an itinerant race; their pursuits, excepting in as far as these are
                    modified by the manners of countries distant from each other, are alike; for the
                    discrepancies they exhibit may reasonably enough be ascribed to an insensible
                    acquisition of the habits of those near whom their various tribes happen to
                    dwell. They are totally indifferent as to the quality of the food serving for
                    their subsistence, and entirely ignorant of systematic religious principles. All
                    preserve the strictest adherence to their own sect, and sedulously abstain from
                    intermixtures or intermarriages with that of any other nation; and where
                    infringements of these rules are seen, they are to be ascribed more to necessity
                    than inclination. Another resemblance, which has probably been lost in the lapse
                    of time, is supposed to consist in the three-stringed viol, introduced into
                    Europe by the jugglers of the thirteenth century, which is exactly similar to
