                    >Basette</hi></label>, a game with cards, said to have been invented by a noble
                    Venetian, who was banished for his invention. It was first introduced into
                    France by Signior Justiniani, ambassador of Venice, in 1674. Severe laws were
                    made against it by Louis XIV., to elude which they disguised basset under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">pour et contre,</hi> “for and against,” which
                    occasioned new arrets and prohibitions of parliament. The parties concerned in
                    it are a dealer or banker; his assistant, who supervises the losing cards; and
                    the punter, or any one who plays against the banker.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides these, there are other terms used in this game. 1. The <hi
                        rend="italic">fasse or face</hi> is the first card turned up by the tailleur
                    belonging to the pack, by which he gains the value of half the money laid down
                    on every card of that sort by the punters. 2. The <hi rend="italic">couch</hi>
                    is the first money which every punter puts on each card; each person who plays
                    having a book of thirteen several cards before him, on which he may lay his
                    money, more or less, at discretion. 3. The <hi rend="italic">paroli</hi> is,
                    when a punter having won the first stake, and having a mind to pursue his good
                    fortune, crooks the corner of his card, and lets his prize lie, aiming at a <hi
                        rend="italic">sept et le va.</hi> 4. The <hi rend="italic">masse</hi> is,
                    when having won the first stake, the punter is willing to venture mere money on
                    the same card. 5. The <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> is, when the punter, having won
                    the first stake, be it a shilling, half-crown, guinea, or whatever he laid down
                    on his card, and not caring to hazard the paroli, leaves off, or <hi
                        rend="italic">goes the pay;</hi> in which case, if the card turns up wrong,
                    he loses nothing, having won the couch before; whereas if it turn right, he by
                    this adventure wins double the money staked. 6. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >alpiew</hi> is much the same with paroli, and used when a couch is won by
                    turning up or crooking the corner of the winning card. 7. <hi rend="italic">Sept
                        et le va</hi> is the first great chance or prize, when the punter, having
                    won the couch, makes a paroli, and goes on to a second chance, so that if his
                    winning card turns up again, it comes to <hi rend="italic">sept et le va,</hi>
                    which is seven times as much as he laid down on his card. 8. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quinze et le va</hi> is the next higher prize, when the punter having won
                    the former, is resolved to push his fortune, and lay his money a second time on
                    the same card, by crooking another corner; in which case, if it comes up he wins
                    fifteen times the money he laid down. 9. <hi rend="italic">Trent et le va</hi>
                    is the next higher prize, when the punter, crooking the fourth corner of his
                    winning card, if it turn up, wins thirty-three times the money he first staked.
                    10. <hi rend="italic">Soixaηt et le va</hi> is the highest prize, and entitles
                    the winner to sixty-seven times his first moneys which, if it be considerable,
                    may chance to break the bank; but the bank has many chances of first breaking
                    the punter. This cannot be won but by the tailleur’s dealing the cards over
                    again.</p>
                <p part="N">The rules of the game of basset are as follows: 1. The banker holds a
                    pack of fifty-two cards, and having shuffled them, he turns the whole pack at
                    once, so as to discover the last card; after which he lays down all the cards by
                    couples. 2. The punter has his book of thirteen cards in his hand, from the king
                    to the ace, and out of these he takes one card or more at pleasure, upon which
                    he lays a stake. 3. The punter may, at his choice, either laydown his stake
                    before the pack is turned, or immediately after it is turned, or after any
                    number of couples arc down. 4. Supposing the punter to lay down his stake after
                    the pack is turned, and calling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. the places of those cards
                    which follow the card in view, either immediately after the pack is turned or
                    after any number of couples are drawn; then, 5. If the card upon which the
                    punter has laid a stake comes out in any even place except the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193194957?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4957-0434"/>first, he
                    wins a stake equal to his own. 6. If the card upon which the punter has laid a
                    stake come out in any even place except the second, he loses his stake. 7. If
                    the card of the punter comes out in the first place, he neither wins nor loses,
                    but takes his own stake again. 8. If the card of the punter comes out in the
                    second place, he does not lose his whole stake, but only one half; and this is
                    the case in which the punter is said to <hi rend="italic">defaced.</hi> 9. When
                    the punter chooses to come in after any number of couples are down, if his card
                    happens to be but once in the pack, and is the last of all, there is an
                    exception from the general rule; for although it comes out in an odd place,
                    which should entitle him to win a stake equal to his own, yet he neither wins
                    nor loses from that circumstance, but takes back his own stake.</p>
                <p part="N">This game has been the object of mathematical calculation; and M. de
                    Moivre solves this problem: To estimate at basset the loss of the punter under
                    any circumstance of cards remaining in the stock when he lays his stake, and of
                    any number of times that his card is repeated in the stock. And from the
                    solution he has formed a table showing the several losses of the punter in
                    whatsoever circumstances be may happen to be. From this table it appears, 1.
                    That the fewer the cards in the stock, the greater is the loss of the punter: 2.
                    That the least loss of the punter, under the same circumstances of cards
                    remaining in the stock, is when his card is but twice in it; the next greater
                    when but three times; the next greater when four times; and the greatest of all
                    when but once. The gain of the banker upon all the money adventured at basset is
                    15s. 3d. per cent.</p>
