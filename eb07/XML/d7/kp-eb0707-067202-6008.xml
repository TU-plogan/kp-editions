                <p><label type="entry">DEFORMITY</label>, the want of that uniformity necessary to
                    constitute the beauty of an object.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756021" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6021-0673"/>
                <p>Deformity is either natural or moral. These are both referred by Mr Hutcheson to
                    an internal sense; and our perceptions of them, as he supposes, arise from an
                    original and arbitrary structure of our own minds, by which certain objects,
                    when observed, are rendered the occasions of certain sensations and
                    affections.</p>
                <p>That many objects afford no pleasure to our sense is obvious. Many are certainly
                    void of beauty; but then, says this author, there is no form which seems
                    necessarily disagreeable of itself, when we dread no evil from it, and compare
                    it with nothing better of the kind. Many objects are naturally displeasing and
                    distasteful to our external senses, whilst others are pleasing and agreeable, as
                    smells, tastes, and some separate sounds; but with regard to our sense of
                    beauty, no composition of objects which produce not unpleasant simple ideas,
                    seems positively unpleasant or painful of itself, had we never observed any
                    thing better of the same kind.</p>
                <p>Had there been a species of the form which we now denominate <hi rend="italic"
                    >ugly</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deformed,</hi> and had we never seen nor
                    expected greater beauty, we should have received no disgust from it, though the
                    pleasure would not have been so great in this form as in those which we now
                    admire. Our sense of beauty seems designed to give us positive pleasure, but not
                    positive pain or disgust, any further than what arises from disappointment.</p>
                <p>There are indeed many faces which at first view are apt to raise dislike. But
                    this generally arises not from any positive deformity, but either from want of
                    expected beauty, or from the carrying some natural indications of morally bad
                    dispositions, which we all acquire a faculty of discerning in countenances,
                    airs, and gestures. That this is not occasioned by any form positively
                    disgusting, appears from the circumstance, that if, upon long acquaintance, we
                    are sure of finding sweetness of temper, humanity, and cheerfulness, though the
                    bodily form continues, it will occasion us no disgust. There are horrors raised
                    by some objects, which are only the effects of fear for ourselves, or compassion
                    towards others, when either reason or some foolish association of idea⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> makes us apprehend danger, and not the effect of any
                    thing in the form itself. For we find, that most of those objects which excite
                    horror at first, when experience or reason has removed the fear, may become the
                    occasion of pleasure.</p>
                <p>The casual conjunction of ideas occasions us disgust when there is nothing
                    disagreeable in the form itself. And this, in effect, is the cause of most of
                    our fantastic aversions to the figures of divers animals. Thus serpents of all
                    kinds, and many insects, really beautiful enough, are beheld with aversion by
                    many people, who have some accidental ideas of mischief associated with them. A
                    similar reasoning is applied to our perception of moral beauty and deformity.
                    (See <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and
                    Virtue,</hi> passim.)</p>
                <p>But it is more to the present purpose to distinguish between the sentiments of
                    delight or disgust, excited in our minds by beautiful or deformed objects, which
                    are effects of certain causes, and the natural and real qualities of the
                    perceived objects by which they are produced. There are objects, says an
                    excellent writer, which have a natural aptitude to please or offend, or between
                    which and the contemplating mind there is a necessary congruity or incongruity;
                    and though the actual perception of the understanding, and consequent feeling of
                    the heart, in contemplating the actions and affections of moral agents, may
                    exist in very different degrees, on account of the incidental obstructions
                    arising from bodily indisposition, mental prejudices and biasses, and the
                    association of ideas; yet, in every rational mind properly disposed, morally
                    good actions must for ever be acceptable, and can never of themselves offend;
                    and morally evil actions must for ever be disagreeable, and can never of
                    themselves please. What is right in actions and characters is beautiful and
                    amiable, and gives pleasure; what is wrong is deformed and odious, and excites
                    disgust. Right and pleasure, wrong and pain, are as distinct as cause and
                    effect. It is no less absurd to maintain that the perception of virtue is
                    nothing distinct from the perception of the pleasure resulting from it, than to
                    infer, with some metaphysicians, that solidity, extension, and figure, are only
                    particular modes of sensation, because attended, whenever they are perceived,
                    with some sensations of sight or touch. Thus does the author show that moral
                    beauty and deformity are real qualities of certain actions, in which consists
                    their aptitude to please or disgust. With respect to natural beauty, he
                    observes, that uniformity amidst variety pleases, because the natures of variety
                    and uniformity are such, that whenever united, they are adapted to please every
                    unbiassed mind that discerns them. He accounts for the pleasure they afford,
                    without referring them to an arbitrary internal sense, by the following
                    circumstances which attend them. They are more easily comprehended by the mind:
                    order and symmetry give things their stability and strangth, and subserviency to
                    any valuable purpose: regularity and order are evidence of art and design.
                    Disorder and confusion, whence deformity arises, denote only the negation of
                    regularity and order; or any arrangement and disposition of things, which are
                    not according to a law, rule, or plan, and prove not design. These are not
                    positively displeasing, except where we previously expected order, or where
                    impotence or want of skill appear, and the contriver has either failed in his
                    design or executed it unskilfully.</p>
                <p>In a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Fugitive Pieces</hi> is preserved an essay
                    on Bodily Deformity, by William Hay, who was himself what he describes, and who,
                    whilst he ridicules his own figure with great pleasantry, discusses the general
                    subject in a manner equally instructive and agreeable. He considers, first, the
                    natural consequences of bodily deformity; secondly, how it affects the outward
                    circumstances; and, thirdly, what turn it gives to the mind.</p>
                <p>It is certain that the human frame, when warped and disproportioned, is lessened
                    in strength and activity, and rendered less fit for its functions. Scarron had
                    invented an engine to take off his hat; “and I wish,” says our author, “I could
                    invent one to buckle my shoe, or to take up a thing from the ground, which I can
                    scarce do without kneeling; for I can bend my body no farther than it is bent by
                    nature. For this reason, when ladies drop a fan or glove, I am not the first to
                    take it up, and often restrain my inclination to perform those little services,
                    rather than expose my spider-like shape. And I hope it will not be construed as
                    pride, if I do not always rise from my seat when I ought; for if it is low, 1
                    find some trouble in it; and my centre of gravity is so ill placed, that I am
                    often like to fall back. Things hanging within the reach of others are out of
                    mine; and what they can execute with ease, I want strength to perform. 1 am in
                    danger of being trampled upon or stifled in a crowd, where my back is a
                    convenient lodgment for the elbow of any tall person that is near. I can see
                    nothing; and my whole employment is to guard my person. 1 have forborne to
                    attend his majesty in the House of Peers, since I was like to be squeezed to
                    death there against the wall. I would willingly come thither when his majesty
                    commands; but he is too gracious to expect impossibilities. Besides, when I get
                    in, I can never have the pleasure of seeing on the throne one of the best
                    princes who ever sat on it. These, and many others, are the inconveniences
                    continually attending a figure like mine. They may appear grievous to persons
                    not used to them, but they grow easier by habit; and though <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756034" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6034-0674"/>they may a little disturb,
                    they are not sufficient to destroy the happiness of life, of which, at an
                    average, I have enjoyed as great a share as most men. And perhaps one proof of
                    it may be my writing this essay, not intended as a complaint against Providence
                    for my lot, but as an innocent amusement to myself and others.”</p>
                <p>As to what effect deformity may have on the health, it appears natural to
                    imagine, that as the inward parts of the body must in some measure conform with
                    the outward mould, so the form of the latter being irregular, the former cannot
                    be so well placed and disposed to perform their functions; and that generally
                    deformed persons would not be healthy or long lived. But this is a question best
                    determined by facts; and in regard to it the instances are too few or too little
                    observed to enable us to draw a general conclusion from them; yet health is more
                    than is commonly thought in a man’s own power, and the reward of temperance more
                    than the effect of constitution, which makes it more difficult to pass a
                    judgment. Aesop could not be young when he died, and might have lived longer if
                    he had not been murdered at Delphi. The Prince of Orange scarcely passed the
                    meridian of life, and the Duke of Luxembourg died about the age of sixty-seven.
                    The Lord Treasurer Burghley lived to seventy-eight; but his son, the Earl of
                    Salisbury, died about fifteen years after him. It is said that Mr Pope’s father
                    was deformed, and he lived to the age of seventy-five; whereas the son died in
                    middle age, if he may be said to die whose works are immortal. “My father,” adds
                    our author, “was not deformed, but active, and my mother a celebrated beauty;
                    and I, that am so unlike them, have lived to a greater age, and daily see my
                    acquaintance of a stronger frame quitting the stage before me.”</p>
                <p>But whether deformity, abstractedly considered, be really prejudicial to health,
                    in its consequences it appears to be most commonly an advantage. Deformed
                    persons have less strength than others, and therefore should naturally be more
                    careful to preserve it; and as temperance is highly conducive to health, it may
                    incline them to be more temperate. Another great preservative of health is
                    moderate exercise, which few deformed persons can want strength to take. As a
                    deformed person is not formed for violent exercise, he is less liable to such
                    disorders as are the natural consequences of it. He will also escape many
                    accidents, to which men of athletic make, and who glory in their strength, are
                    always exposing themselves, to make trial and proof of it. If he cannot carry an
                    ox, like Milo, he will not, like Milo, be handcuffed in the oak by attempting to
                    rend it. He will not be the man that shall ride from London to York in a day, or
                    to Windsor in an hour, for a wager; or that shall be perpetually performing
                    surprisingly long journeys in a surprisingly short time, for no earthly business
                    but the pleasure of relating them. Conscious of his own weakness, he will be
                    cautious of running into places or occasions of danger. Nature, too, warns
                    deformed persons to be careful not to offer such affronts as may call them forth
                    into the field of false honour, where they cannot acquit themselves well for
                    want of strength and agility; and they are the more secure from such affronts
                    themselves, since others will consider the little credit to be gained by
                    compelling them to appear on that scene. On the whole, therefore, it may be
                    concluded that deformity is a protection to a man’s health and person; which,
                    strange as it may appear, are better defended by feebleness than by
                    strength.</p>
                <p>The influence of bodily deformity on a man’s fortune may next be considered.
                    Amongst the lower class, he is cut off from many professions and employments. He
                    cannot be a soldier, for he is under standard; he cannot be a sailor, since he
                    wants activity to climb the rigging; he cannot be a chairman or porter, because
                    he wants strength to bear the burden. In higher life, he is ill qualified for a
                    lawyer, as he can scarcely be seen over the bar; and for a divine, since he may
                    drop from his hassock out of sight in his pulpit. The improvement of his mind is
                    his proper province, and his business should only be such as depends’ on
                    ingenuity. If he cannot be a dancing-master to adjust the heels, he may be a
                    schoolmaster to instruct the head; he cannot be a graceful actor on the stage,
                    but he may produce a good play; he would appear ill as a herald in a procession,
                    but he may pass as a merchant on the Change; he cannot undergo the fatigue of
                    the campaign, but he may advise the operations of it; he is designed by nature
                    rather to sleep on the two-topped Parnassus, than to descend to the plains of
                    Aeolis; he cannot be crowned at the Olympic games, but may be the Pindar to
                    celebrate them; he can acquire no glory by the sword, but he may by the pen, and
                    may grow famous by only relating those exploits which it is beyond his power to
                    imitate.</p>
                <p>Lord Bacon, whose extensive and penetrating genius pointed out every part of
                    nature for examination, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Deformity</hi> says,
                    “that in their superiors it quencheth jealousy towards them, as persons that
                    they think they may at pleasure despise; and it layeth their competitors and
                    emulators asleep, as never believing they should be in a possibility of
                    advancement till they see them in possession.” But it is much to be doubted
                    whether this is not more than counterbalanced by the contempt of the world,
                    which it requires no mean parts to conquer; for if, as has been said, a good
                    person is a letter of recommendation, deformity must be an obstruction in the
                    way to favour. In this respect, therefore, deformed persons set out in the world
                    at a disadvantage; and they must first surmount the prejudices of mankind before
                    they can be upon a par with others, and must obtain by a course of behaviour
                    that regard which is paid to beauty at first sight. When this point is once
                    gained, the tables are turned, and then the game goes in their favour; for
                    others, sensible of injustice towards them, no sooner find them better than they
                    expected, tfian they believe them better than they are; whereas in the beautiful
                    person they sometimes find themselves imposed upon, and are angry that they have
                    worshipped only a painted idol. For, to use Lord Bacon’s words, “neither is it
                    almost seen that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue: they
                    prove accomplished, but not of great spirit; and study rather behaviour than
                    virtue. Whereas deformed persons, if they be of spirit, will free themselves
                    from scorn, which must be either by virtue or malice; and therefore let it not
                    be marvelled if they sometimes prove excellent persons, as was Agesilaus, Zanger
                    the son of Solomon, Aesop, Gasea, president of Peru; and Socrates may likewise
                    go amongst them, with others.” Nay, he says, “in a great wit deformity is an
                    advantage to rising;” and in another part of his works, “that they who by
                    accident have some inevitable and indelible mark on their persons or fortunes,
                    as deformed people, bastards, and the like, if they want not virtue, generally
                    prove fortunate.”</p>

                    informs us, that “she chose the goodliest persons for her household servants;
                    but in her counsellors did not put by sufficiency, though accompanied with a
                    crooked person; as it chanced in a father and a son of the Cecils, both
                    incomparable for prudence.” It is well known the queen would make the father,
                    Burghley, sit in her presence, telling him that she did not use him for his
                    legs, but his head. But the son, afterwards Lord Treasurer and Earl of
                    Salisbury, was not so civilly treated by the populace; and he is an instance not
                    only that envy pursues a great man, but that the highest post cannot redeem a
                    deformed one <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756047" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6047-0675"
                    />from contempt: it attends him like his shadow, and like that, too, is ever
                    reminding him of his ill figure, which is often objected to for want of real
                    crimes. For the same writer says of the same great man, “that the misfortunes
                    accompanying him from his birth did not a little add to that cloud of detraction
                    that fell upon all that he said or did; a mulct in nature, like an optic
                    spectacle, multiplying much in the sight of the people the apparitions of ill.”
                    Nor was this contempt buried with him; it trampled on his ashes and insulted his
                    grave; as appears by an epitaph which Osborn cites, as devoid of wit as it is
                    full of scurrility; in one line of which there is an epithet, not so elegant as
                    descriptive of his person, namely, “little Bossive Robin that was so great.”</p>
                <p>Such contempt in general, joined with the ridicule of the vulgar, is another
                    certain consequence of bodily deformity; for men naturally despise that which
                    appears less beautiful or useful, and their pride is gratified when they see
                    such foils to their own persons. It is this sense of superiority which is
                    testified by laughter in the lower sort; whilst their betters, who know how
                    little any man whatsoever has to boast of, are restrained by good sense and good
                    breeding from such an insult. But it is not easy to say why one species of
                    deformity should be more ridiculous than another, or why the mob should be more
                    merry with a crooked man than with one who is deaf, lame, squinting, or
                    purblind. It is a back in alto relievo which bears all the ridicule, though one
                    would think a prominent belly a much more reasonable object of derision, since
                    the last is generally the effect of intemperance, and of a man’s own creation.
                    Socrates was ugly, but not contemned; and Philopoemen had a very mean
                    appearance; but though contemned on that account, he was not ridiculed.
                    Montaigne says, “Ill features are but a superficial ugliness, and of little
                    certainty in the opinion of men; but a deformity of limbs is more substantial,
                    and strikes deeper in.” As it is more uncommon, it is more remarkable; and that
                    perhaps is the true reason why it is more ridiculed by ' the vulgar.</p>
                <p>The last consideration on this subject relates to those passions and affections
                    which most naturally result from deformity. Lord Bacon observes, that “deformed
                    persons are commonly even with nature; for as nature hath done ill by them, so
                    do they by nature, being for the most part (as the Scripture saith) <hi
                    rend="italic">void of natural affection”</hi> But Mr Hay says, “I can neither
                    find out this passage in Scripture, nor the reason of it; nor can I give my
                    assent or negative to a proposition, till I am well acquainted with the terms of
                    it. If by natural affection is here meant universal benevolence, and that
                    deformity necessarily implies a want of it, a deformed person must then be a
                    complete monster. But however common the case may be, my own sensations inform
                    me that it is not universally true. If by natural affection is meant a partial
                    regard for individuals, I believe the remark is judicious, and founded in human
                    nature. Deformed persons are despised, ridiculed, and ill-treated by others;
                    they are seldom favourites, and commonly most neglected by parents, guardians,
                    and relations; and therefore, as they are not indebted for much fondness, it is
                    no wonder if they repay but little. It is the command of Scripture, <hi
                    rend="italic">not to set our affections on things below</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and it is the voice of reason not to overvalue what we must soon part
                    with; therefore, to be so fond of others as not to be able to bear their absence
                    or to survive them, is neither a religious nor moral duty, but a childish and
                    womanish weakness; and I must congratulate deformed persons, who by example are
                    early taught another lesson. And I will now lay open my own heart to the reader,
                    that he may judge if Lord Bacon’s position is verified in me.</p>
                <p>“1 hope it proceeds not from a malignity of heart; but</p>
                <p>I never am much’affected with the common accidents off life, whether they befal
                    myself or others. I am little moved when I hear of death, loss, or misfortune; I
                    think the case is common. “Tritus, et e medio fortunae ductus accrvo.” And as it
                    is always likely to happen, I am not surprised when it does. If I see a person
                    cry or beat his breast on any such occasion, I cannot bear him company, but am
                    not a Democritus to laugh at his folly. I read of battles and fields covered
                    with slain; of cities destroyed by sword, famine, pestilence, and earthquake; I
                    do not shed a tear. I suppose it is because they are the usual storms to which
                    the human species are exposed, proceeding from the just judgments of God, or the
                    mistaken and false principles of rulers. I read of persecutions, tortures,
                    murders, massacres; my compassion for the sufferers is great, but my tears are
                    stopped by resentment and indignation against the contrivers and perpetrators of
                    such horrid actions. But there are many things that bring tears into my eyes
                    whether I will or no; and when I reflect, I am often at a loss in searching out
                    the secret source from whence they flow. What makes me weep (for weep I do) when
                    I read of virtue or innocence in distress; of a good man helpless and forsaken,
                    unmoved by the greatest insults and cruelties, or courageously supporting
                    himself against oppression in the article of death? 1 suppose it is to see vice
                    tri umphant, and virtue so ill rewarded in this life. May I judge by myself, I
                    should imagine that few sincere Christians could read the sufferings of their
                    Saviour, or Englishmen those of a Cranmer, Ridley, or Latimer, without tears;
                    the first dying to establish his religion, the last to rescue it from
                    corruption. When I read of Regulus returning to torment, and John of France to
                    imprisonment, against the persuasion of friends, to keep faith with their
                    enemies, I weep to think there is scarce another instance of such exalted
                    virtue. Those who often hear me read know that my voice changes, and my eyes are
                    full when I meet with a generous and heroic saying, action, or character,
                    especially of persons whose example or command may influence mankind. I weep
                    when 1 hear a Titus say, that he had lost the day in which he did no good; when
                    Adrian tells his enemy that he had escaped by his being emperor; or Louis XII.
                    that he is not to revenge the affront of the Duke of Orleans. These are the
                    first instances that happen to occur to me. I might recollect many, too many to
                    insert in this essay; yet all are but few, compared to instances of cruelty and
                    revenge; perhaps I am concerned that they are so rare; perhaps too I inwardly
                    grieve that I am not in a situation to do the like. I am entertained, but not
                    moved, when I read Voltaire’s History of Charles XII.; but I melt into tears on
                    reading Hanway’s character of his antagonist Peter the Great. The first is a
                    story of a madman; the other of a father, friend, and benefactor of his people,
                    whose character, as the author observes in the conclusion of it, will command
                    the admiration of all succeeding generations; and I suppose I lament that God is
                    pleased to advance to royalty so few such instruments of good to mankind.”</p>
                <p>Again: “I am uneasy when I see a dog, a horse, or any other animal, ill treated:
                    for I consider them as endued with quick sense, and no contemptible share of
                    reason; and that God gave man dominion over them, not to play the tyrant, but to
                    be a good prince, and promote the happiness of his subjects. But I am much more
                    uneasy at any cruelty to my own species; and heartily wish Procrustes
                    disciplined in his own bed, and Phalaris in his bull. A man bruized all over in
                    a boxing match, or cut to pieces in fighting a prize, is a shocking spectacle;
                    and I think I could with less horror see a thousand fall in battle, than human
                    nature thus depreciated and disgraced. Violence, when exerted in wantonness or
                    passion, is brutality; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756060"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6060-0676"/>can be termed bravery only when it is sanctioned
                    by justice and necessity.</p>
                <p>“1 have been in a situation to see not a little of the pomp and vanity as well as
                    of the necessity and misery of mankind; but the last only affect me; and if, as
                    a magistrate, I am ever guilty of partiality, it is in favour of the poor. When
                    1 am at church among my poor but honest neighbours in the country, and sec them
                    serious in performing the ceremonies prescribed, tears sometimes steal down my
                    cheek on reflecting that they are doing and hearing many things they do not
                    understand, while those who understand them better neglect them; that they who
                    labour and live hard are more thankful to heaγen than those who fare luxuriously
                    on the fruits of their labour; and are keeping and repeating the fourth
                    commandment at the very instant the others are breaking it</p>
                <p>“These are some of the sensations I feel, which I have freely and fairly
                    disclosed, that the reader may judge how far I am an instance of a deformed
                    person wanting natural affection. And I am a good subject of speculation,
                    because all in me is nature; for, to own the truth, I have taken but little
                    pains (though I ought to have taken a great deaD to correct my natural
                    defects.</p>
                <p>“Lord Bacon’s next position is, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> That deformed
                    persons are extremely bold; first in their own defence, as being exposed to
                    scorn; but in process of time by a general habit.’ This probably is so among the
                    inferior sort, who are in the way of continual insults; for a return of abuse is
                    a natural weapon of self-defence, and in some measure justified by the law of
                    retaliation. To upbraid a man with a personal defect, which he cannot help, is
                    also an immoral act; and he who does it has reason to expect no better quarter
                    than to hear of faults which it was in his own power not to commit. But I find
                    this observation far from being verified in myself; an unbecoming bashfulness
                    has been the consequence of my ill figure, and of the worse management of me in
                    my childhood. I am always uneasy when any one looks śtedfastly on so bad a
                    picture, and cannot look with a proper confidence in the face of another. I have
                    ever reproached myself with this weakness, but am not able to correct it. And it
                    may be a disadvantage to a man in the opinion of those he converses with; for
                    though true modesty is amiable, the false is liable to misconstruction; and when
                    a man is out of countenance for no reason, it may be imagined that he has some
                    bad reason for being so. In point of assurance, I am indeed a perfect riddle to
                    myself; for I, who feel a reluctance in crossing a drawing-room, or in opening
                    my mouth in private company before persons with whom I am not well acquainted,
                    find little in delivering my sentiments in public, and exposing my discourse,
                    often as trifling as my person, to the ears of a thousand. From what cause this
                    proceeds I know not; it may be partly from hopes of wiping off any ill
                    impression from my person by my discourse, partly from a sense of doing my duty,
                    and partly from a security in public assemblies from any gross personal
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>“Lord Bacon compares the case of deformed persons to that of eunuchs, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> in whom kings were wont to put great trust as good
                    spies and whisperers; for they that are envious towards all, are more obsequious
                    and officious towards one.’ But, with submission to so good a judge of human
                    nature, 1 own I can discover no uncommon qualification in them for spies, and
                    very few motives to envy peculiar to themselves. Spies submit to that base and
                    ungenerous office, either for the sake of interest or power: if for interest, it
                    is to gratify their covetousness; if for power, their ambition or revenge; which
                    passions are not confined to the eunuch or deformed, but indiscriminately seize
                    all classes of men. Envy too may prompt a man to mean actions, in order to brinġ
                    down the person envied to his own level; but if it is on account of superiority
                    of fortune it will operate alike on men of all shapes. Eunuchs have but one
                    peculiar motive to envy; but that, as Lord Bacon expresses it, makes them
                    envious towards all, because it is for a pleasure which all but themselves may
                    enjoy. Deformed persons are deprived only of beauty and strength, and therefore
                    those alone are to be deemed the extraordinary motives to their envy; for they
                    can no more be beautiful or strong than eunuchs be successful lovers. As to
                    myself, whatever sparks of envy might be in my constitution, they are now
                    entirely extinguished; for, by frequent and serious reflections, I have long
                    been convinced of the small value of most things which men value the most.</p>
                <p>“There is another passion to which deformed persons seem to be more exposed than
                    to envy, which is jealousy; for being conscious that they are less amiable than
                    others, theymay naturally suspeetthat they are less beloved. I have the
                    happiness to speak this from conjecture, and not from experience; for it was my
                    lot, many years ago, to many a young lady, very piously educated, and of a very
                    distinguished family, and whose virtues are an honour to her family and her sex;
                    so that I had never any trial of my temper, and can only guess at it by emotions
                    1 have felt in my younger days, when ladies have been more liberal of their
                    smiles to those whom 1 thought in every respect but person my inferiors.”</p>
                <p>The most useful inference from all this to a deformed person is, to be upon his
                    guard against those frailties to which he is more particularly exposed, and to
                    be careful that the outward frame do not distort the soul. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orandum</hi><hi rend="italic">est,</hi> says Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">ut sit
                    mens sana in</hi><hi rend="italic">corpore sano,</hi> “Let us pray for a sound
                    mind in a healthy body;” and every deformed person should add this petition, <hi
                    rend="italic">zit sit mens recta in</hi><hi rend="italic">corpore curvo,</hi>
                    for “an upright mind in a crooked one.” And let him frequently apply to himself
                    this article of self-examination, <hi rend="italic">Lenior et melior jis,
                    accedente senecta?</hi> “As age approaches, do your temper and morals improve?”
                    It is a duty peculiarly incumbent; for if beauty adds grace to virtue itself,
                    vice must be doubly hideous in deformity.</p>
                <p>Ridicule and contempt are a certain consequence of deformity; and therefore what
                    a person cannot avoid, he should learn to disregard. He should bear it like
                    aman, forgive it as a Christian, and consider it as a philosopher; and his
                    triumph will be complete if he can exceed others in pleasantry on himself. Wit
                    will cease when it sees itself outdone, and so will malice when it finds it has
                    no effect; and if a man’s behaviour afford no cause of contempt, it will fall
                    upon those who condemn him without cause.</p>
                <p>Instead of repining, therefore, a deformed person ought to be thankful to
                    Providence for giving him such a guard to his virtue and repose. Thousands are
                    daily ruined by a handsome person; for beauty is a flower which every one wants
                    to gather in its bloom, and spares no pains or stratagem to reach. All the
                    poetical stories concerning it have their moral. A Helen occasions war and
                    confusion; the Hyacinths and Ganymedes are seized on for catamites; the
                    Endymions and Adonises for gallants; Narcissus can admire nobody but himself,
                    and grows old before he is cured of that passion. Who is a stranger to the story
                    of Lucretia killing herself for her violated chastity? or of Virginia killed by
                    her father to preserve it? In those circumstances, says Juvenal, she might have
                    wished to change persons with Rutila, the only lady we know amongst the ancients
                    celebrated for a hump-back. The handsomest men are chosen for eunuchs and
                    gallants; and when they are detected in exercising the last function, both
                    Horace and Juvenal inform us of the penalties and indignities <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756073" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6073-0677"/>they undergo. Silius was
                    converted by the insatiable Messalina into a husband, and Sporus, by the monster
                    Nero, into a wife. The last-mentioned poet shows that praying for beauty is
                    praying for a curse. And Persius refuses to join in such a prayer: and has'not
                    the deformed person reason to thank his stars, which have placed him more out of
                    danger than even virtue itself could do? for that could not guard a Joseph, an
                    Hippolytus, a Bellerophon, and others, against the revenge of slighted love.</p>
                <p>Another great advantage of deformity is, that it tends to the improvement of the
                    mind. A man who cannot shine in his person will have recourse to his
                    understanding, and attempt to adorn that part of him which alone is capable of
                    ornament. When his ambition prompts him to begin, with Cowley, to ask himself
                    this question,</p>
                <p>What shall I do to be for ever known,</p>
                <p>And make the age to come my own?</p>
                <p>on looking around him, he will find many avenues to the temple of fame barred
                    against him; but some are still open through that of virtue; and these, if he
                    has a right ambition, he will most probably attempt to pass. The more a man is
                    inactive in his person, the more his mind will be at work; the time which others
                    spend in action he will pass in study and contemplation; and by these he may
                    acquire wisdom, and through wisdom fame. The name of Socrates is as much sounded
                    as those of Alexander and Caesar, and is recorded in much fairer characters. He
                    gained renown by wisdom and goodness, they by tyranny and oppression; he by
                    instructing, they by destroying mankind: and happy it is that their evil deeds
                    were confined to their lives, whilst he continues to instruct us to this day. A
                    deformed person will naturally consider where his strength and his foible lie;
                    and as he is well acquainted with the last, he will easily find out the first;
                    and must know that, if it is anywhere, it is not, like Samson’s, in the hair,
                    but must be in the lining of the head. He will say to himself, “I am weak in
                    person; unable to serve my country in the field, I can acquire no military
                    glory; but I may, like Socrates, acquire reputation by wisdom and probity; let
                    me therefore be wise and honest. My figure is bad, and I should appear but ill
                    as an orator either in the pulpit or at the bar; let me therefore pass my time
                    in my study, either in reading what may improve myself, or in writing what may
                    entertain or instruct others. I have not the strength of Hercules, nor can I rid
                    the world of so many monsters; but perhaps I may get rid of some that infest
                    myself. If I cannot draw out Cacus from his den, I may pluck the villain from my
                    own breast. I cannot cleanse the stable of Augeas, but I may cleanse my own
                    heart from filth and impurity. I may demolish the hydra of vices within me; and
                    be careful too, that whilst I lop off one, I do not suffer more to grow up in
                    its stead. Let me be serviceable in any way that I can; and if I am so, it may
                    in some measure be owing to my deformity, which at least should be a restraint
                    on my conduct, lest my conduct make me more deformed.”</p>
                <p>Few persons have a house entirely to their mind, or the apartments in it disposed
                    as they could wish; and there is no deformed person who does not wish that his
                    soul had a better habitation, which is sometimes not lodged according to its
                    quality. Lord Clarendon says of Sir Charles Cavendish, brother to the Marquis of
                    Newcastle, that he was a man of the noblest and largest mind, though of the
                    least and most inconvenient body, that lived; and every body knows that the
                    Prince of Orange had many amiable qualities; therefore, in justice to such
                    persons, we must suppose that they did not repine that their tenements were not
                    in a more regular style of architecture. And let every deformed person comfort
                    himself with reflecting, that though his soul has not the most convenient and
                    beautiful apartment, yet that it is habitable; that the accommodation will serve
                    as an inn upon the road; that he is but tenant for life, or, more properly, at
                    will; and that, whilst he remains in it, he is in a state to be envied by the
                    deaf, the dumb, the lame, and the blind.</p>
