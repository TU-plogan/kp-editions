                <p><label type="entry">DELFT</label>, a city of the circle of Rotterdam, in the
                    Netherlands, situated on the river Schie. It is the seat of the engineer,
                    artillery, and marine schools, and is a naval arsenal. It is a regular,
                    well-built city, intersected with canals, and containing seven churches, one of
                    them with a tower three hundred feet in height. There is also the palace in
                    which William, first prince of Orange, was assassinated in 1584; and in the
                    churches are monuments to Van Tromp and to Grotius. There are manufactories of
                    cloths, kerseys, and baizes, of the earthenware whose name originated from the
                    city, of geneva, and of heavy iron goods, such as anchors and cannon. It
                    contains 4870 houses, and 12,900 inhabitants. It is in long. 4. 16. 25. E. and

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Delft</hi><hi rend="italic">Ware,</hi> a kind of pottery of
                    baked earth, covered with an enamel or white glazing, which gives it the
                    appearance and neatness of porcelain. Some kinds of this enamelled pottery
                    differ from others, either in their sustaining sudden heat without breaking, or
                    in the beauty and regularity of their forms, enamel, and the painting <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194756151" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6151-0683"/> with which they
                    are ornamented. In general, the fine and beautifully enamelled potteries, which
                    approach the nearest to porcelain in external appearance, are, at the same time,
                    those which least resist a brisk fire; whilst those which sustain a sudden heat
                    are coarse, and resemble common pottery.</p>
                <p>The basis of this pottery is clay, which, when too fat, is mixed with such a
                    quantity of sand that the earth preserves enough of its ductility to be easily
                    worked, moulded, and turned; and yet so that its fatness may be sufficiently
                    counteracted, and that it may not crack or shrink too much in drying or in
                    baking. Vessels formed of this earth must be dried very gently, to avoid
                    cracking. They are then placed in a furnace to receive a slight baking, which is
                    only meant to give them a certain consistence or hardness. And, lastly, they are
                    covered with an enamel or glazing, which is done by putting upon the vessels
                    thus prepared the enamel, which has been ground very fine, and diluted with
                    water.</p>
                <p>As vessels to which the enamel is applied are but slightly baked, they readily
                    imbibe the water in which the enamel is suspended, and a layer of the enamel
                    adheres to their surface. These vessels may then be painted with colours
                    composed of metallic calces, mixed and ground with a fusible glass. When they
                    have become perfectly dry, they are placed in the furnace, included in cases of
                    baked earth called <hi rend="italic">seggers,</hi> and exposed to a heat capable
                    of fusing uniformly the enamel which covers them. This heat applied to fuse the
                    enamel being much stronger than that which was applied at first to give some
                    consistence to the ware, is also the heat necessary to complete the baking
                    thereof. The furnace and colours used for painting this ware are the same as
                    those employed for porcelain. The glazing, which is nothing but white enamel,
                    ought to be so opaque as not to show the ware under it. There are many receipts
                    for making these enamels; but all of them are composed of sand or flints,
                    vitrifying salts, calx of lead, and calx of tin; and the sand must be perfectly
                    vitrified, so as to form a glass considerably fusible. Somewhat less than an
                    equal part of alkaline salt, or twice its weight of calx of lead, is requisite
                    to effect such vitrifications of sand. The calx of tin is not intended to be
                    vitrified, but to give a white opaque colour to the mass; and one part of it is
                    added to three or four parts of all the other ingredients taken together. From
                    these general principles various enamels may be made to suit the different kinds
                    of earths. To make the enamel, lead and tin are calcined together with a strong
                    fire; and the sand is also made into a fritt with the salt or ashes. The whole
                    is then well mixed and ground together, and the matter is placed under the
                    furnace, where it is melted and vitrified during the baking of the ware. It is
                    next ground in a mill, and applied as above directed.</p>
                <p>The preparation of the white enamel is a very essential article in making delft
                    ware, and one in which many artists fail. A French writer, in a memoir
                    concerning this kind of ware, recommends the following proportions, namely, a
                    hundred pounds of calx of lead to be mixed with about a seventh part of that
                    quantity of calx of tin for common delft ware, or a fourth part of calx of tin
                    for the finest kind, a hundred or a hundred and ten pounds of fine sand, and
                    about twenty or thirty pounds of sea-salt. Concerning the earth of which the
                    ware is made, he observes, that pure clay is not a proper material when used
                    alone; and that different kinds of earth mixed together are found to succeed
                    better. Pieces of ware made of clay alone are found to require too much time to
                    dry; and they, besides, crack, and lose their form, unless they are made
                    exceedingly thick. An addition of marl diminishes the contraction of the clay,
                    renders it less compact, and allows the water to escape, without altering the
                    form of the ware in drying; and it also affords a better ground for the enamel,
                    which appears more glossy and white than when laid upon clay alone. The kinds of
                    clay which are chiefly used in the composition of delft ware, are the blue and
                    the green. A mixture of blue clay and marl would not be sufficiently solid, and
                    would be apt to scale, unless it were exposed to a fire more intense than that
                    which is commonly used for the burning of delft-ware. But to give greater
                    solidity, there is added some red clay, which, on account of its ferruginous
                    matter, possesses the requisite binding quality. The proportions of these
                    ingredients vary in different works, according to the different qualities of the
                    earths employed. Three parts of blue clay, two parts of red clay, and five parts
                    of marl, form the composition used in several manufactories. M. d’Antic thinks
                    that the best delft ware might be made of equal parts of pure clay and pure
                    calcareous earth; but this composition would require that the fire should be
                    continued twice as long as it generally is.</p>
