            <div facs="nls:194755631" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">DAY</label>, according to the most natural and obvious sense
                    of the word, signifies that space of time during which it continues to be light,
                    in contradistinction to night, which is that portion of time during which it is
                    dark; but the space of time in which it is light being somewhat vague and
                    indeterminate, the time between the rising and the setting of the sun is usually
                    looked on as the day, and the time which lapses from its setting to its rising
                    again as the night.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">day</hi> is often taken in a large sense, so as to
                    include the night also, or to denote the time of a whole apparent revolution of
                    the sun round the earth; in which sense it is called by some a natural day, and
                    by others an artificial one. But, to avoid confusion, it is usual to call it in
                    the former sense simply the <hi rend="italic">day,</hi> and in the latter a <hi
                    rend="italic">nyctherneron,</hi> by which term the latter acceptation is aptly
                    denoted, as it implies both day and night. The nycthemeron is divided into
                    twenty-four parts, called <hi rend="italic">hours</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    which are of two sorts, equal, and unequal or temporary.</p>
                <p>Different nations begin their day at different hours. Thus the Egyptians began
                    their day at midnight; and from them Hippocrates introduced that way of
                    reckoning into astronomy, which Copernicus and others have followed; but the
                    greater part of astronomers reckon the day to begin at noon, and so count
                    twenty-four hours till the noon of the next day, and not twice twelve, according
                    to the vulgar computation. The method of beginning the day at midnight prevails
                    in Great Britain, France, Spain, and most parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>The Babylonians began their day at sunrise, reckoning the hour immediately before
                    its rising again the twenty-fourth hour of the day; whence the hours reckoned in
                    this way are called the <hi rend="italic">Babylonic hours.</hi> In several parts
                    of Germany they begin their day at sunset, and reckon on till sunset next day,
                    calling that the <hi rend="italic">twenty-fourth hour</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> these are generally termed <hi rend="italic">Italian hours.</hi> The
                    Jews also began their nycthemeron at sunset; but then they divided it into twice
                    twelve hours as we do, reckoning twelve for the day, be it long or short, and
                    twelve for the night; so that their hours continually varying with the day and
                    night, the hours of the day were longer than those of the night during one half
                    year, and the contrary during the other; whence their hours are called
                    temporary. Those at the times of the equinoxes, however, became equal, because
                    then those of the day and night were so. The Romans also reckoned their hours
                    after this manner, as do the Turks at the present day.</p>
                <p>This kind of hours is called <hi rend="italic">planetary,</hi> because the seven
                    planets were anciently looked upon as presiding over the affairs of the world,
                    and as taking it by turns each of these hours, according to the following order;
                    Saturn first, then Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and last of all the
                    Moon; and hence they denominated each day of the week from that planet whose
                    turn it was to preside over the first hour of the nycthemeron. Thus, assigning
                    the first hour of Saturday to Saturn, the second will fall to Jupiter, the third
                    to Mars, and so the twenty-second of the same nycthemeron will fall to Saturn
                    again, and therefore the twenty-third to Jupiter, and the last to Mars; so that
                    on the first hour of the next day it will fall to the Sun to preside, and by the
                    same manner of reckoning the first hour of the next day will fall to the Moon,
                    of the next to Mars, of the next to Mercury, of the next to Jupiter, and of the
                    next to Venus; and hence the days of the week came to be distinguished by the
                    Latin names of <hi rend="italic">Dies</hi><hi rend="italic">Saturni,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Solis, Lunoe, Martis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercurii,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jovis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Veneris,</hi> and amongst us by
                    the names of Saturday, Sunday, Monday, &amp;c.</p>
