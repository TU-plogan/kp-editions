                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DESIGN</label>, in a general sense, is the plan, order,
                    representation, or construction of a building, book, painting, or the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Design,</hi> in the manufactories, expresses the figures
                    with which the workman enriches his stuff or silk, and which he copies after
                    some painter or eminent draughtsman, as in diaper, damask, and other flowered
                    silk and tapestry, or the like.</p>
                <p>In undertaking such kinds of figured stuffs, it is necessary, says M. Savary,
                    that before the first stroke of the shuttle be made, the whole design be
                    represented on the threads of the warp; we do not mean in colours, but with an
                    infinite number of little packthreads, which, being disposed so as to raise the
                    threads of the warp, let the workmen see, from time to time, what kind of silk
                    is to be put in the eye of the shuttle for woof. This method of preparing the
                    work is called <hi rend="italic">reading the design,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >reading the figure.</hi> The manner in which it is performed may be briefly
                    described. A paper is provided, considerably broader than the stuff, and of a
                    length proportionate to what is intended to be represented thereon. This is
                    divided lengthwise by as many black lines as there are intended threads in the
                    warp, and across these lines by others drawn breadthwise, which, with the
                    former, make little equal squares; and on the paper thus squared the draughtsman
                    designs his figures, and heightens them with colours as he sees fit. When the
                    design is finished a workman reads it, whilst another lays it on the simblot. To
                    read the design is to tell the person who manages the loom the number of squares
                    or threads comprised in the space he is reading, intimating at the same time
                    whether it is ground or figure. To put what is read on the simblot is to fasten
                    little strings to the several packthreads which are to raise the threads named;
                    and this is continued till the whole design is read.</p>
                <p>Every piece being composed of several repetitions of the same design, when the
                    whole design is drawn, the drawer, in order to begin the design afresh, has
                    nothing to do but to raise the little strings, with slip-knots, to the top of
                    the simblot, which he had let down to the bottom; and this he must repeat as
                    often as is necessary, till the whole be manufactured. <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi></p>
                <p>The ribbon-weavers have likewise a design, but it is far' more simple than that
                    now described. It is drawn on paper with lines and squares, representing the
                    threads of the warp and the woof. But instead of lines, of which the figures of
                    the former consist, these are constituted of points only, or dots, placed in
                    certain of the little squares formed by the intersection of the lines. These
                    points mark the threads of the warp which are to be raised, and the spaces left
                    blank denote the threads which are to keep their situation; the rest is managed
                    as in the former case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Design</hi> is also used, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Painting,</hi> to signify the first idea of a large work, drawn roughly, and
                    with an intention to be carefully executed and finished.</p>
                <p>In this sense it means the simple contour or outline of the figures intended to
                    be represented, or the lines which terminate and circumscribe them: and such
                    design is sometimes drawn in crayons or ink, without any shadows at all;
                    sometimes it is hatched, that is, the shadows are expressed by sensible
                    outlines, usually drawn across each other with the pen, crayon, or graver.
                    Sometimes, again, the shadows are done with the crayon rubbed, so that the lines
                    may not appear; at other times, the grains or stroke of the crayon appear from
                    its not being rubbed: sometimes the design is washed, that is, the shadows are
                    done with a pencil in Indian ink, or some other liquor; and sometimes the design
                    is coloured, that is, colours are laid on much like those intended for the grand
                    work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Design,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> is defined by
                    Rousseau to be the invention and the conduct of the subject, the disposition of
                    every part, and the general order of the whole.</p>
                <p>It is not sufficient to form beautiful airs and a legitimate harmony; all these
                    must be connected by a principal subject, to which the various parts of the work
                    relate, and by which they become one. Thus unity ought to prevail in the air, in
                    the movement, in the character, in the harmony, and in the modulation. All these
                    must indispensably relate to one common idea which unites them. The greatest
                    difficulty is, to reconcile the observation of these precepts with an elegant
                    variety, which, if not introduced, renders the whole piece irksome and
                    monotonous. Without question, the musician, as well as the poet and the painter,
                    may risk every thing in favour of this delightful variety; if, under the pretext
                    of contrasting, he do not endeavour to cheat us with false appearances, and,
                    instead of pieces justly and happily planned, present us with a musical minced
                    meat, composed of little abortive fragments, and of characters so incompatible
                    that the whole forms a heterogeneous assemblage.</p>
