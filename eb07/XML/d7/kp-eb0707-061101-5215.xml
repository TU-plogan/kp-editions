                <p><label type="entry">DAMPS</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> are
                    certain noxious exhalations issuing from some parts of the earth, and which
                    prove almost instantly fatal to those who breathe them.</p>
                <p>These damps are chiefly observed in mines and coalpits, though vapours of the
                    same kind often issue from old lavas of burning mountains; and, in those
                    countries where volcanoes are common, it is said that they fill the houses, and
                    destroy people suddenly without the least warning of their approach. In mines
                    and coal-pits they are chiefly of two kinds, called by the miners and colliers
                    the <hi rend="italic">choke fire-damps</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and both go
                    under one general name of <hi rend="italic">foul air.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >choke-damps,</hi> known in modern chemistry by the name of fixed air, or
                    carbonic acid gas, usually infest those places which have been formerly worked,
                    but long neglected, and are called by the miners <hi rend="italic">wastes.</hi>
                    No place, however, can be reckoned safe from this kind of damps, except where
                    there is a due circulation of air; and the procuring of this is the only proper
                    means of preventing accidents from damps of all kinds. The choke-damp suffocates
                    the miners suddenly, with all the appearances found in those that are suffocated
                    by fixed air. Being heavy, it descends towards the lowest parts of the workings,
                    and thus is dangerous to the miners, who can scarcely avoid breathing it. The
                    <hi rend="italic">fire-damp,</hi> which is inflammable air, or hydrogen gas,
                    rises to the roof of the workings, as being specifically lighter than the common
                    atmosphere; and hence, though it will suffocate as well as the other, it seldom
                    proves so dangerous in this way as by its inflammable property, by which it
                    often takes fire at the candles, and explodes with extreme violence.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (No. 119), there is an
                    account of some explosions by damps of this kind, on which the following
                    observations have been made. First, Those who are in the place where the vapour
                    is fired suddenly find themselves surrounded with flames, but hear little or no
                    noise; though those who are in places adjacent, or above ground, hear a very
                    great one. Secondly, Those who are surrounded by the inflamed vapour feel
                    themselves scorched or burnt, but are not moved out of their places, though such
                    as. unhappily stand in the way of it are commonly killed by the violence of the
                    shock, and often thrown with great force out at the mouth of the pit; nor are
                    the heaviest machines found able to resist the impetuosity of the blast.
                    Thirdly, No smell is perceived before the fire, but a very strong one of
                    brimstone is afterwards perceptible. Fourthly, The vapour lies towards the roof,
                    and is not perceived if the candles are held low; but when these are held
                    higher, the damp descends like a black mist, and catches hold of the flame,
                    lengthening it to two or three handfuls; and this appearance ceases when the
                    candles are held nearer the ground. Fifthly, The flame continues in the vault
                    for several minutes after the crack. Sixthly, Its colour is blue, something
                    inclining to green, and very bright. Seventhly, On the explosion of the vapour,
                    a dark smoke like that proceeding from fired gunpowder is perceived. Eighthly,
                    Damps are generally observed to come about the latter end of May, and to
                    continue during the heat of summer. They return several times during the summer
                    season, but observe no certain rule.</p>
                <p>Besides these kinds of damps, which are very common, we find others described in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> concerning the nature of
                    which we can say nothing. Indeed the account seems somewhat suspicious. They are
                    given by Mr Jessop, from whom we have the foregoing observations concerning the
                    fire-damp, and who had these from the miners in Derbyshire. After describing the
                    common damp, which consists of fixed air, “They call the second sort,” says he,
                    “the <hi rend="italic">peas-bloorn damp,</hi> because, as they say, it smells
                    like peas-bloom. They tell me it always comes in the summer time; and those
                    grooves are not free which are never troubled with any other sort of damps. I
                    never heard that it was mortal, the scent, perhaps, freeing them from the danger
                    of a surprise; but by reason of it many good grooves lie idle at the best and
                    most profitable time of the year, when the subterraneous waters are the lowest.
                    They fancy it proceeds from the multitude of red-trefoil flowers, by them called
                    <hi rend="italic">honeysuckles,</hi> with which the limestone meadows in the
                    Peake do much abound. The third is the strangest and most pestilential of any,
                    if all be true which is said concerning it. Those who pretend to have seen it,
                    for it is visible, describe it thus: In the highest part of the roof of those
                    passages which branch out from the main groove, they often see a round thing
                    hanging, about the bigness of a foot-ball, covered with a skin of the thickness
                    and colour of a cobweb. This, they say, if it is broke by any accident, as the
                    splinter of a stone, or the like, disperseth itself immediately, and suffocates
                    all the company. Therefore, to prevent casualties, as soon as they have espied
                    it, they have a way, by the help of a stick and long rope, of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755228" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5228-0612"/>breaking it at a distance;
                    which done, they purify the place well with fire before they dare enter it
                    again. I dare not avouch the truth of this story in all its circumstances,
                    because the proof of it seems impossible, since they say it kills all that are
                    likely to bear witness to the particulars: neither do I deny but such a thing
                    may have been seen hanging on the roof, since I have heard many affirm it.” (See
