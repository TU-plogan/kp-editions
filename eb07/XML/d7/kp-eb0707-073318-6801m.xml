                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DERBEND</label>, a town of Persia, and capital of the
                    province of Daghestan, and also of a small principality of the same name. It is
                    situated in the province of Schirvan, on the western shore of the Caspian Sea,
                    and contains about 650 houses, and 4000 inhabitants, who are Armenians,
                    Mahommedans, Jews, and Russians. It is built in the form of a parallelogram, and
                    extends on a declivity from the very margin of the shore west to the foot of a
                    lofty mountain, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756814" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6814-0734"
                    />and is considered as the gate of Persia, its name signifying an impassable
                    place, or, more strictly, a door locked. It is surrounded by strong walls,
                    rising out of the sea, and defended by about sixty towers; and the highest part
                    of the hill or rock is crowned by the citadel, which, however, is at too great a
                    distance either to protect the city or to cover the harbour. Part of the
                    celebrated wall of Gog and Magog, said to have extended to the Black Sea, is
                    still to be seen near this fortress. It is of great solidity, and runs in a
                    western direction over high and inaccessible mountains. Many of the stones used
                    in the construction of the walls are cubes of six feet, but the ramparts are so
                    narrow that cannon are only mounted on the towers, and the entrance to the town
                    is through a single antique iron gate. The town was formerly supplied with water
                    by magnificent aqueducts built by the Arabs; but these are now in ruins, and the
                    inhabitants are under the necessity of using water from wells <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ∙so that the supply afforded is barely sufficient for
                    the consumption of the inhabitants. It has little trade, owing to the poverty of
                    the surrounding countries, but very fine saffron is cultivated in the
                    neighbourhood. The harbour is one of the worst on the Caspian Sea. It had
                    formerly a quay, which is now sunk under water. Derbend is a place of great
                    antiquity; the celebrated caliph Haroun-alRaschid lived here at different times,
                    and brought the town into great repute, by promoting commerce and the arts. In
                    the convulsions of this part of Asia it has frequently changed masters. It was
                    taken possession of by the Russians in 1722, who retained possession of it until
                    1735, when it was restored to the Persians. In the war with Persia which
                    commenced in 1796, it surrendered to the Russians, and has ever since remained
                    in their possession. Long. 48. 58. E. Lat. 41. 52. N.</p>
