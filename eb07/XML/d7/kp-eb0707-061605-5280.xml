                <p><label type="entry">DANIEL</label>, the fourth of the greater prophets, was born
                    in Judea, of the tribe of Judah, about the twenty-fifth year of the reign of
                    Josiah. He was led captive to Babylon, with other young Hebrew lords, after the
                    taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, who received them into his service. That
                    prince gave them masters to instruct them in the language and science of the
                    Chaldeans, and ordered them to be fed with the most delicate viands; but fearing
                    lest they should eat meat forbidden by the law of Moses, they desired the king’s
                    officers to allow them only pulse. The wisdom and conduct of Daniel having
                    pleased Nebuchadnezzar, that prince conferred on him several posts of honour. It
                    is commonly believed that this prophet, when but twelve years of age, made known
                    the innocence of the chaste Susannah; but the learned are not agreed that the
                    young Daniel who confounded the old men was the same with this prophet. However,
                    he explained Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the mysterious statue, which foretold the
                    four great monarchies; on which account he was made prefect of the province of
                    Babylon. In the reign of Darius, the king of the Medes, he refused to adore the
                    golden statue of the king, and was cast into the lions’ den, when those beasts,
                    though pinched with hunger, did him no manner of hurt; and he explained the
                    characters written on the wall of the room in which Belshazzar was feasting. It
                    is believed that Daniel died in Chaldea, and that he did not take advantage of
                    the permission granted by Cyrus to the Jews to return to their own country. St
                    Epiphanius says he died at Babylon; and in this he is followed by the generality
                    of historians.</p>

                    poet and historian, was born near Taunton, in Somersetshire, in the year 1562,
                    and educated at Oxford; but leaving that university without a degree, he applied
                    himself to English history and poetry under the patronage of the Earl of
                    Pembroke’s iamily. He was afterwards tutor to the Lady Anne Clifford; and, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194755293" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5293-0617"/> upon the death of
                    Spenser, he was created poet-laureat to Queen Elizabeth. In King James’s reign
                    he was appointed gentleman extraordinary, and afterwards one of the grooms of
                    the privy chamber to the queen consort, who took great delight in his
                    conversation and writings. He died in October 1619. His works, which are
                    numerous, consist mostly of dramatic pieces and poems, the principal of which
                    are, 1. The Complaint of Rosalind, London, 1594, 4to; 2. Sonnets; 3. Tragedy of
                    Cleopatra, London, 1598, 4to; 4. Of the Civil Wars between the Houses of York
                    and Lancaster; 5. The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses, London, 1604, 8vo; 6.
                    Epistles; 7. Musophilus, containing a General Defence of Learning; 8. Tragedy of
                    Philotas, London, 1611, 4to; 9. First part of the History of England, in three
                    books, London, 1613, 4to; 10. The Queen’s Arcadia, a pastoral tragi-comedy,
                    London, 1605, 4to; and, 11. Funeral Poem on the death of the Earl of Devon,
                    London, 1623, 4to. The character of Daniel’s genius seems to have been propriety
                    rather than elegance; his language is generally pure, and his reflections just;
                    but his thoughts are too abstract, and appeal to the understanding rather than
                    to the imagination or the heart.</p>
