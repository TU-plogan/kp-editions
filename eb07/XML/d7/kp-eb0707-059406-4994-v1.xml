                <p><label type="entry">DALGARNO, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, an almost
                    forgotten but highly meritorious and original writer, was born in Old Aberdeen
                    about the year 1626. He appears to have studied at Marischal College, New
                    Aberdeen, but for what length of time, or with what objects, is wholly unknown.
                    In 1657 he went to Oxford, where, according to Anthony Wood, “he taught a
                    private grammar school with good success for about thirty years.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(^Athen. Oxon.</hi> vol. ii. p. 506-7.) He died of a fever on the
                    28th August 1687, and was buried, says the same author, “in the north body of
                    the Church of St Mary Magdalen.” Such is the scanty biography which has been
                    preserved of a man who lived in friendship with the most eminent philosophers of
                    his day, and who, besides other original speculations, had the singular merit of
                    anticipating, a hundred and fifty years ago, some of the most profound
                    conclusions of the present age respecting the education of the deaf and dumb.
                    His work upon this subject is entitled <hi rend="italic">Didascalocophus, or the
                    Deaf and Dumb Mans Tutor,</hi> and was printed in a very small volume at Oxford
                    in 1680. He states the design of it to be, to bring the way of teaching a deaf
                    man to read and write, as nearly as possible to that of teaching young ones to
                    speak and understand their mother tongue. “In prosecution of this general idea,”
                    says an eminent philosopher nf our own time, who on more than one occasion did
                    his endeavour to rescue the name of Dalgarno from oblivion, “he has treated in
                    one short chapter, of <hi rend="italic">a Deaf Mans Dictionary</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, in another, of a <hi rend="italic">Grammar for Deaf
                    Persons</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> both of them containing a variety of
                    precious hints, from which useful practical lights might be derived by all who
                    have any concern in the tuition of children during the first stage of their
                    education.” (Mr Dugald Stewart’s <hi rend="italic">Account of a Boy born Blind
                    and Deaf. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinb.</hi> vol. vii.) Twenty
                    years before the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Didascalocophus,</hi>
                    Dalgarno had given to the world a very ingenious piece entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Ars Signorum,</hi> from which, says Mr Stewart, it appears
                    indisputably'' that he was the precursor of Bishop Wilkins in his speculations
                    concerning “a real character and a philosophical language.” Anthony Wood tells
                    us expressly, indeed, that Dalgarno communicated this piece to Wilkins before it
                    was published, and that it was from it that the latter took the hint of his
                    celebrated work. It is highly discreditable to Wilkins that he takes no notice
                    whatever of the name of Dalgarno; and Dr Wallis must share the same censure.
                    “That Dalgarno’s suggestions with respect to the education of the dumb were not
                    altogether useless to Dr W’allis, will be readily admitted by those,” says Mr
                    Stewart, “who take the trouble to compare his Letter to Mr Beverly, published
                    eighteen years <hi rend="italic">after-</hi> Dalgarno’s treatise, with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Loquela,</hi> published in 1653. In this Letter some valuable remarks are to be
                    found on the method of leading the dumb to the signification of words, and yet
                    the name of Dalgarno is not once mentioned to his correspondent.” That notice
                    which the English professors, who borrowed from them, ungenerously withheld from
                    the writings of the Scottish schoolmaster, was liberally bestowed upon them by a
                    far greater man of another country, namely, Leibnitz, who has, on various
                    occasions, alluded to the <hi rend="italic">Ars Signorum</hi> in commendatory
                    terms.</p>
