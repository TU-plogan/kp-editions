                <p><label type="entry">DENBIGHSHIRE</label>, a county of North Wales. This district,
                    which in Welsh is called <hi rend="italic">Sir Dinbech,</hi> was in the time of
                    the Romans included in that part of Cambria occupied by the Ordovices, and
                    formed a portion of Venedotia, one of the minor partitions of Britannia
                    Secunda.</p>
                <p>The figure of Denbighshire is very irregular, continually varying in length and
                    breadth. Its length from northwest to south-east is about forty-eight miles, and
                    its greatest breadth twenty miles, but in some parts it is not more than eight
                    miles. It is 170 miles in circumference, and is computed to contain 731 square
                    miles. On the north it is bounded by the Irish Sea, on the north-east it is
                    separated from Flintshire by the river Dee, on the south-east by Shropshire, on
                    the south by Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire, and on the west it is separated
                    from Caernarvonshire by the river Conway.</p>
                <p>This county is divided into six hundreds, Isdulas, Isaled, Ruthin, Yale,
                    Bromfield, and Chirk. It includes one borough, six market-towns, viz. Denbigh,
                    Ruthin, Wrexham, Holt, Llangollen, and Llanruost, and consists of fifty-seven
                    parishes. It is included in the Chester circuit; and, with respect to
                    ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it is under the Archbishop of Canterbury, partly in
                    the diocese of Bangor, and partly in that of St Asaph, the deanery of Duffryn
                    Chvyd being in the former see. By the reform act it returns one member to
                    parliament for the county, and one is chosen by the four burghs of Denbigh,
                    Ruthin, Holt, and the town of Wrexham. The borough of Denbigh affords the title
                    of earl to the noble family of Fielding, and that of Yelverton derives the title
                    of baron from the town of Ruthin.</p>
                <p>The surface of the country is much diversified, affording a very great variety of
                    scenery. The western parts are rather mountainous, abounding with hills, upon
                    which are <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756593" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6593-0717"
                    />small lakes. The northern parts have the same character, excepting that tract
                    which stretches from Abergeley along the sea-coast, which gradually slopes into
                    the extensive plain of Morva Rhyddlan. The celebrated Vale of Clwyd is a fine
                    scene. The land spreads on each side of a river of the same name from its source
                    to the sea, a distance of more than twenty miles, and from about five to seven
                    in breadth. The mountains, which rise on each side, with their brown and barren
                    summits, form a fine contrast with the verdant meads and luxuriant fields, which
                    gratify the sight as far as the eye can reach! Towns, villages, and seats,
                    thickly studded over its surface, tend still more to enliven the scene, and to
                    beautify this charming vale. The land included between the Alun and the Dee is
                    fertile, pleasant, and highly productive. The central parts of the hundred of
                    Isaled consist of bleak and barren hills, and the southern comprise a large
                    tract of land, devoid of wood, and productive of peat only, which principally
                    affords the fuel of the inhabitants. Yale is a mountainous region, chiefly
                    covered with heath, forming an excellent cover for grouse. Bromfield, the most
                    important part of this county in population and wealth, though sharing in the
                    mountainous character of the rest, furnishes a great proportion of rich
                    land.</p>
                <p>The irregularities of the surface, and the variety of the soils, produce a
                    considerable difference in the climate of Denbighshire. On the hills the air is
                    sharp, being deprived of its softness in its passage over Snowden and the
                    neighbouring hills. Still it is reckoned salubrious. The atmosphere in the vales
                    is milder. Duffryn Clwyd, being open towards the sea,and defended by its
                    mountain barriers, is proverbially celebrated for its salubrity. The inhabitants
                    of this district are remarkable for their bright complexion, cheerful
                    countenances, and sound constitutions; a display of vivacity in youth, and a
                    vigour in age, not possessed in less favoured situations; longevity, therefore,
                    ceases to be remarkable, because it is here a common occurrence.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of this county are the Clwyd, the Conway, and the Dee,
                    neither of which are navigable in those portions which pass through
                    Denbighshire. The lesser are Ceriog, rising on the western side, and forming a
                    junction with the Dee near Chirk Castle; the Alun, commencing from Llandegla,
                    and, after a most circuitous route, tailing into the Dee a little below the town
                    of Holt. The Ellesmere Canal passes through the southern part of the county; but
                    there is great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of water to keep it
                    navigable.</p>
                <p>Rich veins of iron and lead ore and coal have been found in various places; and
                    mines of these substances have been opened in several districts. Slate of a
                    durable quality is worked in the southern parts, and meets with a great demand.
                    Limestone is abundant; and freestone and other siliceous substances are obtained
                    in various parts.</p>
                <p>In agricultural improvements few counties surpass Denbighshire. The encouragement
                    given for the amelioration of the soil, by the establishment of two agricultural
                    societies, one in the Vale of Clwyd, and another in the neighbourhood of
                    Wrexham, together with the co-operating effects produced by Sir Watkin Williams
                    Wynne’s show of cattlc and sheep, annually held at his seat, Wynnstay, with a
                    distribution of prizes on the occasion, is very visible in the county. It is
                    stated to contain 410,000 acres, of which 150,000 is arable land and 250,000 is
                    pasturage. The roads also, which used to be very bad, have been much improved
                    during the last few years.</p>
                <p>The native horses are of a small size, but exceedingly hardy. The cows are
                    generally of the black kind, low-in stature, and yield milk of an excellent
                    quality. The sheep are the light horned sort, producing wool well adapted for
                    the manufactures of the country. The goat, superior in size, and in the length
                    and fineness of its hair, to that of most other countries, is found here in its
                    ferine and domesticated state. In an agricultural point of view, the chief
                    products are cattle, corn, and cheese. The latter is in some parts not inferior
                    to the best Cheshire.</p>
                <p>Its manufactures chiefly consist of coarse cloth made in the parish of Glynn, of
                    flannels wrought from the country wool, of cotton twist and Angola hose in the
                    town of Denbigh, of a small quantity of iron, and of a few harps at
                    Llanrwst.</p>
                <p>Among the customs peculiar to this-county, in common with other parts of Wales,
                    are those pertaining to marriages and burials. Their weddings are thus
                    conducted: When the marriage is agreed to be celebrated, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bidder,</hi> that is, one whose charge is to <hi rend="italic">bid</hi> or
                    invite the guests, is appointed. He must be a person of respectable character,
                    and as well gifted with eloquence and address as can be procured, as on his
                    abilities the number of guests chiefly depends. He is to be sufficiently skilled
                    in pedigrees and family anecdotes, in order to be able to introduce compliments
                    derived from these sources. The purport of his bidding is to request the
                    attendance of the friends of the young couple, and their benevolent presents, in
                    order to enable the new-married pair to begin life with comfort and prosperity.
                    These contributions are some article of furniture or money, and are regularly
                    repaid, by gifts of a similar kind, on a like occasion. By this custom, a
                    deserving young couple of the lower class are sometimes set up in a state of
                    comparative wealth.</p>
                <p>Previously to a funeral, it is customary, when the corpse is brought out of the
                    house and laid upon a bier, for the next of kin to distribute bread, cheese, and
                    beer over the coffin, to some poor persons of the same sex, and nearly of the
                    same age, as the deceased. This being done, all kneel down, and the minister
                    repeats the Lord’s prayer. At every cross way they stop, and the same ceremony
                    is repeated, till they arrive at the place of interment. The funerals are
                    generally attended by immense crowds of people of both sexes. All the graves are
                    planted with the choicest evergreens and flowers; so that a church-yard has all
                    the appearance of a beautiful well-managed flower-garden.</p>
                <p>The peasantry of this county are firm believers in <hi rend="italic"
                    >fairies,</hi> a diminutive race, clad in green, who hold their merry dances
                    invisibly by moonlight, footing it to lyric measures on the verdant turf of
                    their mountains, and leaving their marks, in darkened circles, to the admiration
                    of the beholders. Allied to this race are the <hi rend="italic">hnochers,</hi> a
                    species of aerial beings, who, the miners say, are heard under ground, and by
                    their noises pointing out to the workman the place where a rich vein of ore lies
                    hid. The corpse candle is a light proceeding from the dwelling of a person who
                    is shortly to die, to the churchyard where he is to be buried. Witchcraft and
                    the second-sight are also articles of firm belief among the lower class.</p>
                <p>Denbighshire contains several remains of ancient castles; that near the county
                    town has been compared, with respect to its situation, to Stirling. It is placed
                    on the summit of a lofty hill, and assumes at a distance a most imposing
                    appearance. From its present remains it appears to have been a superb structure,
                    and, from the strength of its position, invulnerable except by heavy artillery,
                    and irreducible, except in cases of treachery or famine. It is supposed to be of
                    British foundation. The castle of Ruthin was built of red stone, and erected in
                    the time of Edward I. It stood on the side of a hill fronting the vale to the
                    west. The remains of this once proud pile consist of a few fragments of towers
                    and fallen walls, reduced nearly to the foundations; and the area at present
                    comprises a meadow, fives-court, and bowling-green. There are also the remains
                    of a castle at Chirk, on the line of Offa’s Dike; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756606" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6606-0718"/> and another at Holt, built
                    by Earl Warren in the reign of Edward I. whose remains are now little
                    attractive.</p>
                <p>Its ecclesiastical antiquities consist of the remains of St Hiliary’s Chapel,
                    founded in 1579, by Dudley, earl of Leicester, and a priory of Carmelites, or
                    White Friars, in the town of Denbigh. Llan Eqwert Abbey, a fine picturesque
                    object, was a house of Cistertians founded in 1200, and generally known by the
                    name of Valle Crucis. Wrexham Church, formerly collegiate, and not only the
                    glory of the county, but ranked among the wonders of Wales, was erected about
                    the year 1472; but the tower doe3 not appear to have been finished till 1506. It
                    exhibits a specimen of the chaste proportions and moderate decorations of Henry
                    VlI.’s time.</p>
                <p>Among the modern buildings, Wynnstay Hall, the hospitable mansion of Sir W. W.
                    Wynne, and Chirk Castle, the seat of the Honourable Mr West, deserve particular
                    notice.</p>
                <p>The amount of population, from returns not of very certain accuracy, in 1700
                    appears to have been 39,700, and 46,900 in 1750; but by the more correct returns
                    of late years it has been as follows, viz. 60,352 in 1801, 64,240 in 1811,
                    76,311 in 1821, and 82,800 in 1831. The annual value of the real property, as
                    assessed for the property-tax of 1815, appears to have been L.22l,763.</p>
