                <p><label type="entry">DANTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">George-Jacques</hi></label>,
                    born at Arcis-sur-Aube on the 28th October 1759, was, at the epoch of the
                    revolution, advocate to the council of the king, and one of the most terrible
                    enemies of the authority to which a little before he appeared to have attached
                    his fortune. Nature seems to have fitted this man for the part which he chose
                    for himself. In appearance, in figure, and in voice, he might well have passed
                    for an incarnate representative of a malignant but mighty fiend. Of colossal
                    stature and extraordinary strength, with a countenance deeply marked by the
                    small-pox, a flat and wry nose, protruding lips, and little sparkling eyes, he
                    had an ardent and audacious look; whilst his rude and powerful voice made the
                    public halls resound with its harsh thunder, and his diction, full of
                    gigantesque figures and violent apostrophes, terrified those whom it failed to
                    overpower. Mirabeau, who wanted persons of this description, in order to
                    frighten the court and produce the first shocks of the revolution, employed
                    Danton, as a sort of forge-blast, to inflame the popular passions. Ever since
                    the year 1789, he had been the principal chief of the Parisian populace, in fact
                    a true fish-market king. When the capital had been divided into districts, he
                    was chosen to preside over that of the Cordeliers; and this portion of Paris
                    immediately became the rendezvous of the most furious revolutionists;—in its
                    assemblies all authorities were attacked, and all principles perverted. But this
                    local anarchy did by no means satisfy the wishes of Danton. For, as the tribune
                    of the district was accessible to all the citizens, there occasionallyappeared
                    in it reasonable men, who forcibly combated his extravagances; and hence, in
                    order to ensure the development of his system, he required auxiliaries disposed
                    rather to go beyond than to fall short of his intentions. With this view he
                    established the club of the Cordeliers, compared to which, that of the Jacobins
                    was a collection of moderate and rational persons. Hitherto the district had
                    only attacked monarchical institutions; but the new club had for its object to
                    subvert, even to its foundations, the whole fabric of society. About the same
                    time Danton took under his protection the infamous Marat, whose journal
                    corrupted the populace, and stimulated them to the commission of every kind of
                    excess; he withdrew that diseased miscreant from the agents of the police,
                    afforded him an asylum, and employed him as often as he had occasion for any
                    seditious movement, or for spreading some denunciation necessary to his designs.
                    But it was not only in district assemblies nor in the clubs that Danton
                    domineered; he was to be seen in the streets and in the public places, in the
                    midst of tumultuous assemblages, haranguing the multitude, often with vehemence,
                    and sometimes with gaiety. He had not, like many others, declared for the
                    revolution on speculative grounds. His views were far less elevated. Devoted to
                    sensual indulgences, he belonged to that class of intriguers who seek to bring
                    on great civil commotions in order thereby to arrive at fortune; and sometimes
                    he made no mystery of his intentions in this respect.</p>
                <p>But it was not till the flight and return of Louis XVI. from Varennes that he
                    began to make himself generally feared. On that occasion he put himself at the
                    head of the assemblage in the Champ-de-Mars, which demanded the trial and
                    punishment of the king. This first essay, however, proved unsuccessful; Danton
                    was ordered to be arrested; and being at the same time pursued for debt, he
                    durst not appear openly at the elections. But he had nevertheless the audacity
                    to go to canvass for votes; and when an officer named Damien attempted to seize
                    him, the poor man was himself arrested for having violated the national
                    sovereignty. The populace, who watched over the safety of their chiefs, wished
                    to massacre the officer; and Danton was named deputy attorney-general of the
                    commune of Paris, in the face of the laws, and even of the constituent assembly
                    itself, to which this nomination was a manifest outrage. At length the
                    constitutional advisers of Louis XVI. seeing that they could not overpower
                    Danton, or rather that they durst not attempt it, resolved to purchase him; but
                    the persons charged with the negociation having estimated his services at too
                    low a price, were consequently treated with disdain; he haughtily rejected their
                    propositions, and had the incredible audacity, in one of his discourses to the
                    commune, to signify, that if the terms proposed had not been accepted, it was
                    only because they were below his pretensions. In order, however, to silence some
                    rumours which were circulated against him, he now showed himself fiercer than
                    ever against royalty, and contributed more than any other individual to the
                    revolution <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755332" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5332-0620"/>of
                    the tenth of August. The real republicans still confined themselves to mere
                    declamations; they were undecided what course they should follow, and they dared
                    not push matters to extremities. It was Danton who struck the decisive blow,
                    after having prepared all the means necessary to render it effectual. Some days
                    before the catastrophe, Pétion, major of Paris, had caused to be lodged in the
                    house of the Cordeliers, and recommended to its benevolence, that horde of
                    ruffians who, under the name of the Marseillais, had traversed France, to the
                    number of six hundred, declaring openly, wherever they went, that they were
                    going to Paris to murder the king. Danton received them, entertained them, gave
                    them the necessary instructions, provided them with suitable auxiliaries, and
                    arranged with them the attack of the Tuilleries; and it was, in fact, by means
                    of these vagabonds that the oldest and most powerful monarchy of Europe was, at
                    a moment of weakness and terror, overthrown.</p>
                <p>After this event, Danton was appointed minister of justice by the legislative
                    assembly, which had now lost all authority, and decreed whatever he required of
                    it. Even Robespierre, afterwards so powerful, durst not as yet venture to show
                    himself; and Danton stood alone on the field of battle, surrounded only by a
                    small number of friends. He began by causing the barriers to be shut, and
                    decreeing domiciliary visits in order to discover those who were known to be
                    attached to the party of the court. These searches were made in the middle of
                    the night, and a crowd of persons, chiefly belonging to the most distinguished
                    classes, were hurried to prison, where a dreadful fate awaited them. An
                    extraordinary tribunal was instituted, and the first victims were sent to the
                    scaffold; but, formidable as were the men who composed it, this tribunal still
                    procccded too slowly for the taste of the popular leaders, who required numerous
                    executions, and proceedings more rapid and terrible. On the morning of the 2d
                    September 1792, intelligence arrived that the Prussians, commanded by the Duke
                    of Brunswick, and having with them two brothers of the king, and a great number
                    of emigrants, had entered the territory of France and taken possession of Lorgwy
                    and Verdun. This news threw the capital into the most violent agitation. Danton
                    immediately repaired to the committee of the commune, and, having convoked the
                    committee of public safety, whose members all belonged to the club of the
                    Cordeliers, had a long conference with them. The prisoners were then deprived of
                    all instruments and moveables which might have been used by them in their own
                    defence; whilst those detained for debt, and some other persons who were
                    fortunate enough to interest the popular leaders, were released. This being
                    done, the terrible minister of justice proceeded to the bar of the national
                    assembly, gave an account of the progress of the enemy, and required that a
                    general arming should be instantly decreed, that the tocsin should be sounded,
                    and that all citizens able to bear arms should be summoned to the Champ-de-Mars,
                    to be there enrolled and formed into military cohorts, to march against the
                    tyrants and their satellites. The deputy Vergniaux, in a vehement harangue,
                    enumerated the menaces of the Duke of Brunswick, and converted the demand of the
                    minister into a motion, which was unanimously agreed to.</p>
                <p>But scarcely had this decree passed, when alarm and terror spread all over the
                    capital. At the lugubrious sound of the tocsin, and the hollow roll of the
                    générale, the furious multitude shouted “to arms,” insulting and menacing all
                    who did not participate in their frenzy; whilst the emissaries of the clubs and
                    of the committee of the commune declared loudly, that before marching against
                    the enemy, it was necessary to exterminate the “scélérats” of the interior, and
                    particularly the prisoners seized in the course of the domiciliary visits. These
                    unhappy men, foreseeing their fate, supplicated the individual charged with the
                    superintendence of the prisons to save their lives; and, to his eternal honour,
                    that person courageously undertook to do his utmost in order to provide for
                    their safety. He repaired to the hotel where the ministers were assembled, and
                    first addressed himself to Danton, giving an account of the movements which were
                    observed around the prisons, with the alarm of the prisoners, and representing
                    to the colossal terrorist that it particularly belonged to him, as minister of
                    justice, to afford them protection. Danton, however, repulsed the application in
                    language worthy of a revolutionary Moloch. With a bellowing tone of voice, and a
                    gesture appropriated to the expression, he exclaimed, in words which we shall
                    not translate, “Je me f... bien des prisonniers; qu’ils deviennent ce qui
                    pouront;” and went away grinning a diabolical smile at his own sanguinary
                    brutality. It was equally by his orders or with his approbation that the persons
                    who had been sent to the high court of Orleans were brought back to Versailles,
                    and there massacred. It was under his countersign that the odious circular
                    issued by the committee of the commune of Paris was sent into the departments to
                    invite the “patriots” to repeat in the provinces the executions of September in
                    the capital. These dreadful massacres produced the effect which their authors
                    had expected from them. Terror froze every heart. In the greater number of the
                    departments, as well as in Paris, the enemies of the royal authority alone
                    obtained suffrages at the elections; and all public functions were performed by
                    the most furious of this class.</p>
                <p>Danton quitted the ministry of justice in order to discharge the duties of a
                    deputy to the convention, to which he had been called by the electors of Paris,
                    hoping to exercise there the same ascendency as he had done over the clubs and
                    the people of the capital; but he carried along with him a double source of
                    discord and enmity, namely, his crimes and his success. Although he was in fact
                    the real founder of the republic, yet the true republicans were necessarily his
                    adversaries. This class of revolutionists, amongst whom were several who to fine
                    talents united elevated sentiments, did not choose that the republic, which was
                    the object of their wishes, should from its very birth be attainted by crimes so
                    horrible and so monstrous as the executions of September; and they warmly
                    demanded the punishment of those who had committed them, or had been accessary
                    to their commission. On the other hand, the dark jealousy of Robespierre
                    observed with uneasiness that Danton divided with him the favour of the
                    populace, and possessed at least equal influence in the convention; and from
                    this time accordingly he meditated Danton’s destruction.</p>
                <p>Although at this time much more criminal than his rival, Danton was nevertheless
                    of a disposition less exclusively wicked. He was one of those proud beings who,
                    conceiving themselves called to regulate the destinies of states, think that all
                    crimes become lawful actions, provided they tend to ensure the success of grand
                    designs; but he would not have committed useless crimes, and it may be said of
                    him that he ceased to be criminal from the moment when he had no longer any
                    pretension to figure as a statesman. Even at the first sitting of the
                    convention, he wished to re-establish order and to inspire confidence, by
                    demanding that all property should be guaranteed by a solemn decree. More
                    tolerant than other persons who had not to reproach themselves with the same
                    excesses, he said he was afraid of rendering liberty hateful by too rigorous an
                    application of what he was pleased to call “philosophical principles.” On
                    several occasions he even took upon himself the defence of religious worship;
                    and it is not <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755345" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5345-0621"
                    />altogether improbable that this terrible man would have become prudent and
                    moderate, had he not been forced to repel the attacks directed against his
                    party. Roland, his colleague in the ministry, hoping to render himself agreeable
                    to the people by proving that he had not shared in the peculations which had
                    recently taken place, gave an account of his conduct in office, and caused
                    placards containing his official exposition to be affixed to the corners of the
                    streets. Danton, on the other hand, being unable to parade so much honesty,
                    pretended that the ministers were only responsible as a whole, and could not
                    render an account except collectively. This doctrine prevailed, and Roland fell
                    under the axe of the guillotine.</p>
                <p>Danton voted for the death of Louis XVI.; but it was not apparently a judgment
                    which he wished to pronounce. In answer to one of the familiars who, in
                    conversation, represented to him that the convention had done wrong in putting
                    the king on his trial, “You are right,” said Danton; “therefore we will not
                    judge him, we’ll kill him.” The new republic was already tormented with the most
                    violent discords, which, notwithstanding all his audacity, occasioned Danton
                    great uneasiness. He foresaw inevitable catastrophes, and dreaded that he and
                    his associates would not be able much longer to command events. “The metal
                    boils,” said he; “but the statue of liberty is not yet cast. If you do not watch
                    the furnace, you will be all burned.”</p>
                <p>On his return from Belgium, whither he had been sent with Lacroix to superintend
                    the armies and revolutionize the country, he was warmly accused of peculation,
                    particularly by Marat. He treated Marat with contempt, and silenced his
                    accusers; but he could never efface the impression which this denunciation had
                    made. After the check which the armies experienced at Aix-la-Chapelle, Danton
                    returned to Paris to give an account of the state of things, and to prepare the
                    necessary means of defence. These were terror and levies <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse.</hi> In the clubs and in the sectional
                    assemblies, the cry to arms was continually resounded; and to supply the place
                    of the massacres of September, which being too complete could not be renewed,
                    Danton caused Chaumette, then one of his partisans, to demand the formation of a
                    revolutionary tribunal. Towards the close of the struggle which terminated in
                    the events of the 31st May 1793, Danton hesitated what part to take. The
                    popularity of Robespierre disturbed him; but the declared determination of the
                    moderate republicans to bring the authors of the massacres of September to
                    punishment did not occasion him less alarm. At the moment of the crisis, Μ. de
                    Meilhan, who belonged to the latter party, endeavoured to draw him over by
                    flattering his pride. Danton listened to him with attention, looked for an
                    instant undecided, then, reflecting on the danger to which he would expose
                    himself, and the influence which he would lose by a change of system, he merely
                    replied, with reference to the republicans, “They have not confidence;” and
                    entered the hall of the convention, where, mingling with those who were rushing
                    blindly into a new revolution, he invoked without success the vengeance of the
                    laws against Henriot, who had outraged the convention, and appeared to desire
                    its dissolution. After the 3lst of May, Danton demanded that the committee of
                    public safety should be erected into a provisional government; and, in order to
                    prevent all suspicion, he refused to become a member of that body.</p>
                <p>Less verbose than Robespierrein his popular cajoleries, Danton nevertheless
                    sought to attach the multitude by means which must have appeared to him much
                    more effectual. He attacked all the laws of the maximum, and especially the tax
                    on grain; and as the sectional assemblies of Paris had been deserted, terror
                    having kept away some, and the necessity of labour others, he caused a decree to
                    be passed, ordaining that each citizen who attended these assemblies should
                    receive an indemnity of forty sous. From this time they were inundated by crowds
                    of the lowest populace, prepared to believe whatever was told them, and to do
                    whatever they were desired. One of their first acts was to demand that Danton
                    should be added to the committee of public safety; and although he affected to
                    refuse, he ended by consenting to form one of that body. In the month of
                    November 1793, he attacked the extravagant festivals of Reason, which the
                    schismatic Cordeliers dared to celebrate, even in the very bosom of the
                    convention. “When shall we cause these mummeries to cease ?” said he. “We have
                    not wished to destroy superstition in order to establish atheism.” Robespierre
                    joined him in overthrowing a faction which threatened both alike; and soon
                    afterwards the principal founders of the worship of reason parted with their
                    heads on the scaffold.</p>
                <p>But this understanding could not be of long duration. Robespierre was not one of
                    those men who hate in vain. Camille Desmoulins, the friend of Danton, had
                    ventured to compare the measures then pursued with those which had been employed
                    by Tiberius, and to exhibit proofs in a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Vieux Cordelier,</hi> wherein he published various
                    passages from Tacitus, which certainly went to show that a perfect similitude
                    existed between the decrees of the convention and those of the Roman emperor.
                    Robespierre rebuked him sharply, and abandoned him to the vengeance of the
                    chiefs of his party, whom he had turned into ridicule. Danton took the part of
                    Desmoulins, and counselled him not to be alarmed at the severity of the reproof
                    administered by Robespierre, who could no longer tolerate any opposition to his
                    will. He also wished to defend Fabre d’Eglantine, his intimate adviser, who had
                    been accused of malversation; but he was unable to save his brother peculator,
                    and ought to have learned by this check that he himself would soon be attacked.
                    In fact the struggle now commenced between these redoubted rivals; and those who
                    dreaded the consequences attempted to bring them together. They met at dinner,
                    but parted in greater alienation than ever, “It is right,” said Danton,
                    addressing Robespierre, “that the royalists should be put down; but the innocent
                    ought not to be confounded with the guilty, and we should only strike when the
                    blow will be useful to the republic.” “Eh! who has told you,” replied
                    Robespierre, knitting his eye-brows fiercely, “that any innocent man has
                    perished ?” <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> must show myself,”
                    said Danton, in retiring; “there is not a moment to be lost.” Nevertheless,
                    instead of acting he hesitated. Westermann, his principal agent, pressed him to
                    strike, and promised assistance. Danton merely answered, “He dares not.” But
                    before braving him, Robespierre had taken his measures, and the giant who had
                    overturned the throne was arrested in bed on the night of the 31st March 1794,
                    without offering the least resistance. Lacroix, his friend, was arrested the
                    same night, and both were conducted to the Luxembourg. Danton, on entering,
                    politely saluted the numerous <hi rend="italic">detenus</hi> who had crowded
                    around in order to see him. “Gentlemen,” said he, “I had hopes of soon bringing
                    about your liberation; but here I am myself among you; and I no longer know how
                    all this will end.” Some deputies wished to remonstrate against this arrest; but
                    Robespierre appeared in the tribune, and having indignantly asked who they were
                    that dared to take the part of the conspirator, and the immoral man with whose
                    crimes the people were about to be made acquainted, they all remained silent.
                    Danton and Lacroix were confined in separate cells, but sufficiently near to be
                    able to converse, and to be overheard by the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >detenus.</hi> Lacroix threw out some reproaches against Danton, accusing him of
                    indolence and carelessness. “It is this,” said he, “which has ruined <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194755358" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5358-0622"/> us.” They then
                    conversed gaily on the fate which awaited them, and which they appeared to
                    deride. When brought before the revolutionary tribunal, four days after their
                    arrest, they scarcely deigned to answer the interrogatories put to them by the
                    president, and during the discussion they amused themselves with rolling pellets
                    of bread, and darting them at the noses of the judges and the jury. Danton,
                    whilst occupied in forming these missiles, merely observed, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Mon individu sera bientôt dans le</hi><hi rend="italic">neant</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; mais mon nom est déjà dans la posteritél'</hi> The tribunal,
                    terrified at their audacity, consulted the committees of government on the
                    subject, and the latter gave orders to put the prisoners <hi rend="italic">hors
                    des debats,</hi> that is, to condemn them at once, without further hearing. This
                    decision threw Danton into an inexpressible rage, and he launched out into
                    imprecations against those by whom he had been proscribed. “It was I,” cried he
                    on entering the chamber of the condemned, “it was I who caused this infamous
                    tribunal to be instituted; I ask pardon of God and man for having done so. I
                    leave every thing,” added he, “in a frightful hodgepodge; no one understands any
                    thing of government: besides, they are all brothers of Cain; Brissot would have
                    caused me to be guillotined as well as Robespierre.” The sight of the apparatus
                    of punishment did not in the slightest degree discompose him; he mounted the
                    fatal cart with unshaken firmness; his head was high, and his looks full of
                    pride; and he seemed still to command the populace. Nevertheless, before
                    submitting himself to the executioner, he seemed for an instant to be softened,
                    if not overcome. “Oh, my well-beloved! oh, my wife,” cried he, “I shall never
                    see you more.” Then rousing him abruptly, he shouted, “Be thyself, Danton; no
                    weakness ;” after which he rapidly ascended the scaffold, and said to the
                    executioner, “You will show my head to the people; it is worth the trouble.” He
                    died on the 5th April 1794, at the age of thirty-five. <hi rend="italic"
