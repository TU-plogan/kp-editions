                <p><label type="entry">DEE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a mathematician
                    and astrologer, was born in July 1527, at London, where his father was a wealthy
                    vintner. In 1542 he was sent to St John’s College, Cambridge. After five years’
                    close application to mathematical studies, particularly astronomy, he went to
                    Holland, in order to visit several eminent mathematicians on the Continent.
                    Having continued abroad nearly a year, he returned to Cambridge, and was there
                    elected one of the fellows of Trinity College, then first erected by King Henry
                    VIII. In 1548 he took the degree of master of arts; and in the same year he left
                    England a second time, his stay at home being rendered unpleasant by the
                    suspicions which were entertained of his being a conjuror; suspicions arising
                    partly from his application to astronomy, but especially on account of a piece
                    of machinery in the <hi rend="italic">Ε</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ξη</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∣</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi> of
                    Aristophanes, which he exhibited to the university, and in which he represented
                    the scarabaeus flying up to Jupiter, with a man and a basket of victuals on its
                    back. These suspicions he could never after shake off; nor did his subsequent
                    conduct, as we shall see, tend to clear him of the imputation; for if he was not
                    actually a conjuror, it was not from want of endeavours to become one.</p>
                <p>Upon leaving England he repaired to the University of Louvain, where he was much
                    esteemed, and visited by several persons of high rank. Here he resided about two
                    years, and then set out for France, where, in the college of ìlheims, he read
                    lectures on Euclid’s Elements with great applause. In 1551 he returned to
                    England, and was introduced by the secretary Cecil to King Edward, who assigned
                    him a pension of a hundred crowns, which he afterwards relinquished for the
                    rectory of Upton-upon-Severn; but soon after the accession of Queen Mary, having
                    had some correspondence with the Lady Elizabeth’s servants, he was accused of
                    practising against the queen’s life by enchantment. On this account he suffered
                    a tedious confinement, and was several times examined; but in the year 1555, he
                    obtained his liberty by an order of council.</p>
                <p>When Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne, Dee was consulted by Lord Dudley
                    concerning a propitious day for her majesty’s coronation. On this occasion he
                    was introduced to the queen, who made him great promises, which were never
                    performed, though she condescended to receive his instructions relative to the
                    mystical interpretation of some of his unintelligible writings, which he
                    published about this time. In 1564 he made another voyage to the Continent, in
                    order to present a book which he had dedicated to the Emperor Maximilian. He
                    returned to England in the same year; but in 1571 we find him in Lorrain, where,
                    being dangerously ill, two physicians were sent to his relief by the queen.
                    Having once more returned to his native country, he settled at Mortlake, in
                    Surrey, where he continued his studies with unremitting ardour, and collected a
                    considerable library of curious books and manuscripts, and a variety of
                    instruments, most of which were afterwards destroyed by the mob, as belonging to
                    one who dealt with the devil. In 1578, the queen being then much indisposed, Mr
                    Dee was sent abroad to consult with German physicians and philosophers, or
                    rather astrologers, on the occasion. But having returned to England, he was soon
                    afterwards employed in a more rational service. Her majesty, desirous to be
                    informed concerning her title to those countries which had been discovered by
                    her subjects, commanded Mr Dee to consult the ancient records, and to furnish
                    her with proper geographical descriptions. Accordingly, in a short time he
                    presented to the queen, in the gardens at Richmond, two large rolls, in which
                    the discovered countries were geographically described and historically
                    illustrated. These rolls are preserved in the Cotton Library. His next
                    employment was the reformation of the calendar, a subject<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755943" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5943-0667"/> on which he wrote a rational
                    and learned treatise, still preserved in the Ashmolean Library at Oxford.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the extravagancies of our eccentrical philosopher seem to have been
                    counteracted by a tolerable proportion of reason and science; but henceforward
                    we must consider him as a mere necromancer and credulous alchymist. In the year
                    1581, he became acquainted with one Edward Kelly, by whose assistance he
                    performed divers incantations, and maintained a frequent imaginary intercourse
                    with spirits. He was particularly intimate, it seems, with the angels Raphael
                    and Gabriel, one of whom made him a present of a black speculum, in which his
                    angels and demons appeared as often as he had occasion for them; they also
                    answered his questions, and Kelly’s business was merely to record their
                    dictates. In 1583, Kelly and Dee were both introduced to a certain Polish
                    nobleman, then in England, named Albert Laski, palatine of Siradia, a person
                    addicted to the same ridiculous pursuits; and the Pole was so charmed with Dee
                    and his companion, that he persuaded them to accompany him to his native
                    country. They accordingly embarked for Holland in September 1583, and travelling
                    over land, arrived at the town of Laski in February following. Their patron,
                    however, finding himself abused by their idle pretensions, persuaded them to pay
                    a visit to Rodolph, king of Bohemia, who, though a credulous man, was soon
                    disgusted with their nonsense. They were afterwards introduced to the king of
                    Poland, but with no better success. Soon after this they were invited by a rich
                    Bohemian nobleman to his castle of Tre-bona, where they continued for some time
                    in great affluence, owing, as they asserted, to their art of transmutation by
                    means of a certain powder in the possession of Kelly.</p>
                <p>But Dee having quarrelled with his companion, quitted Bohemia, and returned to
                    England, where he was once more graciously received by the queen, who in 1595
                    made him warden of Manchester College, in which town he resided several years.
                    In 1604, he returned to his house at Mortlake, where he died in the year 1608,
                    aged eighty-one, leaving a large family and many works behind him.</p>
                <p>The principal works which Dee printed and published are, 1. <hi rend="italic"
