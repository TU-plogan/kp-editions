                <p><label type="entry">DAMASCUS</label>, a large, opulent, and handsome city of
                    Syria, which stands on the western edge of a fine plain, and on a level site,
                    having a chain of hills passing close to it on the north-west, and the plain
                    extending away beyond the range of vision to the east, adorned everywhere with
                    extensive gardens, and forming a circuit of between twenty-five and thirty
                    miles. It was formerly surrounded by walls defended by towers, which have now
                    fallen into a ruinous state; and the buildings also have so increased that the
                    number of houses without the walls is double that of those within. The streets
                    are in general narrow compared with those in European cities; but the narrowest
                    streets of Damascus are wider than most of the streets of Cairo, and
                    conveniently admit two foot passengers to move with safety on each side of a
                    loaded camel; the greater number of the streets would allow two loaded camels to
                    pass without incommoding those on foot, and many streets are so wide as to allow
                    six or eight camels or horses to pass abreast. They are all well paved, and have
                    elevated foot-paths on each side. All the houses in the suburbs are surmounted
                    with cupolas; and these, viewed from a distance, present an appearance of an
                    encampment of conical tents ten or twelve feet high. The houses in this quarter
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755150" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5150-0606"/> of the town
                    are built of bricks baked in the sun, which, were they not protected by the
                    cupolas, would be wasted away by the rains. The buildings in the interior of the
                    town are constructed chiefly of stone below and light yellow bricks above; they
                    are about two stories high, with flat roofs, whilst the prinċipal edifices are
                    painted in the gayest colours, and the aspect is light and airy in the extreme.
                    The town, however, in the interior has a dull and monotonous appearance; the
                    houses, from the size of the doors, and the small number of windows, presenting
                    a great proportion of dead surface. Damascus is one of the most splendid cities
                    in the East, and contains about 500 houses, which are entitled to the name of
                    palaces: all their splendour is, however, confined to the interior, which
                    contains a number of spacious and splendid apartments, courts, terraces, and
                    galleries, adorned with marble pavements of various colours, ingeniously and
                    fancifully arranged, mosaic work of the same materials, friezes painted and
                    gilded, and the ceilings so many broad canopies of gold and brilliant colours,
                    with rich additions of sculpture and enamel, and the furniture consisting of
                    sofas richly embroidered, Persian carpets, mirrors, and other valuable articles,
                    worth frequently from L. 5000 to L.25,000. Into many of the apartments beautiful
                    fountains are introduced. No city contains so many canals and fountains; each
                    house has one; and this abundant supply of water is derived from three rivulets
                    or branches of the river called Barrady, which, after fertilizing the gardens
                    for a course of about three leagues, arc lost in a hollow of the desert to the
                    southeast, where they form a morass, called Behairat-el-Merdi, or the Lake of
                    the Meadow. The mosques and chapels throughout the city are exceedingly
                    numerous, the former being not less than one hundred, large and small. Of these,
                    the Great Mosque, so called on account of its extent, is the most remarkable.
                    The architecture is of the Corinthian order throughout every part of the
                    edifice. Its form is an oblong square, composed of three aisles running parallel
                    to each other, and divided by rows of fine Corinthian columns. It has two
                    minarets at each end, and is crowned by a large stone cupola, supported by four
                    enormous pillars. The interior produces a most imposing effect from its
                    dimensions, and the square court in front is also magnificent from its extent.
                    It has on three of its sides a porticoor colonnade of Syrian granite pillars,
                    mostly of a fine grain and reddish colour, and on the outside is a superb
                    fountain, which throws the water twenty feet high. Another with a grove of trees
                    on each side stands in a spacious court within. The galleries are supported by
                    numerous columns, and on the walls are still seen the remains of mosaic work
                    with which they were once adorned. An hospital for the indigent sick is attached
                    to this edifice. This mosque is said to have been originally built by the
                    Emperor Heraclius, and to have been dedicated to Zachariah; by others it has
                    been considered to have been the work of the bishops of this see, and by them
                    dedicated to St John of Damascus; whilst the Turks call it the Mosque of St John
                    the Baptist, and think it was built by the Khalif Valid in the 86th year of the
                    Hegira <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 692). The mosque of the dervishes, where
                    these fanatics dance until they are excited to a temporary fit of madness, is a
                    large, regular, and handsome edifice, and has two of the loftiest and finest
                    minarets to be seen in Damascus. Besides the principal dome, which is very
                    large, a line of smaller ones is carried round three sides of the open court in
                    front of the building, after the same manner as those in the great mosque of
                    Mecca, of which it appears to be a close imitation. In the court adjoining this
                    mosque is an hospital or charitable institution, constructed by the Sultan
                    Selim, for the manufacture of silk. There are other mosques, distinguished for
                    their beautiful and ancient architecture. One is adorned with all kinds of fine
                    marble like mosaic pavement, and another is remarkable for its minaret, which is
                    entirely cased with pantiles. Besides the mosques of the Mahommedans, the Jews
                    have six synagogues, the Catholic Christians one convent, with a church included
                    in it, the Greeks one place of worship larger and richer than the Catholics, the
                    Armenians a convent and a church, and the Syrians and Maronites one each. To all
                    these places of worship there can hardly be less than 1000 persons attached,
                    including the ulemah of the Mahommedans, the rabbin of the Jews, and the priests
                    of the Christian sects, whose sole business it is to promote their several
                    religions, and increase the number of their proselytes. The patriarch of Antioch
                    has his see at Damascus, where he resides. The castle is situated towards the
                    south-west part of the city, and is about three quarters of a mile in circuit.
                    It is a large and fine edifice, with three square towers in front and five on
                    each side, and is surrounded with a broad and deep ditch of rustic masonry.
                    Within it resembles a small town. It is supposed to have been built in the
                    middle ages, either by the Greeks or the first Mahommedan conquerors of Syria.
                    It appears to be a work of great antiquity, and to have undergone many
                    additions, alterations, and repairs at different periods. In the oldest parts of
                    it, near the foundation, the stones are of an extraordinary size, and the rustic
                    masonry is the only feature of Roman architecture which it possesses. It is
                    mentioned by Buckingham, one of the latest European travellers who visited
                    Damascus, and to whom we are chiefly indebted for this account, that the castle
                    presents, in the interior, a confused heap, in which are mingled together strong
                    works of defence, ruined palaces retaining marks of ancient splendour, and rich
                    ornaments of the most florid arabesque, with remains of fountains, aqueducts,
                    and gardens attached, besides dark passages, gloomy dungeons, secret stairs, and
                    a labyrinth of other objects which could not be penetrated without a guide
                    acquainted with the localities. Some of the finest buildings in Damascus are the
                    khans or caravanserais appropriated to the reception of goods brought in
                    caravans from various quarters by wholesale merchants. Mr Buckingham mentions
                    one of these as superior to every other, its architecture being in the finest
                    style of the Saracen order. It consists of a spacious court, with a superb
                    gateway in the form of a pointed arch, vaulted and highly ornamented with
                    sculpture. The court was finely paved, and in the centre a large fountain sent
                    forth cooling and agreeable streams, the whole being crowned with a cluster of
                    lofty domes. The masonry is in the ancient Saracenic and Turkish taste, with
                    alternate layers of black and white stone, and the ornaments are profusely rich.
                    The coffee-houses in Damascus are exceedingly spacious; they have benches on
                    each side of the street, extending fifty yards in length, and rooms of the same
                    space, in which passengers smoke and drink coffee. There are many houses also at
                    which sherbet and other sweet drinks are prepared, cooled with the ice and snow
                    brought down to the city from a snowy mountain to the south-west of the town.
                    Skins of iced water, sweetened and perfumed, are retailed through the streets at
                    a para for each draught.</p>
                <p>Damascus is a magnificent city, whether we consider its spacious streets and
                    splendid public buildings, or the beauty of the environs, exhibiting
                    finely-cultivated fieldsinter-mingled with gardens. The suburb of Salheyah,
                    which lies at the foot of the mountains that bound the city on the west and
                    north-west, is a great resort on the last day of every week, whither all the
                    inhabitants of Damascus of every age and condition repair in their holiday dress
                    to enjoy the free air and pleasures of the country. Here are to be seen parties
                    by the way-side, some smoking, others engaged in loud and merry conversation,
                    and others <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755163" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5163-0607"
                    />amusing themselves and their children; the women enveloped in snow-white
                    muslin robes, with veils of a dark gauze, their usual dress; the men of the city
                    mounted on horses richly caparisoned, or on fine mules and asses; others
                    sauntering on foot, or reposing on the banks that skirt the road, either
                    smoking, playing at chess, or touching the Arnaout guitar to their songs. Mr
                    Buckingham celebrates the beauty of Damascus above that of all the cities of the
                    East. “The gardens,” he observes, “that surround the city on the north, the fine
                    olive grounds and long avenues of trees to the south, the numerous villages
                    pressing the skirts of the town on the east, and the great suburb of Salheyah,
                    with the thronged public way that leads to it on the west, added to the sombre
                    but rich and thickly planted cypresses, the slender poplars, the corn grounds,
                    and the rivers and streams which so abundantly water the whole, give to this
                    charming spot a character becoming fairy land, and render it a fit object for
                    the descriptive powers of an Arabian tale.”</p>
                <p>This city is the scat of an extensive trade both with India and with Europe. The
                    productions of India, consisting chiefly of spices, cotton manufactures, coarse
                    and fine muslins, and gold stuffs, are in great demand, and bring high prices.
                    They arc brought from India by the Persian Gulf, Bussora, Bagdad, and Aleppo,
                    and are consequently burdened with the heavy expenses of a circuitous land
                    carriage. If they could be supplied by way of the Red Sea and Egypt, they might
                    be sold at a cheaper rate, and the commerce would be more extended. The
                    insecurity of property in these eastern countries, and the heavy transit duties
                    levied on all goods in the ports of Egypt and the Red Sea, have hitherto
                    prevented commerce from following this route. But the growing ascendency of
                    Mehemmed Ali, who has imbibed European maxims of policy, and the success of his
                    arms in the East, will probably open to the eastern trade a freer ingress into
                    these countries. The manufactures of England, which have found their way into
                    the bazars of Damascus, are much sought after, and held in very high esteem,
                    particularly light woollen cloths of gay colours, printed cottons and chintzes,
                    and silk and cotton shawls made in imitation of those of Cashmere; also needles,
                    pins, knives, scissors, and fine hardware, as well as China and earthenware,
                    whether English or Indian. These goods being generally imported through a
                    roundabout route, namely, through Saida, Bairaut, and Tripoli, are sold at very
                    high prices. Iron, lead, tin, cochineal, sugar, and such other European articles
                    as are required in the city, are also imported through the same channel. Wearing
                    apparel for fashionable persons of both sexes at Damascus, and clothes that have
                    been worn, are brought from Constantinople; and being distributed all over the
                    country, are frequently the means of spreading the contagion of the plague.
                    Amongst the various manufactures to be found in the bazars are superb canarisons
                    for horses, of which the Turks, as well as all the other eastern nations, are
                    extremely fond. These are made in European Turkey; and a number of fine bridles,
                    martingales, and silver and embossed breastpieces, come also from Persia. The
                    fire-arms are chiefly of French and German manufacture, being prepared in an
                    ornamented style expressly for this market. The sabre blades are almost all of
                    the old Persian or Damascus manufacture, the art of making them being no longer
                    known or practised in this city; so that they grow daily more valuable, as no
                    modern sword can compare with them in temper and in quality. The silk seen in
                    the bazars of Damascus is principally of Chinese and Indian manufacture; the
                    furs come from Russia, Georgia, Circassia, and Armenia; the velvet from Italy;
                    copper from Asia Minor; the manufactures of Britain through Smyrna; and various
                    other articles of an inferior kind from Germany and France. There are few
                    manufactures in Damascus; and these consist chiefly in silk stuffs, plain,
                    coloured, and embroidered with gold; fabrics of plain cotton, and cotton and
                    silk mixed, all for home consumption, and mostly of broad striped or wavy
                    patterns for the caftans of the Turkish dress.</p>
                <p>Commerce, as in all other places in the East, is carried on by means of caravans,
                    of which the principal is that which goes with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
                    It is conducted by the pasha, who receives the standard of the prophet from the
                    governor of the castle, and gives a solemn pledge for its restoration. This
                    expedition unites commercial with religious objects. Three caravans, each
                    accompanied by about 2500 armed men, go thrice a year to Bagdad, the journey
                    occupying thirty days; those to Aleppo travel twice or thrice a month. Besides
                    these, many other caravans go to différent ports of Syria, Damascus being a
                    great rendezvous and emporium of trade. Provisions and fruit of all kinds are
                    abundant; also ice and snow, which may always be obtained from the neighbouring
                    mountains. The place is healthy, though sometimes attacked by the plague; and it
                    is also subject to a malignant tertian fever, which is frequently fatal. The
                    government of the city is committed to a pasha, who has a palace here. He rules
                    with despotic power, and frequently resorts to exactions in order to increase
                    his revenue. Damascus is a place of great antiquity. It is one of the very
                    earliest citics of which the Scriptures make mention, being coeval with Babel,
                    Nineveh, Sodom, Gomorrah, Ur of the Chaldees, &amp;c. which existed very soon
                    after the flood. It is also named as the birth-place of Eliezer, the steward of
                    Abraham’s house; and no mention is made of any subsequent destruction of this
                    city. It is likely therefore to contain monuments of high antiquity. Such
                    fragments of the wall as yet remain appear accordingly to be very ancient,
                    presenting at the lowest base a masonry apparently more ancient than either the
                    Roman or Saracen. The blocks of stone are frequently of a square form, which is
                    unusual except in the most ancient structures; and sometimes the height exceeds
                    the length, which is still more rarely seen. During the earlier periods of
                    history, Damascus was the capital of a kingdom, sometimes independent, sometimes
                    subject to the Jews. It was conquered by the Romans, and afterwards fell into
                    the hands of the Arabians. It underwent varions revolutions during the disorders
                    of the middle ages; and was finally conquered, along with all Syria, by the
                    Emperor Selim, and has since been subject to the Turkish power. The pasha at the
                    head of a numerous army having been defeated by the French cavalry in 1799, it
                    was the intention of Bonaparte to have marched to this city; but his course was
                    arrested by the unsuccessful siege of Acre. In 1811 it was menaced by the
                    Wahabees, who afterwards retired. In 1832 it was entered by Mehemmed All’s
                    troops from Egypt under Ibrahim Pasha, who had captured Acre after a long siege,
                    and whose subsequent successes in the war with Turkey have now (1833) secured to
                    his father, the pasha of Egypt, the possession of this fine city, by the treaty
                    recently concluded with Turkey. Buckingham, on the authority of the best
                    informed residents, estimates the population of Damascus at 100,000 Mahommedan
                    inhabitants, of whom 90,000 are native Syrian Arabs, and 10,000 arc Turks,
                    continually replaced by new families and settlers from Constantinople and the
                    towns of Asiatic Turkey; of these, 1000, with about 100 Albanians, form the
                    military force of the city. From them also are chosen the various public
                    functionaries. There arc, besides 15,000 Jews, 25,000 Christians, 3000 of the
                    schismatic Greek communion. Altogether the population may be stated at <pb

                    136 miles north of Jerusalem, 195 south of Antioch, and 276 south-south-west of
                    Diarbekir. Long. 36. 30. E. Lat. 38. 30. N.</p>
