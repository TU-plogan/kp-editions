                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DAEMONIAC</label> (from <hi rend="italic">daemon),</hi> a
                    human being whose volition and other mental faculties are overpowered and
                    restrained, and his body possessed and actuated by some created spiritual being
                    of superior power.</p>
                <p>Such seems to be the determinate sense of the word; but it is disputed whether
                    any of mankind ever were in this unfortunate condition. It is generally agreed,
                    that neither good nor evil spirits are known at present to exert such authority
                    over the human race; but in the ancient heathen world, and amongst the Jews,
                    particularly in the days of our Saviour, evil spirits are thought by many to
                    have been much more troublesome.</p>
                <p>The Greeks and Romans imagined that their deities, in order to reveal future
                    events, frequently entered into the prophet or prophetess who was consulted,
                    overpowered their faculties, and uttered responses by their organs of speech.
                    Apollo was believed to enter into the Pythoness, and to dictate the prophetic
                    answers received by those who consulted her. Other oracles besides that of
                    Delphi were supposed to unfold futurity by the same machinery. And in various
                    cases either malignant daemons or benevolent deities were thought to enter into
                    and to actuate human affairs. The <hi rend="italic">Lymphatici,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerriti,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Larυαtι</hi> of the
                    Romans, were all of this description; and the Greeks, by the use of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">ba</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">μονι(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">ομiνοι,</hi> show that they
                    referred to this cause the origin of madness. Among the ancient heathens,
                    therefore, it appears to have been a generally received opinion, that superior
                    beings entered occasionally into men, overpowered the faculties of their minds,
                    and actuated their bodily organs. They might imagine that this happened in
                    instances in which the effects were owing to the operation of different causes;
                    but an opinion so generally prevalent had surely some plausible foundation.</p>
                <p>The Jews, too, if we may trust the sacred writings and Josephus, appear to have
                    believed in daemoniacal possession<pb break="no" facs="nls:194754877"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4877-0585"/>. The case of Saul may be recollected as one among
                    many in which superior created beings were believed by the Jews to exert in this
                    manner their influence over human life. The general tenor of their history and
                    language, and their doctrines concerning good and evil spirits, prove that the
                    opinion of daemoniacal possession had been well known and generally received
                    among them.</p>
                <p>In the days of our Saviour, it would appear that daemoniacal possession was very
                    frequent amongst the Jews and the neighbouring nations. Many were the evil
                    spirits whom Jesus is related in the gospels to have ejected from patients who
                    were brought unto him as possessed and tormented by these malevolent daemons.
                    His apostle^ too, and the first Christians, who were most active and successful
                    in the propagation of Christianity, appear to have frequently exerted the
                    miraculous powers with which they were endowed on similar occasions. The daemons
                    displayed a degree of knowledge and malevolence which sufficiently distinguished
                    them from human beings; whilst the language in which the daemoniacs are
                    mentioned, and the actions and sentiments ascribed to them in the New Testament,
                    show that our Saviour and his apostles did not consider the idea of daemoniacal
                    possession as being merely a vulgar error concerning the origin of a disease or
                    of diseases produced by natural causes.</p>
                <p>The more enlightened cannot always avoid the use of metaphorical modes of
                    expression; which, though founded upon error, have yet been so established in
                    language by the influence of custom, that they cannot be suddenly dismissed.
                    When we read in the book of Joshua that the sun on a certain occasion stood
                    still, in order to allow that hero time to complete a victory, we easily find an
                    excuse for the conduct of the sacred historian, in accommodating his narrative
                    to the popular ideas of the Jews concerning the relative motions of the heavenly
                    bodies. In all similar instances we do not complain much of the use of a single
                    phrase, originally introduced by the prevalence of some groundless opinion, the
                    falsity of which is well known to the writer.</p>
                <p>But in descriptions of characters, in the narration of facts, and in laying down
                    systems of doctrine, we require very different rules to be observed. Should any
                    person, in compliance with popular opinions, talk in serious language of the
                    existence, dispositions, declarations, and actions of a race of beings whom he
                    knew to be absolutely fabulous, we surely could not praise him for candour or
                    integrity, but must suppose him to be either exulting in irony over the
                    credulity of those around him, or taking advantage of their weakness, with the
                    dishonest and the selfish views of an impostor. And if he himself should pretend
                    to any connection with this imaginary system of beings, and should claim, in
                    consequence of his connection with them, particular honours from his
                    contemporaries, whatever might be the dignity of his character in all other
                    respects, nobody could hesitate for a moment to brand him as an impostor of the
                    basest character.</p>
                <p>Precisely in this light must we regard the conduct of our Saviour and his
                    apostles, if the ideas of daemoniacal possession were to be considered merely as
                    a vulgar error. They talked and acted as if they believed that evil spirits had
                    actually entered into those who were brought to them as possessed with devils,
                    and as if those spirits were actually expelled by their authority out of the
                    unhappy persons whom they had possessed. They expected, they demanded too, to
                    have their profession and declarations believed, in consequence of their
                    performing such mighty works, and to be honoured as having thus triumphed over
                    the powers of hell. The reality of daemoniacal possession stands upon the same
                    evidence with the gospel system in general.</p>
                <p>Neither is there any thing absurd or unreasonable in. this doctrine. It does not
                    appear to contradict those ideas which the general appearance of nature and the
                    series of events suggest concerning the benevolence andwisdom of the Deity, and
                    the councils by which he regulates the affairs of the universe. We often fancy
                    ourselves able to comprehend things to which our understanding is wholly
                    inadequate; and we persuade ourselves, at times, that the whole extent of the
                    works of the Deity must be well known to us, and that his designs must always be
                    such as we can fathom. We are then ready, whenever any difficulty arises, in
                    considering the conduct of Providence, to model things according to our own
                    ideas; to deny that the Deity can possibly be the author of things which we
                    cannot reconcile; and to assert that he must act on every occasion in a manner
                    consistent with our narrow views. This is the pride of reason; and it seems to
                    have suggested the strongest objections that have been at any time urged against
                    the reality of daemoniacal possession. But the Deity may surely connect one
                    order of his creatures with another. We perceive mutual relations and a
                    beautiful connection prevalent throughout all that part of nature which falls
                    within the sphere of our observation. The inferior animals are connected with
                    mankind, and subjected to their authority, not only in instances in which it is
                    exerted for their advantage, but even where it is tyrannically abused to their
                    destruction. Amongst the evils to which mankind have been subjected, why might
                    not their being liable to daemoniacal possession be one? Whilst the Supreme
                    Being retains the sovereignty of the universe, he may employ whatever agents he
                    thinks proper in the execution of his purposes; he may either commission an
                    angel or let loose a devil, as well as bend the human will, or communicate any
                    particular impulse to matter.</p>
                <p>All that revelation makes known, all that human reason can conjecture, concerning
                    the existence of various orders of spiritual beings, good and bad, is perfectly
                    consistent with, and even favourable to, the doctrine of daemoniacal possession.
                    It was generally believed throughout the ancient heathen world; it was equally
                    well known to the Jews, and equally respected by them; it is mentioned in the
                    New Testament in such language, and such narratives are related concerning it,
                    that the gospels cannot well be regarded in any other light than as pieces of
                    imposture, and Jesus Christ must be considered as a man who dishonestly took
                    advantage of the weakness and ignorance of his contemporaries, if this doctrine
                    be nothing but a vulgar error. But it teaches nothing inconsistent with the
                    general conduct of Providence; it is not the caution of philosophy, but the
                    pride of reason, which suggests objections against this doctrine.</p>
                <p>Those, again, who are unwilling to allow that angels or devils have ever
                    intermeddled so much with the concerns of human life, urge a number of specious
                    arguments in opposition to such a supposition. The Greeks and Romans of old, say
                    they, did believe in the reality of daemoniacal possession. They supposed that
                    spiritual beings did at times enter into the sons or daughters of men, and
                    distinguish themselves in that situation by capricious freaks, deeds of wanton
                    mischief, or prophetic enunciations. But in the instances in which they supposed
                    this to happen, it is evident that no such thing took place. Their accounts of
                    the state and conduct of those persons whom they believed to be possessed in
                    this supernatural manner, show plainly that what they ascribed to the influence
                    of daemons were merely the effects of natural diseases. Whatever they relate
                    concerning the <hi rend="italic">larvafĩ,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerriti,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">lymphatici,</hi> shows that these were
                    merely people disordered in mind, or in the same unfortunate situation with
                    those madmen and idiots and melancholy persons whom we have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754890" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4890-0586"/>among ourselves. Festus
                    describes the <hi rend="italic">larvati</hi> as being <hi rend="italic">furiosi
                    et mente moti.</hi> Horace says,</p>
                <p>Hellade percussa, Marius cum praecipitat se, Cerritus fuit.</p>
                <p>And Lucian describes daemoniacs as lunatic, and as staring with their eyes,
                    foaming at the mouth, and speechless.</p>
                <p>It appears still more evidently, that all the persons spoken of as possessed with
                    devils in the New Testament, were either mad or epileptic, and precisely in the
                    same condition with the madmen and epileptics of modern times. The Jews, amongst
                    other reproaches which they threw out against our Saviour, said, “He hath a
                    devil, and is mad: why hear ye him ?” The expressions, <hi rend="italic">he hath
                    a devil, and is mad,</hi> were certainly used on this occasion as synonymous.
                    With all their virulence, they would not surely ascribe to him at once two
                    things which were inconsistent and contradictory. Those who thought more
                    favourably of the character of Jesus, asserted concerning his discourses, and in
                    reply to his adversaries, “that these are not the words of him that hath a
                    daemon,” meaning, no doubt, that he spoke in a more rational manner than a
                    madman could be expected to speak. The Jews appear to have ascribed to the
                    influence of daemons, not only that species of madness in which the patient <hi
                    rend="italic">is raving andfurious,</hi> but also <hi rend="italic"
                    >melancholy</hi> madness. Of John, who secluded himself from intercourse with
                    the world, and was distinguished for abstinence and acts of mortification, they
                    said, “He hath a daemon.” The youth whose father applied to Jesus to free him
                    from an evil spirit, describing his unhappy condition in these words, “Have
                    mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and sore vexed with a daemon; for oft times
                    he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water,” was plainly epileptic. Every
                    thing indeed that is related in the New Testament concerning daemoniacs, proves
                    that they were people affected with such natural diseases as are far from being
                    uncommon amongst mankind in the present age. When the symptoms of the disorders
                    cured by our Saviour and his apostles as cases of daemoniacal possession,
                    -correspond so exactly with those of diseases well known as natural in the
                    present age, it would be absurd to impute them to a supernatural cause. It is
                    much more consistent with common sense and sound philosophy to suppose, that our
                    Saviour and his apostles wisely, and with that condescension to the weakness and
                    prejudices of those with whom they conversed, which so eminently distinguished
                    the character of the author of our holy religion, and must always be a prominent
                    feature in the character of the true Christian, adopted the vulgar language in
                    speaking of those unfortunate persons who were groundlessly imagined to be
                    possessed with daemons, though they well knew the notions which had given rise
                    to such modes of expression to be ill founded; than to imagine that diseases,
                    which arise at present from natural causes, were produced in days of old by the
                    intervention of daemons, or that evil spirits still continue to enter into
                    mankind in all cases of madness, melancholy, or epilepsy.</p>
                <p>Besides, it is by no means a sufficient reason for receiving any doctrine as
                    true, that it has been generally received throughout the world. Error, like an
                    epidemical disease, is communicated from one to another. In certain
                    circumstances, too, the influence of imagination predominates, and restrains the
                    exertions of reason. Many false opinions have extended their influence
                    throughout a very wide circle, and maintained it long. On every such occasion as
                    the present, therefore, it becomes us to inquire, not so much how generally any
                    opinion has been received, or how long it has prevailed, as from what causes it
                    has originated, and on what evidence it rests.</p>
                <p>When we contemplate the frame of nature, we behold a grand and beautiful
                    simplicity prevailing throughout the whole. Notwithstanding its immense extent,
                    and although it contains such numberless diversities of being, yet the simplest
                    machine constructed by human art does not display greater simplicity, or a
                    happier connection of parts. We may therefore venture to draw an inference, by
                    ana-Iogy, f <hi rend="superscript"> rom</hi> what is observable of the order of
                    nature in general to the present case. To permit evil spirits to intermeddle
                    with the concerns of human life, would be to break through that order which the
                    Deity appears to have established throughout his works; it would be to introduce
                    a degree of confusion unworthy of the wisdom of Divine Providence.</p>
                <p>Such are the most rational arguments which have been urged on both sides in this
                    controversy. Perhaps the daemonists have the stronger probabilities on their
                    side; but we will not presume to take upon ourselves the office of arbitrators
                    in the dispute.</p>
