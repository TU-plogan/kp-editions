                    of Stair, who bears the greatest name in the annals of Scotish jurisprudence,
                    was the son of James Dalrymple of Stair, by his wife Janet, the daughter of
                    Fergus Kennedy of Knockdaw, and was born in the month of May 1619, at Dunmorchie
                    in the parish of Barr and county of Ayr. The family from which he descended was
                    at an early period distinguished by its love of religious liberty: Dalrymple of
                    Stair is mentioned among the Lollards of Kyle. Before he had attained the fifth
                    year of his age, he lost his father,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sir John Dalrymple has stated that “he lost his estate in
                    his youth, for killing the murderer of his father; and was obliged, upon that
                    account, to fly from his country. When the civil war broke out, he returned to
                    Scotland, and commanded a troop of dragoons in the parliament’s service.”
                    (Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. i. p. 21G∙) Part of this account,
                    and some particulars which he subjoins, are evidently inaccurate. It is
                    expressly stated by Forbes that Dalrymple commanded, not a troop of dragoons,
                    but a company of foot. This story of murder and vengeance we have not found
                    confirmed by any other authority.</p></note> and the care of his education
                    devolved upon his mother, who is described as a woman of an excellent spirit,
                    and who survived her husband for nearly forty years. The first elements of
                    learning he acquired at Mauchline school, and at the age of fourteen was sent to
                    the university of Glasgow, where he took the degree of A. M. in 1637. He
                    repaired to Edinburgh in the course of the ensuing year, and obtained a
                    commission in the earl of Glencairn’s regiment, but he did not long adhere to
                    the military profession. In 1641 he was encouraged to offer himself as a
                    candidate for a vacant professorship of philosophy at Glasgow. In those
                    old-fashioned times, the comparative merit of candidates was a circumstance not
                    entirely disregarded: their comparative merit was ascertained by a fair and open
                    competition; on this occasion, Captain Dalrymple presented himself in buff and
                    scarlet, and was with great applause declared to be the successful competitor,
                    ∏e retained his commission for some time after he became professor of
                    philosophy. He was admitted on the 12th of March, and became bound by an oath to
                    resign his professorship in case of marriage. As a preparation for such a step,
                    he accordingly resigned it on the 4th of September 1643, and was immediately
                    re-elected. On the 21 st of the same month, he married Margaret, the eldest
                    daughter of James Ross of Balneil in the county of Wigton, with whom he acquired
                    a large estate. They are said to have lived together in great happiness; but,
                    according to the statement of one of his descendants, Lord Hailes, his happiness
                    must have been in his own mind, for “he could not have much happiness from the
                    complacency of his wife.”</p>

                    discharge of his particular functions, and to the enlargement of his stock of
                    general learning. His lectures were attended by many young men of rank and
                    fortune,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    Advocates Library there is an octavo MS. -which bears the following title:

                    Domini 1643.” It contains notes of the professor’s lectures on logic, taken by a
                    student named Robert Law.</p></note> and he thus had an opportunity of forming
                    connexions which he afterwards found to be of considerable advantage. Not
                    satisfied with his present acquisitions, he devoted much attention to the study
                    of the Greek and Latin languages, with the history and antiquities of Greece and
                    Rome; and to all his other pursuits he added the study of the civil law, in
                    which he must have been his own preceptor. His colleagues had easily discovered
                    his talents for business, and he frequently had occasion to visit the seat of
                    government in the prosecution of some of the university suits: he was thus
                    rendered familiar with the forms of judicial procedure, and became acquainted
                    with the most eminent men on the bench and at the bar. Having adopted the
                    resolution of betaking himself to the profession of the law, he resigned his
                    chair in the year 1647, and was admitted an advocate on the 17th of February
                    1648, being then in the twenty-ninth year of his age. He soon rose to
                    professional eminence. After the execution of the king, the committee of estates
                    dispatched certain commissioners to his son at Breda, for the purpose of
                    inviting him to Scotland: Dalrymple was appointed to act as their secretary, and
                    he appears to have acquitted himself to the satisfaction of both parties in this
                    weighty negociation. In Holland he visited several learned men, and particularly
                    Salmasius, who held an honorary professorship in the university of Leyden. He
                    returned home in the course of the ensuing year, 1650; but during his absence,
                    he had been nominated by the estates one of the commissioners for revising the
                    old books of law, the acts of parliament, and the practice of the different
                    judicatures. On the 29th of May he was sent to the north, along with Arthur
                    Erskine of Scots-craig, with instructions to attend the king’s landing.<note

                    appears to have engaged very zealously in the royal cause; but it is well known
                    that the efforts of the Scotish royalists to place Charles on the English throne
                    were unavailing to him, and pernicious to themselves.</p>
                <p>Dalrymple continued his practice at the bar till the imposition of what was
                    called the Tender, when several other eminent lawyers likewise retired. He
                    however resumed his place when Cromwell’s government either dispensed with the
                    oath, or connived at its omission. In the year 1656, he was included in a
                    deputation of four advocates who were sent to remonstrate with the commissioners
                    for the administration of justice, on the expediency of restoring the ancient
                    practice of the outer-house, which these republican judges had suppressed. This
                    remonstrance was attended with the desired effect. On the 26th of June 1657, Sir
                    James Learmonth of Balcomy, one of the judges, expired on the bench; and on the
                    very same day, a commission, appointing Dalrymple in his place, was signed by
                    General Monk in the name of the protector’s council in Scotland. In a letter
                    written three days before, the general had recommended him to Cromwell as “a
                    person fit to be a judge, being a very honest man, a good lawier, and one of a
                    considerable estate ;” and now, describing him as a person of eminent abilities,
                    he craved his highness’s approbation of the choice which the coun cil had been
                    induced to make.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Thurloe’s State-Papers, vol. vi. p. 3G7∙ 372.</p></note> The annual salary
                    of the J judges was then three hundred pounds sterling. This was a preferment
                    which he had not solicited, and of which he did not accept without considerable
                    reluctance. Whatever might be his views or feelings as to Cromwell’s government,
                    it is probable that his practice at the bar may have been more lucrative. He was
                    admitted on the 1st of July, and his appointment was confirmed by the protector
                    on the 25th of the same month. In this situation, his interest was beneficially
                    exerted in procuring for the gentlemen connected with the counties where his
                    estates were situated, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> redress of grievances from the
                    council or the English officers; and by thus enlarging the sphere of his
                    utility, he encreased his connexions, and strengthened his personal influence.
                    He obtained so considerable a share of Monk’s confidence, that the day before he
                    began that march which decided the fate of three kingdoms, he held a private
                    conference with Dalrymple, and requested him to deliver his unreserved opinion
                    as to the best method of restoring tranquillity and regular government. The
                    learned judge readily answered that “the wisest and fairest way was to procure a
                    meeting of a full and free parliament.” This sound advice was ultimately
                    adopted, at least to a certain extent; and of Monk, “who was determined to make
                    his own fortune, without regard to any party,”<note anchored="true"

                    with sufficient dexterity.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, Dalrymple accompanied the earl of Cassillis to
                    London, in order to pay his respects to the king. On this occasion he received
                    the honour of knighthood; and his name was inserted in the first commission to
                    the judges of the court of session, dated on the 13th of February 1661. During
                    the absence of the lord president, it was customary to appoint a vicepresident;
                    and, except in one instance, when he was himself absent at the same time, the
                    choice uniformly fell upon Sir James Dalrymple. After an interval of two years,
                    he was exposed to some degree of uneasiness by the operation of the statutes
                    which required the oath of allegiance to be accompanied with a declaration
                    against the national covenant adopted in 1638, and the solemn league and
                    covenant adopted in 1643, as being contrary to the fundamental laws and
                    liberties of the kingdom. Dalrymple was in the country attending the funeral of
                    his mother when this ill-timed declaration was tendered to his colleagues, and
                    when all who were in town subscribed it, with the solitary exception of Sir
                    James Dundas of Arniston. The earl of Glencairn, lord chancellor, communicated
                    to him the king’s order to the privy council to declare vacant the places of
                    such judges as refused to subscribe; and in his answer, dated at Ayr on the loth
                    of January 1664, he stated that he had already resigned his commission into the
                    king’s hands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of this
                    letter to the earl of Glencairn, the original is in the possession of Thomas
                    Thomson, Esq. to whose kindness we are likewise indebted for the use of various
                    other documents connected with the personal history of Lord Stair.</p></note>
                    After the lapse of a few months, he was invited to court, and was favoured with
                    an audience of his majesty, who graciously received his explanations, and was
                    pleased to inform him that he would not accept his resignation. The
                    conscientious judge stated that he was willing to “declare against no more than
                    what was opposite to his majesty’s just right and prerogative.” A letter from
                    the king, dated on 2lst of April, restored him to his seat on the bench, and his
                    declaration was afterwards received with this qualification<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755033" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5033-0597"/>. During the interval, he had
                    made an excursion to France: he left London on the 22d, and reached Paris on the
                    29th of April.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                    dates we copy from a letter which he addressed to the earl of Argyle, from
                    Paris, on the 30th of April 1GG4. The original also belongs to Mr Thomson.
                    Forbes has stated that he made an excursion to France with his eldest son, who
                    was then beginning his continental travels; and having returned by way of
                    London, that he had then the honour of waiting upon his majesty. But the king’s
                    letter, restoring him to his office, was dated on the 21st of April, and he left
                    London for Paris on the following day.</p></note> On the 2d of June ensuing, he
                    was created a baronet. While at the bar, he had refused all employment in
                    criminal cases, and under the protectorate he had declined to act in the
                    criminal court. After the Restoration, he was offered the place of king’s
                    advocate, or that of a judge in the court of justiciary: but, says Forbes, “he
                    excus’d himself, alledging for his reason the danger of acquitting the guilty,
                    or wounding the innocent in such offices; and no doubt the gentleness of his
                    nature, as well as the hazard he foresaw in deciding concerning state-crimes,
                    had influence on that resolution.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the court from the period of the Restoration to the year 1669, are in a great
                    measure imputed to his influence. He was one of the commissioners appointed
                    under the great seal for regulating judicatures; and the regulations which they
                    recommended were embodied and confirmed by acts of parliament passed in 1669 and
                    1672. He opposed the distinction which was then projected between lawyers who
                    practised in the inner and those who practised in the outer-house; and he
                    equally opposed the scheme of tendering to the advocates an oath that they would
                    not accept higher fees than were fixed by the authority of the court. For his
                    conduct in resisting these unpalatable measures he received the thanks of the
                    faculty: but in the midst of the arbitrary proceedings which were so prevalent
                    at that period, it was difficult to escape the general odium; and in 1674,
                    during the great schism which took place between the bench and the bar, on the
                    subject of appeals from the court of session to the parliament, he felt the
                    force of that envy which his merit and his good fortune had frequently provoked.
                    In his Apology he has expressly declared that he had no personal concern in the
                    violent measure of banishing the advocates from Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The project of a union between the two kingdoms had been revived in the year
                    1670, and Sir James Dalrymple was then appointed one of the Scotish
                    commissioners. By his wit and address upon this occasion, he strongly
                    recommended himself to the good graces of Lauderdale.<note anchored="true"

                    a member of the privy council, which at that period was invested with very
                    undefined and arbitrary powers. The office of president of the court of session
                    having become vacant by the resignation of Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar, he
                    was appointed to succeed him on the 13th of January 1671; and his place as an
                    ordinary judge was supplied by his kinsman Sir Thomas λVallace of Craigie. On
                    the 15th of December 1676, the common council of Edinburgh, having taken into
                    consideration the many great and signal services done to the city by the lord

                    corporation, and that the same benefit should be extended to his successors in
                    office. This municipal act continued in force till the year 1741, when the lord
                    president Forbes declined to avail himself of the privilege which it
                    conferred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brunton &amp;

                <p>Dalrymple’s connexion with so corrupt an administration necessarily exposed him
                    to suspicion and obloquy. Having afterwards been charged with subserviency to
                    the duke of Lauderdale, a name devoted to infamy, he replied that the accusation
                    was “general and calumnious, without an instance given and he then proceeded to
                    state that his influence had always been applied to the most beneficial
                    purposes. The duke, he remarks, “came to Scotland in the year 1677; and upon
                    representations made by me and others, he concurr’d in making several acts of
                    council, correctory of the abuses that then run; as particularly, that persons
                    were cited for church-disorders, without special circumstances of time or place,
                    but generally in one or other of the days of all the months for several years;
                    and were put to their oaths upon the whole libel, whereby many had been holden
                    as confest, and thereupon fined, imprisoned, and transported like slaves to
                    forraign plantations: whereupon the then arch-bishop of St Andrews did represent
                    to the bishops in England, and to the court, that he was overturning the
                    settlement of this nation; and he likewise said that in one moneth after he came
                    hither, he had put the king’s interest further back than could be retrived in
                    seven years. To make up which, he was instigated to bring in the Highland host
                    upon the west of Scotland, who treated them as enemies, not only by free
                    quarter, but by all insolcncies and oppressions; and to obtain an order of
                    council to enjoin a bond to be taken by all in publick trust, and others in that
                    countrey, to delate, apprehend, and bring to judgment all the presbyterian
                    ministers that came ever in their power, that had keeped any conventicles:
                    against both which I did with all freedom and faithfulness disswade him and
                    dissent; and I do not remember of any one person in council or session that
                    could never be induced to subscribe that bond, or to approve that road, but my
                    self. And when in the year 1679 several complaints were made to K. Charles
                    against Lauderdale and his brother, which were published in print,<note

                    apostolical church Dr Sharp, is sufficiently characteristic. Any departure from
                    the most violent and oppressive measures, was to be , construed as hostile to
                    church and state. In a private letter addressed to Lord Melville on the 1st of
                    January 1690, he thus expresses himself, in homely language, but with no
                    undignified sentiment: “I ador God’s providence in permitting εo much dust
                    against me, thogh the matter, separat from the railing, imports nothing hot my
                    embracing first and last the statione God hath called me to, and the malitious

                    confident your Lordship will bear witnes for me to his Majestie.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1679, the duke of York came to reside at FIolyroodhouse, and the
                    judges and other members of the College of Justice made him a visit of ceremony.
                    The lord president addressed him in a congratulatory speech, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755046" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5046-0598"/>which contained the following
                    uncourtly sentiment: “ ’Tis matter of great joy to this nation to see one of the
                    royal family among them, after being for so many years deprived of that honour;
                    and the nation being entirely protestant, it is the fittest place your Royal
                    Highness could have made your recess to at this time.” He took other
                    opportunities of endeavouring to impress the duke with a conviction, that it was
                    not for his own advantage to attempt any measure which might have the least
                    tendency to injure the protestant establishment. In the parliament of 1681, in
                    which the duke acted as his majesty’s commissioner, Sir Janies Dalrymple sat as
                    a member for the county of Wigton, and was nominated one of the lords of the
                    articles. When the test was under the consideration of the house, he proposed
                    and carried a clause, that all persons holding public offices should swcar that
                    they sincerely professed the protestant religion as contained in the Confession
                    of Faith approved by parliament in 1567. According to the statement of one
                    historian, he drew up such an oath as was neither consistent with itself, nor
                    with his own principles, nor such as could be taken without the guilt of
                    perjury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cunningham’s
                    Hist, of Great Britain, vol. i. p. 50.</p></note> He was dissatisfied with a
                    test which described the presbyterians as fanatics; and as he could not prevent
                    its being adopted, he seems to have devised the expedient of introducing one
                    clause in order to nullify another. As soon as the act was passed, the duke of
                    York declared that the president had ruined all honest men, that is, all
                    papists, by introducing that Confession. For subscribing this test with a
                    particular explanation, the earl of Argyle was subjected to a prosecution, which
                    formed one of the most flagrant acts of that disgraceful era of our national
                    history. Dalrymple himself declined to subscribe it; and in the month of October
                    he proceeded to London, for the purpose of explaining his conduct to the king,
                    and perhaps of recommending his eldest son as his successor;<note

                    Sufferings of the Church of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 197∙</p></note> but before his
                    arrival, a new commission, appointing Sir George Gordon president, and
                    superseding Sir Thomas Murray of Glendoick, and Sir John Baird of Newby th, had
                    been issued under the great seal. As he had quitted Scotland without obtaining
                    leave from the commissioner, the king refused him an audience, and Murray, the
                    secretary of state, commanded him to leave England. “That quarrel,” he remarks
                    in his Apology, “with my freedom to the then duke, at his first coming to
                    Scotland, against attempting to weaken the protestantinterest, in a publick
                    speech I had at his entry, made me to be the first person laid aside that ever
                    was looked after. I was cited before the criminal judges, before the council,
                    before the parliament, and hundreds of examinations and re-examinations were
                    taken against me, even of my most intimate domestick servants, and my sisters in
                    law, not in the regular way of probation, but by way of inquisition to found a
                    process upon any special matter, which was never done, because nothing was found
                    against law. Can any judge in Christendom show such a trial of integrity, who
                    did so long a time serve in such an eminent station? No man was found to witness
                    the least malversation or baseness, by indirect interest in any cause, by taking
                    any bribe or reward, by partiality or insolency, though nothing would have been
                    more acceptable to the court, than by one blow against my fortune and fame, to
                    have ruined me upon malversation in my trust as a judge.” The only offence that
                    could be traced amounted to a suspicion that some presbyterians, who had been at
                    the battle of Bothwell-Bridge, lived upon his estates, or lurked about his house
                    in the country, when he was occupied with his public duties in town. This was
                    considered as an adequate ground for proceeding against him for “harbour and
                    reset of rebels;” a charge sufficiently indefinite to leave ample room for the
                    operation of laws arbitrary in themselves, and administered with little regard
                    to substantial justice. Dalrymple had previously found it expedient to quit the
                    kingdom. His tenants were harassed in the various modes devised by the
                    instruments of oppression, his rents were arrested, and on applying to the
                    king’s advocate, Sir George Mackenzie, he found that he himself incurred the
                    danger of being committed to prison: he therefore sought a place of refuge in
                    Holland, where he arrived towards the close of the year 1682. He chiefly resided
                    at Leyden, the seat of a very famous university.</p>
                <p>While he was exposed to these persecutions, he prepared for the press those works
                    which have chiefly recommended him to the notice of posterity. His first and
                    greatest work was printed before he went into exile. “The Institutions of the
                    Law of Scotland, deduced from its originals, and collated with the Civil, Canon,
                    and Feudal Laws, and with the customs of neighbouring nations.”<note

                    in a “second edition, much enlarged.” Edinb. 1693, fol. A much longer period
                    elapsed before the appearance of “the third edition, corrected and enlarged,
                    with notes.” Edinb. 1759, fol. This edition was begun by John Gordon, who only
                    conducted it to the eighty-fifth page, and the undertaking was completed by
                    William Johnstone, afterwards more conspicuously known by the name of Sir
                    William Pulteney. But the labours of these editors appear very insignificant,
                    when compared with those which are exhibited in “the fourth edition, with
                    commentaries and a supplement, by George Brodie, Esq. Advocate.” Edinb. 1826-31,
                    2 vols. fol. It is a proof of the estimation in which the author continues to be
                    held, that another elaborate edition has since been given to the public, “with
                    notes and illustrations by John S. More, Esq. Advocate.” Edinb. 1832, 2 vols.

                    copies in the Advocates Library, and many others are to be found in private
                    collections. It must apparently have been considered as a useful exercise for
                    apprentices in the law to make a complete transcript of a book which was
                    sufficiently accessible in print. During his exile, he published a work which,
                    although requiring less genius and learning in its author, was at that time of
                    great practical utility. “The Decisions of the Lords of Council and Session, in

                    re-establishment of the court to the month of August 1681.</p>

                    connected with arbitrary government, and he was therefore sufficiently prepared
                    to engage in an attempt to rid the kingdom of an incorrigible tyrant. When the
                    prince of Orange was on the eve of embarking for his memorable expedition,
                    Dalrymple enquired into the real object of his enterprise; and when the prince
                    declared that he designed the glory of God, and the security of the protestant
                    religion, the venerable exile pulled off his wig, and pointing to his head,
                    exclaimed, "Though I be now in the seventieth year of my age, I am willing to
                    venture <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> my own, and my children’s fortunes in such
                    an undertaking.” It is stated by Forbes, that “the kindness and tender affection
                    express’d by his Royal Highness upon that occasion to my Lord Stair, exposed him
                    to the envy of several persons; which afterwards broke out in pamphlets stuff’d
                    with personal reflections, and other injurious writings against restoring him to
                    his rightful office of president of the session, and aspersing his
                    administration thereof. This good old man, with all imaginable cheerfulness,
                    came over in that glorious expedition, to preserve our constitution, when
                    religion, liberty, and property, the dearest concerns of mankind, seem’d to be
                    at stake. The prince, upon his landing at Torbay, sent to inquire concerning my
                    Lord Stair’s health; and perceiving that his horses were not come up, ordered a
                    Neapolitan horse belonging to himself to be sent to the Lord Stair for his
                    accommodation.” When he arrived in Scotland, his influence was very usefully
                    exerted in providing that the election in boroughs should be conducted by a
                    general poll of freemen, and thus securing a majority of Whigs and presbyterians
                    in the convention of estates.</p>
                <p>Sir George Lockhart, president of the court of session, fell by the hand of an
                    assassin on the 31 st of March 1689, and on the 28th of October Sir James
                    Dalrymple was reinstated in his former office. This appointment, so equitable
                    and judicious in itself, excited a considerable degree of popular clamour, on
                    the alleged ground, that when the court was entirely dissolved by this change in
                    the government of the kingdom, it was not competent for the crown to restore it
                    without the authority of parliament. The lord president was very fiercely
                    attacked in an anonymous pamphlet ascribed to Robert Ferguson, a restless and
                    unscrupulous individual, who was known by the descriptive appellation of the
                    Plotter, and who was “remarkable for serving his party, and saving himself in
                    all plots.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dalrymple’s

                    character and conduct in a manner at once able and satisfactory. In the course
                    of the same year, on the 21st of April, he was elevated to the peerage, by the
                    title of Viscount of Stair, Lord Glenluce and Stranraer, with limitations to the
                    heirs male of his body. He had now acquired great influence in the management of
                    affairs in Scotland; and this influence derived no inconsiderable support from
                    his son, who was conspicuous for the elegance of his person, and the power of
                    his eloquence. The last publication of the distinguished author was worthy of
                    his declining years, and of his former reputation. It bears the title of “A

                    Reason and Revelation: methodically digested into several Meditations. By a

                    two eminent individuals among the English non-conformists, contains a very high
                    commendation of the author and his performance. “The clearness and vigor of his

                    and amiable excellencies as are perfective of our minds, and attractive of our
                    wills; so in our author’s unfolding them, there is joined with the strength of
                    argument, that beauty of perswasion as may enlighten and engage all

                    English friends for purifying his style from provincial idioms, which are
                    sufficiently numerous in his other works. But his long and eventful life had
                    nearly reached its close: he died on the 25th of November 1695, after having
                    attained the seventy-seventh year of his age, and his remains were interred in

                    acted a very conspicuous part in the wars and diplomacies of his own age. Sir
                    James Dalrymple, Bart, the second son of the lord president, was one of the
                    principal clerks of session; and, as an antiquary, he is favourably known by his
                    “Collections concerning the Scottish History.” Edinb. 1705, 8vo. Sir Hugh
                    Dalrymple, Bart, the third son, succeeded his father as president of the court
                    of session. The fourth son was Thomas Dalrymple, Μ. D. physician in ordinary to
                    the king in Scotland. The youngest son, Sir David Dalrymple, Bart, was, like
                    many other members of the same family, bred to the legal profession, and was
                    successively solicitor general, lord advocate, and auditor of the Scotish
                    exchequer. He was the grandfather of the late Lord Hailes. The president had
                    four daughters, all of whom were married, two of them into the noble families of
                    Catheart and Dumfries.</p>
                <p>Lord Stair, like every other individual who has rendered himself highly
                    conspicuous in times of great public excitement, is mentioned by different
                    writers with a very different measure of praise or censure. According to Bishop
                    Burnet, he was “a man of great temper and of a very mild deportment, but a false
                    and cunning man, and a great perverter of justice; in which he had a particular
                    dexterity of giving some plausible colours to'the greatest injustice.” This
                    general and heavy charge of perverting justice we have not found supported by
                    any particular instances. The fountains of justice were at that unhappy period
                    very extensively polluted, but we are disposed to class him among the most
                    unexceptionable judges who had then sat upon the Scotish bench. We must not
                    however conceal the fact, that, when he resumed his seat after the Revolution,
                    his conduct as a judge was a frequent and angry topic of discussion;<note

                    Letters, p. 154. 167. 257. Edinb. 1774, 4to.</p></note> nor can we venture to
                    determine how far this circumstance is to be imputed to the force of political
                    animosity. It was his misfortune to live in most flagitious times, and by his
                    public station to be necessarily connected with a government which evinced a
                    total disregard of the first principles of justice and humanity. The arbitrary
                    proceedings of Lauderdale he seems to have resisted, with consummate prudence
                    indeed, but still with decent firmness; and of the integrity of his character he
                    exhibited repeated proofs, by preferring the loss of office and emolument to a
                    compliance with the iniquity of the times. At a period when the nobility and
                    gentry of Scotland furnished so many and such flagrant examples of cool and
                    deliberate villany, Lord Stair acted with a very unusual degree of moderation
                    and consistency; nor would it perhaps be easy to mention any person of rank in
                    the profligate reign of Charles II. whose character could so well endure a
                    severe scrutiny. He was a man of the most gentle deportment,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir George Mackenzie has
                    given him the following character: “Stair was a gentleman of excellent parts, of
                    an equal wit, and universal learning; but most considerable for being so free
                    from passions, that most men thought this equality of spirit a mere hypocrisy in
                    him. This meekness fitted him extremely to be a president; for he thereby
                    receiv’d calmly all men’s informations, and by it he was capable to hear,
                    without disorder or confusion, what the advocates represented. But that which I
                    admir’d most in him was, that in ten years intimacy, I never heard him speak
                    unfriendly of those who had injur’d him.” (Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland,
                    p. 214.)</p></note> joined with a prudence which seemed to be constitutional;
                    and as extreme prudence not unfrequently lingers on the verge of meanness or
                    artifice, it may in some cases be difficult to trace the line where virtue ends
                    and vice begins. The force of his talents and the respectability of his
                    character rendered him an acquisition to any party in the state. He was
                    importuned to accept of a seat on the bench under the government to which, as an
                    advocate, he had declined to take the oath of allegiance; and when he was
                    admitted, it only appears that he took an oath to discharge his office with
                    fidelity. A similar line of conduct was pursued in another kingdom by Sir
                    Matthew Hale, whose name can never be mentioned but with high respect. When
                    Stair became a member of the privy council, he was indeed associated with men
                    whose breath was contamination; but even in this difficult situation he seems to
                    have maintained his integrity, and to have resisted to the utmost of his power
                    the pernicious and profligate measures which then disgraced the nation. An
                    individual of a more bold and decided character might have signalized his
                    opposition by more prominent acts; but, in the midst of such associates, it must
                    have proved less beneficial to the community, and more ruinous to himself.<note

                    during the year 1691; and the mode in which he endeavoured to remove the
                    opposition of some of the members is here detailed by the ear! of Crawfurd, one

                    profession, which he minded more than the raising of a great fortune. He was
                    sober, temperate, and mighty regular. He duly prayed always and read a chapter
                    of the Bible to his family before they sat down to dinner, and performed the
                    like divine service after supper; which he would not interrupt upon any
                    consideration of business, how important soever. He had a great spirit, and
                    equal temper in the harshest passages of his life: by the constant bent of his
                    thoughts to what was serious or profitable, he knew how to divert them from any
                    uneasy impression of sorrow. He was apt to forget, at least not to resent
                    injuries done to him, when it was in his power to requite them.” (Journal of the

                    philosophy, and even in theology. He was the first writer who reduced the law of

                    eminent philosopher; but as he was not educated to the profession of law, his
                    Institutes chiefly consist of decisions of the court of session; which with him

                    branch, he exerted no mean talents or learning. Lord Stair adopted a more
                    general design, and, with great sagacity extracting order out of confusion,
                    combined his loose and heterogeneous materials into a compact and lucid form;

                    of Hailes, in the county of Haddington, Bart., auditor-general of the exchequer
                    in Scotland, and his mother Lady Christian Hamilton, a daughter of Thomas, sixth
                    earl of Haddington. His grandfather Sir David Dalrymple, lord advocate from 1709
                    to 1720, was the youngest son of James, first Viscount Stair, president of the
                    Court of Session, and author of the Institutions of the Law of Scotland; and he
                    is said to have been the ablest of a family of whom several, in their different
                    capacities, civil, military, and judicial, were so eminently distinguished for
                    ability. Sir David Dalrymple received his classical education at Eton, where he
                    was remarkable for his proficiency in classical learning and for exemplary
                    conduct, and where he acquired a marked predilection for English manners and
                    customs, which adhered to him through life. From thence he went to Holland, and
                    studied civil law at the university of Utrecht, being intended for the Scottish
                    bar. On his return to his native country, after∙ passing the ordinary trials, he
                    was admitted advocate on the 24th of February 1748. Although possessing an ample
                    fortune (his father having died on the 24th of February 1751), and attached to
                    the pursuits of elegant literature, he was not seduced from close application to
                    the study of a dry profession. As a barrister, however, his success was not
                    equal to the expectations which had been formed of him; and as he did not attain
                    any high distinction or very extensive practice in his profession, he was still
                    enabled to pursue his favourite literary and antiquarian researches. This want
                    of success at the bar was, it is said, chiefly owing to the circumstance of his
                    being unfitted to shine as a public speaker, by an ill-toned voice, an
                    ungraceful elocution, and a dryness of manner too much in contrast with the
                    eloquence and fluency of some of his more popular brethren. The character,
                    however, which he had secured for sound knowledge, acuteness, unwearied
                    application, and strict probity in his profession, made up for the want of more
                    imposing attractions, and eminently fitted him for filling a judicial situation.
                    He was elevated to the bench, and took his seat as one or the senators of the
                    college of justice on the 6th of March 1766; and ten years later, on the 3d of
                    May 1776, he was also appointed a lord of justiciary, having on the former
                    occasion, according to the usage of the court, assumed the title of Lord Hailes,
                    the name by which he is generally known among the learned of Europe.</p>
                <p>As a judge of the supreme civil and criminal courts, it is here sufficient to
                    observe, that he merited and obtained high confidence and approbation; and he is
                    particularly remembered for the solemnity of his demeanour when it fell to him
                    to pass sentence upon criminals. We shall therefore proceed to consider his
                    literary character and pursuits, in which, although not ambitious of mere
                    literary fame, he had early in life attained considerable eminence. This led to
                    an extensive and friendly intercourse with many persons of learning and genius
                    in England, and in the number of his correspondents were such men as Bishop
                    Warburton, Lord Hardwicke, Dr Percy, afterwards bishop of Dromore, T. Warton, Dr
                    Birch, Dr Kippis, Bishop Hurd, and Horace Walpole.<note anchored="true"

                    by Mr Malcolm Laing, the historian, July 9,1800, we learn that the greater part
                    of Lord Hailes’ correspondence was unfortunately destroyed. “I am desired (he
                    says) to ask you by Air Thomson, an advocate, whether you have any letters of
                    the late Lord Hailes, that could contribute to furnish an account of his life
                    and writings. From some stupidity of his administrators, Lord Hailes’ letters,
                    &amp;c. were destroyed, I believe, at his death; and, unless in the hands of his
                    correspondents, there are no materials for his life, which Air Thomson has some
                    thoughts of undertaking, together with a new edition of his works. He left the
                    first volume of his Annals corrected and enlarged for a new edition; and if you
                    can contribute any thing to an account of his life, it will be received as a
                    great obligation.” (Pinkerton’s <hi rend="italic">Correspondence,</hi> vol. ii.

                    doctor of laws was conferred on Sir David Dalrymple by the university of
                    Edinburgh on the 5th of December 1760.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Woodhouselee), was not of a dry and scholastic nature. He felt the beauties of
                    the composition of the ancients; he entered with taste and discernment into the
                    merits of the Latin poets, and that peculiar vein of delicate and ingenious
                    thought which characterises the Greek epigrammatists; and a few specimens which
                    he has left us of his own composition in that style, evince the head of a
                    master.”</p></note> From this list it will be evident that the objects of his
                    investigation may almost exclusively be referred to two distinct classes; the
                    one connected with the history and literary antiquities of his own country, and
                    the other with the earlier state of the Christian church; and a few remarks may
                    be made in reference to the most important of his works in each of these
                    classes.</p>
                <p>His inquiries regarding Scottish history and antiquities were at first more
                    particularly directed to objects connected with the ancient ecclesiastical and
                    statute laws of the country. In regard to the latter of these subjects, he never
                    carried his intentions into full effect, having left only partial “Specimens,”
                    to evince what were his intentions. His “Canons of the Church of Scotland,” and
                    “Historical Memoirs concerning the Provincial Councils of the Scottish Clergy,”
                    are tracts of great importance. But so little attention did they excite at the
                    time, that of the first he thought proper to state, “for the benefit of those
                    who may be inclined to publish any tracts concerning the Antiquities of

                    Hailes, as one of the guardians of Lady Elizabeth, the infant daughter of the

                    break="no" facs="nls:194755098" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5098-0602"/>, in 1770, for the
                    House of Lords, the very elaborate memorial entitled « The Additional Case of
                    Elizabeth, claiming the title and dignity of Countess of Sutherland.” In this
                    volume, to which is affixed the names of two of her ladyship’s counsel
                    (Alexander Wedderburn, afterwards the Lord Chancellor, Earl of Rosslyn, and Sir
                    Adam Fergusson), Lord Hailes has displayed the greatest accuracy of research in
                    regard to the family history of the Scottish nobility, and the rules of descent
                    in this country; while lie managed the question at issue with such dexterity of
                    argument, as not only clearly to establish the right of his pupil, but also to
                    form a precedent at the same time for the decision of all such questions of
                    succession in future. About the same time Lord Hailes published, anonymously,
                    selections from George Bannatyne’s manuscript collection of early Scottish
                    poetry; a volume which displays great judgment and good taste on the part of the
                    editor, and which is accompanied with illustrative notes not less valuable than
                    interesting. He is somewhat severe upon Allan Ramsay, who, in 1724, had
                    published several of the same poems, for liberties taken with the text. Ramsay’s
                    mode of publication was not such as accords with our ideas of editing early
                    remains, as he felt no scruple in omitting or altering what he disliked or did
                    not understand, in improving, as he thought, what required improvement. Still we
                    do not see why, as one of the first persons to call public attention to the
                    works of the older and neglected Scottish poets, his attempts at emendation
                    should be visited with more severe censure than the similar or still greater
                    liberties taken by Dr Percy in publishing his Reliques of Ancient English
                    Poetry.</p>
                <p>Three years later, in 1773, appeared Lord Hailes’ “Remarks on the History of
                    Scotland,” consisting of nineteen chapters, each of them treating of subjects
                    calculated (in the words of Lord Elibank in his “Letter” to the author) “to
                    revive that spirit of inquiry into the antiquities of this country, which, to
                    our shame, was almost totally extinguished; and which, if it was possible to
                    abolish, would at once destroy the most powerful incitement to private virtue
                    and public spirit.” The “Remarks” might be considered as gleanings of the
                    historical research which he was making at that time, and discovered his
                    lordship’s turn for minute and accurate inquiry “into knotty points” of history.
                    This publication, whilst it displayed the candour and liberality of his
                    judgment, prepared the public for the favourable reception of the “Annals of
                    Scotland,” the first volume of which appeared in 1776. This is a work so well
                    known, and its value is so justly appreciated, that it would be unnecessary to
                    enlarge upon its merits. The chronological plan adopted was somewhat novel in
                    English history, but was not calculated for a popular work. It was, however,
                    quite suited to the author’s peculiar turn of mind; his great object being that
                    of clearing away the fables, unsupported theories, and partial statements, of
                    former historians. Several general histories of the country had recently been
                    published, such as Maitland and Grainger’s, and Guthrie’s, whilst public
                    attention bad been in a more especial manner directed towards the subject by the
                    writings of Robertson and Hume. The period which Lord Hailes intended to treat
                    of began with the accession of Malcolm Canmore, in 1057, “because the History of
                    Scotland, previous to that period, is involved in obscurity and fable;” and
                    because he was enabled to ascertain and establish its subsequent details by the
                    authority either of contemporary writers, or by references to public records and
                    other original documents which had been preserved. Although the “Annals”
                    presented no attractions of style, being devoid of all the graces and amenities
                    of writing, yet the author’s patient elaboration of minute facts and dates, his
                    acuteness in detecting error, his strict impartiality, and his scrupulous
                    attachment to truth, excited the admiration of the great English moralist, to
                    whom he had sent the sheets for révisai, and whose opinion of the work is worthy
                    of quotation. “It is in our language, 1 think,” says Dr Johnson, “a new mode of
                    history which tells all that is wanted, and, I suppose, all that is known,
                    without laboured splendour of language or affected subtilty of conjecture. <hi
                    rend="italic">The exactness of his</hi> [Lord Hailes’ĵ <hi rend="italic">dates
                    raises my wonder.</hi> He seems to have the closeness of Henault without his
                    restraint.” This opinion he takes a pleasure in repeating in a subsequent letter
                    to Mr Boswell. “Be so kind,” he says, “as to return Lord Hailes my most
                    respectful thanks for his first volume; his accuracy strikes me with wonder; his
                    narrative is far superior to that ofHe-nault, as I have formerly mentioned.”
                    Again, he says, “Lord Hailes’ Annals of Scotland have not that painted form
                    which is the taste of this age; but it is a book which will always sell, it has
                    such a stability of dates, such a certainty of facts, and such a punctuality of
                    citation. <hi rend="italic">I never before read Scotch history with
                    certainty''</hi> On the appearance of the second volume in 1779, he says, it
                    “lies by my bed-side; <hi rend="italic">a booh surely of great labour, and, to
                    every just thinker, of great delight”</hi> Johnson, however, was not blind to
                    its cardinal defect, namely, the dispassionate and dry statement of facts; but
                    this he hints with a delicacy, arising no doubt from the high regard he
                    entertained for the author’s private character. “Lord Hailes’ Annals of
                    Scotland,” he says, in a subsequent letter to Mr Boswell, “are very exact; <hi
                    rend="italic">but they contain mere dry particulars.</hi> They are to be
                    considered as a dictionary. You knowsucb things are there, and may be looked at
                    when you please. Robertson paints; but the misfortune is, you are sure he does
                    not know the people whom he paints; so you cannot suppose a likeness. Characters
                    should never be given by a historian, unless he knew the people whom he
                    describes, or copies from those who knew them.”</p>
                <p>Lord Hailes’ Annals terminate with the accession of the house of Stuart, in the
                    person of Robert III. in 1370. He intended to have carried them on to the
                    restoration of James I. in 1424; but for “various and invincible reasons,” which
                    are not stated, he left this portion to be resumed by some future historian. We
                    have seen it mentioned, that when urged by Dr Carlyle to write the history of
                    the house of Stuart, by continuing the Annals to the period of the union between
                    Scotland and England, he declined such a project, alleging “he had not temper to
                    write the annals of such men.” At a later period of life he turned his thoughts
                    to the literary history of bis country, and published several sketches of lives
                    as specimens of a <hi rend="italic">Biographia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scotica</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work, he thought, which, if executed “on
                    a large and liberal plan, would deserve approbation and he engaged, if others
                    would co-operate, “to assist in the general design.” The only person, we
                    believe, who came forward on the occasion was the Earl of Buchan, but, with all
                    his zeal and patriotism, his lordship’s habit of mind presented a striking
                    contrast when compared with the extent and accuracy of Lord Hailes’ literary and
                    biographical knowledge, in which he probably excelled all his contemporaries:
                    the scheme accordingly was abandoned.</p>
                <p>We may now-turn to the other class of Lord Hailes’ publications, which consists
                    of those relating to the history and antiquities of the Christian church. His
                    attention must have been led to this subject previously to the appearance of the
                    obnoxious chapters in Gibbon’s History of the Roman Empire; for no allusion to
                    that work is contained in the notes to his account of the Martyrs of Smyrna,
                    published in the same year, 1776. He may therefore have been the more deeply
                    impressed with a sense of the mistakes and partialities of that splendid writer;
                    and he certainly, in no subsequent work, loses an opportunity<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755111" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5111-0603"/> to expose his unfair
                    statements in tracing the progress and establishment of Christianity during the
                    earlier persecutions of the church. In all these publications Lord Hailes was
                    evidently actuated by a fervent and enlightened zeal; and, by the light which he
                    throws upon difficult passages of ancient writers, he vindicates such sentiments
                    and conduct as are conformable to the word of God, against the insinuations of
                    the historian of the Roman empire in its decline, and directly supports the
                    cause of our most holy faith. His continued investigations of the subject at
                    length, in 1786, led to the publication, in a substantive form, of his most
                    elaborate work, entitled “An Inquiry into the secondary Causes which Mr Gibbon
                    has assigned for the rapid Progress of Christianity.” This work has too much the
                    character of a collection of detached critical remarks; but, besides the extent
                    of learning which it displays in common with his minor publications, it is both
                    solid and acute in argument, and most satisfactorily establishes “that the
                    things which Mr Gibbon considered as secondary or human causes, efficaciously
                    promoting the Christian religion, <hi rend="italic">either tended to retard its
                    progress, or ivere the manifest operations of the wisdom and power of
                    God.”</hi></p>
                <p>His lordship’s constitution had been long in an enfeebled state, and being
                    predisposed to corpulence, his habits of studious application, and the want of
                    regular exercise, were unfavourable for the prolongation of life; yet he
                    attended his duty on the bench till within three days of his death, when he was
                    attacked with symptoms of apoplexy <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> on his way
                    from the Court of Session, and was carried off by a second attack on the 29th of
                    November 1792, in the sixty-sixth year of his age. Lord Hailes was twice
                    married. By his first wife, Anne, daughter of the Honourable George Brown, Lord
                    Coalston, he left one daughter, who still inherits the family estate. By his
                    marriage with Helen, daughter of the Honourable Sir James Fergusson, Baronet,
                    Lord Kilkerran, who survived him, he had another daughter, afterwards married to
                    her cousin, the grandson of Lord Kilkerran. As Lord Hailes left no male issue,
                    the title of baronet descended to his nephew John, eldest son of his brother
                    John Dalrymple, formerly Lord Provost of Edinburgh.</p>

                    in August 1752, which contained the first proposals for extending and improving
                    the city of Edinburgh, which was still confined within its ancient and narrow
                    limits.</p>

                <p>5. A Discourse of the unnatural and vile Conspiracye attempted by John Earl of
                    Gowrye, and his brother, against his Majestie’s Person, at Saint Johnstoun, upon
                    the 5th of August 1600. No date [1755Ĵ, 12mo. This tract is the narrative
                    published in 1600 as King James’s account of the Earl of Gowrye’s Conspiracy,
                    reprinted with explanatory notes, intended to serve as a specimen of historical
                    collections illustrative of that still mysterious point of Scottish history.
                    This reprint has no date, and is usually assigned to the year 1757; but it is
                    mentioned in the list of new books, in the Scots Magazine for December 1755.
                    There is another edition of the tract reprinted about the same time, but without
                    notes. Sir David Dalrymple afterwards communicated such papers as he had
                    collected, and explained his sentiments regarding the “Conspiracy” to Dr
                    Robertson, which enabled him, in his History of Scotland, “to place that
                    transaction in a light which dispels much of the darkness and confusion in which
                    it has been hitherto involved.”</p>

                <p>8. † A Sermon which might have been preached in East Lothian, on the 25th of
                    October 1761. Edin. 1761, 12mo. Occasioned by the country people pillaging the
                    wreck of two vessels cast away on the coast of East Lothian, between Dunbar and
                    North Berwick. This “Sermon” is mentioned in the Scots Magazine, Nov. 1761, p.
                    614, where the author is styled “a gentleman distinguished no less for humanity
                    and religion, than for politeness and learning.” His object in composing this
                    discourse was the restitution of the stolen goods. It was “printed on his own
                    charges, and caused be distributed in that country, not permitting a single copy
                    to be sold ;” and we are told it produced the designed effect. It was reprinted,

                    the language, which Dr Johnson blamed, and blamed justly; for, says he, “An
                    author’s language is a characteristical part of his composition, and is also
                    characteristical of the age in which he writes. Besides, sir, when the language
                    is changed, we are not sure that the sense is the same.”</p>

                    1794 edition of the Catalogue of the Lords of Session is occasionally to be met
                    with in a volume, along with Nos. 18, 19, 20, and 21 of this list, having a

                <p>16. † A Specimen of Notes on the Statute Law of Scotland. Lord Hailes, in the
                    Scots Magazine, May 1768, announced that “for some time past he had been engaged
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755124" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5124-0604"/>in drawing up

                    8vo, pp. 37, and circulated copies, addressed to such persons as were likely to
                    afford the information and assistance which he wished.</p>

                    time ιfter No. 16. Lord Hailes appears to have contemplated some publication of
                    the kind, even at a late period of his life. In a letter to Pinkerton, dated
                    Sept. 28, 1790, after observing that he had no view of beginning where he had
                    left off in the History of Scotland, he says, “Any thing that I have [collected]
                    as to the five James’s and Queen Mary, will come in properly among my notes on
                    their acts of parliament; a work which has been long under my hands, and which I
                    am unwilling to lose sight of.”</p>

                    Edinburgh Magazine and Review, the Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany,
                    the Gentleman’s Magazine, and in various other periodical works. In the
                    Gentleman’s Magazine, vol. lx. 1790, are a series of remarks on the late edition
                    of the Tatler, with notes, in six volumes; also, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755137" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5137-0605"/>in vol. lxi. two letters on
                    the famous miniature, said to be of Milton, in the possession of Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds. The Edinburgh Magazine and Review for February 1774 contains some
                    remarks on the Latin Poems of Dr Pitcairne, by Lord Hailes. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Life of Kames,</hi> vol. i. p. 6, note.) He was also a contributor to Kippis’s
                    edition of the Biograpliia Britannica.</p>
                <p>In addition to these, Lord Hailes printed several minor tracts without titles,
                    some of them being specimen sheets of his published works. “The Little
                    Freeholder,” a dramatic entertainment, London, 1790, 12mo, has been usually
                    attributed to him, but, we have heard it asserted, on insufficient grounds.</p>
                <p>Some of his letters have been printed in Pinkerton’s Literary Correspondence, in
                    Nichols’ Illustrations, and in other works.</p>
                <p>After this copious list of the publications by Lord Hailes, it is unnecessary to
                    add any thing to what has been already stated in regard to his literary
                    character, which united acuteness of mind and soundness of judgment with
                    extensive learning and assiduous research. Every true lover of bis country must
                    rejoice that such a man should have devoted himself so zealously to literary
                    pursuits, while they must revere his memory for his successful attempts to
                    subject to the ordeal of rational criticism so many disputed points of
                    historical research, and more particularly for having illustrated three
                    centuries of our national history with a degree of accuracy and information
                    which it is much easier to admire than to emulate. But as in his writings his
                    attention was uniformly directed to promote the interests of religion and
                    virtue, so in his conduct he was actuated by the purest principles of
                    benevolence and fervent piety; and in the private relations of life he was all
                    that was praiseworthy and honourable. “In a word,” says the late Lord
                    Woodhouselee, “he was an honour to the station which he filled, and to the age
                    in which he lived.” “That such a man,” to use the words of an intelligent
                    writer, “should not yet have found a,biographer worthy of his merits, cannot be
                    ascribed either to the obscurity of his character and station, or to the
                    incapacity of his contemporaries. But Lord Hailes was a man of piety of the old
                    stamp, and a strenuous advocate for revealed religion, and therefore did not
