                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DAHOMEY</label>, a considerable kingdom, situated in the
                    interior of Western Africa, behind the Slave Coast. It was scarcely known to
                    Europeans till the beginning of the last century, when Guadjo Trudo, the
                    sovereign of Dahomey, extended his dominion to the sea, by the conquest of
                    Whidah and Ardra. These beautiful countries, the garden of Africa, were rendered
                    almost a desert by this terrible inroad; and they have as yet recovered only a
                    small portion of their former prosperity. Several French and English travellers
                    have since made their way to the capital of Dahomey, and given a view of the
                    extraordinary institutions and political system which prevail there. All the
                    most arbitrary forms of despotism seem to be mild and liberal when compared with
                    the tyranny established in this barbarous state. The despotism is not founded
                    upon force and terror, nor is it connected with any timid or effeminate
                    character in its subjects, who are the most furious and desperate soldiers in
                    Africa. It rests on a blind and idolatrous veneration for the person of the
                    sovereign, as for that of a superior being. It is a crime to suppose that the
                    king of Dahomey can eat, drink, sleep, or perform J any of the functions of an
                    ordinary mortal. Bossa Aha-dee, on his accession, caused all the persons of the
                    name of Bossa in his dominions to be put to death, conceiving it to be an
                    unpardonable presumption that any subject should bear the same name as his
                    master. The greatest lords are allowed to approach the king only lying flat on
                    their faces, and rolling their heads in the dust. The attempts thus made to
                    inspire the people with reverence for their monarch seem completely successful.
                    The Dahoman rushes to battle with the same blind intrepidity in the cause of his
                    king, as the Spartans formerly did for their nation and laws. Norris having
                    asked a Dahoman before battle if he did not think the enemy too numerous, the
                    man replied, “I think of my king, and then I dare engage five of the enemy
                    myself.” He declared his indifference whether he survived or not; adding, “It is
                    not material; my head belongs to the king, not to myself; if he pleases to send
                    for it, I am ready to resign it; or if it be shot through in battle, it is no
                    difference to mc, I am satisfied.” War is the element of the Dahomans, and they
                    had subdued all the neighbouring states, till they themselves were repeatedly
                    defeated, and at length rendered tributary, by the Eyeos, a still more numerous
                    and powerful people, who occupy the country to the north-east. The ferocity
                    which prevails in this nation almost surpasses belief. Human skulls form the
                    favourite ornament in the construction of the palaces and temples. The king’s
                    sleeping chamber has the floor paved with skulls, and the roof ornamented with
                    the jaw-bones of chiefs whom he has overcome in battle. Every year a grand
                    festival is held, which lasts for several weeks, and during which the king
                    waters the graves of his ancestors with hosts of human victims. The bodies of
                    those unhappy men are not even interred, but are suspended by the feet to the
                    walls, and left hanging till they putrefy. But the most extraordinary exercise
                    of despotism consists in the treatment of the female sex, all of whom in Dahomey
                    are considered as the property of the king, and entirely at his disposal. After
                    retaining an immoderate number for his own use, he distributes the rest, first
                    among his chief men, and then among the commons. The distribution of wives takes
                    place once a year at the grand festival, when each individual gives in such a
                    sum as he is able to spare for the purchase, and receives in return such a wife
                    as the king chooses to bestow. There is no room for discussion or complaint; be
                    she old, ugly, or deformed, she must equally be accepted. As a large proportion,
                    however, are left without the means of procuring a wife, the king maintains a
                    certain number of courtezans, who are obliged to ply their trade at a moderate
                    rate to all comers. He himself has about three thousand wives, a large
                    proportion of whom exercise functions which do not in other countries devolve
                    upon the female sex. They are trained to arms, and compose a regiment of royal
                    guards, divided into companies, armed with muskets and bows, and provided with
                    drums, flags, and all the apparatus of war. At the death of the king a horrid
                    scene commences; the wives, after the most extravagant demonstrations of grief,
                    begin with breaking and destroying every thing that belongs to them, and then
                    fall to murdering each other, till they are stopped by order of the new
                    sovereign. The throne descends rightfully to the eldest son; but as it is judged
                    indispensable that this fierce nation should be swayed by a vigorous hand, where
                    there appears any deficiency in the eldest, the chiefs select one of the younger
                    brothers. This arrangement, however, often gives rise to a civil war.</p>
                <p>The country of Dahomey is very little known to Europeans, who have only observed
                    that part which is passed in going from the coast to the capital. This appeared
                    to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754916" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4916-0588"/>be very
                    beautiful and fertile, rising for about 150 miles in a gradual slope, but
                    without any great elevation. The soil is a deep rich clay of a reddish colour,
                    with a little sand on the surface; but there was not observed in the whole
                    country a stone as large as a walnut. Of farinaceous vegetables, the country,
                    when duly cultivated, yields a plentiful supply; maize, millet or Guinea corn; a
                    kind of peas, or rather kidney beans’, called callavances; and also a species of
                    beans called ground beans. The Dahomans likewise cultivate yams, potatoes, the
                    plantain, and the banana. Pine apples, oranges, limes, guavas, and other
                    tropical fruits, abound in this fertile country; nor is it destitute of
                    productions adapted for commerce, such as indigo, cotton, the sugar cane,
                    tobacco, palm oil, together with a variety of spices, particularly a species of
                    pepper, scarcely distinguishable from that raised in the East Indies. The
                    harmattan, or dry wind, blows here strongest from the north-east; but Mr Norris
                    does not ascribe to it those pestilential qualities which have often been
                    supposed to belong to it. It parches up the ground indeed, and injures every
                    species of vegetable. To man it produces unpleasant sensations, rendering the
                    eyes, nostrils, lips, and palate very dry and uneasy. But it does not induce any
                    fatal diseases; it even cures cutaneous eruptions, and stops the progress of
                    small-pox, fluxes, and remittent fevers. The greatest injury to health arises
                    from the periodical rains, and the tornadoes with which they are accompanied.
                    These, however, are the grand source of fertility, and are immediately succeeded
                    by the most luxuriant vegetation.</p>
