                <p><label type="entry">DEGRADATION</label>, in our law books called <hi
                    rend="italic">disgradation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">deposition,</hi> the act
                    of depriving or stripping a person for ever of a dignity or degree of honour,
                    and taking away the title, badge, and privileges thereof.</p>
                <p>The degradation of a peer, a priest, a knight, a gentleman, an officer, or such
                    like person, is performed with different ceremonies. That which anciently
                    obtained in degrading a person from his nobility is very curious. It was
                    practised in the time of Francis I. upon Captain Fangel, who had in a cowardly
                    manner given up Fontarabia, of which he was governor. On this occasion, twenty
                    or thirty cavaliers, without blemish or reproach, were assembled; before whom
                    the gentleman was accused of treason and breach of faith by a king-at-arms. Two
                    scaffolds were erected; the one for the judges, heralds, and pursuivants, and
                    the other for the guilty cavalier, who was armed at all points, and his shield
                    placed on a stake before him, reversed with the point upwards. There also
                    assisted twelve priests in surplices, who sung the vigils of the dead. At the
                    close of each psalm they made a pause, during which the officers of arms
                    stripped the condemned of some piece of his armour, beginning with the helmet,
                    and proceeding thus till he was quite disarmed, which being done, they broke his
                    shield in three pieces with a hammer. Then the king-at-arms emptied a bason of
                    hot water on the criminal’s head, and the judges, putting on mourning habits,
                    went to the church. This being done, the degraded was drawn from off the
                    scaffold with a rope tied under his arm-pits, laid on a bier, and covered with
                    mortuary clothes, the priest singing some of the prayers for the dead, and then
                    he was delivered to the civil judge and the executioner of justice.</p>
                <p>For a more domestic instance, Sir Andrew Harcla, earl of Carlisle, being
                    attainted and convicted of treason, by the 18th Edward II. <hi rend="italic"
                    >coram</hi><hi rend="italic">rege,</hi> after judgment had been pronounced on
                    him, his sword was broken over his head, and his spurs hewn off his heels; Sir
                    Anthony Lucy, the judge, saying to him, “Andrew, now thou art no knight, but a
                    knave.” By statute 13th Car. II. William Lord Monson, Sir Henry Mildmay, and
                    others, were degraded from all titles of honour, dignities, and pre-eminences,
                    and prohibited to bear or use the title of lord, knight, esquire, or gentleman,
                    or any coat of arms, for ever afterwards. It has been maintained that the king
                    may degrade a peer; but it appears from modern authorities that he cannot be
                    degraded but by act of parliament.</p>
                <p>As to ecclesiastics, we have an instance of degradation before condemnation to
                    death, in the eighth century, at Constantinople. It is in the person of the
                    patriarch Constantine, whom Constantine Copronymus caused to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756086" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6086-0678"/>executed. He was made to
                    ascend the ambo, when the patriarch Nicetas sent some of his bishops to strip
                    him of the pallium, and to anathematize him; then they made him go out of the
                    church backwards.</p>
                <p>But we have a much later instance in our own history. When Cranmer, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, was degraded by order of Queen Mary, they dressed him in episcopal
                    robes, made only of canvass, put the mitre on his head, and the pastoral staff'
                    in his hand, and in this attire showed him to the people; and this being done,
                    they stripped him again piece by piece. Subsequently they did not stand so much
                    on the ceremony of degradation in order to the putting of a priest to death, by
                    reason of the delays and difficulties which it would occasion. Pope Boniface
                    pronounced that six bishops were required to degrade a priest; but the
                    difficulty of assembling so many bishops rendered the punishment frequently
                    impracticable. In England, a priest, after being delivered to his ordinary, if
                    he* cannot purge himself of the crime with which he is charged, his gown and
                    other robes are stripped over his ears by the common hangman, by which he is
                    declared divested of his orders.</p>
                <p>It has been decided, however, that degradation does not efface the priestly
                    character. Degradation seems only to differ from deposition in a few ignominious
                    ceremonies which custom has added thereto. Accordingly, in the business of
                    Arnoul, archbishop of Rheims, sentenced in the council of Orleans in 991, it was
                    deliberated what form they should follow in the deposition; whether that of the
                    canons, that is, simple deposition; or that of custom, namely, degradation. And
                    it was declared that he should surrender the ring, pastoral staff, and pallium,
                    but that his robes should not be torn off. In effect, the canons prescribe no
                    more than a mere reading of the sentence. It is the rest, therefore, added
                    thereto by custom, namely, the stripping off the ornaments, and the tearing the
                    pontifical vestments, that properly constitutes degradation.</p>
