                <p><label type="entry">DATA</label>, among mathematicians, a term for such things or
                    quantities as are given or known, in order thereby to find other things that are
                    unknown. The <hi rend="italic">data</hi> of Euclid is the first in order of the
                    books which have been written by the ancient geometricians, to facilitate and
                    promote the method of resolution or analysis. In general, a thing is said to be
                    given which is either actually exhibited, or can be found out, that is, which is
                    either known by hypothesis, or that can be demonstrated to be known; and the
                    propositions in the book of Euclid’s data show what things can be found out or
                    known, from those that by hypothesis are already known; so that in the analysis
                    or investigation of a problem, from the things that are laid down as given or
                    known, it is demonstrated, by the help of these propositions, that other things
                    are given, and from these last that others again are given, and so on, till it
                    is demonstrated that that which was proposed to be found out in the problem is
                    given; and when this is done, the problem is solved, and its composition is made
                    and derived from the compositions of the data which were employed in the
                    analysis. And thus the data of Euclid are of the most general and necessary use
                    in the solution of problems of every kind.</p>
                <p>Marinus, at the end of his preface to the data, is mistaken in asserting that
                    Euclid has not used the synthetical, but the analytical method in delivering
                    them; for though in the analysis of a theorem, the thing to be demonstrated is
                    assumed in the analysis, yet in the demonstrations of the data, the thing to be
                    demonstrated, which is, that something is given, is never once assumed in the
                    demonstration; from which it is manifest that every one of them is demonstrated
                    synthetically; though indeed if a proposition of the data be turned into a
                    problem, the demonstration of the proposition becomes the analysis of the
                    problem.</p>
                <p>From the primary use of the word <hi rend="italic">data</hi> in mathematics, it
                    has been transplanted into other branches, as philosophy, medicine, and the
                    like, where it expresses any quantity which, for the sake of a present
                    calculation, is taken for granted to be such, without requiring an immediate
                    proof of its certainty, and is also called the <hi rend="italic">given</hi>
                    quantity, number, or power. And hence also such things as are known, and from
                    which, either in natural philosophy, the animal mechanism, or the operation of
                    medicine, we come to the knowledge of others unknown, are now frequently in
                    physical writers called <hi rend="italic">data.</hi></p>
