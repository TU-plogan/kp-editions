                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dairy</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Dairying,</hi> that
                    branch of husbandry of which the object is to convert the produce of the soil
                    into milk, by means of the domesticated animals, and to prepare it for use in
                    different forms.</p>
                <p>The only animal kept in considerable numbers for its milk, in this country, is
                    the cow. Though it is still the practice in some parts of Britain to draw a
                    quantity of milk from ewes, after their lambs are weaned, and a few goats and
                    asses are kept chiefly for their milk; yet in the case of sheep, the milk is a
                    very subordinate part of the produce, and the medicinal quality of the milk of
                    the two latter species of animals, of which the number is quite inconsiderable,
                    does not allow them to be considered as part of a dairy stock.</p>
                <p>Milk is used either in the state in which it is drawn from the cow, or, after its
                    component parts have been separated, in the shape of cream, or butter, or
                    cheese, with butter milk, skimmed milk, or whey. Hence, to give a general view
                    of this branch of husbandry, it is necessary to arrange dairies under three
                    great divisions, according to the principal object of each, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">new milk, butter,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cheese</hi> dairies.
                    Nor is it any objection to this arrangement, . that, at certain seasons of the
                    year, or owing to temporary causes, it may be found necessary to unite the
                    labours of all the three in any one of these divisions. It is enough that the
                    chief purpose and general management be different, to entitle them to separate
                    consideration, because these take their rise in the very different circumstances
                    of each class, and give to it a determinate character. The treatment of the
                    cows, and the value of their produce, are by no means the same in all the three,
                    and the animals themselves would require to be selected with a view to the
                    particular object of each; the cow that yields the greatest quantity of milk,
                    and is on this account preferred for a new milk dairy, not being always the most
                    profitable one in a cheese or butter dairy.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">New Milk Fairies.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It is only in
                    or near large towns 1 that dairies of this description can be established upon a
                    scale of any extent, and there they are found in great variety. It will give a
                    sufficient view of what may be considered the best systems of management, to
                    mention the practice of the London and Edinburgh dairymen.</p>
                <p>1. The cows kept for∙supplying the metropolis with milk( are of a large size,
                    with short horns, and known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Holderness
                    cattle,</hi> from a district of that name in Yorkshire, though they do not now
                    all come from thence, but many of them from a similar stock in that and the
                    neighbouring counties. They are bought from the breeders when three or four
                    years old, and in calf, and exposed by the dealers at the fairs and markets in
                    Middlesex, particularly at Islington, where there is a fresh supply from the
                    country every week, by means of which the London cow-keepers are enabled to keep
                    up their stocks. These cows arc preferred on account of the quantity of their
                    milk, without much regard to its quality. A few of the cow-keepers have very
                    large stocks, nearly a thousand having been sometimes in the possession of one
                    individual. The whole number required for the supply of London and its environs
                    with milk is about 8500, the produce of which a few years ago was estimated at
                    L.38 a year each, or L.323,000 in all, said to yield a profit of L.6 per cow to
                    their owners. But the sum actually paid for milk, including the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754929" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4929-0589"/>profits of the retailer, has
                    been stated at L.626,233 per annum.</p>
                <p>The cow-keepers breed very few cattle, and those only from favourite cows, which
                    become so merely from their giving much milk, and with very little attention to
                    the choice of their bulls. Cows of this description are usually kept five, or
                    even sometimes seven years. When they are allowed to become dry, with a view to
                    their being disposed of, they soon become fat on their former diet, and are then
                    sold to the butcher.</p>
                <p>During the night the cows are confined in stalls. About three o’clock in the
                    morning each has an half bushel basket of grains, to which salt, not much more
                    than an ounce a day, is sometimes added. From four o’clock to half past six they
                    are milked by the retail milk-dealers, who contract with the cow-keepers for the
                    milk of a certain number of cows, at so much for eight quarts. When the milking
                    is finished, a bushel basket of turnips is given to each cow; and very soon
                    afterwards they have an allotment, in the proportion of one truss to ten cows,
                    of grassy and soft meadow hay, which had been the most early mown, and cured of
                    the greenest colour. These several feedings are generally made before eight
                    o’clock in the morning, at which time the cows are usually turned into the
                    cow-yard, though in one large dairy at Islington they are constantly confined to
                    the stake. About twelve o’clock they are again confined to their stalls, and
                    served with the same quantity of grains as they had in the morning. About half
                    past one o’clock in the afternoon, the milking commences in the manner before
                    described, and continues till near throe, when the cows are again served with
                    the same quantity of turnips, and, about an hour afterwards, with the same
                    distribution of hay. Along with, or instead of turnips, mangel wurzel is now
                    much used in these dairies.</p>
                <p>This mode of feeding generally continues during the turnip season, which is from
                    the month of September to the month of May. During the other months of the year
                    they are fed with grains, cabbages, tares, and the foregoing proportion of
                    rouen, or second cut meadow-bay, and are continued to be fed and milked with the
                    same regularity as before described, until they are turned out to grass, when
                    they continue in the field all night; and even during this last period they are
                    frequently' fed with grains, which are kept sweet and eatable for a considerable
                    length of time, by being buried in pits made for that purpose. There are about
                    ten bulls to a stock of three hundred cows. The calves are generally sent to
                    Smithfield market at one, two, or three days old. The quantity of milk given by
                    each cow, on an average, is <hi rend="italic">nine quarts</hi> a day, or 3285
                    quarts in the year. The weekly expense of food is estimated in the Middlesex
                    report at 10s. 3d. and the other charges about L.5. 7s. per annum. In 1807, the
                    retailer paid to the cow-keeper for the milk 2^d. and sold it to the consumer at
                    4⅜d. per quart; but it is alleged, that by' taking off cream, difference of
                    measure, and other means, the retailer obtains a profit of no less than a
                    hundred per cent.</p>
                <p>Five or six men only are employed in attending nearly three hundred cows. As one
                    person cannot milk more than eight or nine cows twice a day, that part of the
                    business would necessarily be attended with considerable expense to the
                    cow-keeper, were it not that the retailer, as before observed, agrees for the
                    produce of a certain number of cows, and takes the labour and expense of milking
                    ļ upon himself.</p>
                <p>Every cow-house is provided with a milk room, where the milk is measured, and
                    served out by the cow-keeper; and this room is commonly furnished with a pump,
                    to which the retail dealers are said to apply in rotation, not secretly, but
                    openly, before any person who may be standing by, from which they pump water
                    into the milk vessels at their discretion. The pump is placed there expressly
                    for that purpose, and it is seldom used for any' other.</p>
                <p>2. The greater part of the cows kept in Edinburgh are also of the short-horned
                    breed, brought from the counties of Berwick, Roxburgh, and Northumberland, and
                    weigh, when fat, from forty to sixty stones avoirdupois. They are purchased by
                    dealers, who drive them to market when they are about to calve, or immediately
                    after calving. Many of them are too old for being kept to advantage on the usual
                    food allowed them in the country, or to be fattened on turnips; and part of them
                    are purchased from hinds or married ploughmen, who have no means of fattening
                    them. A cow which shows a great deal of milk sells in Edinburgh nearly as high
                    as a fat cow of the same weight.</p>
                <p>The cow-feeders of Edinburgh do not find it for their interest to keep their cows
                    for more than one year, or even so long, if they can be fattened sooner. Their
                    object is to have as great a quantity of milk as possible in the first instance;
                    and when the cows fall off in milking, as they almost alway’s do between four
                    and six months after calving, to prepare them speedily for the butcher. Most of
                    the cows continue to give a good deal of milk while they are fattening, and even
                    until they are sent to the shambles. It is expected they should sell to the
                    butcher at the price paid by the cow-keeper.</p>
                <p>Their food in summer is brewers’ and distillers’ grains,] and wash or dreg, wheat
                    shellings or small bran, grass, and straw; and in winter the same grains, dreg,
                    and bran, with turnips and potatoes, and hay instead of grass. When grains are
                    scarce, cut or chopped hay is mixed with them. Some of them are sent to pasture
                    in fields near the city for about two months during the best of the grass
                    season; but even then a certain number must be kept in the house, for consuming
                    the grains, which are usually purchased by contract for a whole year.</p>
                <p>With regard to management, the cow-keepers begin; with grains, dreg, and bran,
                    mixed together, at five o’clock] in the morning; feed a second time at one
                    o’clock afternoon, and a third from seven to eight in the evening. Grass in
                    summer, and turnips or potatoes in winter, are given at both intervals. A small
                    quantity of straw is laid below the grass, which absorbs its moisture, and is
                    eaten after the grass; and, in winter, straw or hay is given after the turnips.
                    Part of the turnips or potatoes is boiled, particularly when there is a scarcity
                    of grains, and intermixed with them. The expense in summer is said to be 2s.
                    10^d., and in winter 3s. 7⅜d. per day, for each cow. The cows are seldom milked
                    more than twice a day; but for about a month after being bought, it is sometimes
                    necessary to milk them three times. The common periods of milking are six
                    o’clock in the morning, from three to four in the afternoon, and, when milked a
                    third time, nine in the evening.</p>
                <p>Their produce in milk, when fed as already stated, may average about seven Scotch
                    pints, or nearly twelve quarts and a half, daily, per cow. When the cows are
                    smaller, and not so well fed, five pints, or about nine quarts, is said to be
                    the average. The price of milk in Edinburgh used to be 6d. per pint, but of late
                    it has been lower, particularly in summer. This is said to be very little more
                    than the price of the food. For interest of money, risk, expenses of management,
                    and profit, there is the manure, worth L.3. 10s. for each cow; some savings on
                    the cows while at grass, which costs only Is. 8d. per day; and probably a small
                    advance of price may be commonly got from the butcher when the cows are
                    skilfully selected and well managed.</p>
                <p>There have been instances of cow-feeders contracting with others to retail their
                    milk; but the practice is not common. The cow-keepers generally retail it
                    themselves.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754942" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4942-0590"/>
                <p>In one instance a guinea a week for the milk of each cow was paid by retailers to
                    a farmer in the vicinity of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Comparing the London and Edinburgh dairies, there seems to be a difference in
                    favour of the best of the latter, of no less than three quarts and a half per
                    day. If this be the fact, perhaps it is owing to the whole of the Edinburgh cows
                    being always in milk, none of them being kept for years and bred from, as in the
                    London dairies.</p>
                <p>An extensive dairy was carried on a few years ago at Glasgow, by Mr William
                    Harley, and conducted with an attention to the health and comfort of the
                    animals, and the purity of the milk, that has probably had no parallel in
                    Britain. The cows were of the Ayrshire breed, bought in generally either newly
                    calved, or a few weeks before calving, and kept constantly in the house till
                    they were sent to the butcher. Their food was much the same as in the Edinburgh
                    dairies; but the turnips and potatoes given in winter were always prepared with
                    steam. The average quantity of milk was eleven quarts daily from each cow, and
                    it was delivered to the consumer from vessels so constructed and secured as to
                    prevent adulteration in its passage from the dairy. This establishment, which
                    was an interesting object to strangers, exists no longer.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Butter Dairies.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This class is
                    not confined, like the former, to the immediate neighbourhood of towns, yet the
                    principal ones are situated at such a moderate distance as to allow of their
                    produce being sent thither in a fresh state. Butter is made, indeed, in every
                    part of the country, but it is nevertheless the chief object of a great number
                    of dairies, which therefore form one leading division in this department of
                    husbandry.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that any particular breed of cows, as in milk dairies, is
                    selected as most suitable for dairies of this description; nor that their food
                    and general management differ materially from those of cows kept for other
                    purposes. Even in dairies of this class, butter, though the chief object, is not
                    one so exclusive as to prevent the cows from being employed as a breeding stock.
                    With this last view they are almost of every different variety, according as one
                    or other breed is considered as the most profitable, upon the whole, in
                    different situations. They are commonly the breed of the district where the
                    dairy is situated, and not, like the short horns kept in milk dairies, brought
                    from other quarters, with a particular view to this description of produce. For
                    an account of these breeds, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>Butter is made either from cream taken from the milk, or from the milk itself,
                    the former method, however, being still the most common. The best cream will be
                    ready for the skimming dish in seven or eight hours, though twelve is the more
                    usual period; and, according to the state of the weather, it is allowed to stand
                    from three to seven days before it is put into the churn. The best temperature
                    at commencing the operation of churning is from fifty to fifty-five degrees, and
                    it should never exceed sixty. The practice of churning the whole milk, which has
                    long prevailed, particularly in the western counties of Scotland, does not seem
                    to be generally known. Mr Marshall, in his review of the original report of
                    Cheshire, printed in 1794, mentions it in 1810, as a singular variety in the
                    English butter dairy, that in Cheshire the milk and cream are churned together
                    without any previous separation.</p>
                <p>The practice as it prevails in Scotland has been thus described. The milk, when
                    drawn from the cow, is placed in coolers about three inches deep, and stands
                    from twelve to twenty-four hours; when the cream has risen to the surface, the
                    coolers are emptied into a stand-vat, where the milk remains till churned. If
                    another milking is ready to be placed in the stand-vat before the former has
                    begun to sour, the second also may be put into it; but if the first has soured,
                    or is approaching to it, such admixture, it is said, would lead to fermentation,
                    and injure the milk. The utmost care is always taken not to allow the <hi
                    rend="italic">coagulum</hi> of the milk in the stand-vat to be broken till it is
                    about to be churned. If the house be of a proper temperature, the milk may stand
                    from a day to a week without injury, till as much be collected as it may be
                    convenient to churn at a time. No milk is ever churned till it has become acid
                    and coagulated.</p>
                <p>The operation is generally performed in plunge-churns of considerable size. Some
                    of them, containing 120 Scotch pints, are worked by a single person; and when
                    machinery is applied, 150 or 200 pints are churned at a time. In a few minutes
                    after the operation begins, as much warm water is poured into the churn as
                    raises the temperature of the milk from fifty to fifty-five degrees of
                    Fahrenheit (being that of the dairy house), to seventy or seventy-five degrees;
                    the churning always going on while the water is slowly poured in. The milk will
                    admit of a greater proportion of water in autumn, when it is rich, than in
                    spring, when it contains more serum. Probably one pint of water may generally be
                    added, one way or other, to every five or six Scotch pints of milk in the early
                    part of summer, and one to four or five in winter. A certain proportion is
                    considered indispensable, both for raising the cream and facilitating churning;
                    but it is alleged that too much is often employed, for the purpose of adding to
                    the quantity of the butter-milk. When milk is either overheated, or churned too
                    hastily, the butter is always soft, and of a white colour. From two to three
                    hours is a proper time for performing the operation of churning.</p>
                <p>In Renfrewshire, where nearly all the milk is employed in the manufacture of
                    butter and butter-milk, cows have been hired by the year at L.13 or L.14.</p>
                <p>The average yearly produce per cow of the butter-dai∙⅛ ries of England, according
                    to Mr Marshall, is three fir-p kins, of fifty-six pounds each. In
                    Buckinghamshire the∣ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> rate is higher, a cow
                    yielding five pounds per week for forty weeks, or more than three and a half
                    firkins. The annual consumption of London has been computed at 50,000 tons, or
                    two millions of firkins, which, at the rate of three firkins per co,w, is equal
                    to the butter produce of 667,000 cows. This would be in the proportion of three
                    quarters of a hundredweight to every individual in the population, which is
                    probably much above the truth; but the demands for the shipping and other
                    purposes must be very considerable.</p>
                <p>The packing, salting, and selling of butter are regulated by statutes, of which
                    the most important is the 36th Geo. III. c. 86. By these it is enacted, that
                    every vessel made for the packing of butter shall be marked with the maker’s
                    name and place of abode, and its own weight, and shall be of a size to contain
                    eighty-four pounds, called a tub, or a firkin to contain fifty-six pounds, or a
                    half firkin of twenty-eight pounds; and severe penalties are imposed for the
                    breach of these, and a variety of other regulations for the prevention of
                    fraud.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of butter leaves a large proportion of the milk applicable to
                    other purposes. When the whole milk is churned, the residuum is called
                    butter-milk, which is sold in towns at a penny per Scotch pint (about two
                    imperial quarts), and when delivered in a cleanly and pure state, it is esteemed
                    a wholesome and nutritious article of food by the labouring classes. If the
                    cream only is employed, there remains skimmed or sour milk, which in some
                    places, as in Buckinghamshire, where it is reduced by repeated skimmings for
                    cream, is given to hogs; but it is more commonly made into inferior cheese,
                    yielding whey as the last product, for the feeding of hogs.</p>

                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Cheese Dairies.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The English
                    cheeses in greatest repute are the Stilton, the Cheshire, and the Gloucester. In
                    making the first, “the night’s cream is put to the morning’s milk with the
                    runnet,” the curd is not broken, but allowed to drain gradually in a sieve, and
                    gently pressed till it becomes somewhat firm and dry; after which it is placed
                    in a box made exactly to fit it, and then bound with cloths till it acquires
                    sufficient firmness to support itself. After the cloths are removed every cheese
                    is brushed once a day for two or three months. It is not considered as ready for
                    use until it is two years old. The cheese of Cheshire and Gloucester are made of
                    the whole milkand cream, excepting that part of the cream is abstracted in the
                    single Gloucester. The runnet in general use is a pickle, prepared from the maw
                    or stomach of a calf, of which somewhat less than half an imperial pint suffices
                    for fifty gallons of milk; and when the cheese is to be coloured, an ounce of
                    Spanish arnotto will serve for an hundredweight. At the time of setting the
                    curd, the temperature of the milk, according to Mr Marshall, should be from 85°
                    to 90°, and should not, during the process, be allowed to lose more than 5° or
                    7°. When the coagulation has taken place, the curd is repeatedly broken or cut
                    with a knife, and the whey drawn off; and then, after salt has been intimately
                    mixed with it, it is packed into a vat with holes in the bottom, over which a
                    cloth has been spread, and with which it is covered up and put into the cheese
                    press. Here it usually remains the first time for two hours, after which it is
                    taken out and put into a vessel of hot whey for an hour or two to harden its
                    skin, and again, wrapped in fresh dry cloths, submitted to the action of the
                    press from time to time. In one of these intervals it is rubbed with salt,
                    sweated, and its rough edges or other projections are carefully pared away. When
                    finally removed from the press to the room where it is to be kept, which should
                    be cool and dry, it is turned at first every day, and afterwards at short
                    intervals, until it is ready for use.</p>
                <p>Besides the cheeses made in Scotland in imitation of the English kinds, Ayrshire
                    and the other western counties have long been noted for what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Dunlop cheese,</hi> of which the following account has been
                    collected from the Agricultural Reports.</p>
                <p>When such a number of cows are kept as to yield milk sufficient for a cheese of
                    tolerable size, at every milking the milk is passed through a sieve,
                    provincially termed a <hi rend="italic">milsey,</hi> to remove impurities, into
                    a boyne or vat, and formed into curd by a mixture of runnet. As milk requires to
                    be coagulated as nearly as possible at its heat when drawn from the cow, and as
                    it must cool somewhat in milking and passing through the sieve, it is necessary
                    to pour a quantity of warm water into it in the curd-vat.</p>
                <p>Where the cows on a farm are not so numerous as to give milk sufficient to make a
                    cheese every time they are milked, the milk is stored about three or four inches
                    deep in coolers, till as much is collected as will form one of a proper size.
                    When the cheese is to be made, the cream is skimmed from the milk in the
                    coolers, and, without being heated, is passed through a sieve or drainer, along
                    with the milk which is drawn from the cows at the time, into the curd-vat; and
                    the skimmed milk being heated, so as to raise the temperature of the whole mass
                    to about the heat of new milk, and also passed through the drainer, the whole is
                    coagulated by runnet, carefully mixed with the milk. The cream is put into the
                    curd-vat cold, that its oily parts may not be melted.</p>
                <p>The temperature at which the milk is kept, from the time it is drawn from the
                    cows till it is formed into cheese, ought to be carefully attended to. To make
                    it cool, and to facilitate the rising of the cream, a small quantity of cold
                    water is generally poured into each cooler. If kept much warmer than 55 degrees
                    of Fahrenheit, it will not properly cast up the cream, a thing necessary, even
                    when the whole is to be formed into cheese; and it will very soon become sour.
                    And, if it gets into a lower temperature, the milk never coagulates so well; the
                    cheese made from it is soft and inadhesive, and the whey is separated with
                    difficulty. It is not enough that the temperature be raised to the proper degree
                    when coagulated; if it has, prior to that, become too cold, the heat at setting
                    the curd will not do away the bad effects of the previous cold. It is said to be
                    owing to the milk being allowed to cool too much before it is coagulated, that
                    it becomes difficult to get it formed into cheese in winter, and that the cheese
                    made at that season is so soft and tasteless.</p>
                <p>Whenever the milk has coagulated, the whey is drawn off as fast as possible; and,
                    to facilitate its separation, the curd is minutely broken, or cut with a knife.
                    When the whey has been mostly extracted, the curd is put into a drainer, and
                    again cut and pressed, to expel it more completely. It is next broken small,
                    minutely mixed with salt, and put into the cheese-vat, with a piece of thin
                    canvass round it; and pressure is applied till the whey is wholly extracted and
                    the cheese formed. It remains the first time about an hour, and afterwards three
                    or four hours each time, in the press, getting a dry cloth, and its position
                    being reversed, every time it is replaced. Skewers are never put into the sides
                    of the cheese to extract the whey, as is common in England.</p>
                <p>Some have of late shortened the process of pressing, by placing the cheese, when
                    it comes from the press for the first time, into water heated to about 95 or 100
                    degrees, where it remains till the water falls to the heat of new milk. It is
                    then driedjvell, and again placed under the press.</p>
                <p>Salt is generally applied without measure or weight, but the proper rate is said
                    to be about half an ounce to every pound of cheese, or thirteen ounces to
                    twenty-four pounds.</p>
                <p>When the cheeses come from the press, they are exposed for about a week to a
                    considerable degree of drought, and turned over twice every twenty-four hours,
                    and afterwards laid on boards in a close cool room, and turned over twice a
                    week. The practice of sweating cheeses after they come from the press, and
                    before they are laid up to dry, which is so common in England, is not approved
                    of in Scotland, from an idea that it impoverishes the cheese, by melting part of
                    its fat.</p>
                <p>All the operations are carried on in Scotland by women. Men would think
                    themselves degraded were they to assist in milking the cows or making the
                    cheese.</p>
                <p>Besides one or two meal cheeses, in which the milk is fresh or sweet, a great
                    deal of cheese is made from milk from which cream has been taken, and which has
                    therefore been allowed to stand longer. This may be considered as a subordinate
                    branch of the butter dairy, where butter is made from cream, as is still the
                    most general practice; but the process does not require to be described, as it
                    is not materially different from that which prevails in what may be more
                    properly called a cheese dairy. Suffolk has been long noted for cheese of this
                    description. Yet the celebrated Parmesan is said to be made of milk from which
                    the cream has been taken; nor, in the process of its manufacture, as described
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Eath Papers</hi> (vol. vii.), and by Cadell in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey in Carniola</hi> (8vo, 1818), does there appear any thing
                    worthy of particular notice, unless it be that the coagulation is effected in a
                    cauldron suspended over a fire, and probably, therefore, at a higher
                    temperature. The best kind of Parmesan is that which has been kept at least
                    three years.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754968" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4968-0592"/>
                <p>The average yearly produce of cheese from the milk of a cow is, according to
                    Marshall, from three to four hundredweight, or more than double the weight of
                    butter. If four and a half quarts of milk commonly yield one pound of cheese, a
                    cow that gives two thousand quarts in a year should produce about four
                    hundredweight of cheese. It has been calculated that Cheshire alone makes no
                    less than 11,500 tons in a year.</p>
                <p>In many of the English cheese dairies, a quantity of inferior butter is obtained
                    from the whey. In some parts of Gloucestershire, and in Cheshire, this produce
                    is rated at half a pound per cow in the week, which sells at from a penny to
                    twopence a pound less than milk butter. In some instances, what is called the
                    “green whey,” or that which is taken from the cheese-tub after the curd is
                    formed, and the “white,” or that which is expressed from the curd itself, arc at
                    first treated separately, the former being heated, as soon as it has parted with
                    the curd, till it throws up a little white froth, and the latter set by till it
                    is at Ieast a day old. This last is then added to the furnacepan that contains
                    the green whey, from which mixture a substance is thrown up something in
                    appearance between cream and curd, which is constantly skimmed off as long as it
                    rises, and put into the cream mugs to be churned for butter. In the practice of
                    other dairies the white whey only seems to be used, and, after standing some
                    time in these mugs to acidulate for churning, the butter is obtained from it in
                    the same way as from milk. The green and the white whey are, in other instances,
                    both heated together, to which, if perfectly sweet, a little acid is sometimes
                    added.</p>
                <p>Whey, whether butter be made from it or not, is sometimes subjected to further
                    operations, to fit it for human food. <hi rend="italic">Fleetings,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">flit-milk,</hi> made by pouring butter-milk upon whey, is a common
                    beverage among the farm servants of Cheshire. But the purpose to which it is
                    chiefly applied is the feeding of pigs, for which it is worth about a guinea for
                    every cow. From the whey obtained from the milk of four cows, it has been
                    calculated that a hog may, in one season, and with very little other food, be
                    raised to the weight of twelve or fifteen stone.</p>
                <p>On the subject of cream, a product common to all the three classes of dairies,
                    though of greatest value in the situation proper to new milk dairies, that is,
                    in or near towns, it is only necessary to observe, that the sale of it affords a
                    ready resource whenever all the milk cannot be disposed of in a fresh state, and
                    also when, from the season of the year, or other circumstances, the manufacture
                    of cheese must be discontinued. But there is yet another branch of dairying that
                    deserves attention, namely, the fatting of calves; and this also may be, and
                    usually is, carried on, at least occasionally, at dairies of every description.
                    As milk is their chief, and in most cases their only food, its employment in
                    this way may be considered as merely another mode of preparing it for the use of
                    man.</p>
                <p>Calves are either suckled or fed from the pail. In the county of Middlesex, where
                    a great many arc fatted by the first mode, the calves are kept in pens of seven
                    or eight feet square. There are seldom more than four calves in one pen, which
                    has only one door, and that is towards the cows. Particular care is taken to
                    keep these places free from dirt of every kind, and well bedded with clean
                    straw. On one side of every pen is placed a small trough, at such a height as to
                    prevent its receiving any soil; this is always kept supplied with chalk, both in
                    lumps and in powder, not with a view to render the veal white, as some persons
                    erroneously suppose, but with the intention of preventing acidity in the
                    stomach. Without this precaution they would be liable to scour, which always
                    prevents their thriving, and sometimes occasions the death of the animal. Some
                    persons mix ground barley with the chalk, and others give them daily balls, made
                    of linseed jelly and barley-meal, to render them more fat, or fat in less time
                    than could be done with milk alone. They are suckled at precisely the same time
                    every twelve hours, generally at six o’clock. Any considerable deviation in time
                    would occasion their being fretful, and that would impede their becoming fat. In
                    about ten weeks they make the best vcal; though they are frequently continued
                    eleven or twelve weeks, with increase of weight; but in that case the joints of
                    meat become large, and the grain of the veal coarse. The large calves also sell
                    at a less price per stone than such as are of a moderate size.</p>
                <p>In the western counties of Scotland, where cheese dairies prevail, the calves are
                    fed from the pail, suckling being considered as injurious to the cows; and as
                    the cows will not readily suckle any but their own calves, a calf would thus be
                    often confined to the milk of only one cow. It is the practice there to give to
                    those that are to be reared the first drawn milk, which is thin, and abounds
                    with serum; and to such as are fatting, the last drawn milk of two, or perhaps
                    of three cows. They have no other food; and bleeding is never used with a view
                    to expedite their fattening, as in some dairies. A little bacon or mutton broth
                    is administered when a purgative is necessary; and runnet is used for an
                    opposite purpose if they begin to scour. But the ordinary management consists in
                    merely supplying them with abundance of the richest milk, after the first two or
                    three weeks, and keeping them dry, by means of plenty of litter, in a dark,
                    well-aired apartment, not exposed to the extremes of either heat or cold.</p>
                <p>The apartments required, and their arrangement, as well as the furniture and
                    implements, necessarily depend upon the extent of the dairy establishment, and
                    the main purpose for which it is carried on. In all, there should be a room for
                    the milk separate from that in which the necessary operations are performed, or
                    the produce stored up. The milking pails are of wood or tin, the latter
                    preferable, as being more easily and thoroughly cleansed. The vessels in which
                    the milk is deposited to throw up the cream, or the coolers, which are usually
                    of a circular form, may be of wood, lead, pottery, or iron; the latter, when
                    tinned within, with a plug which admits of the milk being drawn off, leaving the
                    cream behind, have been much approved of. Of churns, some are wrought like a
                    pump, called plunge churns, and others are of a barrel form, the apparatus for
                    giving the necessary agitation to the milk being worked by a handle on the
                    outside. The cheesepress. is commonly constructed of wood, and the power
                    obtained by a screw, though sometimes by a lever with weights attached. Skimming
                    dishes, and a variety of minor articles, in which there is nothing to require a
                    detailed description, will naturally suggest themselves as indispensable in the
                    management of every dairy.</p>
                <p>The operations of the dairy, in all its branches, are still conducted perhaps
                    more empirically than those of any other department of husbandry, though it
                    would appear’ that science, chemistry in particular, might be applied to
                    discover the principles and regulate the practice of the art with facility and
                    precision. We have heard it admitted, even by experienced dairymen, that the
                    quality of their cheeses differs materially in the same season, without their
                    being able to assign a reason. Every one knows how different the cheese of
                    Gloucester is from that of Cheshire, though both are made from fresh milk, the
                    produce of cows of the same breed, or rather, in both counties, of almost every
                    breed, and fed on pastures that do not exhibit any remarkable difference in
                    soil, climate, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754981"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4981-0593"/>herbage. Even in the same district, some of what
                    must appear the most important points are far from being settled in practice. Mr
                    Marshall, in his <hi rend="italic">Rural Economy of Gloucestershire,</hi> has
                    registered a number of observations on the heat of the dairy-room, and of the
                    milk, when the runnet was applied in cheese-making, on the time required for
                    coagulation, and the heat of the whey afterwards, which are curious, only
                    because they prove that no uniform rule is observed in any of these particulars.
                    The same discrepancy is observable in all the subsequent operations, till the
                    cheese is removed from the press, and even afterwards in the drying-room. Onc
                    would think the process of salting the cheeses the most simple of all; and yet
                    it is sometimes, as in the west of Scotland, mixed with the curd; in other
                    instances, poured into the milk, in a liquid state, before being coagulated; and
                    still more commonly little or none is applied till the cheeses are formed in the
                    press, and then only externally in the salting room. Our limits do not permit us
                    to describe this great diversity of practice, nor is it necessary, as it does
                    not appear which method is entitled to a preference.</p>
                <p>As the first step towards scientific improvement in the practice of the dairy, it
                    would be desirable to obtain a simple and accurate test of the quality of milk,
                    or the proportion in which its three component parts, oleaginous, caseous,
                    and-serous, are combined in every instance. By means of this, it would not only
                    be known beforehand what the produce of milk, in each of these parts, ought to
                    be under correct management; but also, by applying it to the milk of different
                    breeds, and of the same breed kept on different kinds of food, the most
                    profitable description of cows, and the most beneficial mode of feeding them,
                    according to the purpose for which their milk was to be employed, would in time
                    be determined. The changes which are understood to take place in milk during the
                    gestation of the animal, and at certain intervals from the period of its
                    parturition, and such also as depend upon its age, might perhaps be detected by
                    the habitual employment of such an instrument.</p>
                <p>The importance of a test of this kind has not escaped the attention of ingenious
                    men. Mr Dicas, a mathematical instrument-maker in Liverpool, and well known by
                    his invention for trying the strength of spirituous liquors and worts, many
                    years ago constructed what has been called a lactometer, an instrument for
                    ascertaining “the richness of milk from its specific gravity, compared with
                    water, by its degree of warmth taken by a thermometer, on comparing its specific
                    gravity with its warmth.” “If the principle be right,” says the author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lancashire Report,</hi> “by this maybe discovered not only the
                    qualities of the milk of different cows, pastures, foods, as turnips, potatoes,
                    grains, &amp;c. but also probably which may be the best milk, or best pastures
                    for butter, and which for cheese.” Another invention for the same purpose came
                    under the notice of the Highland Society of Scotland in June 1816, in a Report
                    from a committee of their number, prepared by Dr Hope, professor of chemistry in
                    the University of Edinburgh. The subject of it was the patent aerometric beads,
                    invented by Mrs Lovi of this city. The committee were of opinion that these
                    beads might be introduced into the dairy with a reasonable prospect of practical
                    utility. The importance of such a test, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
                    one that would immediately indicate the quality of the milk, arising from the
                    different specific gravities of its parts, and also the mode of using these
                    beads, may be seen from the following observations of the committee:</p>
                <p>“Were milk a liquor, the value of which, as of many other fluids, is indicated by
                    its specific gravity, the application of the beads would be simple, and their
                    testimony immediate. This, however, is not the case. Milk is a compound fluid,
                    consisting in a great measure of water, and owing its valuable qualities
                    principally to the curd and butter which it-contains. The richest milk abounds
                    in oil and curd, and the poorest in water. As the oil is lighter than water, and
                    the curd heavier, the quantity of these ingredients is not indicated by the
                    specific gravity; for were these substances in milk in certain proportions, they
                    would not affect the specific gravity of the fluid, however large the quantity
                    of them might be, the one counteracting the other.</p>
                <p>“Milk possesses a specific gravity greater than that of water, which it derives
                    in part from the saccharo-saline nìatters belonging to the whey, and in part
                    from the curd; and it approaches more nearly the specific gravity of water, the
                    greater quantity of water it has, or the greater the proportion of cream. Hence
                    a low specific gravity indicates either much richness or great poverty; and,
                    consequently, the gravity of this fluid is not an immediate indication of its
                    quality. The information given by the beads will, however, be valuable, if the
                    specific gravity be examined after the cream is removed, as well as before.</p>
                <p>“When milk is tried as soon as it cools, say to 60°, and again after it has been
                    thoroughly skimmed, it will be found that the skiinmed milk is of considerably
                    greater gravity; and as this increase depends upon the separation of the lighter
                    cream, the amount of the increase, or the difference between the specific
                    gravity of the fresh and skimmed milk, will bear proportion to, and may be
                    employed as a measure of, the relative quantities of the oily matter or butter
                    contained in different milks. In this manner, therefore, by discovering by these
                    beads the difference in the specific gravity of milk when new, and after being
                    skimmed, the relative values of this liquor for giving butter may be certainly
                    and easily determined.</p>
                <p>“The committee conceive that it would be of much importance to ascertain, by
                    carefully-conducted experiments, the exact quantity of butter furnished by a
                    given measure of milk of different degrees of richness, the specific gravities
                    of which have been examined before and after the separation of the cream. By
                    such experiments, the quantity of butter corresponding to each degree of change
                    in the specific gravity may be determined; and then the aerometric beads will
                    serve to indicate, not only' the relative qualities of different milks, for the
                    purpose of butter-making, but also the actual quantity of butter that any given
                    quantity of milk ought to afford.</p>
                <p>“That such information may prove of consequence in regulating the business of the
                    dairy, is too obvious to require illustration.</p>
                <p>“The specific gravity of skimmed milk depends both on the quantity of the
                    saccharo-saline matters and of the curd. To estimate the relative quantities of
                    curd, and by that determine the value of milk, for the purpose of yielding
                    cheese, it is only required to curdle the skim milk, and ascertain the specific
                    gravity of the whey. The whey will, of course, be found of lower specific
                    gravity than the skimmed milk; and the number of degrees of difference affords a
                    measure of the relative quantities of the curd.</p>
                <p>“By a proper series of experiments, the quantity of cheese equivalent to each
                    degree of the diminution of gravity in a given measure of this fluid, might be
                    determined.</p>
                <p>“Hence it appears to your committee, that the aerometric beads may be employed to
                    explore the quality of milk, in relation both to the manufacture of butter and
                    cheese; and your committee beg leave to direct the attention of the society to
                    this subject.”</p>
