                    rend="smallcaps">Dantzig</hi></label>, one of the provincial governments of West
                    Prussia. It is bounded by Königsberg'on the east, by Marienwerder on the south,
                    by Koslin on the west, and by the Baltic on the north. It extends over 3322
                    square miles, or 2,126,000 English acres. It comprehends eleven cities, seven
                    market-towns, and 1856 villages and hamlets. The inhabitants amounted in the
                    year 1817 to 237,323, and in 1826 to 316,340. At the first period the
                    Protestants were 142,041, the Catholics 97,530, the Menonites 9122, and the
                    remainder Jews. It is a level country, with rather a sandy soil; but near the
                    Vistula the soil is excellent, and produces abundant crops of wheat, rye,
                    barley, and oats. On the meadows many oxen are fattened, and on the uplands
                    numerous flocks of sheep are grazed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dantzick,</hi> a city, the capital of the government of that
                    name in the province of West Prussia. It was an independent city, one of the
                    Hans Towns, in ancient times, but under the protection of the kings of Poland.
                    After the division of that country, Dantzick became subject to Prussia, and was
                    united to it in 1793. It is a fortified city, rendered strong by its narrow
                    front, covered by powerful batteries on the rising grounds which extend across
                    it, and by the broad stream of the Vistula and its extensive marshes. It has
                    been twice taken during the late war, but both times by famine rather than by
                    the military assailants. The city, with its suburbs, contains 45,450
                    inhabitants, almost all of whom are engaged in commerce. The chief trade is in
                    corn, which is brought down the Vistula from the Polish and Prussian districts
                    on both sides of the stream. It is conveyed in open barges, landed near the
                    city, and exposed to the sun and air till it is perfectly dry, when it is stored
                    in vast magazines denominated <hi rend="italic">Speicher,</hi> till it is
                    required for distant markets. There is also a considerable trade carried on in
                    timber, which is also floated down from Poland. The city has been of long
                    existence, and many of the houses exhibit the fashion of antiquity. There are
                    appropriate institutions for education, for the poor, and for the sick. The
                    manufactures are numerous, but all on a small scale, and chiefly for the supply
                    of the city and its vicinity. The haven admits only vessels of small burden, or
                    very flat bottoms. Long. 18. 33. 40. E. Lat. 54. 21. 5. N.</p>
