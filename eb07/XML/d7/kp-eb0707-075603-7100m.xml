                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dialling,</hi> sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gnomonics,</hi> is a branch of the mixed mathematics, which treats of the
                    construction of sun-dials. Its foundation is the astronomical theory of the
                    sun’s apparent motions; and from these its rules and operations have been
                    deduced by the aid of geometry and trigonometry.</p>
                <p>It may be supposed that in the early ages men would be satisfied with the
                    divisions of the day marked by the rising and setting of the sun, and his
                    greatest elevation above the horizon. When the gnomon, an upright pillar, the
                    first of all astronomical instruments, had been applied to astronomy, the
                    angular motion of iţs shadow might suggest that it was applicable to the
                    division of the day.</p>
                <p>The earliest mention that is made of a sun-dial is in the Bible. We read in the
                    thirty-second chapter of Second Chronicles, that when Hezekiah was sick, he
                    prayed to the Lord, and “He gave him a sign what that sign was is particularly
                    told in Isaiah, chap, xxxviii. verse 8, “Behold I will bring again the shadow of
                    the degrees which is gone down in the <hi rend="italic">sun-dial</hi> of Ahaz
                    ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was
                    gone down.” This was about 700 years before the Christian era.</p>
                <p>The Chaldeans, among the earliest astronomers, as well as the other nations of
                    Asia, divided the day into sixty parts. They had also a division of the day into
                    twelve hours. The earliest of all sun-dials of which we have any certain
                    knowledge was the <hi rend="italic">Hemicycle</hi> or Hemisphere of their
                    astronomer Berosus, who probably lived about 540 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> This was the most simple and natural of all sun-dials, and therefore
                    must have preceded the others. It has been the most generally used, but it could
                    never be of any considerable dimensions, and was not susceptible of much
                    accuracy. It, however, required no mathematical theory for its construction; a
                    distinct notion of the spherical motion of the heavens was sufficient. To
                    understand this dial, let us suppose a concave hemisphere, placed horizontally
                    in an open place, with the concavity turned towards the zenith, and let a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194757113" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7113-0757"/> globule be
                    suspended or fixed in any way at its centre; when the sun’s centre rises above
                    the horizon the shadow of the globule will enter the hemisphere, and throughout
                    the day the shadow will trace on its inside the sun’s diurnal parallel. Now, let
                    the lines described by the shadow on the solstitial and equinoctial days be
                    traced on the inside of the sphere, and also on as many intermediate days as may
                    be, but in fact the tropical paths of the shadow will be sufficient; let each of
                    these be divided into twelve equal parts, and let curve lines be drawn through
                    corresponding points of division. These will be sensibly great circles on the
                    inside of the hemisphere, and will two and two converge towards points in the
                    meridian more or less distant. Here then is a sun-dial which will divide the
                    period between sunrise and sunset into twelve portions, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >temporary hours.</hi> The hours indicated by this dial were from its nature
                    unequal, and varied from day to day. This defect, however, was not of much
                    consequence when there were no machines for dividing time: a knowledge of
                    geometry would have served to construct the dial so as to divide time equally,
                    but at that remote period geometry was not known as a science.</p>
                <p>The difference between the equinoctial hours, which were equal, and the unequal
                    temporary hours, might not be at first observed, or migh t have been disregarded
                    by a people who inhabited a climate where the elevation of the pole was small,
                    and who, besides, attended only to the rising and setting of the sun, and, it
                    may be, his passing the meridian, which at all times divided the day into parts
                    nearly equal. They probably first divided each half of the day, as well as they
                    could by estimation, into three equal parts, and these again each into two. The
                    dial of Berosus, although imperfect, was a great step towards improvement in the
                    division of time, and was not at variance with the conjectural divisions,
                    because in both ways the twelve hours had the same bounding limits, the rising
                    and setting of the sun.</p>
                <p>It would have been easy to have passed from the temporary to equal hours, which
                    were marked by equal arcs on the equator; it was only necessary to describe
                    semicircles through these points of division which should cut each other in the
                    poles of the world: these would have divided the parallels into arcs of fifteen
                    degrees each: by carrying the divisions into fifteen degrees upon the summer
                    tropic from the six o’clock hour circle to sunrise and sunset, there would have
                    been got the excess of the longest above the equinoctial day. Thus a more exact
                    notion of the length of the day and night at all seasons would have been
                    obtained. But this would have appeared a great innovation, and not likely to
                    have been adopted: every one knows how obstinate the common people are in
                    adhering to old habits. Accordingly the construction of Berosus descended beyond
                    the time of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. We find it in the year 900 among the
                    Arabians, who followed it in the construction of their dials, as appears from
                    the work of Albategnius; and it is only since the invention of mechanical
                    instruments for dividing time that it has altogether disappeared.</p>
                <p>It is doubtful whether the Chaldeans had any mathematical theory for their dial,
                    although it was of great simplicity. The facility, however, of its construction
                    has probably made it the best known. Four have, in modern times, been recovered
                    in Italy. One was discovered in the year 1746, at Tivoli. It has been supposed
                    that this belonged to Cicero, who in one of his letters says that he had sent a
                    dial of this kind to his villa near Tusculum. P. Zuzzeri, a Jesuit, has made
                    this dial the subject of a memoir published at Venice. The second and third were
                    found in 1751; one at Castel-Nuovo, and the other at Rignano; and a fourth was
                    found in 1762 at Pompeii. It differs from the others in respect that the tropics
                    are not expressly marked, and the equator alone is seen. G. H. Martini, the
                    author of a dissertation, in the German language, on the Dials of the Ancients,
                    supposes this last to be the oldest of the four, and that it is probably the
                    primitive dial, such as was known to Berosus. Delambre, however, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomie Ancienne,</hi> expresses himself of a contrary opinion, because it
                    was more difficult to construct such a dial without than with the tropics.
                    Martini says that the dial was made for the latitude of Memphis; it may
                    therefore be the work of Egyptians, if it was not constructed in the school of
                    Alexandria. It may be ascribed to the Egyptians, however, without attributing to
                    them much knowledge in geometry; a terrestrial globe, on which were traced the
                    equator and tropics, divided into degrees, and with its pole elevated to the
                    latitude of the place, was all that was necessary. This being cut into two
                    hemispheres horizontally, and great circles traced through the corresponding
                    points of the two tropics, would furnish two convex models of the dial, from
                    which any number of concave ones might easily be formed. The convex spherical
                    model might even have had the parts cut away which were not to be shown on the
                    concavity, and thus the construction of the dial might be a purely manual
                    operation performed by an artist.</p>
                <p>When the first dial was constructed, it was easy from that to make others. Thus,
                    by the side of a Chaldean dial let a plane be fixed in any position, with a
                    perpendicular gnomon; mark on the plane the position of the top of the shadow
                    from hour to hour on the solstitial and equinoctial days, and join the
                    corresponding horary points by lines, and it will appear that the three
                    analogous points are always in a straight line; and thus there might be formed,
                    without any theory, temporary dials of all kinds.</p>
                <p>It may be supposed that every nation that cultivated astronomy had found means to
                    divide time. It appears that the Egyptians had found in the heavens the means of
                    attaining this object, but no sun-dial has been found among the antiquities of
                    Egypt, and their sculptures give no indication of any having existed; they may,
                    however, be buried in the sands, or overwhelmed in the midst of the vast ruins
                    of their cities. It has been supposed that the numerous obelisks found
                    everywhere in Egypt were erected in honour of the sun, and’employed as gnomons.
                    The famous circle of Osymandias might have determined the azimuths of the
                    heavenly bodies, and thus have given the hours of the day or night.</p>
                <p>Herodotus has recorded that the Greeks derived from the Babylonians the use of
                    the pole and of the gnomon, and the division of the day into twelve parts: the
                    pole was an instrument that showed the hour of the day. The Greeks by their
                    geometry were in full possession of the means of constructing dials; and the
                    Syntaxis of Ptolemy treats of their construction by means of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Analemma,</hi> an instrument by which the various problems of
                    astronomy might be resolved.</p>
                <p>The dials of the ancients marked the hour of the day by the shadow of a gnomon,
                    but they had neither centres nor axes, and in some respects this was an
                    advantage. The nature of their hours, which varied with the season, made it
                    necessary to give such directions to the horary lines as prevented them from
                    meeting in a point; they therefore were satisfied with finding the position of
                    three points in each, although two would have been sufficient, for the lines
                    were sensibly straight in all plane dials; the diurnal paths of the extremity of
                    the shadow were hyperbolas, which intersected the horizon in the points of
                    rising and setting, and of these there might be any number, but in general they
                    were limited to the arcs of Cancer and Capricon; the line for Aries and Libra
                    was always straight, and furnished a middle point in the hour line.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194757126" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7126-0758"/>
                <p>The constructions given by Ptolemy were sufficient for regular dials, the only
                    ones he treats of. It is certain, however, that the ancients constructed
                    vertical declining dials, for eight are yet in existence on the Tower of the
                    Winds at Athens. Probably a part of the book of the Analemma is now lost,
                    otherwise it would be remarkable that after Ptolemy had announced, in
                    commencing, that he proposed to facilitate the construction of dials, he should
                    not say a single word on the applications which may be made of his obscure
                    methods and graphical operations, the object of which can hardly be seen, or the
                    principles understood.</p>
                <p>The ancient hours were called <hi rend="italic">hectemoria</hi> by the Greeks,
                    because they were sixth parts of the semidiurnal arc. It does not appear that
                    the nature of the hectemorial hour lines was ever considered by the ancients;
                    indeed, practically, their precise nature was of little importance to them, and
                    of no use in tracing their dials. On the sphere, when the pole is not
                    considerably elevated, the lines which divide the semidiurnal arcs into equal
                    parts differ not much in appearance from arcs of great circles, as has already
                    been remarked; and that they are not exactly so was first suggested by Clavius.
                    Delambre has treated of them in his <hi rend="italic">History of Astronomy,</hi>
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Connoissance des Temps</hi> for 1820. Mr Cadell has
                    treated the subject at considerable length in the eighth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,</hi> and, again,
                    Mr Davis in the twelfth volume of the same work.</p>
                <p>The most interesting monument of ancient gnomonics is the Tower of the Winds,
                    which is yet in existence, and is figured and described by Stuart in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens.</hi> This is a regular octagon, on the
                    faces of which the eight principal winds are represented, and over them are
                    eight different dials; four regular, viz. east, west, north, and south; the
                    other four have the intermediate directions. Vitruvius has described the Tower
                    in the sixth chapter of his first book; but he has not said any thing of the
                    dials. This is remarkable, because he has described all the dials known in his
                    time, and these are in every way more important than those of which he has
                    mentioned the inventors. His silence gives reason to believe that the dials on
                    the Tower have been an after thought, and are of a date later than his time, and
                    much posterior to that of Andronicus Cyrresthes, author of the monument. It is
                    impossible to say any thing with precision as to the time when these eight dials
                    were erected. From the impaired purity of style in the architecture of the
                    Tower, it has been judged to be later than the time of Pericles and Anaxagoras.
                    In their day the science of gnomonics was too little advanced to have served for
                    the construction of the dials; however, as far as mathematical science was
                    required, they might have been made in the time of Hipparchus, or later. It is
                    certain they must have required a science of gnomonics, and therefore a
                    trigonometry, unless they were made empirically by the help of the concave
                    hemisphere of Berosus.</p>
                <p>These dials, as described by Stuart, have the forms of those in the commentary
                    given by Commandine on the Analemma of Ptolemy; everywhere the style is wanting,
                    but the hole in which it had been inserted is visible in the marble. Its vertex
                    is rarely in the axis of the hole, even in the regular dials, which are four in
                    number. However, the height and the foot of the style are not indispensable
                    data; they may be discovered from the principal dimensions of the dial. By a
                    careful examination, Delambre ascertained that the south dial, the most
                    important, was remarkably accurate, and that the height of the style was ten
                    and*a half English inches. The hours are not numbered, but they are temporary,
                    and reckoned from sunrise to noon, and thence to sunset. The north dial is but a
                    supplement of the south, on the same scale, and with the same style. There
                    appear only two evening and two morning lines; and these, instead of being
                    horary, are truly azimuthal; they only indicate the direction of the shadow. Two
                    of these four lines are even a little too long, because that, instead of the
                    hyperbolic arc, which should limit them, a straight line has been drawn. These
                    slight defects are of no real importance.</p>
                <p>The east dial is as exact as the south. It is very narrow, although it has a
                    style double the length, almost nineteen and a fifth inches. The south-east
                    presents the same agreement in all its parts. The height of the style is about
                    twenty-five and a half inches. The inclination of the equinoctial to the
                    horizontal line is 42° 40 ’, such as calculation makes it.</p>
                <p>The north-east dial does not appear to have been traced with so much care, or at
                    least success; the style is only about six and a half inches. The horary lines,
                    three in number, are very oblique. The artist, however, may be excused, because
                    the least error in the graphical operations might alter sensibly their length.
                    Besides, this dial is the least important of them all; there is nothing which
                    cannot be determined with more certainty on some one of the neighbouring dials.
                    The three remaining dials, viz. the southwest, the west, and the north-west, are
                    merely the counterparts of their opposite, and have not been figured in Stuart’s
                    book. The whole give the same general view of the ancient gnomonics as had been
                    previously acquired by an examination of a dial found at Delos, and described by
                    Delambre in the class of mathematical sciences of the Institute for 1814. They
                    are however larger and better executed than that dial, and in their original
                    position. Altogether they form the most complete monument of the practical
                    gnomonics of the ancients.</p>
                <p>There is another remarkable combination of dials in Athens, known by the name of
                    the dials of Phaedrus. They are four in number, and are traced on the same block
                    of pentelique marble. It bears the following inscription: <hi rend="italic"
                    >φαιfyος</hi> ζω∕λoυ <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> rα∕αw≡ui <hi rend="italic"
                    >wann.</hi> From the form of the letters, Μ. Visconti, who communicated the
                    designs of these dials to Delambre, has inferred that the monument may be of the
                    second or third century of our era. Dclambre described and carefully verified
                    all the parts of these dials <hi rend="italic">(Hist, de l’Astron. An.</hi> vol.
                    ii.), and everywhere he found, if not all the conformity which he desired, at
                    least as much as he could expect. The dials by themselves confirm what is
                    manifest from those on the 'Tower of the Winds, that the Greeks had geometrical
                    methods for vertical,’and also for declining dials. To the ancient dials which
                    have been here noticed we may add a singular one found at Portici in 1755, and
                    described by the academicians of Naples. It has the figure of a bacon ham, and,
                    like all the others, shows temporary hours. The theory of this dial is simple,
                    but, considering the imperfect trigonometry of the Greeks, its construction by
                    calculation might be laborious; probably it was made by the simple process,
                    already described, from the Chaldean dial. The epoch of this dial is not known,
                    nor is any dial of this kind noticed by Vitruvius, to whom we owe all the
                    knowledge we have of other ancient dials. Vitruvius has attributed to Berosus
                    the hemicycle hollowed in a square cut according to the inclination of the place
                    (a description which Delambre says is incorrect). He has added, that Aristarchus
                    of Samos invented the horologium called <hi rend="italic">scaphe</hi> (boat), or
                    the <hi rend="italic">hemisphere.</hi> This may have been the hemisphere of
                    Berosus which Aristarchus taught the Greeks. He attributes also to him the <hi
                    rend="italic">dish in a plane.</hi> This may have been an equinoctial or a
                    horizontal dial; these the Greeks could execute graphically without calculation.
                    Vitruvius gives precepts for the construction of this dial, which are not,
                    however, very intelligible now. He goes on to say, that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194757139" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7139-0759"/>the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aranea</hi> is due to Eudoxus, or, according to others, to Apollonius. This
                    appears to have been a horizontal dial, on which circles of altitude were
                    traced. Scopas of Syracuse invented the <hi rend="italic">plinth</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lambris,</hi> and he assigns to Parmenion the invention of an
                    universal dial; and he goes on to speak of many others, the nature of which can
                    only now be guessed. He indicates dials of suspension intended for travellers;
                    these may have been like our ring-dials, but he does not explain them
                    particularly. In concluding, he says that, <hi rend="italic">to comprehend the
                    theory of dials,</hi> it was necessary to know that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analemma.</hi></p>
                <p>The first sun-dial erected at Rome was in the year 290 B. c. Papirius Cursor had
                    taken it from the Samnites. In 261 B. c. Valerius Messala placed in the forum a
                    dial which he had taken at Catania, the latitude of which is five degrees less
                    than that of Rome. In 164, Q. Marcius Philippus caused the first dial to be
                    constructed; it was probably the work of a foreign artist, for no Roman has
                    written any thing on gnomonics. We have seen that the dial found at Pompeia was
                    made for the latitude of Memphis, consequently it was less adapted to its
                    position than that of Catania was to Rome. These facts prove that mathematical
                    knowledge was not cultivated at Rome or in Italy.</p>
                <p>It appears that sun-dials had been common in the days of Plautus. In a fragment
                    of one of his comedies ( 7½e <hi rend="italic">Boeotian)</hi> preserved by Aulus
                    Gellius in his <hi rend="italic">Attic Eights,</hi> he makes a parasite declaim
                    against sun-dials in these terms:</p>
                <p>Ut ilium di perdant, primus qui horas repperit, Quique adeo primus statuit hic
                    solarium. Qui mihi comminuit misero articulatim diem, Nam me puero uterus erat
                    solarium Multo omnium istorum et verissimum, Ubi iste monebat esse, nisi quum
                    nihil erat. Nunc etiam quod est, non est, nisi Soli lubet. Itaque adeo jam
                    oppletum est oppidum solariis. Major pars populi aridi raptant fame.</p>
                <p>The gods confound the man who first found out How to distinguish hours! Confound
                    him, too, Who in this place set up a sun-dial, To cut and hack my days so
                    wretchedly Into small portions. When I was a boy, My belly was my sun-dial; one
                    more sure, Truer, and more exact than any of them. This dial told me when <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> twas proper time To go to dinner, when I had aught to
                    eat. But now-a-days, why, even when I have, I can’t fall-to unless the sun give
                    leave. The town’s so full of these confounded dials, The greatest part of its
                    inhabitants, Shrunk up with hunger, creep along the streets. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Translation of Plautus by Thornton and Warner.</hi></p>
                <p>The Arabians, as they drew their knowledge of astronomy from the Greeks, so they
                    also adopted their system of gnomonics without any material alteration. They
                    studied the Analemma of Ptolemy, and found means of simplifying and diversifying
                    his solutions. No nation attached more importance to gnomonics. Indeed, when
                    there was no other way of knowing the hours, dials were in great request,
                    particularly in southern climes; for in northern countries the shortness of the
                    day for a great part of the year, and the uncertainty of sunshine, diminished
                    much their utility. Abul-Hassan, who lived about the beginning of the thirteenth
                    century, and one of their most modern writers, introduced among them equal
                    hours, and taught how to trace them on dials; but he made but little use of
                    them, and it does not appear that his invention was supported. He was also the
                    author of a new way of describing the arcs of parallels. He invented a dial
                    called <hi rend="italic">hhaphir,</hi> a word which means the hoof of a horse;
                    the Greeks had no such dial. He made various others, to which particular names
                    were given. He taught how to trace the progress of the shadow on plane,
                    cylindrical, conic, and spherical surfaces. The Greeks, however, had preceded
                    him in the construction of dials on conic surfaces.</p>
                <p>The writings of Abul-Hassan present a theory not to be found in the gnomonics of
                    the Greeks, or any other Arabian writer, or in that of the moderns. He employed
                    the properties of the conic sections to describe the arc of signs. It is true,
                    Commandine and Clavius have also traced their arcs of signs by means deduced
                    from the theory of these curves; but their mode of proceeding, very obscure, is
                    not that of the Arabian. We do not find among them the universal dial of
                    Regiomontanus, nor the analemmatic dials, which give the hour by the sun’s
                    altitude; nor had they any idea of the angles at the centre of different dials.
                    We find these angles and different other novelties in the first European authors
                    who have written on gnomonics; but these geometers do not say that they were the
                    inventors of these happy innovations. There is therefore in the history of
                    gnomonics a blank which cannot now be filled up. We see a marked progress,
                    without knowing precisely to whom we owe the obligation. These discoveries
                    probably preceded the invention of printing. The original works are lost, but
                    tradition has handed down to us what was most useful in them. The oldest of
                    these writers, Munster and Schoner, have affected to imitate the Arabs, in
                    suppressing all demonstrations, as had been done by Albategnius and Ebn-Jounis.
                    They have given constructions resting on principles nowhere demonstrated, and
                    hence has arisen an obscurity not easily to be dissipated.</p>
                <p>Among the first of the moderns who have treated of gnomonics may be reckoned John
                    Stabius, Andrew Stri-borius, and John Werner, astronomers of the fifteenth
                    century. Their works however have never been printed. To these may be added John
                    Schoner, an astronomer of the sixteenth century, who gave in 1515 a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Horarii cylindri</hi><hi rend="italic">Canones,</hi>
                    in which he treats of the construction of cylindrical dials. His other works on
                    dialling were afterwards published by Andrew Schoner, his son. Some notions on
                    modern gnomonics were given in a treatise on the Roman calendar, printed in
                    1518. This writer treats of a general horary square, after Regiomontanus, which
                    supposes equal hours; so that these appear to have been established in the
                    middle of the fifteenth century, and probably earlier. It appears from Stoffier,
                    that in his time a new system of gnomonics had been formed, the author of which
                    however is unknown.</p>
                <p>Sebastian Munster, a cordelier, who had embraced the opinions of Luther,
                    published at Basle, in 1531, a work with this title, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compositio Horologiorum</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">plano
                    muro, truncis, anulo concave cylindro, et variis quadrantibus,</hi> &amp;c.; and
                    again, in 1533, <hi rend="italic">Horologiographia post priorem editionem.</hi>
                    The author was born at Ingelheim in 1489, and died of the plague at Basle in
                    1532. He employs equinoctial hours, and supposes great circles to pass through
                    the pole of the world perpendicular to the equator, dividing it into twenty-four
                    equal parts. A plane which cuts all these circles shows the hours by its
                    intersection with the different planes. Here then is a complete revolution in
                    the theory of dialling; and doubtless the change had subsisted for some time;
                    for he speaks with contempt of these vulgar constructors who, without any
                    theory, blindly followed the rules and tables which had been given to them. It
                    is very remarkable that so total a change should have taken place without the
                    author being known; and not less so that the first author who printed a book on
                    gnomonics should have given all his precepts without demonstration. Equinoctial
                    hours were now substituted for temporary hours, a centre was given to the dial,
                    an axis was substituted for the perpendicular style; centres and dividing <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194757152" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7152-0760"/> radii were now
                    introduced; all these changes could only have been made by a skilful geometer.
                    Among the inventions of Munster was a moon-dial. It is not certain that he was
                    the author of all the inventions which he describes, but at any rate he was the
                    first to publish them.</p>
                <p>The next writer to be noticed was Andrew Schoner. His book has the date 1562,
                    with this title: <hi rend="italic">Gnomonice Andreae Schοneri Noribergensis,
                    hoc</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >descriptionibus horologiorum</hi><hi rend="italic">sciatericoum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">omnis</hi><hi rend="italic">generis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">omnia reccns</hi><hi rend="italic">nata et edita.</hi> By the
                    concluding words, the author seems to assert that all contained in his book was
                    his own invention. This, however, could not be true of any thing contained also
                    in the first or second edition of Munster’s book, which preceded his by
                    twenty-nine years. Schoner speaks of many learned men that had gone before him
                    in the same science, and regrets that their labours were unknown. He cites
                    Regiomontanus and others, but he does not name Munster. He was an enthusiast on
                    his particular subject, and affirmed that dials could no more be dispensed with
                    than meat and drink. He was an obscure writer, and communicated nothing new,
                    unless in treating of inclining-declining dials, of which no mention is made by
                    Munster, nor among the ancients. In the same century there came out other
                    treatises on dialling, as by Benedict in 1574, Elie Vinet in 1564, John of Padua
                    in 1582, and Valentino Pini in 1598. These do not seem to have added much to
                    what was previously known.</p>
                <p>In the following century we have a work on dialling by an astronomer, La Hire.
                    The first edition came out in 1682, another in 1698. Montucla pronounces this
                    book obscure, and Delambre agrees in his opinion; for La Hire merely indicates
                    his demonstrations, and his constructions are so complicated that they are with
                    difficulty understood. He never employs calculation, unless indeed in an
                    appendix, which might be left out, without altering the character of the work.
                    All his operations may be performed without any idea of even plane trigonometry.
                    He employs only compasses, the rule, and the plumb-line. A dial may be traced by
                    his directions, without knowing whether it be horizontal, vertical, east, west,
                    declining, or inclining, and without the latitude of the place or the sun’s
                    declination being know n. This plan is not the best for practice; but it was
                    new, and therefore remarkable and deserv-ingof notice. His constructions are
                    often ingenious; but they have the essential fault of not admitting of much
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>There is a treatise on gnomonics by Ozanam, of date1693. It also forms a part of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi rend="italic">de Mathématiques,</hi> printed
                    in 1697. This, in the opinion of Delambre, is a perspicuous work, and much
                    superior for practice to that of La Hire.</p>
                <p>The subject of dialling was greatly agitated in the course of the seventeenth
                    century by all writers on astronomy. Thus a quarto volume of 800 pages, entirely
                    on gnomonics, forms a part of the works of Clavius, printed in 1612. This may be
                    supposed to contain all that was known before his time, as well as his own
                    inventions. In this work he has demonstrated both the theory and practice, after
                    the manner of the ancient mathematicians.</p>
                <p>The eighteenth century produced some writers on dialling; but clocks and watches
                    had by this time superseded sun-dials: their theory was well known and explained
                    in all works on astronomy. The art of constructing them was now considered as a
                    mathematical recreation. At this point we shall conclude their history.</p>

                    Dialling.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The theory of dialling, to be fully understood, requires an acquaintance with
                    some of the more simple doctrines of astronomy; also of the elements of geometry
                    and plane and spherical trigonometry. However, a less extensive knowledge of
                    pure mathematics will be sufficient for the construction of the more simple and
                    common dials. A correct notion of the nature of an angle, and a knowledge of the
                    elementary problems of practical geometry, viz. the drawing of parallels,
                    perpendiculars, &amp;c., and how to make an angle of any proposed number of
                    degrees, also to measure an angle, will suffice for the mere geometrical
                    construction of dials. The instruments required are compasses, a scale of
                    chords, or a protractor for measuring angles, and a straight-edged rule. A globe
                    is useful in giving distinct notions of the doctrine of the sphere, but may be
                    dispensed with in the practice of dialling. A dialling scale íàcilitates the
                    practice; and therefore instructions will be given by which it may be
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>2. The preliminary astronomical knowledge has been delivered in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Astronomy. To</hi> avoid repetition, we must direct the
                    attention of the reader to that article. He will find it in the first and second
                    chapters of the Second Part; but it is only the definition of the circles of the
                    sphere, and the description of the apparent motions, to which w e shall have
                    occasion to refer.</p>
                <p>3. The apparent diurnal motion of the starry heavens is perfectly uniform. The
                    sun’s apparent diurnal motion about the earth’s axis, however, deviates a little
                    from perfect equality, by reason of his unequal angular motion in the ecliptic,
                    and its obliquity to the equator; but these need not be attended to in the
                    construction of a sun-dial. Their joint effect produces <hi rend="italic">the
                    equation of time,</hi> a correction which must always be applied to the time it
                    indicates. We have given a table of its quantity for every day in the year at
                    the end. Atmospheric refraction likewise might be taken into account, but in
                    practice it is neglected. The construction of a dial is a graphical operation,
                    subject to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194757165" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7165-0761"/>the
                    imperfection of instruments and their application. The object in view is a
                    practical method of finding a measure of time for the ordinary affairs of life;
                    and for this, extreme accuracy is not required.</p>
                <p>4. The mean distance of the earth from the sun is 23,984 times its semidiameter.
                    Hence we may infer that all the phenomena of the solar motions, as seen from any
                    part of the earth’s surface, will be almost exactly the same as if they were
                    seen from its centre, the difference being inappreciable by the nicest
                    instrument; just as the apparent position of a spire or other object four miles
                    distant, in respect of neighbouring objects, will not be in the least altered by
                    a change of a foot in the position of the eye to either side of the point from
                    which the object was first viewed. Hence it follows, that if we place in
                    sunshine a globe on which the circles of the sphere are delineated, or, instead
                    of a globe, a skeleton sphere, such as is represented in fig. 1 and 2 of Plate
                    CLXXXV. formed of twenty-four equal wire circles, which all pass through the
                    extremities of a common diameter <hi rend="italic">Pp,</hi> formed of some solid
                    matter; and if these circles, in radiating from their intersections P, <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> make equal angles round these points, just as the
                    meridians do on the common terrestrial globe; then, if the axis Ppbe placed
                    parallel to the earth’s axis; the shadow projected by the axis will fall on the
                    wires one after another at intervals of an hour, because the apparent angular
                    motion of the sun about the axis Pp will be uniform, just as it is about the
                    imaginary axis of the earth.</p>
                <p>This very simple instrument, if correctly made, and placed in a fixed position,
                    with its axis directed to the pole of the world, which is near the pole star,
                    and, moreover, with one of its circles in the plane of the meridian (that is, in
                    a direction due north and south), would serve to divide the day into twenty-four
                    equal portions. This is the most natural and elementary of all dials.</p>
                <p>5. We have supposed our dial to be composed entirely of wires or material
                    circles; and although the hour of the day will be known if the shadow of the
                    axis be observed to fall on one of the circles, there will be an uncertainty as
                    to the exact time when the shadow is passing between two circles. To remedy
                    this, let us suppose that a plane ABCD, fig. 1, or AFCG, fig. 2, of some solid
                    matter, is placed within the sphere, and passes through E its centre. The shadow
                    of the axis PE will now be projected on this plane surface, and will be seen at
                    all times in its progress from wire to wire. If now straight lines be drawn from
                    the centre E to the points in which the plane DAB meets the wire circles, and
                    the hours be marked on them as in the figures, it will be noon when the shadow
                    falls along the line E XII., and eleven in the forenoon when it falls on Ľ XI.,
                    and one in the afternoon when it falls on E I., and so on throughout the day. As
                    the shadow on the plane will always be visible, any time intermediate between
                    two hours may be guessed at nearly by the position of the shadow in respect to
                    the lines on which it falls at the preceding and following hours.</p>
                <p>6. It is evident that the plane BAD may have any position whatever within the
                    sphere; the dial will still indicate the hours, supposing always that the axis
                    <hi rend="italic">Pp</hi> is directed towards the north and south poles of the
                    heavens. We may assume that the plane DAB is horizontal; then the lines drawn on
                    the plane from the centre to the points in which it cuts the wires will
                    constitute a <hi rend="italic">horizontal dial.</hi> Such a dial, constructed as
                    has been explained, for London, in latitude 51⅛°, is shown by fig 1. On the
                    longest day the sun’s centre rises at London forty-four minutes before four, and
                    sets seventeen minutes after eight; therefore the extreme hours marked on the
                    dial are IV. and VIII.</p>
                <p>7. If again we suppose the plane AFG to be vertical, as in fig. 2, and that it
                    faces the south, then we have a <hi rend="italic">south</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dial.</hi> In this case the plane of the dial cannot be illuminated before six
                    in the morning, nor after six in the evening; therefore these are the extreme
                    hours marked on it.</p>
                <p>8. If the plane, which we have supposed to be in the inside of the sphere, were
                    perpendicular to the axis, it would then pass through the equator in the
                    heavens, and the result would be an <hi rend="italic">equinoctial dial.</hi> In
                    this case, the circle which forms the circumference of the dial would evidently
                    be divided into equal parts by the wire circles; therefore the shadow would move
                    with an uniform angular motion about the centre, just as the hour-hand of a
                    watch does; and, moreover, it would be illuminated on the north side only in the
                    summer, and on the south side in the winter. In the same way, by giving
                    different positions to the plane, the student of this subject may get an exact
                    conception of every other kind of dial.</p>
                <p>9. It is sufficiently obvious, that when the points in which the circles cut the
                    plane BAD (fig. 1) or FCG (fig. 2) have been once determined, and lines drawn
                    from them to the centre, the circles are no longer necessary to the dial, which
                    is then simply a plane; and although we have employed the hypothesis of material
                    circles to represent the circles of the sphere, as being a convenient way of
                    treating the subject, yet the intersection of the circles and the plane of the
                    dial may be determined either by a geometrical construction or a numerical
                    calculation.</p>
                <p>10. It will now be proper to define certain terms which will frequently occur in
                    treating this subject.</p>
                <p>The plane ABCD (fig. 1), on which the lines that indicate the hours are drawn, is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">plane of the dial.</hi></p>
                <p>The material line PE, which rises out of the plane of the dial, and projects a
                    shadow on it, and thereby indicates the hours, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axis</hi> of the dial. Instead of being a line or rod, it is sometimes the edge
                    of a thin flat plate (as in fig. 3, 4, &amp;c.) fixed on the plane of the dial;
                    it is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">gnomon·,</hi> also the <hi
                    rend="italic">style,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">dial.</hi></p>
                <p>The circles P&lt;ψ, <hi rend="italic">Pbp, Pep,</hi> &amp;c. also the circles of

                    circles</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Astronomy,</hi> Part II. chap. 1). Of these,

                    >meridian</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the others are named from the hours, as
                    the six o’clock hour circle, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The lines E XI. E XII. E I. &amp;c. which are the intersections of the hour
                    circles and the plane of the dial, are called <hi rend="italic">hour
                    lines</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that in the plane of the meridian, which
                    indicates the hour of noon, is the <hi rend="italic">meridian line.</hi></p>
                <p>The common intersection of the hour lines is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >centre</hi> of the dial. The angles which the hour lines make with the meridian
                    lines are the <hi rend="italic">hour angles at the centre of the dial</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the spherical angles which the hour circles make with
                    the meridian are the <hi rend="italic">hour angles</hi> at the pole. These are
                    the same as the angles which the planes of the circles make with the
                    meridian.</p>

                <p> 11. The manner in which the general principles of dialling<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194757178" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7178-0762"/> have been explained shows
                    directly how a dial may be constructed by means of a terrestrial globe. Let
                    PE∕&gt; be the axis of a globe (fig. I), XII. E XII. the equator, and BAD its
                    horizon. Suppose now the globe to be rectified for the latitude of any place,
                    London for instance, which is in latitude 51^ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>;
                    this is done by placing it in such a position that the arc of the brazen
                    meridian between the pole and horizon is equal to the latitude. Then it is
                    manifest, that if at London the brazen meridian of the globe be placed in the
                    plane of the celestial meridian, its axis will point to the poles of the world;
                    and if any one of the meridians on the globe be brought under the brazen
                    meridian, all the meridians, supposing there are twenty-four, will correspond to
                    hour circles in the heavens. In short, the meridians on the globe will
                    correspond to the sphere formed of wire circles, its wooden horizon to the plane
                    inserted within the sphere formed by the circles, and its axis to the axis of
                    that sphere. Assuming now the line drawn from E, the centre of the globe, to the
                    north point on the horizon as the twelve o’clock hour line, the angle XII. E I.
                    which the one o’clock line makes with it at the centre of the dial, will have
                    for its measure the arc of the horizon between the arc of the meridian P XII.
                    and the arc P I. of the next hour circle. This will be about IIf <hi

                    the centre will be measured by the arc of the horizon between the brazen
                    meridian and the arc P II. of the two o’clock hour circle, and so on. The angles
                    made by the forenoon hour lines and the meridian line are equal to those made by
                    the corresponding afternoon hour lines and the meridian line; that is, the angle
                    XI. E XII. to the angle I. E XII. and X. E XII. to II. E XII. &amp;c. The
                    morning and evening hour lines for VI. will both be perpendicular to the
                    meridian; and it is easy to see that the morning hour line for V. will be the
                    continuation of the afternoon hour line for V.; and that the hour lines for IV.
                    and</p>
                <p>III. in the morning will be the prolongations of the lines for the same hours in

                    the morning hours.</p>
                <p>12. If the globe have more than twenty-four circles (some have thirty-six), place
                    the first meridian, which is that of London, under the brazen meridian, and set
                    the moveable hour index to XII. at noon; then turn the globe westward until the
                    index points successively to I. II. III.</p>

                    equator pass under the brazen meridian; and it will appear that the first
                    meridian of the globe cuts the horizon in the following number of degrees from
                    the north toward the east, viz. I If <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, 24į°, 38

                <p>Because the hour lines are less distant from each other about noon than in any

                    The thickness of the style must be equal,to <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the
                    breadth between the meridian lines. Let it now be placed truly upright on the
                    dial, so as to stand on the space between them, and the dial will be finished.
                    The style should be of such a height that its shadow at midsummer shall reach to
                    the space on which the hours are marked.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">To construct a direct South Dial by a Globe.</hi></p>
                <p>14. Let PBjtzDF (fig. 2, Plate CLXXXV.) be a globe on which twenty-four meridians
                    or hour circles are marked, P and/» being the north and south poles, and XII. E
                    XII. the equator. Suppose now P∕&gt;, the axis of the globe, to coincide with
                    the axis of the world; and some one meridian on it, as PFD∕&gt;, with the
                    meridian of the place for which the dial is to serve; then if the globe be cut
                    through the centre E, by a vertical plane AFCG, in an east and west direction,
                    it is manifest that straight lines drawn from the centre to the points on which
                    this plane meets the hour circles on the globe will be the hour lines of a south
                    or north dial. The figure show s a south dial on the lower half of the circle,
                    which is the common section of the circle and cutting plane, the hour lines
                    being E VI. E VII. &amp;c.; and E∕&gt;, the southern half of the axis of the
                    globe, is the axis of the dial. A north dial would just be its counterpart on
                    the upper and opposite side of the plane.</p>
                <p>15. By a comparison of fig. I and 2, it will appear that, as in fig. 1, the angle
                    which the axis PE makes with DAB, the plane of the dial, is the latitude of the
                    place; so in fig. 2, the angle which the axis ∕&gt;E makes with the plane FΛGC
                    is the complement of the latitude, or what it wants of 90°. Hence it follows
                    that <hi rend="italic">a south dial for any given place will serve as a
                    horizontal dial at a place whose latitude is the complement of that of the given
                    place,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Indeed it is easy to see
                    that, <hi rend="italic">if a dial be correctly constructed on any given plane
                    for a given place, there will be some other place, which may be found, where
                    that dial will serve as a horizontal dial.</hi> And the reason is this; whatever
                    be the position of a plane, there must be some place on the earth whose horizon
                    is parallel to that plane. Now all dials whose planes are parallel, wherever
                    they be situated on the earth’s surface, have their axes parallel; therefore, at
                    the same instant the angular motion of the shadow will be the same on them all.
                    If the planes of dials which are parallel be perpendicular to the same meridian,
                    they will indicate the same hour at the same instant. If they are not, the
                    difference between the hours they indicate at any instant will be different,
                    because of their difference of longitude.</p>
                <p>16. From what has been explained, it is evident how the <pb break="no"

                    lines, so that the distance between them may be exactly the thickness of the
                    style; cross them perpendicularly by the line VI. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> VI.;
                    this is the six o’clock hour line. On <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> as centres with any convenient distance describe quadrants,
                    and divide each into ninety degrees. Rectify now the globe for the complement of
                    the latitude of the place; bring a meridian or hour circle on the globe to the
                    north point of the horizon, and (supposing there are twenty-four hour circles)
                    note the degrees reckoned from the north on the horizon, in which it is
                    intersected by the hour circles; these will be the angles which the hour lines
                    make with the double meridian line at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the centre of the dial. Proceed in laying them down exactly
                    as in making a horizontal dial; and it will only be necessary to lay down the
                    hours from noon to six in the evening and the morning, because a vertical plane
                    facing the south can never be illuminated earlier nor later.</p>
                <p>17. We have explained the application of a globe to the construction of dials,
                    less with a view to recommend it in practice, than to elucidate the theory.
                    Other methods are better, because, with the best mounted globe, the hour angles
                    at the centre of the dial cannot be determined with much accuracy. It will be
                    better to compute the angles and lay them down from a scale of chords; or we may
                    use a geometrical construction; or, lastly, we may lay down the hour lines by
                    means of a dialling scale, the easiest method of any.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geometrical Theory of Dialling.</hi></p>
                <p>18. It has been shown (art. 3 and 4) that if at any place a straight rod or wire
                    be parallel to the earth’s axis, in which position it may be considered as
                    coinciding with the axis of the heavens, the angular motion of the sun about
                    that rod will appear to be perfectly uniform throughout the day, and therefore
                    the shadowy space within which the sun’s light is wholly or in part intercepted
                    by the rod will also turn uniformly about it. Hence, to construct a sun-dial, it
                    is only necessary to place the rod so that its shadow may fall on a surface of
                    any kind, and to trace on that surface, at any equal intervals of time (hours
                    for instance), the line shown on the surface by the shadow at the instants which
                    separate these intervals. These lines, numbered according to the hours, will
                    serve to show time by the shadow at all seasons. This is the most simple way of
                    constructing a dial, but it supposes that we have the means of dividing time
                    into equal intervals, a thing indeed easy since the invention of clocks and
                    watches.</p>
                <p>To reduce the subject to a geometrical theory, let us suppose that, in the
                    adjoining figure, OCF is the rod (considered as a material straight line) which
                    projects the shadow, and that it is perpendicular to the plane of a circle APB
                    at C its centre, and let CA be the position of the shadow on the circle at noon
                    Then, if the circumference be divided into twenty-four equal parts, beginning
                    from A, as at 1, 2,.&amp;c., and lines be drawn from the centre through the
                    points of division, it is manifest that the shadow will fall on the lines at the
                    hours marked on them, and the circle will serve as a dial. And since its plane
                    coincides with that of the equator in the heavens, it is an <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Equinoctial Dial.</hi><hi rend="italic">Equinoctial Dial.</hi></p>
                <p>19. To construct this dial (Plate CLXXXVII. fig. 6), on C, a point in the middle
                    of its face, as a centre, describe a circle ABDE; divide the circumference into
                    twenty-four equal parts, and from the points of division draw straight lines to
                    the centre; these will be the hour lines; mark the hours on them as in the
                    figure; fix a thin and straight wire in the centre, perpendicular to the face of
                    the dial, for its style, and place it with the style directed to the pole, and
                    the twelve o’clock hour line in the plane of the meridian; and when the dial is
                    illuminated by the sun, the hours will be indicated by the shadow of the
                    style.</p>
                <p>20. In our climate the superior side of an equinoctial dial is illuminated when
                    the sun is on the north side of the equator, and the inferior or opposite when
                    he is on the south side. On the equinoctial days neither side will be
                    illuminated, because the sun is in the plane of the dial. However, if it have a
                    ledge rising a little above the opposite sides, and the hour lines be continued
                    on the ledge, the shadow will fall on its inside, and indicate the hour,
                    although the direction of the sun’s rays be almost parallel to its face.</p>
                <p>21. To set up an equinoctial dial, direct the straight edge of a vertical plane
                    towards the polar star, which is about one degree thirty-six minutes from the
                    pole of the world; it will then nearly coincide with the axis of the sphere; but
                    for greater accuracy the edge may be directed to the star when highest or
                    lowest, and a line drawn on the plane, making with its edge the above angle.
                    This will be in the true direction of the axis of the dial, the plane of which
                    must be placed perpendicular to the line so determined, and the six o’clock
                    hours in a horizontal line: the dial will then be properly placed.</p>
                <p>22. An equinoctial dial may be set up about the time of either solstice without
                    knowing either the latitude of the place or the direction of the meridian, from
                    this property, that when truly placed, the extremity of the shadow of the axis
                    will then describe a circle on the plane of the dial, the centre being the
                    common intersection of the hour lines. If, therefore, the dial be placed nearly
                    in a true position, with the six o'clock hour line exactly horizontal, by
                    observing the line which is the extremity of the path of the shadow, it will be
                    seen in which way the deviation from the true position lies, and by repeated
                    adjustment it may be truly placed. About the equinoxes the daily path will
                    deviate somewhat from a circle, by reason of the quick change in the sun’s
                    declination.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Horizontal Dial.</hi></p>
                <p>23. Let GEDH (see the adjoining figure) be a horizontal plane on which a dial is
                    to be delineated, and let LOK be a meridian line on this plane; let OCF be a
                    material line or rod in the plane of the meridian, which meets the horizontal
                    plane in O, and makes with OK an angle equal to the latitude of the dial: this
                    rod will be directed to the pole, and will be the axis of the dial. Let BAP be
                    an equinoctial dial, having OCF for its axis, and C for its centre; and let CA,
                    the meridian line on this dial, meet the meridian line on the horizontal plane
                    in K. As has been explained, the plane of the shadow will turn uniformly about
                    the axis OCF, meeting the equinoctial plane in some line CPQ, and the horizontal
                    plane in a corresponding<pb break="no" facs="nls:194757204"

                    after noon on the equatorial dial, and O I. Ο II. &amp;c. the corresponding hour
                    lines on the horizontal dial; the former will make with the meridian line OAK
                    angles proportional to the time from noon, and will be known when the hour is
                    given, 15 degrees being reckoned an hour. The plane of the equinoctial dial
                    being supposed extended to meet the horizontal plane in the line QK, which will
                    be at right angles to the meridian lines CK, OK, the problem to be now resolved
                    is, to find the hour angle KOQ at the centre of the horizontal dial
                    corresponding to any given angle KCQ at the centre of the equinoctial dial,
                    which measures the time from noon.</p>
                <p>The triangles CKQ on the equinoctial plane, and OKQ on the horizontal plane, have
                    a common side KQ, and each a right angle at K; therefore, by trigonometry,</p>
                <p>CK: KQ = rad.: tan. KCQ <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> and KQ: OK = tan. KOQ: rad.,
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">ex. (eq.</hi> CK: OK = tan. KOQ: tan. KCQ.</p>
                <p>But in the triangle COK, right angled at C,</p>
                <p>CK: OK = rad.: sin. OCK, therefore rad. sin. OCK = tan. KOQ: tan. KCQ.</p>
                <p>Hence we have this general theorem or rule for computing the hour angles at the
                    centre of a horizontal dial: <hi rend="italic">As radius to the sine of the

                </table>
                <p>In this table the angles which the hour lines of V. IV. III. make with the
                    meridian are not put down, because they are the same as those of the like hours
                    in the afternoon, the former being the continuation of the latter; a similar
                    remark applies to the hour lines of VII. VIII. IX. in the evening, which are the
                    continuation of the like morning hours.</p>
                <p>The use of the table is obvious. For example, if the angles of the hour lines at
                    the centre of a dial for 56° of latitude be required, the table shows that the
                    hour lines of XI. and I. make angles of 12° 31' with the meridian, and the hour
                    lines of X. and II. angles of 25° 35', and so on. If the latitude is not exactly
                    contained in the table, proportional parts may be taken, without any sensible
                    error. Thus, if the hour line angles of a horizontal dial for 55° 42' be
                    required, the table gives 12° 37' for the angle of the XL or 1. o’clock line in
                    lat. 55° 30 ’, and 12° 31' in lat. 56°: the difference of the angles
                    corresponding to 30' difference of latitude is 4'. Now the proposed latitude
                    exceeds the least of these two by 12', therefore we state this</p>
                <p>4 × 12</p>
                <p>proposition 30: 12 = 4': ——— = 1 ’ ∙6. Hence we find that 12' of addition to the
                    latitude gives 1'∙6, or nearly 2' of addition to the hour angle, which will
                    therefore be 12° 29'.</p>

                <p>25. The formula of art. 23, namely, that the tangent of the angle which any hour
                    line makes with the meridian line is a fourth proportional to radius, the sine
                    of the latitude, and the tangent of the hour angle at the pole (that is, the
                    hour from noon in degrees), reduces the construction of a dial to this

                <p>Having given any angle, to find another whose tangent shall have to that of the

                    line VI. C ʹ C VI. Make a right angled triangle HCK (fig. 6), having K a right
                    angle, and C equal to the angle which the axis of the dial is to make with its
                    plane, that is, to the latitude of the place, which for London is 51^ <hi

                    as centres with a radius equal to CH, the hypothenuse of the triangle CKH (fig.
                    6), describe the quadrants M6, M ʹ 6; and about the same centres, with a radius
                    equal to HK, the side of the triangle opposite to C, describe concentric
                    quadrants, as in the figure; divide these each into six equal parts at the

                    on the other side. From the points of division in the inner quadrant draw lines
                    parallel to the meridian line, and from those in the outer quadrant draw lines
                    parallel to the six o’clock line, so that the lines drawn from the corresponding
                    divisions in the concentric quadrants may meet, viz. those from 11 in <hi

                    side; draw straight lines C ʹ XL C I. through the points <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> on each side of the meridian line, and
                    these will be the hour lines of XI. and I. In like manner, draw straight lines
                    C'X. C II. through <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and
                    these will be the hour lines of X. and II. and so on. Extend the morning hour
                    lines of VII. VIII. and IX. across the dial, and the prolongations will be the
                    hour lines of the same hours in the evening; and in like manner form the hour
                    lines of V. IV. III. in the morning from the same afternoon hours. The style CLM
                    (fig. 6) must have the angle at C equal to the latitude, and may be formed from
                    the triangle CHK (see art. 23).</p>
                <p>27. To demonstrate the truth of this construction, let CB (fig. 5) be any one of
                    the hour lines determined by the intersection of DB a parallel, and EBA a
                    perpendicular to the meridian line, drawn from corresponding points D, E in the
                    concentric quadrants. The points C, D, E will be in a straight line; and from
                    similar triangles,</p>
                <p>AE: AB = CE: CD = CH: HK (fig. 6).</p>
                <p>Now AE is to AB as the tangent of ACE, the hour from noon (in degrees) to the
                    tangent of ACB, the angle made by the hour line and the meridian, and CH is to
                    HK as radius to the sine of the latitude: Therefore (art. 23) the hour line is
                    rightly determined.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Construction.</hi></p>
                <p>28. In the following figure let C be the centre of the dial, CM the XII. and CA
                    the VI. o’clock hour lines. Make the angle MCB equal to the latitude of the
                    place. Take CB of any length, and draw BA perpendicular to CA; make CM equal to
                    CB, and join MA; bisect MA in D; draw DO perpendicular to MA, and equal to DM or
                    DA; join OM, OA; and about 0 as a centre, with OM or OA</p>
                <p>(which are equaD as a radius, describe the quadrant M3A, and divide it into six
                    equal parts at the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These are to correspond to hours; but
                    each may be subdivided into quarters, or other smaller parts of an hour.</p>
                <p>Now, to determine any hour line, for example, that of II. o’clock; draw a
                    straight line OH from 0 to the division 2 of the quadrant, meeting MA in E; next
                    draw a straight line CK from C through E, and this will be the hour line for II.
                    Exactly in the same way all the other hour lines for the afternoon, and by a
                    like construction on the other side of the meridian those for the forenoon, may
                    be found.</p>
                <p>29. To demonstrate this construction, draw MK perpendicular to CM, meeting CE in
                    K, and MH perpendicular to OM, meeting OE in H. The triangles OAE, HME, are
                    manifestly equiangular; so also are the triangles CAE, KME; therefore MH: OA =
                    ME: AE = MK: AC.</p>
                <p>Now, by trigonometry, making MO radius,</p>
                <p>MH: OA = tan. MOH: tan. OMA.</p>
                <p>And making MC radius; MK: AC =tan. MCK: tan. AMC. Therefore tan. MOH: tan. OMA =
                    tan. MCK: tan. AMC. And by alter, tan. MOH: tan. MCK = tan. OM A: tan. AMC.</p>
                <p>That is, because tan. OMA = radius, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> tan. MOE: tan.
                    MCE — rad.: tan. AMC.</p>
                <p>But rad.: tan. AMC = CM or CB: C A = rad.: sin. CMA; therefore, radius is to the
                    sine of CMA, the latitude, as the tangent of MOA, the hour angle from noon, to
                    the tangent of MCE; hence (art. 23) CE is the hour line required.</p>
                <p>30. If OD be made the radius of a circle, DE will evidently be the tangent of the
                    hour angle, reckoned from three o’clock; and in general, the segment between the
                    middle of AM and the point in which any hour line cuts it, will be the tangent
                    of the interval in time between that hour and three o’clock. If therefore these
                    tangents be laid down on a scale, which may be called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scale of hours</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> it will serve for the
                    construction of all dials whatever.</p>
                <p>It has been shown that CM is to CA as radius to the sine of the latitude; but CM
                    is to CA as radius to the tangent of CMA, therefore the tangent of CMA is equal
                    to the sine of the latitude; so that the latitude being known, the angle CMA may
                    be found by inspection in the trigonometrical tables. Let this angle be <hi

                <p>31. Scales for the construction of dials may be either made entirely by a

                    and laid down from a scale of equal parts.</p>
                <p>If a geometrical construction is used (Plate CLXXXV. fig. 8), divide AD a
                    quadrant of a circle into six equal parts, at 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. each of these may
                    be again divided into four (these, however, are not shown in the figure.) Draw a

                    r3s perpendicular to E3; also straight lines from the centre through A, D, the

                    >r</hi> and s; and against these marks put XII. and VI. Draw straight lines from

                <p>32. Divide CD, another quadrant of the circle, into 90 equal parts (only every
                    tenth division is shown), and from the points of division draw perpendiculars to
                    the radius EC; these cut off distances E10, E20, &amp;c. which are equal to the
                    sines of 10°, 20°, &amp;c. and EC is a <hi rend="italic">line of sines.</hi></p>
                <p>33. Draw straight lines from D through 10, 20, &amp;c. the bottoms of the

                    which the first gives the distances of the divisions on the scale of latitudes,
                    in thousandth parts of the whole length of the scale; and the second gives, in
                    the same equal parts, the distances of the divisions on the scale of hours, from
                    the beginning, XII. to every fifth minute of each hour.</p>

                <p>In north latitudes, a north dial can only be illuminated when the sun has north
                    declination, that is, from about 21st March to 22d September; and the nearest
                    times to noon which can be shown by it are those at which the sun crosses the
                    prime vertical on the day of the summer solstice. A south dial can never be
                    illuminated before six in the morning, nor after six in the evening; because
                    when the sun rises earlier and sets later, he never crosses the prime vertical
                    so early as six in the morning, nor so late as six in the evening. It will
                    therefore be needless to describe on either more hours than can be wanted.</p>
                <p>40. Supposing a dial to be traced on a thin material plane, it is easy to
                    understand that a direct north dial is only the back of a direct south one; so
                    that if the hour lines of one of them were cut through it, and extended, they
                    would form on the opposite side the hour lines of the other, and the style of
                    the one dial produced would form the style of the other dial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vertical East and West Dials.</hi></p>
                <p>4L These are described on vertical plpnes facing due east and west; therefore
                    their planes coincide with the meridian, and pass through the poles of the
                    world. Fig. 8 and 9, in Plate CLXXXVII. represent east and west dials. In fig.
                    8, let HR be a horizontal line on a plane facing due east, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> a line in the direction of the earth’s axis crossing it ate. Through
                    this point draw EQ perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> then EQ will be
                    in the plane of the equinoctial circle in the heavens.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that at any two points <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> in the line
                    directed to the pole there are wires of equal length fixed perpendicular to the
                    plane of the dial, and that their tops are joined by a third wire, so as to form
                    a rectangle AwóB (see fig. 10), one side of which <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is
                    on the face of the dial, and the opposite side AB is parallel to it and directed
                    to the pole. The earth’s radius being as nothing when compared with the sun’s
                    distance, it follows that the angular motion of the sún about the line AB will
                    be uniform, just as it is about the earth’s axis, and therefore that the shadow
                    of the line will turn uniformly about it as an axis, and its projection on the
                    dial will always be perpendicular to the line EQ. It will now be easy to
                    understand, that at six in the morning the shadowy plane will be perpendicular
                    to the plane of the dial, and will fall on the line <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and that, as it turns uniformly about its axis, it will cut
                    off from cQ lines which will be the tangents of the angles generated by the
                    shadow, that is, the tangents of the hour angles from six.</p>
                <p>The same will be true of a west dial (see fig. 9); the hour lines of both will be
                    perpendicular to EQ, the line in which the plane of the equator intersects the
                    plane of the dial; and if <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be put for the height of the
                    rod AB above the dial, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> for the hour angle from six
                    o’clock, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> for the distance of the hour line reckoned
                    on EQ either way from <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> then, supposing radius = 1, the

                    is to serve as the six o’clock hour line, over which the rod or wire AB is to be

                    these the hours are to be written as in the figures. At the points <hi

                    perpendicular to the meridian, and passing through the poles. It has a great
                    affinity with east and west dials; for if a prism with six rectangular faces
                    were placed with its axis directed to the pole, and two of its faces due east
                    and west, the remaining two would form planes for polar dials, and the face
                    directed to the pole would serve as the plane of an equinoctial dial.</p>
                <p>45. The style of a polar dial, like that of an east or west dial, must be
                    parallel to its face, and may have the same form (see fig. 10). To construct it,
                    draw <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> in the plane of the meridian for the twelve
                    o’clock hour line, and cross it at right angles by the horizontal line HR. The
                    hour lines are to be found exactly as in the east and west dials, and marked
                    with the hours as in the figure.</p>
                <p>A polar dial may, if it be of sufficient extent, showtime from a little after six
                    in the morning to a little before six in the evening. At the hours of six the
                    sun is in the plane of the dial, and the shadow parallel to its face.</p>
                <p>Putting <hi rend="italic">x</hi> to denote the hour from noon, and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> for the distance of the hour line from the meridian line,
                    and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for the height of the style above the plane of the
                    dial; the formula for a polar dial is</p>

                <p>46. It seldom happens that an upright wall faces exactly one of the cardinal
                    points; therefore, in general, a dial described on the plane of a wall will be a
                    vertical declining dial.</p>
                <p>47. The <hi rend="italic">declination</hi> of a plane is an arch of the horizon
                    between the plane and the prime vertical; or it is the arch between the meridian
                    and a plane perpendicular to the dial plane, and is always reckoned from the
                    south or north.</p>
                <p>48. The <hi rend="italic">meridian</hi> of a plane is the meridian perpendicular
                    to the plane of the dial. This differs from the meridian of the place, which is
                    the meridian that is perpendi-cular to the horizon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">substyle</hi> of a dial is the common section of its plane
                    and the plane of its meridian, or it is the line in which perpendiculars drawn
                    from every point in the axis of the dial meet its plane. In horizontal and in
                    vertical south and north dials, the substyle coincides with the twelve o’clock
                    hour line; but not in declining dials.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194757256" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7256-0768"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">difference of longitude</hi> of a dial plane is the angle
                    which the plane of its meridian makes with the meridian of the place.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">latitude</hi> of any dial plane is the angle which the axis
                    makes with the plane; which is also the latitude of the place where the dial
                    would be a horizontal one.</p>
                <p>49. In the adjoining figure let AB be aline drawn on a vertical plane, a wall,
                    for instance. It may have any aspect, but, to fix our ideas, let us suppose it
                    to face some point between the south and west; let CE be the style or axis fixed
                    at C in the wall in the direction of the earth’s axis; draw the vertical line CD
                    on the plane, and from E, the extremity of the style, draw ED perpendicular to
                    CD; the plane of the triangle CDE will manifestly coincide with the meridian,
                    and CD will be the twelve o’clock-hour line on the dial.</p>
                <p>Let NCF be a horizontal line passing through C due east and west; conceive a
                    plane to pass along NF and the vertical line CD; this will coincide with the
                    prime vertical in the heavens. Let us now suppose that at some hour, for example
                    two in the afternoon, the horary plane (that is, the plane passing through the
                    sun and the axis CE) meets the plane of the dial in the line CH, and the plane
                    of the prime vertical in <hi rend="italic">Ch;</hi> the first of these lines
                    will be the hour line of two on the dial to be constructed, and the second the
                    line of the same hour on the prime vertical, that is, on a vertical south dial.
                    Now by the theory of that dial (art. 38) the angle DCA will be known; it is,
                    however, the angle DCH that is required in order to construct the dial under
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>50. Suppose a horizontal plane to pass along ED, and meet the horary plane in the
                    line EHA, the plane of the dial in DH, and the prime vertical in DA; the plane
                    EDA may now be regarded as that of a horizontal dial, of which EC is the axis, E
                    the centre, and ED the meridian line; and on this dial EH will be the hour line
                    of two; but for any given hour, the angle DEH will be known by formula 1, art.
                    23. And because the horizontal lines DE, DA lie, one in the plane of the
                    meridian CDE, and the other in the plane of the prime vertical CDA, which is
                    perpendicular to the former, the angle EDA will be a right angle; now the angle
                    HD∕∕,, or its equal BCE, is the declination of the dial plane (art. 46), and
                    therefore is given, or may be found; therefore the angle EDH, its complement, is
                    known; and hence</p>
                <p>51. All the angles of the triangle DEH are known.</p>
                <p>Let L denote the latitude of the place for which the dial is to be made; D, the
                    angle LIDA or BCE, the declination of the plane; and Ľ the angle made by the
                    meridian ED of the assumed horizontal dial, and EH the hour line; then, in the
                    triangle DEH we have the angle at E (denoted by E), the angle EDH = 90 — D, and
                    therefore the third angle DHE = 180 — (E + 90 — D) = 90° _ (E — D).</p>
                <p>In the right-angled triangles CDE, CDH (which have CD, one of the sides about the
                    right angle, common to both), by trigonometry, <hi rend="smallcaps">DE</hi>: DH
                    = tan. DCE or cot. DEC: tan. DCII.</p>
                <p>But in the triangle DEH, <hi rend="smallcaps">DE</hi>: DH = sin. DHE: sin. DEH =
                    cos. (E—D): sin. E; therefore, cos. (E — D): sin. E = cot. DEC: tan. DCII.</p>
                <p>Now the first three terms of this proposition are known, because the angles E and
                    D are given, and also the angle DEC, which is the latitude; therefore the fourth
                    term, viz. the tangent of DCH, is known; and hence the angle DCH, between the
                    hour line CH on the dial and the meridian line CD, is known. Thus may all the
                    angles made by the hour lines and the meridian of the dial be determined by
                    plane trigonometry.</p>
                <p>52. This way of finding the hour lines requires two operations for each, viz. one
                    to find the angle DEH at the centre of the auxiliary horizontal dial; and a
                    second to find the angle DCH at the centre of the dial to be constructed. We
                    shall now investigate a formula which gives each angle by a single operation,
                    when two subsidiary quantities common to them all have been found.</p>
                <p>For any vertical declining dial let</p>
                <p>L = latitude of the place;</p>
                <p>D = BCE, the declination of the dial plane reckoned from the east towards the
                    south; <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the variable horary angle described by the sun
                    since noon; <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the corresponding angle DCH at the centre
                    of the dial; and, as before, put E for the angle described at the centre of a
                    horizontal dial for the same latitude in the time <hi rend="italic">χ.</hi></p>

                <p>In the calculation for the hour line angle of III. a. m. the cosine of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> P = 93° is negative; this makes the

                    >y</hi> an angle between 90° and 180°.</p>
                <p>58. If this dial were traced on a plane, and the hour <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194757282" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7282-0770"/>lines extended and continued
                    through it, and if the style also were produced through the plane, the reverse
                    would be a north vertical dial, declining to the westward 49°.</p>
                <p>In general, to make a north declining dial, we have only to make a south
                    declining dial whose declination is the same and lies the same way, and then
                    turn it upside down, and it will be the dial required; but the hours must be
                    numbered the contrary way. Therefore these two examples, duly considered, will
                    serve for examples of all declining dials.</p>
                <p>59. It has been already observed (art. 15), that a dial on any plane whatever,
                    given in position at a given place, will be a horizontal dial at some other
                    place, which may be found. This principle gives another method of constructing a
                    declining vertical dial; for if the latitude of that place, and also the
                    difference between its longitude and that of the place where the dial is to show
                    the time, be found, the former will be the angle which the style must make with
                    the plane of the dial; that is, the angle it makes with the substyle; and the
                    latter will give the time the shadow takes to pass between the twelve o’clock
                    line and the substyle, from which the angle they contain may be found. These
                    three elements being known, viz. the latitude and longitude of the place where
                    the dial would be horizontal, and the angle contained by the meridian line and
                    substyle, the construction is reduced to that of a horizontal dial.</p>
                <p>60. These elements may be found by spherical trigonometry as follows; let SZNz be
                    the meridian, in which Z and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> are the zenith and nadir,
                    and P, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the poles: Let SEN be the horizon, S and N being
                    the south and north points, and E the east; let ZFzbe a vertical plane or great
                    circle of the sphere on which the dial is to be drawn; let this plane cut the
                    horizon in F, and the plane of the meridian in the straight line <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">Lz</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and let it be cut perpendicularly in the line <hi rend="italic">Aa</hi>
                    by a circle PA/? which passes through the poles. Then <hi rend="italic">Cp</hi>
                    or CP will be the axis of the dial, according as it faces the south or the
                    north, <hi rend="italic">Cz or CZ</hi> the twelve o’clock hour line, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ca or</hi> CA the substyle (art. 48).</p>
                <p>In the spherical triangle ZPA, right angled at A, PZ, the complement of the
                    latitude of the place where the dial is to show time is given; so also is the
                    angle PZA, for it is measured by FZ, the arc of the horizon of which the
                    complement is the declination of the dial (art. 47); from these, AP, the measure
                    of the angle contained by PC the axis, and AC the substyle, that is, the
                    latitude of the dial, (art. 48), also AZ, the measure of the angle contained by
                    the substyle AC and the vertical or twelve o’clock hour line, lastly, the angle
                    ZPA, the difference of longitude of the planes ZPC, APC (art. 73), may be all
                    found.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">To trace a Meridian Line on any Plane.</hi></p>
                <p>63. In constructing a dial it is always necessary to determine the line in which
                    the plane of the meridian meets the plane of the dial. On an assumed point in
                    the meridian line as a centre describe several concentric circles with any
                    distances in the compasses: at this point fix a wire truly perpendicular to the
                    plane, and of such a length that when the sun shines its shadow shall extend
                    beyond the circles. Watch now the instant when the extremity of the shadow
                    exactly reaches some one of the circles in the forenoon, and mark the point in
                    which it crosses the circle. In the afternoon, mark in like manner the point in
                    which it again crosses the same circle: and any point that is equally distant
                    from the two points so determined will be in a meridian line passing through the
                    centre of the circle, which may now be drawn. By a like attention to the path of
                    the extremity of the shadow when it crosses the other circles, points may be
                    found in a meridian line passing through their common centre; and a mean
                    position of all the meridian lines thus found will be sufficiently accurate for
                    a dial.</p>
                <p>The theory of this method is sufficiently obvious. At equal intervals of time
                    each way from noon, the shadow is nearly of the same length, and makes nearly
                    equal angles with the meridian line; the deviation from absolute equality arises
                    chiefly from the continual change in the sun’s declination. This, however, is
                    but little in the course of a day near the solstices. Accordingly, greater
                    accuracy will be obtained about midsummer or midwinter than nearer the
                    equinoxes.</p>
                <p>64. A good compass will give an approximation to the true position of the
                    meridian; but the variation, which is not the same at all places and at all
                    times, must be known. In 1823 it was about 24° 10 ’ west at London, and in the
                    same year 27° 48' west at Edinburgh. If the direction of the meridian be known
                    at one place, the variation may be there determined; and thence the direction of
                    the meridian at another place not very distant may be found.</p>
                <p>65. If a good watch be set to true time, or its deviation from it be found, by
                    taking equal altitudes of the sun with a sextant, or by a single altitude, or
                    any other astronomical observation, a dial may thereby be set truly in the
                    meridian.</p>
                <p>66. The pole star is distant from the pole about 1° 36'; hence, knowing the
                    latitude, its greater azimuth may be found. At London its greatest deviation
                    from the meridian either way is about 2° 34' in azimuth. If now two plummets be
                    suspended at some distance from each other, and in such a position that the pole
                    star may appear in the same plane with them, that plane will be nearly in the
                    meridian. If one of the plummets be moveable, and it be shifted, following the
                    change of position in the star, the two extreme positions of the plumb-line
                    will, with the other plummet, determine two vertical planes, which deviate
                    equally from the meridian in opposite directions. If lines were now traced on a
                    horizontal plane in the directions of the vertical planes thus found, these
                    would form with the meridian line sought equal angles on opposite sides of it,
                    and the meridian would be found by bisecting the angle they contain. The pole
                    star comes to the meridian about noon and midnight in the beginning of October.
                    It may then be seen twice in the same night at its greatest distance on opposite
                    sides of the meridian; but one observed maximum distance, and the computed
                    deviation in azimuth, would serve to find the meridian at any time.</p>
                <p>The time of the meridian passage of the pole star on any day of the year may be
                    found as taught in works on astronomy. At this time, as shown by a watch, two
                    plumb-lines may be placed in the meridian, or one, and the corner intersection
                    of two walls truly perpendicular instead of another. Great accuracy in the time
                    of the observation is not required, the motion of the star in azimuth being only
                    7 minutes of a degree in ten minutes of time at London.</p>
                <p>67. A meridian line may be traced by observing when two stars which have the same
                    right ascension, or which differ in right ascension by twelve hours, come into
                    the same vertical plane; for then they are both in the meridian.</p>

                <p>The difference from twelve hours is about forty-six minutes of time. By the
                    revolution of the heavens the star <hi rend="italic">t</hi> comes into the
                    meridian under the pole; but the pole star is not then exactly in the meridian.
                    Afterwards they come into the same vertical, and then the pole star is very near
                    the meridian, and, for finding a meridian line, may be considered as exactly so.
                    The azimuth of the pole star, at the instant when the stars are in the same
                    vertical, may be found by calculation, and the approximate meridian thereby
                    corrected.</p>
                <p>There are other pairs of stars which come into the meridian nearly at the same
                    time. The stars <hi rend="italic">β Draconis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">α
                    Ophiuchi</hi>.are such. The stars ð of the lesser bear, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >α</hi> of the lyre, are also well adapted to the end in view, in latitudes
                    exceeding the polar distance of the most remote star, which is about 511°.</p>
                <p>68. In whatever way a meridian line has been found on a horizontal plane, two
                    plummets hung over it, or so that their lines may pass through it, will indicate
                    the position of the plane of the meridian in space. The line in which it cuts
                    any other plane, as a vertical wall not far from the meridian line, may be found
                    by placing the eye in the meridional plane, with the plummets between it and the
                    wall, and noting points on the wall which their lines cover from the eye. The
                    ingenious diallist may now, with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> little dexterity in
                    practical geometry, fix the style of his dial in the wall or other plane, with
                    its edge in the meridian plane, and making with a vertical line the proper
                    angle, so that it may point to the pole. A perpendicular drawn now from the end
                    of the style on the plane, will give a point in the substyle, which may now be
                    drawn to the centre. Thus two important elements in a dial will be
                    determined.</p>

                <p>If the plane were made to form one side of a temporary trough into which water
                    was poured, the surface of the water would accurately mark the horizontal line.
                    The inclination of the plane to the surface of the water, which is horizontal,
                    might be found by various expedients too obvious to require being pointed
                    out.</p>
                <p>When the position of the meridian and the axis of the dial are truly determined,
                    the finding of the inclination and declination of the plane are problems in
                    practical geometry which may be resolved by the application of levels, or
                    plumb-lines and squares, and those simple principles with which most workmen are
                    familiar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inclining Dials.</hi></p>
                <p>71. We come now to consider inclining dials, or those which stand oblique to the
                    horizon, either projecting forwards from the perpendicular, or retiring
                    backwards.</p>
                <p>From what has been taught, any dial plane being given in position, a meridian
                    line may be traced on it; also, at a point in that line an axis may be fixed
                    pointing to the pole of the world. Suppose now that in the following figure, OB
                    is a meridian line drawn on an inclining dial plane, and OC the axis directed to
                    the pole; the angle COB will be the complement of the latitude of that place
                    where the dial, being vertical, would show true time: this, therefore, is known.
                    If, in addition, we knew the declination of the dial, the hour line angles might
                    be found by the formulae of art. 55. Now it is easy to find the declination, for
                    since the horizon must be perpendicular to the vertical OB, if CB be drawn in
                    the plane of the meridian, and HBΛ in the dial plane, both perpendicular to OB,
                    these lines will be in the plane of the horizon of the place where the dial,
                    being vertical, would show true time; and the angle CBH will be the inclination
                    of the plane of the dial to the meridian, which is the complement of the
                    declination (art. 47). If now we make BH = BZ¢ of any length, and join CH, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ch,</hi> we have, by trigonometry,</p>
                <p>^nrr-(CΛ + CH)(CΛ-CH) <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> ° <hi rend="superscript">
                    s</hi> ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> CBH</hi> 1B≡</p>
                <p>Hence, by measuring the lines on a scale of equal parts, the inclination may be
                    found.</p>
                <p>72. Thus, having the position of the meridian, and the axis, on a dial plane
                    making a given angle with the horizon, we may find the latitude of the place
                    where it would be a vertical declining dial, and also its declination at that
                    place; and with these data the angles which the hour lines make with the
                    meridian may be found by the formulae for vertical dials, art. 55; or else we
                    may find the latitude and longitude of that place where the dial would be
                    horizontal, and construct it by the rules for a horizontal dial.</p>
                <p>73. To begin with the first of these methods, let <hi rend="smallcaps">SZNa</hi>
                    be the meridian (see fig. in next column), Pp the axis of the sphere, Z the
                    zenith of a place where the dial is to stand, SEN the horizon, S, E, and N, the
                    south, east, and north points respectively; also let HFI be a circle of the
                    sphere on the plane of which the dial is to be constructed, and let it meet the
                    horizon in F, and the plane of the meridian in the line HÄ; the line PO/? will
                    be the axis of the dial, and <hi rend="smallcaps">FIO/í</hi> the meridian line.
                    The arch EF between the east point of the horizon and the plane will be its <hi
                    rend="italic">declination,</hi> and the spherical angle HEN its <hi
                    rend="italic">inclination</hi> to, the horizon, or the complement of its
                    reclination from the vertical position.</p>
                <p>Now, let SEft be the horizon of a place having H for its zenith, which of course
                    is the place where the dial would be a vertical dial, and let it cut the dial
                    plane circle in <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because the two
                    horizons are perpendicular to the meridian, their intersection will be in the

                <p>D = FE, the declination of the dial;</p>

                    CLXXXVII.</p>
                <p>74. To construct the dial by finding the latitude and longitude of a place where
                    it would be horizontal, we must find the angle which the substyle makes with the
                    meridian, and also the latitude and longitude of the plane.</p>
                <p>Resuming the figure of art. 73, let a great circle passing through the pole, and
                    perpendicular to the plane of the dial, meet it in the line OA; this will be the
                    substyle, and AOH the angle which it makes with the meridian or XII. o’clock
                    hour line; AOP the angle which the axis makes with the plane of the dial, and
                    the spherical angle APH its difference of longitude.</p>

                    this arc is the complement of the arc jfE, which we have denoted by <hi

                    rend="italic">d.</hi> Again, the arc HP is the complement of the arc Pn, which

                    may be found by spherical trigonometry by these proportions, rad.: cos. H — tan.

                    The solution of this problem is wanted, that it may be known what hours should
                    be inscribed on a dial. It has various cases; but as all are to be resolved on
                    the same principles, it will be sufficient if we consider one.</p>
                <p>Retaining the construction of the fig. of art. 73, let PI be the hour circle
                    passing through the sun when he is in the plane of the dial on a given day. In
                    the spherical triangle HAP, we have found AP, the measure of the angle contained
                    by the axis and substyle; and HPA, the difference of longitude. Again, in the
                    spherical triangle IAP, right-angled at A, besides AP, there is known IP, the
                    sun’s distance from the pole on the given day. Hence the angle IPA may be found
                    by this proportion:</p>
                <p>tan. PI: tan. PA = rad.: cos. API.</p>
                <p>The angle API, expressed in time, is half the period the sun shines on the plane;
                    and the hour angle HPI, in time, is the interval between noon and the sun’s
                    leaving the plane.</p>
                <p>76. Taking the dial constructed in art. 73 as an example, it will be found that
                    when the sun is in the northern tropic, that is, when PI = 66° 30', the angle
                    IPA = 82° 12'. Now (art. 74), HPA = 25° 20'; therefore, when the sun ceases to
                    shine on the plane, the horary angle IPH from noon is 107° 32' — 7 hours 10
                    minutes, the sum of the two arcs; and when he begins to shine on it, the horary
                    angle is 56° 52' — 3 hours 47 minutes, their difference. Hence it will be
                    needless to trace on the dial any hour line earlier than VIII. in the morning,
                    or later than VIII. in the evening.</p>

                <p>77. Sometimes the line which is the boundary of the space passed over by the
                    shadow of the axis of a dial on given days of the year is traced on its plane.
                    The path of the extremity of the shadow when the sun enters the different signs
                    of the ecliptic is an elegant appendage to a dial, and the geometrical problem
                    which determines it is interesting.</p>
                <p>78. Setting aside the considerations of the change in the sun’s declination, the
                    apparent diurnal path of the sun in the heavens is, in the theory of dialling,
                    considered to be a circle parallel to the equator; therefore any fixed point
                    that projects a shadow throughout a day may be considered as the vertex of a
                    cone, the base of which is the diurnal circle described by the sun on that day,
                    and the space bounded by the shadow will be the same cone continued beyond its
                    vertex. Thus it appears that the shadow of a fixed point in space generates the
                    surface of a cone whose axis passes through the pole of the world; and hence the
                    path of the shadow on any plane will be a <hi rend="italic">conic section,</hi>
                    because it is the line in which the surface of the cone meets the plane.</p>
                <p>Let O be the centre of a horizontal dial, OF the axis, Ο XII. the meridian line,
                    and OB the shadow of the axis at any time; join FB, draw FA perpendicular to O
                    XII., and AD perpendicular to OB, meeting OB in D; and join FD. Because FA is
                    perpendicular to the plane BO XII. the plane of the triangle FAD is
                    perpendicular to that plane. Now, by construction, BD is perpendicular to their
                    common section DA, therefore it is perpendicular to the plane <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194757334" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7334-0774"/>of the triangle FAD, and
                    consequently FD is perpendicular to OB.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = OF the length of the axis; <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> = OB the length of its shadow;</p>

                <p>D =∙ the angle OFB, the sun’s polar distance; in the triangles ODF, ODA,
                    right-angled at D,</p>
                <p>OD: OF = cos. FOD: rad.</p>
                <p>OA: OD = rad.: cos. AOD, therefore OA: OF = cos. FOD: cos. AOD; but in the
                    triangle OAF,</p>
                <p>OA: OF = cos. FOA: rad.</p>
                <p>therefore cos. FOA: rad. — cos. FOD: cos. AOD. From the triangle FOB we get this
                    other proportion, sin. (F + 0) or sin. B: sin. F = OF: OB.</p>
                <p>The last two proportions in symbols are cos. L: rad. = cos. <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi>: cos. <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> sin. (D + ι∙): sin. D <hi rend="italic"
                    >= a</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">τ.</hi></p>
                <p>By the first proportion, we may determine <hi rend="italic">v</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> the angle the shadow makes with the meridian; and by the
                    second we get r, the length of the shadow. We may also express its length by the
                    hour angle from noon; for if we put <hi rend="smallcaps">ae</hi> to denote that
                    angle, then (art. 23), rad.: sin. L = tan. <hi rend="italic">x</hi>: tan. <hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi></p>
                <p>From the first and last of these three proportions, it is easy to infer, by
                    spherical trigonometry, that the arcs L and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> are the
                    sides of a right-angled spherical triangle, of which <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is
                    the hypotenuse, and that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the angle opposite the side

                <p>This is the equation of the line described by the shadow referred to axes
                    perpendicular to each other; it contains the first and second powers of the

                    section.</p>
                <p>80. If L = D, then sin. (L — D) — 0. In this case the term which contains <hi

                <p>If L is greater than D, so that the sine of D — L is negative, the equation

                <p>The path of the shadow is an ellipse at any place within the polar circle on the
                    days when the sun does not set; it is a parabola at that place on the day that

                <p>The first of these is the length of the shadow at noon. The vertices of the curve
                    lie on the same side of the centre of the dial when it. is a hyperbola, but on
                    opposite sides when it is an ellipse. The other elements of the curve may be
                    found in the same way, and the curve may be described as a conic section. In
                    practice it will however be sufficient to find the points in which the curve
                    crosses the hour lines of the dial, and then trace the curve through them by
                    hand. The intersection of the curve and any hour line may be found by this
                    construction.</p>
                <p>Let 0 be the centre of the dial, and Ο XII. the meridian line. Take any two
                    lines, OM, ON, in the proportion of the cosine of the latitude to radius; and
                    about 0 as a centre, with these distances, describe circles. Take OF in the
                    meridian line equal to the axis of the dial, and make the angle OFH equal to the
                    sun’s distance from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194757347"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7347-0775"/>pole. Let K be the intersection of any hour line
                    and the lesser circle. Draw KL perpendicular to the meridian, meeting the
                    greater circle in G. Draw OG, meeting FH in H. In the hour line OY, take OB
                    equal to OH, and B is the point in which the hour line meets the path of the
                    shadow.</p>
                <p>For, by trigonometry,</p>
                <p>OG: OK = sin. OKL: sin. OGL = cos. KOL: cos. GOL; that is, because KOL = YOL =

                <p>Hence the angle HOL = <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (formula 2 of art. 78); now HFO =

                    of the shadow (formula 3).</p>
                <p>Whatever has been shown regarding the shadow of a horizontal dial, will apply to
                    any dial whatever, if L be put for the latitude of the place where the dial
                    would be horizontal, and the substyle be taken for the meridian line.</p>

                <p>82. Dials of this kind are not common; yet they are deserving of attention,
                    because of the elegance of their geometrical theory. Their construction depends
                    on this principle.</p>

                <p>By the nature of the dial, the position of the style must depend entirely on the

                <p>These equations express the nature of every dial of this kind.</p>
                <p>85. To construct the dial, we must assume a line of any convenient length, as a
                    scale on which the co-ordinates of the hour points may be measured. The values
                    of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are now to be computed
                    by making <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 15° for the hours of XI. and I.; again, <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> = 30° for the hours of X. and IL, and so on. A graduated
                    scale must be formed along the meridian line, proceeding both ways from 0, that
                    point being the position of the style at the equinoxes; and since it appears
                    from the figure in art. 83, that for any given hour angle <hi rend="italic"

                    0; and that for the south, on the opposite side. Lastly, the months and days of
                    the year ought to be placed on the scale opposite to the degrees of declination
                    to which they correspond.</p>
                <p>86. We may investigate, from the equations, the nature of the curve that is the
                    <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> of the dial points, or which has <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> for rectangular co-ordinates. This will be
                    obtained by eliminating the angle <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>

                <p>87. This dial, represented by fig. 16, Plate CLXXXVII. is of the kind having a
                    variable centre. Its style is vertical, therefore, by what has been shown in
                    art. 84, the equations of the hour points on the dial will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >t — a</hi> tan. L. cos. <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi

                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">τ = a</hi> tan. D.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of the ellipse which is the locus of the hour points are
                    these:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">m</hi> = semicojugate or merid. axis = <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    tan. L, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = semitransverse axis <hi rend="italic">=

                <p>Eccentricity <hi rend="italic">= a.</hi></p>
                <p>These values of <hi rend="italic">t, u, r,</hi> serve to find the hour points by
                    calculation. They may also be found by this construction, fig. 15.</p>
                <p>Draw two straight lines Act, B6, intersecting at right angles in 0; and in OA,
                    one of these lines, take OD of any suitable length for the eccentricity of the
                    dial; draw DB so as to make with DO an angle equal to the latitude of the place;
                    then CB will be half the lesser axis, and B the twelve o’clock hour point.</p>
                <p>In OD, take OA and Oct each equal to DB; and Act will be the hour points for six
                    o’clock in the morning and evening.</p>
                <p>On 0 as a centre, with OA and OB as radii, describe circles, and divide the
                    quadrants in the same angle, each into six equal parts. From K, any one of the
                    divisions of the outer circle, draw KL perpendicular to Oct; and from <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> the corresponding point in the inner circle, draw⅛N
                    parallel to Oct, meeting KL in N; this will be one of the hour points, and in
                    the same way may all the others be found. At the point D make angles ODE, ODc,
                    each 23⅜ degrees, the sun’s greatest declination; and E, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> shall be the positions of the bottom of the style at the solstices, that
                    of the summer being on the north of 0, the middle bf the dial. Describe a circle
                    with DO as a radius, and find the tangents of the series of arcs 1°, 2°, 3°,
                    &amp;c. of that circle, and lay them down as a scale from 0 to E and e, on each
                    side. Find, in the tables which conclude this article, the sun’s declination on
                    the first day of every month, and mark the beginning of the month on the scale E
                    opposite to its Corresponding degree of declination. As many of the intermediate
                    days may in like manner be laid down as there is room for.</p>
                <p>The style must now, by some contrivance, be placed over the scale, so as to admit
                    of sliding along it, and being set to any day, and the dial is finished.</p>
                <p>If a dial of this kind be united to a horizontal dial, as they can only show the
                    same hour when their meridian lines arc in their true position, the compound
                    dial may be set to show time without the help of a compass or meridian line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lamberis</hi><hi rend="italic">Dial.</hi></p>
                <p>88. This is a particular case of the class of dials with a variable centre. It
                    was given by Μ. Lambert in the <hi rend="italic">Eerlin Ephemerides</hi> for
                    1777.</p>
                <p>It has been found (art. 86), that L being put to denote the latitude, and E the
                    angle which the style is to make with the meridian line, the semiaxes of the
                    ellipse, which is the locus of the hour points, are <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    z</hi><hi rend="italic">. a</hi> sin. E</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a</hi> cotan. (E — L), — <hi rend="subscript"> rrς</hi> —.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> v 7</hi> sm. (Ľ—L)</p>
                <p>Now these will be equal, if the cosine of E — L be equal to the sine of E, that
                    is, if E — L + E = 90°, or E =∙∣ (90 + L). When E, the elevation of the style,
                    has this value, the hour points are in the circumference of a circle. At London
                    E would be 70° 45'.</p>
                <p>Lambert’s dial may be constructed geometrically thus: (see fig. 14 of Plate
                    CLXXXVIIL)</p>
                <p>Take a straight line OD of any length, and draw a perpendicular OB. At the point
                    D, make the angle ODB equal to half the sum of 90° and the latitude of the
                    place, and OB will be the radius of the dial.</p>
                <p>Describe a circle about 0 as a centre, with the radius OB, and divide the
                    quadrants each into six equal parts, and the points of division will be the hour
                    points on the dial.</p>
                <p>Draw the lines DE, De, and make a scale of tangents of the sun’s declination from
                    0 to E and e, and against the divisions of the scale write the days of the month
                    exactly as directed in the Analemmatic dial. Also place the style over the
                    meridian, so that it may be adjusted to the time of the year, and make with the
                    meridian line an angle equal to BDO, and the dial will be constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The style must be on the
                    north or south of the point 0, according as the sun is on the north or south
                    side of the equator.</p>
                <p>In these dials, instead of making the style moveable, it might be fixed, and
                    different sets of hour points found for different days of the year. This,
                    however, would make the construction laborious.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have given the theory of the dials, along with their construction. In
                    what follows, we shall, for the sake of brevity, simply give their construction.
                    In general, the theory is just an application of what has been already
                    delivered.</p>

                    the hour of XII. noon being at A. The half hours and quarters may also be laid
                    down by subdivision. At A, the extremity of the diameter, draw a line AD, making

                <p><hi rend="italic">Dial on a Cylinder.</hi></p>
                <p>91. This dial is represented by fig. 4, Plate CLXXXVI. It shows the hour of the
                    day, the sun’s place in the ecliptic, and his altitude at the time of
                    observation. The dial is constructed by tracing the lines on a rectangular piece
                    of paper (fig. 5), and pasting it on the surface of the cylinder. The lines may
                    be traced by the following rules. Having formed on paper a rectangle ABDC, of
                    such a size that, when wrapped round the cylinder, its opposite sides AC, BD,
                    may just coincide; produce the side BA to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> any
                    convenient distance, and on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    centre, with the distance <hi rend="italic">aA,</hi> describe the quadrantal arc
                    AĽ, and divide it into ninety equal parts for degrees; draw lines from the
                    centre through as many divisions of the quadrant as there are degrees of the
                    sun’s altitude in the longest day of the year at noon of the place for which the
                    dial is to serve, which at London is 62°, and continue these lines until they
                    meet the tangent line AC. From the points of meeting draw lines across the
                    rectangle parallel to AB, as shown in the figure, and these will be the
                    parallels of the sun’s altitude, in whole degrees, from sunrise to sunset, on
                    all the days of the year.</p>
                <p>Divide AB, CD, the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, into twelve equal parts
                    for the signs of the ecliptic, and draw straight lines, joining the points of
                    division, on which, at the bottom, place the characters of the signs, as in the
                    figure. The twelve divisions should be subdivided by parallel lines into halves,
                    and, if there be room, into quarters.</p>
                <p>At the top of the rectangle make a scale of the months and days of the year, so
                    as that the division of the scale for each day may stand over the division for
                    the sun’s place on that day in the scale of signs. The sun’s place in the
                    ecliptic each day of the year 1830, the second after leap year, is given at the
                    end of this article, and may serve for this scale. Compute the sun’s altitude
                    for every hour in the latitude of the place, when he is in the beginning and
                    middle of each sign, and in the upright parallel lines make marks for these
                    computed altitudes among the parallels of altitude, reckoning them downward
                    according to the order of the numeral figures set to them along the side BD,
                    answering to the divisions of the quadrant on the opposite side; and through
                    these marks draw the curve hour lines, and set the hours to them, as in the
                    figure, reckoning the forenoon hours downwards, and the afternoon hours upwards.
                    The sun’s altitude should also be computed for the half hours; as to the quarter
                    hour points, they may be put nearly in their proper place by estimation with the
                    eye.</p>
                <p>The scales and hour lines being constructed, the part of the paper on which the
                    quadrant was drawn is to be cut off along the line AC, and that on the opposite
                    side along BD. The superfluous parts at the top and bottom are also to be
                    removed, and it will be fit for being pasted round the cylinder.</p>
                <p>The cylinder, reduced in size, is represented by ABCD, fig. 4. It should be
                    hollow, to hold the style DEe when it is not used. The crooked end of the style
                    is put into a hole in the top AD of the cylinder, which fits on it tightly, and
                    may be turned round, like the lid of a paper snuffbox. The style must stand
                    straight out, perpendicular to the side of the cylinder, just over the line AB,
                    round the top from which the parallels of the sun’s altitude are reckoned; and
                    the length of the style, projecting beyond the cylinder, must be exactly equal
                    to <hi rend="italic">Aa,</hi> the radius of the quadrant in fig. 5.</p>
                <p>To use the dial, place the base of the cylinder on a level table where the sun
                    shines, and turn the top round till the style stand directly over the day of the
                    month; then turn <pb break="no" facs="nls:194757386"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7386-0778"/>the cylinder about on the table till the shadow
                    falls on it parallel to those upright lines which divide the signs, that is,
                    till the shadow be parallel to the (supposed) axis of the cylinder; and then the
                    point or lowest shadow will fall upon the time of the day among the curve hour
                    lines, and will show the sun’s altitude at that time, among the cross parallels
                    of his altitude which go round the cylinder; at the same time it will indicate
                    the sign of the ecliptic in which the sun is.</p>
                <p>The dial may also, when used, be suspended by the ring F in its top. Dials of
                    this kind, of rather rude construction, are sometimes used by the rural
                    population in France.</p>
                <p>92. The construction of this dial requires that the sun’s altitude be found for
                    any given hour of the day, knowing the latitude of the place and the sun’s
                    declination.</p>
                <p>Let D be the sun’s declination,</p>

                    rend="italic">z</hi> the sun’s altitude.</p>
                <p>Then 90° — D, 90° — L, 90° — <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> are the three sides of a
                    spherical triangle, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the angle opposite to the

                <p>From this formula, by giving different values to <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the

                <p>Ex. To find the sun’s altitude at ten in the forenoon or two in the afternoon on

                <p>The formula supposes that the latitude and declination are of the same name, that

                    remembered that cos. <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is a negative quantity, so that
                    the expression in which it occurs is subtractive.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ping Dial.</hi></p>
                <p>93. This kind of dial is shown in figure 7. It is formed of a brass ring or
                    rim,’usually about two inches in diameter, and one third of an inch in breadth.
                    In a point of this rim there is a hole, through which the sun’s light passes,
                    and forms a lucid speck on the opposite concave surface, on which the hours of
                    the day are marked.</p>
                <p>These divisions are made by describing a circle to represent the ring, and
                    drawing a horizontal chord EF; with this as a radius describe a quadrant FD, and
                    divide it into degrees, and through those which mark the sun’s altitude at every
                    hour of the day, at the time of either equinox, draw lines from E to the
                    opposite side of the circle, and there put the corresponding figures. Thus for a
                    place whose latitude is 51° 32', the XII. o’clock line will pass through 38° 38'
                    the colatitude, and the XI. and I. line through 36° 56', the X. and II. through
                    32° 36', the IX. and III. through 26° 5', the VIII. and IV. through 18° 8', and
                    the VII. and V. through 9° 17'. The dial, thus constructed, would only show time
                    at the equinox; but to make it perform the whole year, the hole is made
                    moveable, and the signs of the ecliptic or the days of the month are marked on
                    the convex surface of the ring by taking ET and E⅛ on each side of E, equal to
                    twice the sun’s declination when he enters any particular sign, as Taurus and
                    Pisces, and there marking the character of the sign or corresponding month, and
                    so for all the others; and by these the dial is rectified for the time of the
                    year. From the figure it appears that E XII. δ is equal to FE XII. or the
                    altitude of the sun in the equinox; but T XII. E is equal to the sun’s
                    declination in Taurus, because it is an angle at the circumference standing on
                    an arc which is double the declination; therefore T XII. δ is equal to the
                    meridian altitude when the sun enters Taurus, and a ray passing through the hole
                    at T will mark the XII. o’clock hour of that day. But this dial will not show
                    the'other hours exactly, because T III. <hi rend="italic">d</hi> exceeds E III.
                    <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the equinoctial hour, by the angle of declination, and
                    the same holds of the rest. To remedy this defect, the concave surface of the
                    ring has sometimes been made broader, and seven circles described upon it, the
                    middle one to represent the equinoctial, and the extremes the tropics; and on
                    these circles the hours have been marked as shown in a table of altitudes.</p>
                <p>To use the dial, set the moveable hole to the day of the month, or the degree of
                    the sun’s place in the ecliptic; then, suspending it by the ring, turn it
                    towards the sun till his rays point out the hour among the divisions <hi

                <p>94. This is represented in figure 6 of Plate CLXXXVI. It serves to show the time
                    of the day in any part of the earth, whereas the former is only adapted to a
                    particular latitude. It consists of two rings or flat circles from two to six
                    inches in diameter. The outer ring A represents the meridian of any place. Two
                    of its opposite quadrants are divided into 90°, serving, the one for north and
                    the other for south latitude. The inner ring represents the equator, and turns
                    within the outer on two pivots at the extremities of a diameter, where the hour
                    XII. is marked. A thin reglet or bridge goes across the circles, and in its
                    middle there is an opening, along which there slides a cursor C, having a small
                    hole in it for the sun to shine through. The middle of this bridge represents
                    the axis of the celestial sphere, and its extremities the poles; on one side of
                    it the signs of the zodiac are drawn, and on the other the days of the month. A
                    piece, to which a ring H is fixed, slides along the meridian; and the dial when
                    used is suspended by the ring.</p>
                <p>In this dial, the divisions laid down on the axis on either side of the centre
                    are the tangents of the angles of the sun’s declination, to a radius equal to
                    that of the brass circle, which represents the equator. These may be laid down
                    from a scale of equal parts, of which 1000 answer to the length of the semiaxes
                    from the centre to the equinoctial ring; and then the extreme divisions on the
                    axis will be at the distance of 434 of these equal parts (the tangent of 23°
                    29') from the division at the centre.</p>
                <p>To use this dial, place the line marked on the sliding piece (opposite to the
                    supporting ring) over the degree of the latitude of the place, and put the line
                    which crosses the hole of the cursor to the degree of the sign or to the day of
                    the month. Turn the inner ring on its pivots, and put it at right angles to the
                    outer; and suspend the instrument by the ring H, so that the middle of the
                    bridge (which is the axis of the diaD may be parallel to the axis of the world;
                    then turn its flat side towards the sun, so that his rays passing through the
                    little hole in the cursor may fall exactly on a line drawn round the middle of
                    the concave surface of the inner ring; and in this position<pb break="no"

                <p>96. The dial is represented in fig. 9, Plate CLXXXVI. It may be made of a thick
                    square piece of wood or hollow metal. The sides are cut into semicircular
                    hollows, on which the hours are placed, the style of each coming out from its
                    bottom as far as the ends of the hollow projects. The corners are cut into
                    angles, in the insides of which the hours are also marked; and the edge at the
                    end of each side of the angle serves as a style for easting a shadow on the
                    hours marked on the opposite side. In the middle of the uppermost plane there is
                    an equinoctial dial, in the centre of which an upright wire is fixed for casting
                    a shadow on the hours of that dial, and supporting a small terrestrial globe on
                    its top. The whole dial stands on a pillar rising out of a circular base, in
                    which there is a compass and magnetic needle for plaeing the meridian style
                    towards the south. The pillar has a joint with a graduated quadrant on it
                    (supposed to be hid from sight under the dial in its representation) for setting
                    the dial to the latitude of any given place. The equator of the globe is divided
                    into twenty-four equal parts, and the hours are laid down on it: the time of the
                    day may be shown by these hours when the sun shines on the globe.</p>
                <p>To construct the dial: On a square piece of wood or metal of proper thickness
                    draw the lines <hi rend="italic">ac, bd</hi> (fig. 8) at a distance equal to the
                    intended thickness of the style <hi rend="italic">abed</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and in the same manner trace out the form of the three other styles <hi
                    rend="italic">efgh, ihlm, nopq,</hi> all directed towards the centre of the
                    square. On <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as centres,
                    with such a radius as will leave sufficient strength of stuff, when the distance
                    KI is equal to Aα, describe the quadrantal arcs Ac, <hi rend="italic">Bd.</hi>
                    In like manner, with the same radius describe arcs in all the quadrantal
                    openings, leaving room, however, for the equinoctial dial in the middle. Divide
                    each quadrant into six equal parts for as many hours, as in the figure, and
                    subdivide these for half hours and quarters, numbering the whole eight quadrants
                    as in the figure. To laydown the hours in the angular spaces in the corners: On
                    K and I as centres, with a radius equal to KI, which is equal to Aα, describe
                    the arcs K√, <hi rend="italic">īt,</hi> meeting in <hi rend="italic">t.</hi>
                    Divide each are into four equal parts, and from the centres through the points
                    of division draw the right lines I 3, I 4, I 5,1 6,1 7, and K2, KI, K12, Kll;
                    and they will meet the sides of the angle where the hours should be marked.
                    These hour spaces should also be subdivided into quarters. Do the like for the
                    other three angles, determining in this way the hours shown as in the figure, in
                    which it will be observed that the dotted lines which are parallel are all
                    directed to the same hour of the day. The angular and quadrantal spaces should
                    now be cut out, quite through the solid material of which the dial is formed,
                    and the gnomons inserted in their proper position, observing that these should
                    be as broad as the dial is thick, and this breadth and thickness such as to keep
                    the shadows of the gnomons from ever falling quite out of the hollows, even when
                    the sun’s deelination is greatest. Lastly, construct the equinoctial dial in the
                    middle, agreeably to its theory in art. 19, and the dial will be finished.</p>
                <p>To rectify and use the dial: Place it with its base level, and the gnomons of the
                    quadrants directed to the cardinal points by means of the compass; then bend the
                    pillar in the joint, till the axis be inclined to the horizon at an <pb

                    the latitude of the place. The plane of the equinoctial dial will then be
                    parallel to the equator, the axis of the globe directed to the pole of the
                    heavens; and when the sun shines on the dial, the hours will be indicated by all
                    the parallel edges which cast a shadow, as well as by the axis of the globe and
                    the globe itself, which will show towhat places of the earth the sun is rising,
                    setting, and in the meridian.</p>

                <p>96. This is an equinoctial dial, which may be applied to the construction of a
                    dial on any kind of plane, by a process requiring no calculation. Suppose, for
                    example, the plane ABCD is horizontal, and that GEF is the meridian line,
                    assumed if the plane be moveable, or found if it be fixed. Place the equinoctial
                    dial H with its axis GI directed to the pole, or, in the present case, so as to
                    make with the meridian line an angle equal to the latitude of the place, with
                    the twelve o’clock hour line over the meridian line. If now EF, the lower edge
                    of the upright triangular support KEF, he along the meridian, and the edge EK
                    make with EF an angle equal to the latitude, the dial H will be in its proper
                    position when its axis GI is parallel to EK. Supposing now the whole apparatus
                    to be in a dark place, let a lighted candle be carried round GI, the axis of the
                    equinoctial dial, and let the position of the shadow on the horizontal plane be
                    noted when it falls on the successive hours of the equinoctial dial, then lines
                    from G through these positions will be the hour lines on the horizontal dial. In
                    this way a dial may be described on any plane whatever.</p>

                    dial IK, the horizontal dial ABC, and the vertical south dial; the same axis or
                    gnomon FHG serving all the three. The figure sufficiently explains its
                    construction and application. The method of tracing the hour lines proposed in
                    the preceding article may be applied to produce the horizontal and south dials

                <p>The dials which have been described in this article are all intended to show
                    astronomical or apparent time, of which the hours are equal, if we set aside the
                    equation of time. Such are the hours by which we reckon time; but besides these,
                    there are <hi rend="italic">Babylonian, Italian,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jewish</hi> hours.</p>
                <p>The Babylonian hours are reckoned from sun rising to sun rising, and are
                    twenty-four equal hours, nearly of the same length as the common hours, only
                    they are differently numbered.</p>
                <p>The Italian hours begin at sunset, and are numbered to twenty-four at sunset next
                    day. They also are equal, and nearly the same as the common hours.</p>
                <p>The Jewish hours, otherwise called the <hi rend="italic">old unequal
                    planetary</hi> hours, are reckoned from sunrise; and the day, from sunrise to
                    sunset, is divided into twelve equal parts or hours. The hours of one day,
                    however, will not be equal to those of another, at least in our climate, because
                    of the inequality of the length of the days.</p>
                <p>The older writers on dialling teach how to construct dials which shall show time
                    according to all these ways of dividing the day. They are, however, mere matters
                    of curiosity, and therefore we think it sufficient, in this work, to have thus
                    briefly noticed them. They are fully explained by Emerson in his <hi

                <p>The construction of some of the dials which have been described requires that the
                    sun’s place in the ecliptic, that is, his longitude reckoned from the beginning
                    of the sign Aries, and his declination for the different days of the year,
                    should be known. And in order to convert apparent time into true time, that is,
                    the time shown by the sun into the time shown by a good clock or watch going
                    uniformly, the equation of time is wanted for every day of the year. None of
                    these, however, can be exactly the same on the same day of every year at any
                    given place. Thus, at Greenwich, for four succeeding years beginning with 1820,
                    they were at noon on the first of March as follows:</p>

                <p>There are various reasons why the above three elements are not the same on the
                    same day of every year: the principal one is, because the sun requires nearly
                    six hours more than 365 days to complete a revolution in the ecliptic; and this
                    annual deficiency being compensated by the intercalary day in every fourth year,
                    after this interval the elements return nearly, but not exactly, to the same
                    value on the same day of the year. Our table corresponds to 1830, the second
                    after leap year. This will be sufficiently accurate for the construction of
                    dials, and finding true time by them for a considerable number of years to
                    come.</p>
                <p>The columns of the table containing the sun’s longitude and declination require
                    no explanation. The numbers in that for the equation of time have the signs of
                    addition ( + ) and of subtraction (—) annexed to them. Thus the sign + joined to

                    the equation is to be added to the time shown by the dial to get true time, or
                    that shown by the clock. Again, the sign — belongs to all days from 16th April
                    to 15th June inclusive, and shows that the equation must be subtracted from the
                    time shown by the dial, and so on throughout the year.</p>
