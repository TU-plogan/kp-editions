                    viceroyalty of New Grenada, bounded on the north-west by Panama, on the
                    north-east by the Gulf of Darien, on the east by the province of Carthagena, on
                    the south by Choco, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The country is for the
                    most part mountainous and rugged, but there are interspersed plains which are
                    very fertile, though deserted and uncultivated, and producing only a small
                    quantity of cacao or tobacco. It is watered by a number of rivers, the streams
                    of which wash down gold from the mountains. This province was the first place in
                    Terra Firma where the Spaniards established themselves; but most of the
                    settlements have since been abandoned, owing as much to the savage character of

                    measures twenty-six leagues from north to south, and nine from east to west.
                    Several rivers flow into it, the largest of which is the Atrato. The coast is
                    full of sharp and inaccessible shoals, and only'· towards the west and south are
                    there places fit for disembarking. The limits of the gulf are sometimes extended
                    to the sea which washes the shores of the provinces of Panama and Darien.</p>

                    land which unites North and South America, composed of the provinces of Panama
                    and Veragua, belonging to the republic of Colombia. It sweeps in the form of a
                    crescent about the great Bay of Panama on the south, and has the Gulf of Mexico
                    on the north. It is about 300 miles long, and generally about sixty wide, but
                    where narrowest, between the ports of Porto Bello and Panama, only thirty-seven.
                    This part is sometimes called the Isthmus of Panama. The country here is made up
                    of sickly valleys and stupendous mountains, which seem to be placed as eternal
                    barriers between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which can be distinctly seen
                    at the same time from the summits. These mountains render it impracticable to
                    cut a canal here, but by going to latitude 12° N. and joining the head of the
                    lake Nicaragua to a small river which runs into the Pacific Ocean, and forming a
                    canal thirty miles long, through a low level country, a communication might be
                    formed between the two seas.</p>

                    the rise, progress, and catastrophe of this ill-fated undertaking, Sir John
                    Dalrymple, in the second volume of his Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, has
                    given a very interesting account, authenticated in every particular by
                    unquestionable documents. The projector and leader of the Darien expedition was
                    a clergyman of the name of Paterson, who having a strong desire to see foreign
                    countries, made his profession the means of indulging it, by going to the new
                    western world on the pretence of converting the Indians to the <pb break="no"

                    the old. During his residence there he became acquainted with Captain Dampier
                    and Mr Wafer, who afterwards published, the one his voyages, and the other his
                    travels in the region where the separation is narrowest between the Atlantic and
                    the Pacific Oceans; and both of whom appear to have been men of considerable
                    observation. But he obtained much more knowledge from men who could neither read
                    nor write, by cultivating the acquaintance of some of the old buccaneers, who,
                    after surviving their glories and their crimes, <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    still, in the extremity of age and misfortune, recounted with transport the ease
                    with which they had passed and repassed from the one sea to the other, sometimes
                    in hundreds together, and driving strings of mules before them loaded with the
                    plunder of friends and of foes. Paterson having examined the places, satisfied
                    himself that on the Isthmus of Darien there was a tract of country running
                    across from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which the Spaniards had never
                    possessed, and inhabited by a people continually at war with them; that along
                    the coast, on the Atlantic side, there lay a string of islands called the
                    Sambaloes, uninhabited, and full of natural strength and of forests, from which
                    last circumstance one of them was called the <hi rend="italic">island of the
                    pines</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that the seas there were filled with turtle
                    and the manatee or sea cow; that midway between Porto-Bello and Carthagena, but
                    nearly fifty leagues distant from either, at a place called Acta, in the mouth
                    of the Darien, there was a natural harbour, capable of receiving the greatest
                    fleets, and defended from storms by other islands which covered the mouth of it,
                    and from enemies by a promontory which commanded the passage, and by hidden
                    rocks in the passage itself; that on the other side of the isthmus, and in the
                    same tract of country, there were natural harbours, equally capacious and well
                    defended; that the two oceans were connected by a ridge of hills, which by their
                    height created <hi rend="italic">a</hi> temperate climate in the midst of the
                    most sultry latitudes, and were sheltered by forests, but not rendered damp,
                    because the trees grew at a distance from each other, and had very little
                    underwood; that, contrary to the usual barren nature of hilly countries, the
                    soil was of a black mould two or three feet deep, and producing spontaneously
                    the fine tropical fruits and plants, roots and herbs; that roads might be formed
                    with ease along the ridge, by which mules, and even carriages, might pass from
                    the one sea to the other in the space of a day, and consequently that this
                    passage seemed to be pointed out by nature, as a common centre to connect
                    together the trade and intercourse of the universe.</p>
                <p>Paterson knew that ships which stretch in a straight line from one point to
                    another, and with one wind, run less risks, and require fewer hands, than ships
                    which pass through many latitudes, follow the windings of many coasts, and
                    require many winds; that vessels of seven or eight hundred tons burden are often
                    to be met in the South Sea, navigated by not more than eight or ten hands,
                    because these hands have little else to do than set their sails when they begin
                    their voyage, and to take them in when they end it; that as soon as ships from
                    Britain should get so far south as to reach the trade-wind, which seldom varies,
                    that wind would carry them to Darien, and the same wind would carry ships from
                    the Bay of Panama, on the opposite side of the isthmus, to the East Indies; that
                    as soon as ships coming from the East Indies to the Bay of Panama got so far
                    north as the latitude of 40°, to reach the westerly winds, which about that
                    latitude blow almost as regularly from the west as the trade-winds do from the
                    east, these winds would carry them, in the track of the Spanish Acapulco ships,
                    to the coast of Mexico, whence the land-wind, which blows for ever from the
                    north to the south, would carry them along the coast of Mexico into the Bay of
                    Panama. Thus, in going from Britain, ships would encounter no uncertain winds,
                    except during their passage south into the latitude of the trade-wind; and in
                    coming from India to the Bay of Panama they would meet no uncertain winds,
                    except in their passage north to the latitude of the westerly winds, and in
                    going from the other side of the isthmus to the east, with no uncertain wind
                    whatsoever. Gold was seen by Paterson in some places of the isthmus; and hence
                    an island on the Atlantic side was called the Gold island, and a river on the
                    side running to the Pacific was called the Golden river; but these were objects
                    which he regarded not at that time, because far greater were in his eye, namely,
                    the shortening of distances, the drawing of nations nearer to each other, the
                    preservation of the valuable lives of seamen, and the saving in freight, and in
                    time, so important to merchants, and to an animal whose life is of so short
                    duration as that of man.</p>
                <p>By this obscure Scotchman a project was formed to settle, on this neglected spot,
                    a great and powerful colony; not as other colonies have for the most part been
                    settled, by chance, and unprotected by the country whence they proceeded; but by
                    system, upon foresight, and to receive the ample protection of those governments
                    to whom he was to offer his project. And certainly no greater idea has been
                    formed since the time of Columbus.</p>
                <p>Paterson’s original intention was to submit his project to England, as the
                    country which had most interest in it, not only from the benefit common to all
                    nations, of shortening the length of voyages to the East Indies, but by the
                    effect which it would have had in connecting the interests of her European, West
                    Indian, American, African, and East Indian trade. Paterson, however, having few
                    acquaintances and no protection in London, thought of drawing the public eye
                    upon him, and ingratiating himself with moneyed men and with great men, by
                    assisting them to model a project, which was at that time in embryo, for
                    erecting the Bank of England. But that happened to him which has happened to
                    many projectors in his situation; the persons to whom he applied made use of his
                    ideas, took the credit of them to themselves, were civil to him for a while, and
                    neglected him afterwards. He therefore communicated his project of a colony only
                    to a few persons in London, and these few discouraged him.</p>
                <p>He next, submitted his project to the Dutch, the Hamburgers, and the elector of
                    Brandenburg; because, by means of the passage of the Rhine and Elbe through
                    their states, he thought that the great additional quantities of East Indian and
                    American goods which his colony would export to Europe would be distributed
                    throughout Germany. The Dutch and Hamburg merchants, although they had most
                    interest in the project, heard him with indifference; while the elector, who had
                    very little interest in it, received him with honour and kindness; but court
                    arts and false reports soon lost him even that prince’s favour.</p>
                <p>Paterson, on his return to London, formed a friendship with Mr Fletcher of
                    Saltoun, whose mind was inflamed with the love of public good, and all whose
                    ideas to procure it had a sublimity about them. Fletcher brought Paterson down
                    to Scotland, presented him to the Marquis of Tweeddale, then minister for that
                    country; and thereafter, with that power which a vehement spirit always
                    possesses over a diffident one, persuaded the marquis, by arguments of public
                    good, and the honour which would redound to his administration, to adopt the
                    project. Lord Stair and Mr Johnston, the two <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>
                    secretaries of state, patronised those abilities in Paterson which they
                    possessed in themselves; and the lord advocate, Sir James Stuart, the same
                    person who had adjusted the Prince of Orange’s <pb break="no"

                    the Revolution, and whose son had married a niece of Lord Stair, went naturally
                    along with his connections. These persons, in June 1695, procured a statute from
                    parliament, and afterwards a charter from the crown in terms thereof, for
                    creating a trading company to Africa and the new world, with power to plant
                    colonies and build forts, by consent of the inhabitants, in places not possessed
                    by other European nations.</p>
                <p>Paterson now finding the ground firm under him, and that he was supported by
                    almost all the power and talents of his country, the character of Fletcher, and
                    the sanction of an act of parliament and royal charter, threw his project boldly
                    before the public, and opened a subscription for a company. The frenzy of the
                    Scotch nation to sign the solemn league and covenant never exceeded the rapidity
                    with which they ran to subscribe to the Darien company. The nobility, the
                    gentry, the merchants, the people, the royal burghs without the exception of
                    one, and most of the other public bodies, subscribed. Young women threw their
                    little fortunes into the stock; and widows sold their jointures to get the
                    command of'money for the same purpose. Almost immediately L. 400,000 were
                    subscribed in Scotland, although there was not at that time above L.800,000 of
                    cash in the kingdom. The famous Mr Law, then a youth, afterwards confessed that
                    the facility with which he saw the passion of speculation communicate itself,
                    satisfied him of the possibility of producing the same effect by means of the
                    same cause, but upon a larger scale, when the Duke of Orleans engaged him
                    against his will to turn his bank into a bubble. Paterson’s project, which had
                    been received by strangers with fears when opened to them in private, filled
                    them with hopes when it came to them upon the wings of public fame; for Colonel
                    Erskine, son of Lord Cardross, and Mr Haldane of Gleneagles, the one a generous
                    branch of a generous stem, and the other a country gentleman of fortune and
                    character, having been deputed to receive subscriptions in England and on the
                    Continent, the English subscribed L. 300,000, and the Dutch and Hamburgers
                    L.200,000 more.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the jealousy of trade, which has done more mischief to the
                    commerce of England than all other causes put together, created an alarm in
                    England; and the Houses of Lords and Commons, without previous inquiry or
                    reflection, on the 13th of December 1695, concurred in a joint address to the
                    king against the establishment of the Darien company, as detrimental to the
                    interest of the East India Company. Soon afterwards the Commons impeached some
                    of their own countrymen for being instrumental in erecting the company, and also
                    some of the Scotch nation, one of whom was Lord Belhaven; that is to say, they
                    arraigned the subjects of another country for making use of their own laws.
                    Among six hundred legislators, notone had the sense, not to say genius, to
                    propose a committee of both parliaments to inquire into the principles and
                    consequences of the establishment; and if these should, upon inquiry, be found
                    sound and beneficial, that the advantage should be communicated, by a
                    participation of rights, to both nations. The king’s answer was, that he had
                    been ill advised in Scotland. He soon afterwards changed his Scottish ministers,
                    and sent orders to his resident at Hamburg to present a memorial to the senate,
                    in which he disowned the company, and warned them against all connections with
                    it. The senate transmitted the memorial to the assembly of merchants, who
                    returned it with the following spirited answer: “We look upon it as a very
                    strange thing, that the king of Britain should offer to hinder us, who are a
                    free people, to trade with whom we please; but are amazed to think that he would
                    hinder us from joining with his own subjects in Scotland, to whom he had lately
                    given such large privileges, by so solemn an act of parliament.” But the
                    merchants, seeing the scheme discouraged by their governments, were soon
                    intimidated; and the Dutch, Hamburg, and London merchants withdrew their
                    subscriptions.</p>
                <p>The Scotch, not discouraged, were rather animated by this oppression; for they
                    converted it into a proof of the envy of the English, and of their consciousness
                    of the great advantages which were to flow to Scotland from the colony. The
                    company proceeded to build six ships in Holland, from thirty-six to sixty guns,
                    and they engaged 1200 men for the colony; amongst whom were younger sons of many
                    of the noble and ancient families of Scotland, and sixty officers who had been
                    disbanded at the peace, who carried with them such of their private men,
                    generally raised on their own or the estates of their relations, as they knew to
                    be faithful and brave, most of them being Highlanders. The Scotch parliament, on
                    the 5th August 1698, unanimously addressed the king to support the company. The
                    lord president Sir Hugh Dalrymple, brother of Lord Stair, and head of the bench,
                    and the lord advocate Sir James Stuart, head of the bar, jointly drew up
                    memorials to the king, able in point of argument, information, and arrangement,
                    in which they defended the rights of the company upon the principles of
                    constitutional and of public law; and neighbouring nations, with a mixture of
                    surprise and respect, saw the poorest kingdom of Europe sending forth the most
                    gallant and the most numerous colony which had ever set out from the old to the
                    new world.</p>
                <p>On the 26th day of July 1698, the whole city of Edinburgh poured down to Leith to
                    see the colony depart, amidst the tears, and prayers, and praises of.relations,
                    and friends, and countrymen. Many seamen and soldiers, whose services had been
                    refused, because more had offered themselves than were needed, were found hid in
                    the ships, and, when ordered ashore, clung to the ropes and timbers, imploring
                    to go without reward along with their companions. Twelve hundred men sailed in
                    five stout ships, and arrived at Darien in two months, with the loss of only
                    fifteen of their people. At that time it was in their power, most of them being
                    well born, and all of them hardily bred and inured to the fatigues and dangers
                    of the late war, to have marched from the northmost part of Mexico to the
                    southmost point of Chili, and to have overturned the whole empire of Spain in
                    South America. But modest respecting their own and their country’s character,
                    and afraid of its being alleged that they had plunder, and not a settlement, in
                    view, they began with purchasing lands from the natives, and sending messages of
                    amity to the Spanish governors within their reach; and then fixed their station
                    at Acta, calling it <hi rend="italic">New St Andrew,</hi> from the name of the
                    tutelar saint of Scotland, and the country itself <hi rend="italic">New
                    Caledonia.</hi> One of the sides of the harbour being formed by a long narrow
                    neck of land which ran into the sea, they cut it across so as to join the ocean
                    and the harbour. Within this defence they erected their fort, planting upon it
                    fifty pieces of cannon. On the other side of the harbour there was a mountain
                    about a mile in height, on which they placed a watch-house, which, in the
                    rarefied air within the tropics, so favourable for vision, gave them an immense
                    range of prospect, in order to prevent all surprise. To this place it was
                    observed that the Highlanders often repaired to enjoy the cool air, and to talk
                    of their friends whom they had left behind on their native hills. The first
                    public act of the colony was to publish a declaration of freedom of trade and
                    religion to all nations. This luminous idea originated with Paterson.</p>
                <p>But the Dutch East India Company having pressed the king, in concurrence with his
                    English subjects, to prevent <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755436?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-5436-0628"/> the settlement at Darien, orders had been sent
                    from England to the governors of the West Indian and American colonies, to issue
                    proclamations against giving assistance, or even holding correspondence with the
                    colony; and these were more or less harshly expressed, according to the temper
                    of the different governors. The Scotch, trusting to far different treatment, and
                    to the supplies which they expected from these colonies, had not brought
                    sufficient provisions along with them, and fell into diseases from bad or
                    inadequate food; but the more generous savages, by hunting and fishing for them,
                    afforded them that relief which fellow Britons had refused. They lingered eight
                    months, waiting in vain for assistance from Scotland, and almost all of them
                    either died out or quitted the settlement. Paterson, who had been the first to
                    enter the ship at Leith, was the last to go on board at Darien.</p>
                <p>During the space of two years, while the establishment of his colony had been in
                    agitation, Spain had made no complaint to England or Scotland against it. The
                    Darien council even averred in their papers, which are in the Advocates’
                    Library, that the right of the company was debated before the king, in presence
                    of the Spanish ambassador, ere the colony left Scotland. But now, on the 3d of
                    May 1698, the Spanish ambassador at London presented a memorial to the king, in
                    which he complained of the settlement at Darien as an encroachment on the rights
                    of his master.</p>
                <p>The Scotch, ignorant of the misfortunes of their colony, but provoked at this
                    memorial, soon afterwards sent out another colony of 1300 men, to support an
                    establishment which was now no more; but this last expedition having been more
                    hastily prepared than the first, proved unlucky in its passage. One of the
                    vessels was lost at sea, many men died on board, and the rest arrived at
                    different times, broken in their health, and dispirited when they heard the fate
                    of those who had gone before them. Added to the misfortunes of the first colony,
                    the second had a misfortune peculiar to itself. The General Assembly of the
                    Church of Scotland sent out four ministers, with orders to take charge of the
                    souls of the colony, and to erect a presbytery, with a moderator, clerk, and
                    record of proceedings; to appoint ruling elders, deacons, overseers <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the manners of the people, and assistants in the exercise
                    of church discipline and government, and to hold regular kirk-sessions. When
                    they arrived, the officers and gentlemen were occupied in building houses for
                    themselves with their own hands, because there was no assistance to be got from
                    others; yet the four ministers complained grievously that the council did not
                    order houses to be immediately built for their accommodation. They had not had
                    the precaution to bring with them letters of recommendation from the directors
                    at home to the council abroad; and on these accounts, not meeting with all the
                    attention they expected from the higher, they paid court to the inferior ranks
                    of the colonists, and by this means sowed divisions in the colony. They
                    exhausted the spirits of the people, by requiring their attendance at sermon
                    four or five hours at a time, relieving each other by preaching alternately, but
                    allowing no relief whatever to their hearers. The employment of one of the days
                    set aside for religious exercise, which was Wednesday, they divided into three
                    parts; thanksgiving, humiliation, and supplication, in which three ministers
                    followed one another. And as the service of the church of Scotland consists of a
                    lecture with a comment, a sermon, two prayers, three psalms, and a blessing, the
                    work of the day, upon an average of the length of the service in that age, could
                    not occupy less than twelve hours, during which time* the colony was collected,
                    and kept crowded together in the guard-room, which was used as a church, in a
                    tropical climate, and in a sickly season. The preachers presented a paper to the
                    council, which they took care to make public, requiring them to set aside a day
                    for solemn fasting and humiliation; and, under pretence of enumerating the sins
                    of the people, they poured out abuse on their rulers. They damped the courage of
                    the people by continually representing hell as the termination of life to most
                    men, because most men are sinners. Carrying the presbyterian doctrine of
                    predestination to an extreme, they put a stop to all exertions, by showing that
                    the consequences of these depended not on the individuals by whom they were
                    made, but on an all-controlling and irresistible power, by which, independently
                    of human efforts andvolitions, everything was necessarily determined. They
                    converted the numberless accidents to which soldiers and seamen are exposed into
                    immediate judgments of God against their sins; and, having resolved to quit the
                    settlement, they, in excuse for doing so, wrote bitter letters to the general
                    assembly against the characters of the colonists, and the advantages of the
                    colony itself. One of these men, in a kind of history <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the colony which he published, exulted with a savage triumph over the
                    misfortunes of his countrymen. “They were such a rude company,” said he, “that I
                    believe Sodom never declared such impudence in sinning as they. An observant eye
                    might see that they were running the way they went; hell and judgment was to be
                    seen upon them, and in them, before the time. Their cup was full; it could hold
                    no more: they were ripe; they must be cut down with the sickle of the wrath of
                    God.”</p>
                <p>The last party which joined the second colony atDarien, after it had been three
                    months settled, was Captain Campbell of Finab, with a company of the people of
                    his own estate, whom he had commanded in Flanders, and whom he carried to Darien
                    in his own ship. On their arrival at New St Andrew, they found that intelligence
                    had been received that a Spanish force of 1600 men, which had been brought from
                    the coast of the South Sea, lay encamped at Tubucantee, waiting there till a
                    Spanish squadron of eleven ships which was expected should arrive, when they
                    were jointly to attack the fort. The military command was offered to Captain
                    Campbell, in compliment to his reputation and to his birth as a descendant of
                    the families of Breadalbane and Atholl. In order to prevent a joint attack, he
                    resolved to attack first; and therefore on the second day after his arrival, he
                    marched with two hundred men to Tubucantee, before his approach could be known
                    to the enemy, stormed the camp in the nighttime, dissipated· the Spanish force
                    with much slaughter, and returned to the fort the fifth day. But he found the
                    Spanish ships off the harbour, their troops landed, and almost all hope of aid
                    or of provisions cut off; yet he stood a sicge of nearly six weeks, until almost
                    all the officers had died, the enemy by their approaches had cut off his wells,
                    and his ammunition had been so far expended that he was obliged to melt the
                    pewter dishes of the garrison into balls. The garrison then capitulated, and
                    obtained not only the common honours of war and security for the property of the
                    company, but, as if they had been conquerors, even exacted hostages for the
                    performance of the conditions. Captain Campbell alone desired to be excepted
                    from the capitulation, saying, that he was sure the Spaniards would not forgive
                    him the mischief which he so lately had done them. But the brave, by their
                    courage, often escape that death which they seem to provoke. Captain Campbell
                    made his escape in his vessel, and arrived safely at New York, whence he
                    proceeded to Scotland, where the company presented him with a gold medal, in
                    which his bravery was duly commemorated. The lord-lyon king-at-arms, whose
                    office it is in Scotland to confer badges of distinction upon honourable actions
                    ac∙</p>

                <p>cording to the rules of heraldry, also granted him a Highlander and an Indian as
                    supporters to his coat of arms.</p>
                <p>But a harder fate attended those whom Captain Campbell left at Darien. They were
                    so weak in their health as not to be able to weigh up the anchors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rising Sun,</hi> one of their ships, which carried sixty guns; the
                    generous Spaniards, however, assisted them. In going out of the harbour the
                    vessel ran aground. The prey was tempting; and, to obtain it, the Spaniards had
                    only to stand by and look on; but they showed that mercy to the Scotch in
                    distress which one of their own countrymen, General Elliot, afterwards returned
                    to the posterity of those Spaniards at the siege of Gibraltar. The Darien ships
                    being leaky and weakly manned, were obliged in their voyage to take shelter in
                    different ports belonging to Spain and England. But the Spaniards in the new
                    world treated them with uniform kindness, while the English governments showed
                    them none; and one of their ships was seized and detained. In fact, only Captain
                    Campbell’s ship and another small one were saved. The <hi rend="italic">Rising
                    Sun</hi> was lost on the bar of Charlestown; and of the colony, not more than
                    thirty, saved from war, shipwreck, or disease, ever returned to their native
                    country.</p>
                <p>Paterson, who had withstood the blow, could not endure the reflection of
                    misfortune. He was seized with a lunacy in his passage home, after the ruin of
                    the first colony; but he recovered in his own country, where his spirit, still
                    ardent and unbroken, presented a new plan to the company, founded on the idea of
                    King William, that England should have the joint dominion of the settlement with
                    Scotland. He survived many years in Scotland, pitied, respected, but neglected.
                    After the union of the two kingdoms, he claimed reparation of his losses from
                    the equivalent-money obtained by England to the Darien Company, but was paid
                    nothing; because a grant to him from a public fund would have been only an act
                    of humanity, and not a political job. Thus ended the colony of Darien; an
                    adventure which, in its disastrous results, inflicted a severe blow upon
                    Scotland, and excited feelings of deep hostility towards the English government
                    and nation, which half a century was scarcely sufficient to extinguish.</p>
