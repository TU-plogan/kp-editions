                <p>The greater part of this province, especially the western portion of it, named
                    the Hurrianah, suffers greatly during the hot season from the want of water,
                    which can only be procured from wells dug in many cases to the depth of from 120
                    to 150 feet. The country is an extensive plain, free from jungle·; but owing to
                    the depth to which the ground must be penetrated for water, it has no artificial
                    means of irrigation, and farther west this difficulty increases. The best
                    cultivated part of this portion of the province is the country on the banks of
                    the Cauggar or Goggur river, which being overflowed during the rainy season,
                    yields good pasture, and produces wheat, barley, and sugar cane. It
                    unfortunately happens that the Jumna, which runs through the province, and
                    regularly overflows its banks, is in the lower part of its course so impregnated
                    with natron that it confers no fertility on the adjacent country between its
                    high banks, which is covered with a loose and perfectly barren sand like that of
                    the sea-shore. In ancient times a celebrated aqueduct, constructed in the first
                    instance by a Persian nobleman, and further enlarged and improved with branches
                    and water-courses by Ferose III. in 1308, was conducted from the Jumna
                    immediately on its leaving the mountains, and whilst its stream is yet pure and
                    wholesome, for a distance of 120 miles through the country. It was a noble work,
                    which gave fertility to a large district along its banks, and was the sole
                    source of vegetation<pb break="no" facs="nls:194756164"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6164-0684"/> in the gardens of Delhi, besides furnishing the
                    inhabitants with the only drinkable water within their reach. This aqueduct,
                    which, from indolence, neglect, and the devastations of intestine war to which
                    this province was long exposed, had been allowed to go entirely into disrepair,
                    was re-opened by the British government in 1820, to the great joy of the
                    inhabitants of Delhi, who went out in jubilee to meet its stream, throwing
                    flowers, ghee, and other things into the water, and calling down all manner of
                    blessings on the British government, “who,” says Heber, “have indeed gone far,
                    by this measure, to redeem themselves from the weight of, I fear, a good deal of
                    impolicy.” The supply of water derived from this aqueduct enables the
                    inhabitants in a large tract of country to have •recourse to irrigation, and
                    thus to render the soil productive. In 1822 Zabeta Khan’s or the Great Doab
                    Canal, which passes through Saharanpore, Rampoor, Shamlce, ancLother towns of
                    note, was surveyed. This canal is connected with the Jumna a few miles below
                    where it issues from the mountains, and after a course of 150 miles again joins
                    that river nearly opposite to Delhi, fertilizing an extensive tract of country
                    formerly rich and populous, but latterly sterile and waste. The eastern parts of
                    Delhi, namely, Rohilcund, including the districts of Moradabad and Bareilly, are
                    better watered and more fertile. The principal rivers are the Ganges and the
                    Ramgunga; the latter traversing Rohilcund in nearly its whole extent, and
                    uniting with the Ganges near Kanoje. The Goggra or Sarjou passes the north-east
                    corner; and there arc, besides, many smaller rivers issuing from the northern
                    mountains, which conduce to the fertility of the soil, being distributed by
                    means of canals and reservoirs: water is also found here by digging a few feet
                    into the ground. Throughout the whole extent of this country the surface is
                    flat, being part of the great plain reaching from the northern hills to the sea,
                    through which flow the Ganges and its innumerable tributary streams. Several of
                    the mountain streams, as the Sarda, the Kurnal, and the Cou-riallah, roll down
                    gold, which is found in their sands, and is collected by a particular caste of
                    people. The Kosilu river, in Bareilly, is navigable during the rains, and serves
                    to float down large timber. Sugar, cotton, and grain are the chief products of
                    the eastern parts of Delhi.' Prior to 1809 these districts were annoyed by
                    formidable bands of gang-robbers, who were in such force that they kept at bay
                    the ordinary police establishments of the country. These depredators had
                    acquired such a perfect knowledge of the intricate jungles and numerous fords of
                    the Ganges, that they were enabled to cross and return as often as they pleased,
                    and so intimidated the inhabitants that the latter could not be brought to act
                    against them. By the great exertions of the British magistrates, however, these
                    bands, with their leaders, have been nearly exterminated. Many of those who
                    formerly subsisted by gang-robbery have been induced to cultivate the ground,
                    and to live peaceably, whilst the force stationed along the frontier prevents
                    the Bhurtpoor marauders from renewing their depredations so often as they
                    formerly used to do. Highway robberies do sometimes still occur, however, and
                    are generally attended with murder; but on the whole the amendment has been
                    great and visible; so that a European under ordinary circumstances may travel in
                    safety through any part of the province.</p>
                <p>Many parts of this province have been the scene of civil strife and of foreign
                    war, and have been exposed to general devastation and misery. In 1774 the
                    Rohillas were entirely defeated by the British, and their country given up to
                    waste and plunder. Tracts formerly under cultivation are now converted into
                    extensive wastes covered with Jong grass, which in the hot season is easily
                    inflamed, and abounds with foxes, jackals, hogs, hares, and every sort of game,
                    which ranges over these plains unmolested. The country was afterwards exposed to
                    the exactions of the nabob of Oude’s servants; and from this period may be dated
                    the decline of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures. In 1782 and 1785 it was
                    again plundered by the Sikks, which gave the finishing blow to its prosperity.
                    The country has made advances under the administration of the British, having
                    enjoyed domestic tranquillity, but it has by no means attained to its ancient
                    prosperity; and the policy of the East India Company, which increases the land
                    assessment with the progress of cultivation, tends to repress the spirit of
                    improvement. The staple commercial articles in Rohilcund are cotton cloths and
                    sugar, to which the raw material of cotton has recently been added. In the
                    district of Bareilly a species of rice is cultivated <hi rend="italic">of
                    an</hi> excellent flavour, and superior to the finest sort of what is called
                    Patna rice; the sugar produced is reckoned superior to that of any other part of
                    Hindustan; and in remote times the sugar-cane was cultivated to a great extent.
                    The articles of trade brought from the hills consist of borax, bees-wax, musk,
                    gums, drugs of various kinds, cow-tails, copper and iron, and small quantities
                    of unrefined gold. The returns are made in white cloths, tobacco, and sugar.
                    There are extensive forests at the foot of the hills, which abound with the tree
                    which yields the kut, an article of general consumption along with the betel,
                    and which is also used in dying. These hills contain also copper and iron, which
                    the natives collect either on the surface or after very slight excavations. Salt
                    is imported into Rohilcund in great quantities. Many labourers find employment
                    in cutting down the wood of the forests. Bamboos and various other sorts of
                    trees abound; also large pine trees ninety feet in height, which are floated
                    down the rivers for sale. Elephants are caught below the hills, and form an
                    article of trade. The soil here is fertile, and produces grain, sugar, cotton,
                    indigo, and tobacco. In summer, notwithstanding the northern latitude of this
                    province, the beatis intense; whilst in the winter the wind that blows from the
                    northern mountains causes the thermometer to fall during the winter months to
                    thirty degrees, and water freezes in the tents.</p>
                <p>The country to the north-west of the Jumna and south of the Suttledge is occupied
                    by a number of petty Sikk chiefs and other native princes in dependence on the
                    British. This country was formerly a scene of constant strife, but is now
                    maintained in tolerable order by a British detachment stationed at Ludecana on
                    the Suttledge.</p>
                <p>The principal towns in the province are Delhi, Sirhind, Saharanpoor, Bareilly,
                    Anopshehr, Meerut, Hissar, Seerd-huna, Patealah, and Budayoon. The inhabitants
                    are a handsome and robust race of men, and are a mixture of Hindus,
                    Mahomrnedans, and Sikks, the religion of the latter being very prevalent in the
                    northern districts. The population of the province may be estimated at five
                    millions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Delhi,</hi> a celebrated city, capital of the above
                    province, and for many years the capital of the Patan and Mogul empires,
                    situated on the banks of the Jumna. During the era of its splendour it is said
                    to have occupied a space of twenty miles round; and its great extent is still
                    attested by the ruins, which cover a vast surface. The inhabited part of the
                    town is about seven miles in circuit; it is seated on a range of rocky hills,
                    and is surrounded by an embattled wall, which the English government have put
                    into repair, and have strengthened with bastions, a moat, and a regular glacis.
                    The city has seven gates, namely, the Lahore gate, the Ajmeer gate, Turkoman
                    gate, Delhi gate, Mohur gate, Cabul gate, and Cashmere gate; all built of
                    freestone. The houses within the walls <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756177"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6177-0685"/>are many of them large and high. The streets are
                    in general narrow, with the exception of two; the first leading from the palace
                    to the Delhi gate, which had formerly an aqueduct along its whole extent; and
                    the second from the palace to the Lahore gate. These are really wide, handsome,
                    and, for an Asiatic city, remarkably cleanly. The breadth of the first may be
                    about equal to that of Pall-Mall, and is called Chandnee Chokee, or
                    Silversmiths’ Street, though there is no great number of that trade in it. The
                    city is partitioned into thirty-six divisions, each named after a particular
                    nobleman who resides there, or from some local circumstance. It contains a great
                    number of mosques, with high minarets and gilded domes, and the remains of many
                    splendid palaces belonging to the great omrahs of the empire. They are all
                    surrounded with high walls, and occupy a considerable space of ground, as they
                    comprehend gardens, baths, stables for all sorts of animals, and music
                    galleries, besides an extensive seraglio. Above all is seen the imperial palace,
                    a very high and extensive cluster of Gothic towers and battlements. It was built
                    by Shah Jehan, on the west bank of the Jumna, and is surrounded on three sides
                    by an embattled Avail sixty feet high, built of red granite, with small round
                    towers, and two noble gateways, each defended by an outer barbican of the same
                    construction, though of less height, and the whole surrounded by a Avide moat.
                    It is a place of no strength; but, “as a kingly residence,” says Heber, “it is
                    one of the noblest that I have seen. It far surpasses the Kremlin; but I do not
                    think that, except in the durability of its materials, it equals Windsor.”
                    Adjoining to it is the fortress of Selhnghur, now in ruins. The gardens of
                    Shalimar Avere made by the Emperor Shah Jehan, and are said to have cost one
                    million sterling; but, like his other Avorks, they are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >uoav</hi> in ruins. 'They are surrounded by a brick Avail, and Avere about a
                    mile in circumference.</p>
                <p>There are many fine mosques in Delhi, still in good repair, the chief of Avhich
                    are the Jumna Musjeed and the Kala Musjeed. The former is advantageously
                    elevated on a small rocky eminence to the full height of the surrounding houses.
                    It was begun by Shah Jehan in the fourth year of his reign, and Avas completed
                    in the tenth. In front it has a large square court, surrounded by a cloister
                    open on both sides. It is paved Avith granite inlaid Avith marble, and commands
                    a vieAv of the whole city. In the centre is a great marble reservoir of Avater,
                    with some small fountains supplied by machinery from the canal. On its Avest
                    side, and rising at another flight of steps, is the mosque itself, which is
                    entered by three noble Gothic arches, surmounted by three domes of white marble.
                    It has at each end a very tall minaret. “The ornaments,” says Heber, “are less
                    florid, and the building less picturesque, than the splendid group of the
                    Imambora and its accompaniments at Lucknow; but the situation is far more
                    commanding and Bishop Heber was more impressed Avith the size, the solidity, and
                    rich materials of this building, than Avith any thing of the sort Avhich he had
                    seen in India. By the liberality of the British rulers, it is kept in excellent
                    repair, a grant having been made for this purpose, which has rendered them
                    exceedingly popular. The Kala Musjeed is small, and is chiefly worthy of notice
                    from its plainness, solidity, and great antiquity, being a Avork of the first
                    Patan conquerors in the times of primitive Mussulman simplicitv∙ Not far from
                    the palace is the pretty little mosque of Roshun ud Dowlah, with its three gilt
                    domes, on the porch of which it is said that, in 1739, Nadir Shah sat to
                    Avitness the massacre of the unfortunate inhabitants by his licentious soldiery;
                    and a gate leading to a bazar near it retains the name of “Coonia Dunvazu,” or
                    the Slaughter Gate. There are, besides, about forty other mosques, but of an
                    inferior size. The tombs of the imperial family at Delhi have several of them
                    the most splendid architectural ornaments. That of Humaioon, the second of the
                    Mogul dynasty who reigned over Hindustan, is a noble building of granite, inlaid
                    with marble, and in a very simple style of Gothic architecture. It is surrounded
                    by a large garden with terraces and fountains; and the garden itself is
                    surrounded by an embattled wall with tOAvers, four gateways, and a cloister
                    within all the way round. In the centre of the square is a platform of about
                    twenty feet high and <hi rend="smallcaps">Lave</hi> hundred feet square,
                    supported by cloisters, and ascended by four great flights of granite steps.
                    Above rises the tomb, also a square, with a great dome of Avhite marble in its
                    centre. The apartments within are a circular room, in the centre of which lies,
                    under a small raised slab, the mortal remains of the prince; and in the angles
                    are smaller apartments, Avhere other branches of his family are interred. About
                    a mile westward is another burying-ground, or collection of tombs and small
                    mosques, some of them very beautiful. The most remarkable is a little chapel in
                    honour of a celebrated Mussulman saint Nizam ud Deen; and around his shrine most
                    of the deceased members of the present imperial family lie buried, all in their
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">oavn</hi> little enclosures, surrounded by very elegant
                    lattice work of Avhite marble. From the gate of Agra to Humaioon’s tomb is a
                    very aAvful scene of desolation; “ruins after ruins,” says Bishop Heber, “tombs
                    after tombs, fragments of brick-Avork, freestone, granite, and marble, scattered
                    everyAvhere over a soil naturally rocky and barren, without cultivation except
                    in one or two small spots, and without a single tree.” Amongst these ruins is to
                    be seen one mass which is larger than the rest. This is the old Patan palace,
                    Avhich Avas a large and solid fortress, in a plain and unornamented style, and
                    chiefly remarkable for a high black pillar of cast metal, called Firose’s
                    Walking Stick, a Hindu emblem of Siva, as is supposed, concerning which there is
                    a tradition, that, whilst it stood, the children of Brahma were to bear rule in
                    Indraput, the name of the Hindu city Avhich preceded Delhi. The vanity of the
                    prediction appeared Avhen the country Avas conquered. The pillar is covered
                    Avith inscriptions, mostly in Persian and Arabic; but that Avhich probably
                    contains the prophecy is in a character obsolete and unknoAvn, a sure mark of
                    its high antiquity.</p>
                <p>Delhi has fallen from its ancient splendour; the fine manufactures of which it
                    Avas formerly the seat are greatly declined, and the commerce, for so large a
                    place, is inconsiderable. Cotton cloths and indigo are still manufactured in the
                    toAvn and neighbourhood; there is also a shawl manufactory carried on by
                    Cashmerian Aveavers with wool brought from the Himalaya. JeAvellery is executed
                    in great perfection. The chief imports are by the northern caravans, Avhich
                    amount to nine annually, and bring from Cashmere and Cabul shawls, fruit, and
                    horses.</p>
                <p>The ruins Avhich surround the present toAvn mark the site of old Delhi, which
                    Avas founded on the ruins of the still larger Hindu city of Indraput towards the
                    west. This city was taken in 1193 by the Mahommedans under Cut-tubaddeen Khan,
                    who fixed his residence there, and, upon his succeeding to the throne, made it
                    his capital. It Avas increased and improved, until, under the Afghan monarchs,
                    Agra was made the capital, Avhich continued to be the seat of empire till the
                    return of Humaioon from Persia in 1554. During the reigns of Akbar and
                    Jehangire, Delhi Avas deserted, but Avas restored to its ancient splendour by
                    the Emperor Shah Jehan, <hi rend="smallcaps">av1io</hi> founded the present
                    city, and removed to it many of its inhabitants; the others fol-loAved, to be
                    near the palace and the principal markets; and as, during the disorders of the
                    Mahratta government, it Avas unsafe to remain Avithout the Avalls, the old city
                    Avas soon entirely abandoned.</p>

                <p>Delhi is the residence of the Great Mogul, the representative of the house of
                    Timour, now reduced to a very low ebb by the political revolutions which have
                    taken place in India. He has been honourably treated by the English, who
                    assigned him an annual pension of ten, twelve, and ultimately of fifteen lacs of
                    rupees for his subsistence, and who treat him with all the outward homage of
                    royalty, acknowledging him as the sovereign of the country, and themselves as
                    his tributaries. Delhi, when it was formerly under the dominion of the
                    Mahrattas, was frequently the scene of disorder and bloodshed; but since it has
                    come under the dominion of the British, and tranquillity has been maintained in
                    the country, it has been increasing in population, and property of all
                    descriptions has been rising in value, especially houses and lands, which are
                    more than doubled. The travelling distance from Calcutta by Birbhoom is 976
                    miles.</p>
