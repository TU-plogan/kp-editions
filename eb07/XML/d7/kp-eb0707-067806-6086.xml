                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DEISTS</label>, a class of people known also under the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Frce-thinhers,</hi> whose distinguishing
                    character it is not to profess any particular form or system of religion; but
                    only to acknowledge the existence of a God, and to follow the light and law of
                    nature, rejecting revelation, and opposing Christianity.</p>
                <p>This name seems to have been first assumed as the denomination of a party about
                    the middle of the sixteenth <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6099-0679"/>century, by some gentlemen in France and Italy,
                    who were desirous of thus disguising their opposition to Christianity by a more
                    honourable appellation than that of atheists. Virot, an eminent reformer,
                    mentions certain persons, in his epistle dedicatory prefixed to the second
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Instruction</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrétienne,</hi> published in 1563, who called themselves by a new name, that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Deists.</hi> These, he tells us, professed to believe in
                    God, but showed no regard to Jesus Christ, and considered the doctrines of the
                    apostles and evangelists as fables and dreams. He adds, that they laughed at all
                    religion, though they outwardly conformed to the religion of those with whom
                    they lived, or whom they wished to please, or feared to offend. Some, he
                    observes, professed to believe the immortality of the soul, but others denied
                    both this doctrine and that of a providence. Many of them were considered as
                    persons of acute and subtile genius, and took pains in disseminating their
                    notions.</p>
                <p>The deists hold that, considering the multiplicity of religions, the numerous
                    pretences to revelation, and the precarious arguments generally advanced in
                    proof of them, the best and surest way is to return to the simplicity of nature
                    and the belief of one God, which is the only truth agreed to by all nations.
                    They complain, that the freedom of thinking and reasoning is oppressed under the
                    yoke of religion, and that the minds of men are ridden and tyrannized by the
                    necessity imposed on them of believing inconceivable mysteries; and contend that
                    nothing should be required to be assented to or believed but what their reason
                    clearly conceives.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing character of modern deists is, that they reject all revealed
                    religion, and discard all pretences to it, as the effects of imposture or
                    enthusiasm. They profess a great regard for natural religion, though they are
                    far from being agreed in their notions concerning it. They are classed by some
                    of their own writers as mortal and immortal deists; the latter acknowledging a
                    future state, and the former denying it, or representing it as very
                    uncertain.</p>
                <p>Dr Clarke distinguishes four sorts of deists. 1. Those who pretend to believe the
                    existence of an eternal, infinite, independent, intelligible Being, who made the
                    world, without concerning himself in the government of it. 2. Those who believe
                    the being and natural providence of God, but deny the difference of actions, as
                    morally good or evil, resolving it into the arbitrary constitution of human
                    laws, and who therefore suppose that God takes no notice of them. With respect
                    to both these classes, he observes that their opinions can consistently
                    terminate in nothing but downright atheism. 3. Those who have right
                    apprehensions concerning the nature, attributes, and allgoverning providence of
                    God, and seem also to have some notion of his moral perfections, though they
                    consider them as transcendent, and such in nature and degree that we can form no
                    true judgment, nor argue with any certainty, concerning them, but who deny the
                    immortality of human souls, alleging that men perish at death, and that the
                    present life is the whole of human existence. 4. Those who believe the
                    existence, perfections, and providence of God, the obligation of natural
                    religion, and a state of future retribution, on the evidence of the light of
                    nature, without a divine revelation. Such as these, he says, are the only true
                    deists; but their principles, he apprehends, should lead them to embrace
                    Christianity; and therefore he concludes that there is now no consistent scheme
                    of deism in the world.</p>
                <p>The first deistical writer of any note who appeared in this country was Lord
                    Herbert. He lived and wrote in the seventeenth century; and his book <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritate</hi> was first published at
                    Paris in 1624. This, together with his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Causis Errorum,</hi> and his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Religione</hi><hi rend="italic">Laici,</hi> were afterwards
                    published in London. His celebrated work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Religione Gentilium</hi> was published at Amster-^ dam in 1663 in
                    4to, and in 1700 in 8vo; and an English translation of it appeared at London in
                    1705. As he was one of the first who formed deism into a system, and asserted
                    the sufficiency, universality, and absolute perfection of natural religion, with
                    a view to discard all extraordinary revelation as useless and needless, we shall
                    subjoin the five fundamental articles of this universal religion. These are, 1.
                    That there is one supreme God: 2. That he is chiefly to be worshipped: 3. That
                    piety and virtue are the principal part of his worship: 4. That we must repent
                    of our sins, and if we do so God will pardon them: 5. That there are rewards for
                    good men, and punishments for bad men, both here and hereafter.</p>
