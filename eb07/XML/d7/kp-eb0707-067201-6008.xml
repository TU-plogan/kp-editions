                    folium,</hi> a leaf), the fall of the leaves. A term opposed <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi><hi rend="italic">frondescentia,</hi> the annual renovation of the
                    leaves, produced by the unfolding of the buds in spring.</p>
                <p>Most plants in cold and temperate climates shed their leaves every year. This
                    happens in autumn, and is generally announced by the flowering of the common
                    meadow saffron. The term is only applied to trees and shrubs; for herbs perish
                    down to the roots every year, losing stem, leaves, and all.</p>
                <p>All plants do not drop their leaves at the same time. Amongst large trees, the
                    ash and walnut, although the latest in unfolding, are soonest divested of them.
                    The latter seldom carries its leaves above five months. On the oak and hornbeam
                    the leaves die and wither as soon as the colds commence; but they remain
                    attached to the branches until they are pushed off by the new ones, which unfold
                    themselves the following spring. These trees are doubtless a kind of evergreens.
                    The leaves are probably destroyed only by cold; and perhaps would continue
                    longer on the plant, but for the force of the spring sap joined to the
                    moisture.</p>
                <p>In mild and dry seasons the liiach, privet, yellow jessamine of the woods, and
                    maple of Crete, preserve their leaves green until spring, and do not drop them
                    till the new leaves are beginning to appear. The fig-tree, and many other trees
                    that grow between the tropics, are of this particular class of evergreens. The
                    trees in Egypt, says Dr Hasselquist, cast their leaves in the latter end of
                    December and beginning of January, having young leaves ready before all the old
                    ones have fallen off; and, to forward this operation of nature, few of the trees
                    have buds; the sycamore and willow, indeed, have some, but with few and quite
                    loose <hi rend="italic">stipula</hi> or scales. Nature did not conceive buds to
                    be so necessary in the southern as in the northern countries; and this occasions
                    a great difference between them.</p>
                <p>Lastly, some trees and shrubs preserve their leaves constantly throughout the
                    whole year, and are not in the least influenced by the clemency or inclemency of
                    seasons. Such are the firs, juniper, yew, cedar, cypress, and many other trees,
                    hence denominated <hi rend="italic">evergreens.</hi> These preserve their old
                    leaves a long time after the formation of the new, and do not drop them at any
                    determinate time. In general the leaves of evergreens are harder and less
                    succulent than those which are renewed annually. The trees are generally natives
                    of warm climates; as the alaternuses of France and Italy, and the evergreen oak
                    of Portugal and Suabia.</p>
                <p>Some herbaceous perennials, as the house-leeks and navel-worts, enjoy the same
                    privilege with the evergreen trees, and resist the severities of winter; some
                    even can dispense with the earth for a time, being replete with juices, which
                    the leaves imbibe from the humidity of the atmosphere, and which in such plants
                    are of themselves sufficient for effecting the purposes of vegetation. It is for
                    this reason that, unless in excessive hot weather, gardeners seldom water fat
                    succulent plants, as the aloes, which rot when they are moistened, if the sun
                    does not quickly dry them up.</p>
                <p>The leaves of all the evergreen shrubs and trees have a thin compact skin or
                    cover over their surface, as is easily discovered by macerating them in water,
                    in order to separate the parenchyma or pulp from the vessels of the leaves,
                    which cannot be effected in any of these evergreens till a thin parchment-like
                    colour is taken off. These trees and shrubs are found by experiment to perspire
                    but little, when compared with others which shed their leaves; and it is perhaps
                    principally owing to this close covering, as also to the small proportion of
                    moisture contained in their vessels, that they retain their verdure, and
                    continue through the winter on the trees. The nutritive juices of these plants
                    always abound more or less with an oily quality, which secures them from being
                    injured by severe frosts; so that many of these evergreen trees are adapted to
                    grow in the coldest parts of the habitable world.</p>
                <p>With respect to deciduous trees, the falling off of the leaves seems principally
                    to depend on the temperature of the atmosphere, which likewise serves to hasten
                    or retard the appearance in question. An ardent sun contributes to hasten the
                    dropping of the leaves; and hence in hot and dry summers the leaves of the
                    lime-tree andhorse-chesnut turn yellow about the first of September, whilst in
                    other years the yellowness does not appear till the beginning of October.
                    Nothing, however, contributes more to hasten the fall of the leaves than
                    immoderate cold or moist weather in autumn; but, on the other hand, moderate
                    droughts serve to retard it. As a proof of this position, Mr Adanson relates,
                    that in the year 1759, the leaves of the elm-tree, which generally fall off
                    about the twenty-fifth of November, continued in verdure and vigour at Paris,
                    where the autumn was remarkably dry, till the tenth of the following month.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be remarked, that an evergreen grafted upon a deciduous tree,
                    determines the latter to retain its leaves. This observation is confirmed by
                    repeated experiments, particularly by grafting the laurel, or cherry-bay, an
                    evergreen, on the common cherry; and the ilex, or evergreen oak, on the oak.</p>
