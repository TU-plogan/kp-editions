                <p><label type="entry">DALMATIA</label>, a province of the Austrian dominions, and
                    commonly denominated a kingdom. It was first added to the Roman empire by
                    Augustus. After the fall of the western empire it became part of the kingdom of
                    the Goths, until 620, when it was overrun by the Sclavonians, who founded a
                    kingdom which existed till the beginning of the eleventh century, when it came
                    under the power or protection of the Venetians, and part of it remained subject
                    to that state as long as it continued an independent power; hut the portion of
                    it which lies beyond the Zermania was seized by the Turks, and has now lost the
                    name of Dal- :matia, forming the province of Hersuk.</p>
                <p>The present kingdom of Dalmatia is situated between 12° 15' and 44° 54' north
                    latitude, and 18° 10' and 18° 48' east longitude. It is extended along the
                    shores of the Adriatic, but not continuously, as the small part of the Turkish
                    territory near Mount Xaba interposes between the northern part and Ragusa, where
                    it reaches to the shore of the Adriatic. The extent of Dalmatia is 6600 square
                    miles, or 4,225,000 English acres. The number of its inhabitants in 1821
                    amounted to 344,055, most of whom are of Sclavonic origin; but in the cities
                    there are some Germans and Italians. The Roman Catholic is the prevailing
                    religion, though about 60,000 persons are of the Greek communion. The character
                    of the greater part of the inhabitants is original, and has undergone but little
                    change during many centuries. The mountaineers, especially near Ragusa, are
                    almost in the savage state.</p>
                <p>The greater part of this narrow and long district on the shore is defended by a
                    succession of islands, with excellent natural canals, navigable, between them
                    and the mainland. There are numerous good havens, which are well defended
                    against storms by these islands. The land on the coast is generally intersected
                    by lofty mountains, between which are valleys of greater or less extent, which
                    are highly fertile when cultivated; but from the thin population and the few
                    wants of the inhabitants, the greater part of the kingdom is left in a state of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild, and nearly of the same character as that of the south of
                    Italy; but the many marshes on the coast, especially in the vicinity of Zara,
                    and near the mouths of the Narenta, produce much malaria, and engender many
                    fevers. Frost and snow are rarely seen, and are quite unknown in the valleys.
                    The winter scarcely lasts more than six weeks, and is accompanied with much
                    rain, so that the passion-flower and the <hi rend="italic">verbena
                    triphylla</hi> grow in the open air throughout summer and winter.</p>
                <p>The chief products are horses of a small size, but strong and active, sheep of
                    the woolled kind, goats, cows, swine, game, both sea and river fish, silk worms,
                    and cantharides. It scarcely grows sufficient corn for the consumption, but
                    exchanges for it a wine very strong and fiery, olives, raisins, currants, and
                    timber. There is marble and alabaster raised from the quarries, and abundance of
                    fossil, coal, and some iron from mines. The rivers of Dalmatia are of short
                    course, but deep and rapid. The Zermagna or Zennania rises in the mountain
                    Wellebith, and empties itself into the sea in the Bay of Morlachia. The Kerka
                    springs in a grotto above Knin, and forms five most beautiful cascades before it
                    falls into the Bay of Sebenico The</p>
                <p>Settina has one waterfall of more than 150 feet, and a 1 second at Mala Gubowitza
                    before it reaches the sea. The other rivers are, the Narenta, the Suikorina, and
                    the Om-bla. There are several fresh-water lakes; the largest are those of
                    Novigrad, Narin, Trocklean, and Prelosatz.</p>
                <p>The divisions of the kingdom are into five provinces, namely, Zara, Spalatro,
                    Makarska, Ragusa, and Cattaro, which are subdivided into districts. The
                    government remains as under the Venetians, but some parts seem to have a kind of
                    rude independence of Austria, as they formerly had of Venice. The district of
                    Poglezza forms a state within the state, having 16,000 warriors, who maintain
                    their right to choose their own general and other officers every year. They pay
                    no taxes, but make a present as suits them, according to the state of the
                    harvests. This republican privilege has hitherto been respected by the emperor,
                    who finds his account in the military inhabitants being always in readiness to
                    repel any hostility on the part of their neighbours the Turks.</p>
                <p>The cities and their population are as follow; Zara 4856, Spalatro 6750, Ragusa
                    6500, and Cattaro 2250.</p>
