                <p><label type="entry">DELUGE</label>.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">deluge</hi> is an inundation or overflowing of the earth,
                    either wholly or in part, by water.</p>
                <p>We have several deluges recorded in history; as that of Ogyges, which overflowed
                    almost all Attica, and that of Deucalion, which drowned Thessaly, in Greece: but
                    the most memorable was that called the <hi rend="italic">Universal Deluge,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Noah’s Flood,</hi> which overflowed and destroyed the whole
                    earth, and from which only Noah, and those with him in the ark, escaped. This
                    flood forms one of the most considerable epochs in chronology. Its history is
                    given by Moses, in the book of Genesis; and its date is fixed, by the best
                    chronologers, at the year from the creation 1656, which answers to the year
                    before Christ 2293. From this flood, the state of the world is divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">diluvian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">antediluvian.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the many testimonies to the truth of this part of the Mosaic history, may
                    be mentioned the general voice of mankind at all times, and in all parts of the
                    world. The objections of the free-thinkers have indeed principally turned upon
                    three points: the want of any direct history of that event by the profane
                    writers of antiquity; the apparent impossibility of accounting for the quantity
                    of water<pb break="no" facs="nls:194756255" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6255-0691"/>
                    necessary to overflow the whole earth; and the absence of any apparent necessity
                    for an universal deluge, as the same result might have been accomplished by a
                    partial one.</p>
                <p>The first of these objections has given rise to several very elaborate treatises;
                    though all that has yet been done in this way has scarcely been able to silence
                    the objectors. Mr Bryant, in his system of mythology, has with great learning
                    and considerable success endeavoured to show, that the deluge was the principal,
                    if not the only, foundation of the Gentile worship; that the first of their
                    deities was Noah; that all nations of the world looked up to him as their
                    founder; and that he, his sons, and the first patriarchs, are alluded to in
                    most, if not in all of the religious ceremonies, not only of the ancient, but of
                    the modern heathens. In short, according to this author, the deluge, so far from
                    being forgotten or obscurely mentioned by the heathen world, is in reality
                    conspicuous throughout every act of religious worship performed by them.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian Osiris, according to him, was the same with Ham the son of Noah,
                    though the name was sometimes bestowed on Noah himself. That this is the case is
                    evident, he thinks, from its being said that he was exposed in the ark, and
                    afterwards restored to day; that he planted the vine, taught mankind
                    agriculture, and inculcated upon them the maxims of religion and of justice.
                    Something of the same kind is related of Perseus. He is represented by some
                    ancient historians as a great astronomer, and as well versed in other sciences.
                    After being conceived in a shower of gold, he was exposed in an ark upon the
                    waters, and is said to have had his life renewed. Further, the history of Myrina
                    the Amazon affords a kind of abridgment and mixture of the histories of Osiris
                    and Perseus; and similar to these is the history of Hercules himself. But our
                    author observes, that under the titles of Osiris, Perseus, Myrina, and the like,
                    the ancients spoke of the exploits of a whole nation, who were no other than the
                    Cuthites or Cushites, the descendants of Cush the son of Ham and father of
                    Nimrod. These people spread themselves into the most remote corners of the
                    globe; and hence the heroes whom they represented are always described as
                    conquering the whole world. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Egyptian Osiris
                    was the same with the Dionusus of the Greeks. He is said to have been twice
                    born, and to have had two fathers and two mothers; to have been wonderfully
                    preserved in an ark; and to have travelled all over the earth, and taught men
                    the use of the vine, building, planting, and the like. The Indians also claim
                    him as a native of their country, though some allow that he came from the west.
                    Of Kronus and Astarte, it is said that they travelled over the whole earth,
                    disposing of the countries as they pleased, and doing good wherever they went.
                    The same thing is related of Ouranus, Themis, Apollo, and others; though all
                    their exploits are said to have been the effects of conquest, and their
                    benevolence was enforced by the sword. In a similar manner does he explain the
                    stories of other heroes of antiquity; and having thus, in the characters and
                    histories of the most celebrated personages, found traces of the history of Noah
                    and his family, he proceeds to inquire into the memorials of the deluge itself
                    which are to be met with in the history or religious rites of the different
                    nations of antiquity.</p>
                <p>“We may reasonably suppose,” says he, “that the particulars of this extraordinary
                    event would be gratefully commemorated by the patriarch himself, and transmitted
                    to every branch of his family; that they were made the subject of domestic
                    converse, where the history was often renewed, and ever attended with a
                    reverential awe and horror, especially in those who had been witnesses to the
                    calamity, and had experienced the hand of Providence in their fa vour. In
                    process of time, when there was a falling off from the truth, we might farther
                    expect, that a person of so high a character as Noah, so particularly
                    distinguished by the Deity, could not fail of being reverenced by his posterity,
                    and, when idolatry prevailed, that he would be one of the first among the sons
                    of men to whom divine honours would be paid. Lastly, we might conclude, that
                    these memorials would be interwoven in the mythology of the Gentile world; and
                    that there would be continual allusions to these ancient occurrences in the
                    rites and mysteries as they were practised by the nations of the earth. In
                    conformity to these suppositions, I shall endeavour to show that these things
                    did happen; that the history of the deluge was religiously preserved in the
                    first ages; that every circumstance of it is to be met with among the historians
                    and mythologists of different countries; and traces of it are to be found,
                    particularly in the sacred rites of Egypt and of Greece.</p>
                <p>“It will appear from many circumstances in the more ancient writers, that the
                    great patriarch was highly reverenced by his posterity. They looked up to him as
                    a person highly favoured by heaven, and honoured him with many titles, each of
                    which had a reference to some particular part of his history. They styled him
                    Prometheus, Deucalion, Atlas, Theuth, Zuth, Xuthus, Inachus, Osiris. When there
                    began to be a tendency towards idolatry, and the adoration of the sun was
                    introduced by the posterity of Ham, the title of <hi rend="italic">Helius,</hi>
                    among others, was conferred upon him. They called him also M?p and Mαv, which is
                    the moon. When colonies went abroad, many took to themselves the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Minyadae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Minyae</hi> from him; just as
                    others were denominated <hi rend="italic">Achaemenidae, Auritae, Heliadae,</hi>
                    from the sun. People of the former name are to be found in Arabia and in other
                    parts of the world. The natives at Orchomenos were styled Minyae, as were some
                    of the inhabitants of Thessaly. Noah was the original Zeus and Dios. He was the
                    planter of the vine, and inventor of fermented liquors; whence he was
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">Zeuth,</hi> which signifies ferment, rendered <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeus</hi> by the Greeks. He was also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dionusus,</hi> interpreted by the Latins <hi rend="italic">Bacchus,</hi> but
                    very improperly. Bacchus was Chus, the grandson of Noah; as Ammon may in general
                    be esteemed Ham, so much reverenced by the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>“Among the people of the East the true name of the patriarch was preserved; they
                    called him <hi rend="italic">Noas, Naus,</hi> and sometimes contracted <hi
                    rend="italic">Nous;</hi> and many places of sanctity, as well as rivers, were
                    denominated from him. Anaxagoras of Clazomene had obtained some knowledge of him
                    in Egypt. By him the patriarch was denominated Noas or Nous; and both he and his
                    disciples were sensible that this was a foreign appellation; notwithstanding
                    which, he has acted as if it had been a term of the Greek language. Eusebius
                    informs us that the disciples of Anaxagoras say ‘ that Nous is, by
                    interpretation, the deity, Dis oç Dios; and they likewise esteem Nous the same
                    as Prometheus, because he was the renewer of mankind, and was said to have
                    fashioned them again,’ after they had been in a manner extinct. After this,
                    however, he gives a solution of the story, upon the supposition that Nous is the
                    same with the Greek word <hi rend="italic">νους,</hi><hi rend="italic">the
                    mind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that ‘ the mind was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Prometheus was said to renew
                    mankind, from new forming their minds, and leading them, by cultivation, from
                    ignorance.’</p>
                <p>“Suidas has preserved, from some ancient author, a curious memorial of this
                    wonderful personage, whom he affects to distinguish from Deucalion, and styles
                    <hi rend="italic">Nannacus.</hi> According to him, this Nannacus was a person of
                    great antiquity, and prior to the time of Deucalion. He is said to have been a
                    king, who, foreseeing the approaching deluge, collected every body together, and
                    led them to a <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756268" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6268-0692"
                    />temple, where he offered up his prayers for them, accompanied with many tears.
                    There is likewise a proverbial expression about Nannaeus applied to people of
                    great antiquity.</p>
                <p>“Stephanus gives great light to this history, and supplies many deficiencies, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> The tradition is,’ says he, ‘ that there was one
                    formerly named <hi rend="italic">Annaeus,</hi> the extent of whose life was
                    above three hundred years. The people who were of his neighbourhood and
                    acquaintance had inquired of an oraele how long he was to live; and there was an
                    answer given, that when Annaeus died, all mankind would be destroyed. The
                    Phrygians, upon this account, made great lamentations, from whence arose the
                    proverb <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> to</hi><hi rend="italic">ιm Avvaxov
                    xλαυ&lt;κ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">v, the lamentation of
                    Annaeus,</hi> made use of for people in circumstances highly calamitous. When
                    the flood of Deucalion came, all mankind were destroyed, according as the oraele
                    had foretold. Afterwards, when the surface of the earth began to be again dry,
                    Zeus ordered Prometheus and Minerva to make images of clay in the form of men;
                    and, when they were finished, he called the winds, and made them breathe into
                    each, and render them vital·’”</p>
                <p>From these histories Mr Bryant concludes, that however the story may have been
                    varied, the principal outlines plainly point out the person who is alluded to in
                    these histories. It is manifest, he thinks, that Annaeus, and Nannaeus, and even
                    Inachus, relate to Noachus or Noah. And not only these, but the histories of
                    Deucalion and Prometheus, have a like reference to the patriarch; in the six
                    hundredth year, and not the three hundredth, of whose life the waters prevailed
                    upon the earth. He was the father of mankind, who were renewed in him. Hence he
                    is represented by another author, under the character of Prometheus, as a great
                    artist, by whom men were formed anew, and were instructed in all that was
                    good.</p>
                <p>“Noah was the original Kronus and Zeus, though the latter is a title conferred
                    sometimes upon his son Ham. There is a very particular expression recorded by
                    Clemens of Alexandria, and attributed to Pythagoras, who is said to have called
                    the sea the <hi rend="italic">Tear of Kronus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    there was a further tradition concerning this person, that he drank or swallowed
                    up all his children. The tears of Isis are represented as very mysterious. They
                    are said to have flowed whenever the Nile began to rise, and to flood the
                    country. The overflowing of that river was the great source of affluence to the
                    people, and they looked upon it as their chief blessing; yet it was ever
                    attended with mystical tears and lamentations. This was particularly observed at
                    Coptos, where the principal deity was Isis. An ancient writer imagines that the
                    tears and lamentations of the people were to implore an inundation, and the
                    tears of Isis were supposed to make the river swell. But all this was certainly
                    said and done in memorial of a former flood, of which they made the overflowing
                    of the Nile a type.</p>
                <p>“As the patriarch was by some represented as.a king called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naachus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nauchus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so by
                    others he was styled <hi rend="italic">Inaxhus,</hi> and supposed to have
                    reigned at Argos. Hence Inachus was made a king of Greece, and Phoroneus and
                    Apis brought in succession after him. But Inachus was not a name of Grecian
                    original; it is mentioned by Eusebius, in his account of the first ages, that
                    there reigned in Egypt Telegonus, a prince of foreign extraction, who was the
                    son of Ones the shepherd, and the seventh in descent from Inachus. And in the
                    same author we read that a colony went forth from that country into Syria, where
                    they founded the ancient city of Antioch; and that they were conducted by Casus
                    and Belus, who were sons of Inachus. By Inachus is certainly meant Noah; and the
                    history relates to some of the more early descendants of the patriarch. His name
                    has been rendered very unlike itself, by having been lengthened with
                    terminations, and likewise fashioned according to the idiom of different
                    languages; but the circumstances of the history are so precise and particular
                    that we cannot miss of the truth.</p>
                <p>“He seems in the East to have been called <hi rend="italic">Noas, Noasis,

                    wherever they came, founded cities to his honour; hence places called <hi
                    rend="italic">Nusa</hi> will often occur, and indeed a great many of them arc
                    mentioned by ancient authors. These, though widely distant, being situated in
                    countries far removed, yet retained the same original histories, and were
                    generally famous for the plantation of the vine. Misled by this similarity of
                    traditions, people in after times imagined that Dionusus must necessarily have
                    been where his history occurred; and as it was the turn of the Greeks to place
                    every thing to the account of conquest, they made him a great conqueror, who
                    -went over the face of the whole earth, and taught mankind the plantation of the
                    vine. We are informed that Dionusus went with an army over the face of the whole
                    earth, and taught mankind, as he passed along, the method of planting the vine,
                    and how to press out the juice and receive it in proper vessels. Though the
                    patriarch is represented under various titles, and even these not always
                    uniformly appropriated, yet there will continually occur such peculiar
                    circumstances of his history, as will plainly point out the person referred to.
                    The person preserved is always mentioned as preserved in an ark. He is described
                    as being in a state of darkness, which is represented allegorically as a state
                    of death. He then obtained a new life, which is called a second birth; and is
                    said to have his youth renewed. He is, on this account, looked upon as the
                    first-born of mankind; and both his antediluvian and postdiluvian states are
                    commemorated; and sometimes the intermediate state is also spoken of. Diodorus
                    calls him <hi rend="italic">Deucalion,</hi> but describes the deluge as in a
                    manner universal. ‘In the deluge which happened in the time of Deucalion, almost
                    all flesh died.’ Apollodorus having mentioned Deucalion ev λαgvax∕, <hi
                    rend="italic">consigned to the arh,</hi> takes notice, upon his quitting it, of
                    his offering up an immediate sacrifice to the God who delivered him. As he was
                    the father of all mankind, the ancients have made him a person of very extensive
                    rule, and supposed him to have been a king. Sometimes he is described as a
                    monarch of the whole earth, at other times he is reduced to a petty king of
                    Thessaly. He is mentioned by Helladias in this latter capacity, who speaks of
                    the deluge in his time, and of his building altars to the gods. Apollonius
                    Rhodius supposes him to have been a native of Greece, according to the common
                    notions; but notwithstanding his prejudices, he gives so particular a character
                    of him, that the true history cannot be mistaken. He makes him indeed the son of
                    Prometheus, the son of Japetus; but in these ancient mythological accounts all
                    genealogy must be entirely disregarded. Though this character be not precisely
                    true, yet we may learn that the person represented was the first of men, through
                    whom religious rites were renewed, cities built, and civil polity established in
                    the world; none of which circumstances are applicable to any king of Greece. We
                    are assured by Philo that Deucalion was Noah; and the Chaldeans likewise
                    mentioned him by the name of Xisu-thrus, as we are informed by Cedrenus.</p>
                <p>“That Deucalion was unduly adjudged by the people of Thessaly to their country
                    solely, may be proved from his name occurring in different parts of the world,
                    and always accompanied with some history of the deluge. The natives of Syria
                    laid the same claim to him. He was supposed to have founded the temple at
                    Hierapolis, where was a chasm through which the waters after the deluge <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194756281" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6281-0693"/> were said to have
                    retreated. He was likewise reported to have built the temple of Jupiter at
                    Athens, where there was a cavity of the same nature, and a like tradition, that
                    the waters of the flood passed off through this aperture. However groundless the
                    notions may be of the waters having retreated through these passages, yet they
                    show what impressions of this event were retained by the Am- .monians, who
                    introduced some history of it wherever they came. As different nations succeeded
                    one another in these parts, and time produced a mixture of generations, they
                    varied the history, and modelled it according to their notions and traditions;
                    yet the groundwork was always true, and the event for a long time universally
                    commemorated. Josephus, who seems to have been a person of extensive knowledge,
                    and versed in the histories of nations, says that this great occurrence was to
                    be met with in the writings of all persons who treated of the first ages. He
                    mentions Berosus of Chaldea, Hieronymus of Egypt, who wrote concerning the
                    antiquities of Phoenicia; also Alna-seas, Abydenus, Melon, and Nicholaus
                    Damascenus, as writers by whom it was recorded; and adds, that it was taken
                    notice of by many others.</p>
                <p>“Among the eastern nations, the traces of this event are more vivid and
                    determinate than those of Greece, and more conformable to the accounts of Moses.
                    Eusebius has preserved a most valuable extract to this purpose from Abydenus,
                    which was taken from the archives of the Medes and Babylonians. This writer
                    speaks of Noah, whom he names Seisithrus, as a king, and says that the flood
                    began upon the 15th day of the month Desius; that during the prevalence of the
                    waters, Seisithrus sent out birds, that he might judge if the flood had
                    remained; but that the birds, not finding any resting-place, returned to him
                    again. This was repeated three times; when the birds were found to return with
                    their feet stained with soil, by which he knew the flood was abated. Upon this
                    he quitted the ark, and was never more seen of men, being taken away by the gods
                    from the earth. Abydenus concludes with a particular, in which the eastern
                    writers are unanimous, that the place of descent from the ark was in Armenia,
                    and speaks of its remains being preserved for a longtime. Plutarch mentions the
                    Noachic dove, and its being sent out of the ark. But the most particular history
                    of the deluge, and the nearest of any to the account given by Moses, is to be
                    found in Lucian. He was a native of Samosata, a city of Comagene, upon the
                    Euphrates, a part of the world where memorials of the deluge were particularly
                    preserved, and where a reference to that history was continually kept up in the
                    rites and worship of the country. His knowledge, therefore, was obtained from
                    the Asiatic nations among whom he was born, and not from his kinsmen the
                    Helladians, who were far inferior in the knowledge of ancient times. He
                    describes Noah under the name of Deucalion, and says, ‘ that the present race of
                    mankind are different from those who first existed; for those of the
                    antediluvian world were all destroyed. The present world is peopled from the
                    sons of Deucalion, having increased to so great a number from one person. In
                    respect to the former brood, they were men of violence, and lawless in their
                    dealings. They regarded not oaths, nor observed the rights of hospitality, nor
                    showed mercy to those who sued for it. On this account they were doomed to
                    destruction; and for this purpose there was a mighty eruption of waters from the
                    earth, attended with heavy showers from above, so that the rivers swelled and
                    the sea overflowed, till the whole earth was covered with a flood, and all flesh
                    drowned. Deucalion alone was preserved to re-people the world. This mercy was
                    shown to him on account of his piety and justice. His preservation was effected
                    in this manner. He put all his family, both his sons and their wives, into a
                    vast ark which he had provided, and he went into it himself. At the same time
                    animals of every species, boars, horses, lions, serpents, whatever lived upon
                    the face of the earth, followed him by pairs; all which he received into the
                    ark, and experienced no evil from them; for there prevailed a wonderful harmony
                    throughout, by the immediate influence of the Deity. Thus were they wafted with
                    him as long as the flood endured.’ After this he proceeds to mention, that upon
                    the disappearing of the waters, Deucalion went forth from the ark and raised an
                    altar to God; but he transposes the scene to Hierapolis in Syria, where the
                    natives pretended, as has been already mentioned, to have very particular
                    memorials of the deluge.</p>
                <p>“Most of the authors who have transmitted to us these accounts at the same time
                    inform us that the remains of the ark were to be seen in their days on one of
                    the mountains of Armenia. Abydenus particularly says, in confirmation of this
                    opinion, that the people of the country used to get small pieces of the wood,
                    which they carried about by way of amulet. And Berosus mentions that they
                    scraped off the asphaltus with which it was covered, and used it as a charm.
                    Some of the fathers seem to insist on the certainty of the ark being still
                    remaining in their time. Theophilus says expressly that the remains were to be
                    seen upon the mountains of Aram or Armenia. And Chrysostom appeals to it as to a
                    thing well known. ‘ Do not,’ says he, ‘ those mountains of Armenia bear witness
                    to the truth? those mountains where the ark first rested? And are not the
                    remains of it preserved there even unto this day?’</p>
                <p>“There was a custom among the priests of Ammon of carrying a boat in procession
                    at particular seasons, in which was an oracular shrine held in great veneration.
                    They were said to have been eighty in number, and to have carried the sacred
                    vessel about just as they were directed by the impulse of the deity. This custom
                    was likewise in use among the Egyptians; and Bishop Pocock has preserved three
                    specimens of ancient sculpture, wherein this ceremony is displayed. They are of
                    wonderful antiquity, and were found by him in Upper Egypt.</p>
                <p>“Part of the ceremony in most of the ancient mysteries consisted in carrying
                    about a ship or boat; which custom, upon due examination, will be found to
                    relate to nothing else but Noah and the deluge. The ship of Isis is well known,
                    and the festivity among the Egyptians whenever it was carried in public. The
                    name of this, and of all the navicular shrines, was Baris, which is remarkable;
                    for it was the very name of the mountain, according to Nicoaus Damascenus, on
                    which the ark of Noah rested, the same as Ararat in Armenia. He mentions that
                    there is a large mountain in Armenia, which stands above the country of the
                    Minyae, called Baris; to this it was said that many people betook themselves in
                    the time of the deluge, and were saved; and there is a tradition of one person
                    in particular floating in an ark, and arriving at the summit of the mountain. We
                    may be assured, then, that the ship of Isis was a sacred emblem, in honour of
                    which there was among the Egyptians an annual festival. It was in after times
                    admitted among the Romans, and set down in their calendar for the month of
                    March. The former, in their .description of the primary deities, have
                    continually some reference to a ship or float. Hence we frequently read of <hi
                    rend="italic">ôtot</hi> vαυr∕λλovrEj, <hi rend="italic">sailing gods.</hi> They
                    oftentimes, says Porphyry, describe the sun in the character of a man sailing
                    upon a float. And Plutarch observes to the same purpose, that they did not
                    represent the sun and moon in chariots, <hi rend="italic">but wafted about upon
                    floating machines.</hi> In doing which, they did not refer to the luminaries,
                    but to a person represented under those titles. The sun, or Orus, is likewise
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756294" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6294-0694"/> described by
                    Jamblichus as sitting upon the lotus, and sailing in a vessel.</p>
                <p>“It is said of Sesostris that he constructed a ship which was two hundred and
                    eighty cubits in length. It was of cedar, plated without with gold, and inlaid
                    with silver; and it was, when finished, dedicated to Osiris at Thebes. It is not
                    credible that there should have been a ship of this size, especially in an
                    inland district, the most remote of any in Egypt. It was certainly a temple and
                    a shrine. The former was framed upon this large scale; and it was the latter on
                    which the gold and silver were so lavishly expended. There is a remarkable
                    circumstance relating to the Argonautic expedition, that the dragon slain by
                    Jason was of the size of a trireme; by which must be meant that it was of the
                    shape of a ship in general, for there were no triremes at the time alluded to.
                    And I have moreover shown, that all these dragons, as they have been represented
                    by the poets, were in reality temples, <hi rend="italic">Ωracon-tia,</hi> where,
                    among other rites, the worship of the serpent was instituted. There is another
                    reason to think that this temple, as well as that of Sesostris, was fashioned,
                    in respect to its superficial contents, after the model of a ship; and as to the
                    latter, it was probably intended in its outlines to be the exact representation
                    of the ark, in commemoration of which it was certainly built. It was a temple
                    sacred to Osiris at Theba, or, to say the truth, it was itself called Theba; and
                    both the city, said to be one of the most ancient in Egypt, as well as the
                    province, were undoubtedly denominated from it. Now Theba was the name of the
                    ark. It is the very word made use of by the sacred writer; so that we may, I
                    think, be assured of the prototype after which this temple was fashioned. It is
                    said indeed to have been only two hundred and eighty cubits in length, whereas
                    the ark of Noah was three hundred; but this is a variation of only one fifteenth
                    in the whole; and as the ancient cubit was not in all countries the same, we may
                    suppose that this disparity arose rather from the manner of measuring, than from
                    any real difference in the extent of the building. It was an idolatrous temple,
                    said to have been built by Sesostris in honour of Osiris. I have been repeatedly
                    obliged to take notice of the ignorance of the Greeks in respect to ancient
                    titles, and have shown their misapplication of terms in many instances,
                    especially in their supposing temples to have been erected by persons to whom
                    they were in reality sacred. Sesostris was Osiris; the same as Dionusus, Menes,
                    and Noah. He is called Seisithrus by Abydenus, Xixouthros by Borosus and
                    Apollodorus, and is represented by them as a prince in whose time the deluge
                    happened. He was called Zuth, Xuth, and Zeus, and had certainly divine honours
                    paid to him.</p>
                <p>“Pausanias gives a remarkable account of a temple of Hercules, at Eruthra in
                    Ionia, which he mentions as of the highest antiquity, and very like those of
                    Egypt. The deity was represented upon a float, and was supposed to have come
                    thither in this manner from Phoenicia. Aristides mentions that at Smyrna, upon
                    the feast called Dionysia, a ship used to be carried in procession. The same
                    custom prevailed among the Athenians at the Panathenaea, when what was termed
                    the sacred ship was borne with great reverence through the city to the temple of
                    Dame-ter at Eleusis. At Phalerus, near Athens, there were honours paid to an
                    unknown hero, who was represented in the stern of a ship. At Olympia, the most
                    sacred place in Greece, was a representation of the like nature. It was a
                    building like the forepart of a ship, which stood facing the end of the
                    hippodromus; and towards the middle of it was an altar, upon which, at the
                    renewal of each Olympiad, certain rites were performed.</p>
                <p>“I think it is pretty plain that all these emblematical representations, of which
                    I have given so many instances, related to the history of the deluge, and the
                    conservation of one family in the ark. This history was pretty recent when these
                    works were executed in Egypt, and when the rites were first established; and
                    there is reason to think, that in early times most shrines of the Mizraim were
                    formed under the resemblance of a ship, in memory of this great event. Nay,
                    further, both ships and temples received their names from thence, being styled
                    by the Greeks, who borrowed largely from Egypt, Nαυς, and Naoj, and mariners
                    Nαυrα, <hi rend="italic">Naurae,</hi> in reference to the patriarch, who was
                    variously styled Noas, Nous, and Noah.</p>
                <p>“However the Greeks may in their mysteries have sometimes introduced a ship as a
                    symbol, yet in their reference to the deluge itself, and to the persons
                    preserved, they always speak of an ark. And though they were apt to mention the
                    same person under various titles, and by these means different people seem to be
                    made principals in the same history; yet they were so far uniform in their
                    account of this particular event, that they made each of them to be exposed in
                    an ark. Thus it is said of Deucalion, Perseus, and Dionusus, that they were
                    exposed upon the waters in a machine of this fabric. Adonis was hid in an ark by
                    Venus, and was supposed to have been in a state of death for a year. Theocritus
                    introduces a pastoral personage named Comates, who was exposed in an ark for the
                    same term, and wonderfully preserved. Of Osiris being exposed in an ark we have
                    a very remarkable account in Plutarch, who mentions that it was on account of
                    Typhon, and that it happened on the 17th of the month Athyr, when the sun was in
                    Scorpio. This, in my judgment, was the precise time when Noah entered the ark,
                    and when the flood came, which, in the Egyptian mythology, was called
                    Typhon.</p>
                <p>“Typhon is one of those whose character has been greatly confounded. This has
                    arisen from two different personages being included under one name, who
                    undoubtedly were distinguished in the language of Egypt. Typhon was a compound
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tuph</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tupha-0n,</hi> and signified
                    a high altar of the deity. There were several such in Egypt, upon which they
                    offered human sacrifices; and the cities which had these altars were styled
                    Typhonian. But there was another Typhon, who was very different from the former,
                    however by mistake blended with that character. By this was signified a mighty
                    whirlwind and inundation, and it oftentimes denoted the ocean, and particularly
                    the ocean in a ferment; for, as Plutarch observes, by Typhon was understood any
                    thing violent and unruly. It was a derivative from <hi rend="italic">Tuph,</hi>
                    like the former name; which Tuph seems here to have been the same as the Suph of
                    the Hebrews. By this they denoted a whirlwind; but among the Egyptians it was
                    taken in a greater latitude, and signified any thing boisterous, particularly
                    the sea. Plutarch sneaks of it as denoting the sea, and says likewise that the
                    salt of the sea was called the foam of 1yphon. It signified also a whirlwind, as
                    we learn from Euripides, who expresses it Tuphos; and the like is to be found in
                    Hesychius, who calls it a violent wind.</p>
                <p>“The history of Typhon was taken from hieroglyphical descriptions. In these the
                    dove, <hi rend="italic">oinas,</hi> was represented as hovering over the <hi
                    rend="italic">mundane</hi> egg, which was exposed to the fury of Typhon; for an
                    egg, containing in it the elements of life, was thought no improper emblem of
                    the ark, in which were preserved the rudiments of the future world. Hence, in
                    the Dionusiaca, and in other mysteries, one part of the nocturnal ceremony
                    consisted in the consecration of an egg. By this, we are informed by Porphyry,
                    was signified the world. This world was Noah and his family, even all mankind,
                    inclosed and preserved in the ark.</p>
                <p>“In respect to Typhon, it must be confessed that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756307" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6307-0695"/>history given of him is
                    attended with some obscurity. The Grecians have comprehended several characters
                    under one term, which the Egyptians undoubtedly distinguished. The term was used
                    for a title as well as a name, and several of those personages which had a
                    relation to the deluge were styled Typhonian or Diluvian. All these the Grecians
                    have included under one and the same name, Typhon. The real deity by whom the
                    deluge was brought upon the earth had the appellation of Typhonian, by which was
                    meant <hi rend="italic">Diluvii</hi><hi rend="italic">Deus.</hi> It is well
                    known that the ark was constructed by a divine commission, in which, when it was
                    completed, God inclosed the patriarch and his family. Hence it is said that
                    Typhon made an ark of curious workmanship, that he might dispose of the body of
                    Osiris. Into this Osiris entered, and was shut up by Typhon. All this relates to
                    the Typhonian deity who inclosed Noah, together with his family, within the
                    limits of an ark. The patriarch also, who was thus interested in the event, had
                    the title of Typhonian. I have shown that the ark by the mythologists was spoken
                    of as the mother of mankind. The stay in the ark was looked upon as a state of
                    death and of regeneration. The passage to life was through the door of the ark,
                    which was formed in its side. Through this the patriarch made his descent, and
                    at this point was the commencement of time. This history is obscurely alluded to
                    in the account of Typhon, of whom it is said, that without any regard to time or
                    place, he forced a passage and burst into light obliquely through the side of
                    his mother. This return to light was described as a revival from the grave; and
                    Plutarch accordingly mentions the return of Osiris from Hades, after he had been
                    for a long season inclosed in an ark and in a state of death. This renewal of
                    life was by the Egyptians esteemed a second state of childhood. They
                    accordingly, in their hieroglyphics, described him as a boy, whom they placed
                    upon the lotus or water-lily, and called him Orus. He was the supposed son of
                    Isis; but it has been shown that Isis, Rhea, Atar-gatis, were all emblems of the
                    ark, that receptacle which was styled the mother of mankind. Orus is represented
                    as undergoing from the Titans all that Osiris suffered from Typhon, and the
                    history at bottom is the same. Hence it is said of Isis, that she had the power
                    of making people immortal, and that when she found her son Orus, in the midst of
                    the waters, dead through the malice of the Titans, she not only gave him a
                    renewal of life, but also conferred upon him immortality.”</p>
                <p>In this manner does Bryant interpret almost all the ancient fables, of which no
                    satisfactory solution was ever before given. He shows that the primitive gods of
                    Egypt, who were eight in number, were no other than the eight persons saved in
                    the ark; and that almost all the heathen deities had one way or other a
                    reference to Noah. He proves that Noah was characterized under the titles of
                    Janus, Nereus, Proteus, Oannes, Dagon; and, in short, that the deluge, so far
                    from being unknown to the heathens, or forgotten by them, was in a manner the
                    basis of their whole worship. He traces the history of the raven and dove sent
                    forth by Noah in the customs of various nations, not only in the East, but the
                    West also. And, not content with these testimonies, he shows that the same
                    mythology as that of the Egyptians, and the same hieroglyphics, were carried as
                    far as China and Japan. The Indians have a person whom they call Buto or Budo,
                    or Buddha. This is the same as Boutas of Egypt, Battus of Cyrene, and Boeotus of
                    Greece: and the account given of him is similar to that of Typhon; for it is
                    said that he did not come to life in the usual way, but made himself a passage
                    through the side of his mother, who is represented as a virgin. This history,
                    though now current among the Indians, is of great antiquity, as we learn from
                    the account given by Clemens Alexandrinus. “There is a caste of Indians,” says
                    he, “who are disciples of Boutas. This person, on account of his extraordinary
                    sanctity, they look up to as a god.” The name of Boutas, Battus, and Boeotus,
                    though apparently conferred upon the patriarch, yet related originally to the
                    machine in which he was preserved. Of this some traces may be found among the
                    Greeks. One of the Ammonian names for the ark was Aren or Arene, and Boeotus is
                    said by Diodorus Siculus to have been the son of Neptune and Arne, which is a
                    contraction of <hi rend="italic">arene,</hi> the ark. The chief city, Boutus, in
                    Egypt, where was the floating temple, signified properly the city of the float
                    or ark. The Boeotians, who in the Dionusiaca so particularly commemorated the
                    ark, were supposed to be descended from an imaginary personage, Boeotus; and
                    from him likewise their country was thought to have received its name. But
                    Boeotus was merely a variation from Boutus, and Butus, the ark; which in ancient
                    times was indifferently styled Theba, Argus, Aren, Butus, and Boeotus. The term
                    Cibotus is a compound of the same import, and signifies both the temple of the
                    ark and also a place for shipping.</p>
                <p>“All the mysteries of the Gentile world seem to have been memorials of the
                    deluge, and of the event which immediately succeeded. They consisted for the
                    most part of a melancholy process, and were celebrated by night, in
                    commemoration of the state of darkness in which the patriarch and his family had
                    been involved. The first thing at those awful meetings was to offer an oath of
                    secrecy to all who were to be initiated, after which they proceeded to the
                    ceremonies: these began with a description of chaos, by which was signified some
                    memorial of the deluge. Chaos was certainly the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >βυόος,</hi><hi rend="italic">the great abyss.</hi> Who, says Epiphanius, is so
                    ignorant as not to know that Chaos, and Buthos, the abyss, are of the same
                    purport?</p>
                <p>“The names of the deities in Japan and China, and the form of them, as well as
                    the mythology with which they are attended, point out the country from whence
                    they originally came. In China the deity upon the lotus in the midst of waters
                    has been long a favourite emblem, and was imported from the West; the insigne of
                    the dragon was from the same quarter. The Cuthites worshipped Cham, the sun,
                    whose name they variously compounded. In China most things which have any
                    reference to splendour and magnificence seem to be denominated from the same
                    object. Cham is said, in the language of that country, to signify any thing
                    supreme. Cum is a fine building or palace, similar to Coma of the Ammonians.
                    Cura is a lord or master, Cham a sceptre. Lastly, by Cham is signified a priest,
                    analogous to the Chamanim and Chamenim of Cutha and Babylonia. The country
                    itself is by the Tartars called Ham. The cities Cham-ju, Campion, Compi-tion,
                    Cumdan, Chamul, and many others of the same form, are manifestly compounded of
                    the sacred term Cham. Cambalu, the name of the ancient metropolis, is the city
                    of Cham-bal; and Milton styles it very properly ‘ Cambalu, seat of Cathaian
                    Chan.’ By this is meant the chief city of the Cuthean monarch; for Chan is a
                    derivative of Cahen, a prince. It seems sometimes in China and Japan to have
                    been expressed Quan and Quano.</p>
                <p>“Two temples are taken notice of by Hamilton, near Syrian, in Pegu, which he
                    represents as so like in structure that they seemed to be built on the same
                    model. One of these was <hi rend="italic">Kiahiach,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">God of Gods temple.</hi> The other is called <hi rend="italic">the
                    temple of Dagun</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the doors and windows of it are
                    perpetually shut, so that none can enter but the priests. They will not tell of
                    what shape the idol is, but only say that it is not of human form. The former
                    deity, Kiakiack, is represented as asleep, of a human shape, and sixty feet
                    long, and when he awakes the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756320"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6320-0696"/>world is to be destroyed. As soon as Kiakiack has
                    dissolved the frame and being of this world, Dagun will gather up the fragments
                    and make a new one. I make no doubt but the true name of the temple was <hi
                    rend="italic">lach lach,</hi> and dedicated to the same god as the Jachusi in
                    Japan. Mr Wise takes notice of the Grecian exclamation to Dionusus, when the
                    terms <hi rend="italic">Iacche,</hi><hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Iacche,</hi> were repeated; and he supposes, with great probability, that the
                    Peguan name had a reference to the same deity. It is certain that the worship of
                    Dionusus prevailed very early among the nations in the East. The Indians used to
                    maintain that his rites first began among them. Professor Bayer has shown that
                    traces of his worship are still to be observed among the Tamuli of Tranquebar. ‘
                    They have a tradition,’ says he, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> that there was
                    once a gigantic person named Maid-shurcn, who was born of Nisadabura, near the
                    mountain Meru. He had the horns of a bull, and drank wine, and made war upon the
                    gods. He was attended by eight <hi rend="italic">Pudam,</hi> who were gigantic
                    and mischievous daemons, of the family of those Indian shepherds called <hi
                    rend="italic">Kobaler.'</hi> In this account we have a manifest reference to the
                    history of Dionusus, as well as that of the Dionusians, by whom his rites were
                    introduced. And we may perceive that it bears a great resemblance to the
                    accounts transmitted by the Grecians. What are these Kobaler, who were descended
                    from the shepherds, but the same as the Cobali of Greece, the uniform attendants
                    upon Dionusus? a set of priests whose cruelty and chicanery rendered them
                    infamous. ‘ The Cobali,’ says an ancient author, ‘ were a set of cruel daemons,
                    who followed in the retinue of Dionusus. It is a term made use of for knaves and
                    cheats.’</p>
                <p>“As the deity, in the second temple of Syrian, to which strangers were not
                    admitted, was not of a human form, and was called <hi rend="italic">Dagun,</hi>
                    we may easily conceive the hidden character under which he was described. We may
                    conclude that it was no other than that mixed figure of a man and a fish, under
                    which he was of old worshipped both in Palestine and Syria. He is expressed
                    under this symbolical representation in many parts of India, and by the Brahmins
                    is called <hi rend="italic">Wistnu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Vishnu.</hi> Dagon
                    and Vishnu have a like reference; they equally represent the man of the sea,
                    called by Berosus <hi rend="italic">Cannes,</hi> whose history has been reversed
                    by the Indians. They suppose that he will restore the world when it shall be
                    destroyed by the chief God. But by Dagon is signified the very person through
                    whom the earth has been already restored when it was in a state of ruin, and by
                    whom mankind was renewed. Dagon and Noah I have shown to be the same. Vishnu is
                    represented, like Dagon, under the mixed figure of a man and a fish, or rather
                    of a man, a princely figure, proceeding from a fish. The name of this district,
                    near which the temples above stand, we find to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syrian,</hi> just as was named the region where stood the temples of Atar-gatis
                    and Dagon. Syrus, Syria, and Syrian are all of the same purport, and signify
                    Coelestis and Solaris, from <hi rend="italic">Sehor,</hi> the sun.”</p>
                <p>He next proceeds to describe some of the Indian temples or pagodas, particularly
                    those of Salsette, Elephanta, and another called Elora, near Aurungabad, in the
                    province of Balagate.</p>
                <p>“Many of these ancient structures,” continues Mr Bryant, “have been attributed to
                    Ramscander, or Alexander the Great; but there is nothing among these stately
                    edifices that in the least savours of Grecian workmanship, nor had that monarch,
                    nor any of the princes after him, opportunity to perform works of this nature.
                    We have not the least reason to think that they ever possessed the country, for
                    they were called off from their attention this way by feuds and engagements
                    nearer home. There is no tradition of this country having been ever conquered
                    except by the fabulous armies of Hercules and Dionusus. What has led people to
                    think that those works were the operation of Alexander, is the similitude of the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Ramt∙ xander.</hi> To this person they have sometimes
                    been attributed; but Ramtxander was a deity, the supposed son of Bal, and he is
                    introduced among the personages who were concerned in the incarnations of
                    Vishnu.</p>
                <p>“The temple of Elora, and all the pagodas of which I have made mention, must be
                    of great antiquity, as the natives cannot reach their era. They were undoubtedly
                    the work of the Indo-Cuthites, who came so early into these parts. And that
                    these structures were formed by them, will appear from many circumstances; but
                    especially from works of the same magnificence which were performed by them in
                    other places. For scarce any people could have effected such great works, but a
                    branch of that family which erected the tower in Babylonia, the walls of
                    Baalbec, and the pyramids of Egypt.”</p>
                <p>Having then described a number of Indian idols of surprising magnitude, “the
                    Babylonians and Egyptians,” says he, “and all of the same great family, used to
                    take a pleasure in forming gigantic figures, and exhibiting other
                    representations equally stupendous. Such were the colossal statues at Thebes,
                    and the sphinx in the plains of Coume. The statue erected by Nebuchadnezzar in
                    the plains of Dura was in height threescore Babylonish cubits. It was probably
                    raised in honour of Cham, the sun; and perhaps it was also dedicated to the head
                    of the Chaldaic family, who was deified and reverenced under that title.
                    Marcellinus takes notice of a statue of Apollo named Comeus, which, in the time
                    of the Emperor Verus, was brought from Seleucia to Rome. This related to the
                    same deity as the preceding. We may also infer that the temple at Kamju was
                    erected to Cham, the sun, whom the people worshipped under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">SamonifιT'</hi></p>
                <p>It is remarkable that in Japan the priests and nobility have the title of Cami.
                    The Emperor Quebacondono, in a letter to the Portuguese viceroy in 1585, tells
                    him that Japan is the kingdom of Chamis; whom, says he, we hold to be the same
                    as Sein, the origin of all things. By Sein is probably meant <hi rend="italic"
                    >San,</hi> the sun, who was the same as Cham, rendered here Chamis. The laws of
                    the country are spoken of as the laws of Chamis; and we are told by Kaempfer
                    that all the gods were styled either Sin or Cami. The founder of the empire is
                    said to have been Tensio Dai Sin, or Tensio the god of light. Near his temple
                    was a cavern religiously visited, upon account of his having been once hid, when
                    no sun nor stars appeared. He was esteemed the fountain of day, and his temple
                    was called the Temple of Naiku. Near this cavern was another temple, in which
                    the canusi or priests showed an image of the deity sitting upon a cow. It was
                    called Dainits No Ray, the great representation of the sun. One of their
                    principal gods is Jakusi, similar to the Iacchus of the West. Kaempfer says that
                    he is the Apollo of the Japanese, and they describe him as the Egyptians did
                    Horus. His temple stands in a town called Minnoki; and Jakusi is here
                    represented upon a gilt tarate flower, which is said to be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nymphoea</hi><hi rend="italic">palustris</hi><hi rend="italic">maxima,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">faba Egyptiaca</hi> of Prosper Alpinus. One half of a large
                    scallop shell is like a canopy placed over him; and his head is surrounded with
                    a crown of rays. They have also an idol named Menippe, much reverenced in
                    different parts. Both these, continues Bryant, relate to the same person,
                    namely, Noah. Kaempfer, an author of great credit, saw the temple of Dabys,
                    which he truly renders Daibod, at Jedo, in Japan. By Daibod was meant the god
                    Buddha, whose religion was styled the Budso, and prevailed greatly upon the
                    Indus and Ganges. Kaempfer, from whom Mr Bryant takes this account, says that
                    the people of Sjam represent him <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756333"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6333-0697"/>under the form of a Moor, in a sitting posture,
                    and of a prodigious size. His skin is black, his hair curled, and the images
                    about him are of the same complexion. “This god,” says Mr Bryant, “was supposed
                    to have neither father nor mother. By Budha we are certainly to understand the
                    idolatrous symbol called by some nations Buddo; the same as Argus and Theba,
                    names for the ark. In the mythology concerning it we may see a reference both to
                    the machine itself and to the persons preserved in it; in consequence of which
                    we find this person also styled Bod, Budha, and Buddo; and in the west Butus,
                    Battus, and Boeotus. He was said by the Indians not to have been born in the
                    ordinary way, but to have come to light indirectly through the side of his
                    mother. By Clemens of Alexandria he is called <hi rend="italic">Eouta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in the history of this person, however varied, we may
                    perceive a relation to the arkite deity of the sea, called Poseidon or Neptune;
                    also to Arculus and Dionusus, styled Boeotus and Thebanus. Kaempfer has a
                    curious history of a deity of this sort called Abutto, whose temple stood in the
                    province of Bungo, upon the sea-shore, near the village of Toma. About a quarter
                    of a German mile before you come to this village, stands a famous temple of the
                    god Abutto, which is said* to be very eminent for miraculously curing many
                    inveterate distempers, as also for procuring a favourable wind and a good
                    passage. For this reason sailors and passengers always tie some farthings to a
                    piece of wood, and throw it into the sea, as an offering to Abutto, to obtain a
                    propitious wind. The same deity, but under a different name, was worshipped in
                    China. The Apis, Mnevis, and Anubis of Egypt, have often been mentioned and
                    explained, as well as the Minotaur of Crete. The same hieroglyphics occur in
                    Japan; and we are informed by Marco Polo that the inhabitants worship idols of
                    different shapes. Some have the head of an ox, some of a swine, and others the
                    head of a dog. The most common representation in this country is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Godso Ten Oo,</hi> or ‘ the ox-headed prince of heaven.’</p>
                <p>“It has already been noticed, that the ark was represented under the symbol of an
                    egg, called the <hi rend="italic">mundane egg,</hi> which was exposed to the
                    rage of Typhon. It was also described under the figure of a lunette, and called
                    Selene, or the moon. The person by whom it was framed, and who through its means
                    was providentially preserved, occurs under the character of a steer, and the
                    machine itself under the semblance of a cow or heifer. We have moreover been
                    told that it was called Cibotus, which Clemens of Alexandria calls Thebotha.
                    Epiphanius mentions it by the name of <hi rend="italic">Idaal JBaoth</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and says that, according to an eastern tradition, a person
                    named Nun was preserved in it The horse of Neptune was another emblem, as was
                    also the hippopotamus or river-horse. The people of Elis made use of the
                    tortoise for the same purpose, and represented Venus as resting upon its back.
                    Some traces of these hieroglyphics are to be found in Japan, which were
                    certainly carried thither by the Indic Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>“From an account of a temple of Daiboth, probably the same with Daibod, at Meaco,
                    in Japan, we may perceive that the people there speak of the renewal of the
                    world at the deluge as the real creation, which I have shown to be a common
                    mistake in the histories of the event. And though the story is told with some
                    variation, yet in all the circumstances of consequence it accords very happily
                    with the mythology of Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It matters not how the emblems
                    have by length of time been misinterpreted. We have the mundane egg upon the
                    waters, and the concomitant symbol of the moon; and the egg at last opened by
                    the assistance of the sacred steer, upon which the world issues forth to this
                    day.” The author proceeds afterwards to mention the great veneration paid in
                    these parts to the ox and cow, and says that nobody dares injure them. One deity
                    of the Japanese was Canon, the reputed lord of the ocean. He was represented in
                    an erect posture, crowned with a flower, and coming out of the mouth of a fish.
                    He is represented in the same manner by the natives of India, and named <hi
                    rend="italic">Vishnu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ma-cauter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and he is to be found in other parts of the East. Father Boushet
                    mentions a tradition among the Indians concerning a flood in the days of Vishnu,
                    which covered the whole earth. It is moreover reported of him, that seeing the
                    prevalence of the waters, he made a float, and being turned into a fish, he
                    steered it with his tail. This person, in the account of the Banians by Lord, is
                    called Menow; which certainly should be expressed Men-Now. It is said, that in
                    the Shaster of this people, a like history is given of the earth being
                    overwhelmed by a deluge, in which mankind perished; but the world was afterwards
                    renewed by two persons called Menou and Ceteroupa. Vishnu is described under
                    many characters, which he is said at times to have assumed. One of these,
                    according to the Brahmins of Tanjour, was that of Rama Sami. This undoubtedly is
                    the same as Sama Rama of Babylonia, only reversed; and it relates to that great
                    phenomenon the Iris, which was generally accompanied with the dove, and held in
                    veneration by the Semarim.</p>
                <p>“As the history of China is supposed to extend upwards to an amazing height, it
                    may be worth while to consider the first eras in the Chinese annals, as they are
                    represented in the writings of Japan (for the Japanese have preserved histories
                    of China); and by such a collation, I believe no small light may be obtained
                    towards the discovery of some important truths. Hitherto it has not been
                    observed that such a collation could be made.</p>
                <p>“In the histories of this country, the first monarch of China; is named Foki, the
                    same whom the Chinese call Fohi, and place at the head of their list. This
                    prince had, according to some the body, according to others the head, of a
                    serpent. If we may believe the Japanese historians, he began his reign above
                    21,000 years before Christ. The second Chinese emperor was Sin-Noo, by the
                    people of China called Sin-Num; and many begin the chronology of the country
                    with him. He is supposed to have lived about 3000 years before Christ,
                    consequently there is an interval of near 18,000 years between the first emperor
                    and the second, a circumstance not to be credited. The third, who immediately
                    succeeded Sin-Noo, was Hoam-Ti. In this account we may, I think, perceive, that
                    the Chinese have acted like the people of Greece and other regions. The
                    histories which were imported they have prefixed to the annals of the nation;
                    and adopted the first personages of antiquity, and made them monarchs in their
                    own country. Whom can we suppose Fohi, with the head of a serpent, to have been,
                    but the great founder of all kingdoms, the father of mankind? They have placed
                    him at an immense distance, not knowing his true era. And I think we may be
                    assured, that under the character of Sin-Num and Sin-Noo we have the history of
                    Noah; and Hoam-Ti was no other than Ham. According to Kaempfer, Sin-Noo was
                    exactly the same character as Serapis of Egypt. ‘ He was a husbandman, and
                    taught mankind agriculture, and those arts which relate to the immediate support
                    of life. He also discovered the virtues of many plants; and he was represented
                    with the head of an ox, and sometimes only with two horns. Plis picture is held
                    in high estimation by the Chinese.’ Well indeed might Kaempfer think that in
                    Sin-Noo he saw the character of Serapis, for this personage was no other than
                    Sar-Apis, the great father of mankind, the same as Men-Neuas of Egypt, the same
                    also as Dionusus and Osiris. By Du Halde he is called Chin-Nong, and made the
                    first mo <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756346" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6346-0698"/>
                    narch after Fohi. The Chinese accounts afford the same history as has been given
                    above.</p>
                <p>“As the family of Noah consisted of eight persons inclusive, there have been
                    writers who have placed some of them in succession, and supposed that there were
                    three or four persons who reigned between Sin-Noo and Hoam. But Du Halde says,
                    that in the true histories of the country, the three first monarchs were Fohi,
                    Chin-Nong, and Hoam, whom he styles Hoang-Ti. To these, he says, the arts and
                    sciences owe their invention and progress. Thus we find that those who were
                    heads of families have been raised to be princes, and their names have been
                    prefixed to the list of kings, and their history superadded to the annals of the
                    country. It is further observable, in the accounts given of those supposed
                    kings, that their term of life, for the first five or six generations,
                    corresponds with that of the patriarchs after the flood, and decreases much in
                    the same proportion.</p>
                <p>“The history of Japan is divided into three eras, which consist of gods,
                    demigods, and mortals. The person whom the natives look upon to be the real
                    founder of their monarchy is named Synmu, in whose reign the Sintoo religion,
                    the most ancient of the country, was introduced. It was called Sin-sju and
                    Chami-mitsa, from Sin and Chami, the deities which were the objects of worship.
                    At this time it is said that 600 foreign idols were brought into Japan. To the
                    Sintoo religion was afterwards added the Budso, together with the worship of
                    Amida. This deity they commonly represented with the head of a dog, and esteemed
                    him the guardian of mankind. This religion was more complicated than the former,
                    and abounded with hieroglyphical representations and mysterious rites. It is the
                    same which I have termed the <hi rend="italic">Arhite Idolatry,</hi> wherein the
                    sacred steer and cow were venerated. The deity was represented upon the lotus
                    and upon a tortoise, and oftentimes as proceeding from a fish. In this also,
                    under the character of Buddha, we may trace innumerable memorials of the ark,
                    and of the person preserved in it. The author above, having mentioned the
                    eleventh emperor inclusive from Syn-Mu, tells us that in his time these rites
                    began, <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> In his reign Budo, otherwise called
                    Kobotus, came over from the Indies to Japan, and brought with him, upon a white
                    horse, his religion and doctrines.’ We find here, that the object of worship is
                    made the person who introduced it (a mistake almost universally prevalent),
                    otherwise in this short account what a curious history is unfolded.</p>
                <p>“The only people to whom we can have recourse for any written memorials
                    concerning these things are the inhabitants of India Proper. They were, we find,
                    the persons who introduced these hieroglyphics both in China and Japan. It will
                    therefore be worth while to consider what they have transmitted concerning their
                    religious opinions, as we may from hence obtain still greater light towards
                    explaining this symbolical worship. Every manifestation of God’s goodness to the
                    world was in the first ages expressed by an hieroglyphic; and the Deity was
                    accordingly described under various forms, and in different attitudes. These at
                    length were mistaken for real transfigurations; and Vishnu was supposed to have
                    appeared in different shapes, which were styled Incarnations. In one of these he
                    is represented under the figure before mentioned, of a princely person coming
                    out of a fish. In another he appears with the head of a boar, treading upon an
                    evil daemon, which seems to be the same as the Typhon of the Egyptians. On his
                    head he supports a lunette, in which are seen cities, towers, in short, all that
                    the world contains. In Baldaeus we have a delineation and history of this
                    incarnation. Kircher varies a little in his representation, yet gives him a
                    similar figure of the Deity, and styles him <hi rend="smallcaps">J¾⅛b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Barachater.</hi> By this I should think was signified Vishnu, “the
                    offspring of the fish.” The Brahmins say that there was a time when the serpent
                    with a thousand heads withdrew itselfļ and would not support the world, it was
                    so overburdened with sin. Upon this the earth sunk in the great abyss of waters,
                    and mankind and all that breathed perished. But Vishnu took upon himself the
                    form above described, and diving to the bottom of the sea, lifted up the earth
                    out of the waters, and placed it, together with the serpent of a thousand heads,
                    upon the back of a tortoise.</p>
                <p>“In the third volume of M. Perron’s Zendavesta, there is an account given of the
                    cosmogony of the Parsees; also of the subsequent great events that ensued. The
                    supreme Deity, called by him Ormisda, is said to have accomplished the creation
                    at six different intervals. He first formed the heavens, at the second the
                    waters, at the third the earth. Next in order were produced the trees and
                    vegetables; in the fifth place were formed birds and fishes, and the wild
                    inhabitants of the woods; and in the sixth and last place he created man. The
                    man thus produced is said to be an ox-like person, and is described as
                    consisting of a purely divine and a mortal part. For some time after his
                    creation he lived in great happiness; but at last the world was corrupted by a
                    daemon named Ahriman. This daemon had the boldness to visit heaven, whence he
                    came down to the earth in the form of a serpent, and introduced a set of wicked
                    beings called karsesters. By him the first ox-like personage, called Aboudad,
                    was so infected that he died; after which Kaimorts, probably the divine part, of
                    which the ox was the representative, died also. Out of the left arm of the
                    deceased proceeded a being called Goschòraun, who is said to have raised a cry
                    louder than the shout of 1000 men. After some conversation between the supreme
                    Deity and Goschoraun, it was determined to put Ahriman-to flight, and to destroy
                    all those wicked persons he had introduced; for there now seemed to be an
                    universal opposition to the supreme Deity Ormisda. At this season a second
                    ox-like personage is introduced by the name of Taschter. He is spoken of both as
                    a star and a sun. At the same time he is mentioned as a person upon earth under
                    three forms. By Taschter is certainly signified De Ashter, the same person whom
                    the Greeks and Syrians represented as a female, and called Astarte. She was
                    described horned, and sometimes with the head of a bull; supposed to proceed
                    from an egg; and they esteemed her the same as Juno and the moon. At last it was
                    thought proper to bring an universal inundation over the face of the earth, that
                    all impurity might be washed away; which being accomplished by Taschter, every
                    living creature perished, and the earth was for some time entirely covered. At
                    last, the waters retreating within their proper bounds, the mountains of Albordi
                    in Ferakh-kand first appeared; which the author compares to a tree, and supposes
                    that all other mountains proceeded from it. After this there was a renewal of
                    the world, and the earth was restored to its pristine state. The particular
                    place where Ormisda planted the germina from whence all things were to spring
                    was Ferakh-kand, which seems to be the land of Arach, the country upon the
                    Araxes, in Armenia.”</p>
                <p>Thus we have given ample specimens of this author’s method of reasoning, and of
                    discovering traces of the sacred history even in things which have been thought
                    to have the least possible relation to it. That the Greeks and western nations
                    had some knowledge of the flood, has never been disputed; and from what has been
                    already related, it appears that the same has pervaded the remotest regions of
                    the east. The knowledge which these people have of the fall of man, and the
                    bitter consequences which ensued, can·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756359" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6359-0699"/>
                <p>not, according to Bryant, have arisen from their intercourse with Christians; for
                    their traditions afford no traces of any kind, either of Christianity or its
                    founder. Whatever truths may be found in their writings, therefore, must be
                    derived from a more ancient source. “There are,” says he, “in every climate some
                    shattered fragments of original history, some traces of a primitive and
                    universal language; and these may be observed in the names of deities, terms of
                    worship, and titles of honour, which prevail among nations widely separated, who
                    for ages had no connection. The like may be found in the names of pagodas and
                    temples, and of sundry other objects which will present themselves to the
                    traveller.”</p>
                <p>The accounts hitherto met with in the American continent are far from being
                    equally authentic and satisfactory with those already treated of. In Acosta’s
                    history of the Indies, however, we are informed that the Mexicans make
                    particular mention of a deluge in their country, by which all men were drowned.
                    According to them, one Viracocha came out of the great lake Titicaca in their
                    country. This person dwelt in Tiaguanaco, where at this day are to be seen the
                    ruins of some ancient and very strange buildings; and thence he proceeded to
                    Cusco, where mankind began to multiply. They show also a small lake, where they
                    say the sun hid himself; for which reason they sacrifice largely to him, both
                    men and other animals. Hennepin informs us that some of the savages are of
                    opinion that a certain spirit, called Otkon by the Iroquois, and Atahauta by
                    those at the mouth of the river St Lawrence, is the creator of the world; and
                    that Messou repaired it after the deluge. They say that this Messou or Otkon,
                    being a-hunting one day, his dogs lost themselves in a great lake, which
                    thereupon overflowing, covered the whole earth in a short time, and swallowed up
                    the world. According to Herrera, the people of Cuba knew that the heavens and
                    the earth had been created, and said they had much information concerning the
                    flood, and that the world had been destroyed by water by three personages who
                    came three several ways. Gabriel de Cabrera was told by a man of more than
                    seventy years of age that an old man, knowing the deluge was to come, built a
                    great ship, and went into it with his family and abundance of animals; that he
                    sent out a crow, which did not at first return, staying to feed on the carcases
                    of dead animals, but that she afterwards came back with a green branch. He is
                    said to have added other particulars nearly consonant to the Mosaic account. The
                    same author likewise informs us that it was reported by the inhabitants of
                    Castilla del Oro, in Terra Firma, that when the universal deluge happened, one
                    man with his wife and children escaped in a canoe, and that from them the world
                    had been peopled. The Peruvians likewise affirmed that they had received by
                    tradition from their ancestors, that, many years before there were any incas or
                    kings, when the country was very populous, there happened a great flood; the sea
                    breaking out beyond its bounds, so that the land was covered with water, and all
                    the people perished. To this it is added by the Guancas, inhabiting the vale of
                    Nausea, and the natives of Chiquito in the province of Callao, that some persons
                    found shelter in the hollows and caves of the highest mountains, who again
                    peopled the land. Others again affirm that all perished in a deluge, only six
                    persons being saved in a float, from whom are descended all the inhabitants of
                    that country. In Nieuhoff’s voyages to Brazil we are informed that the most
                    barbarous of the Brazilians, inhabiting the inland countries, scarcely knew
                    anything of religion or of an Almighty Being. But they had some knowledge
                    remaining of a general deluge, it being their opinion that the whole race of
                    mankind were extirpated by a general deluge, except one man and his sister, who
                    being with child before, they by degrees repeopled the world. Μ. Thevet gives us
                    the creed of the Brazilians in this matter more particularly. In the opinion of
                    these savages the deluge was universal. They say that Summay, a Caribbee of
                    great dignity, had two children named Tamendonare and Aricote. Being of contrary
                    dispositions, one delighting in peace and the other in war and rapine, they
                    mortally hated each other. One day Aricote, the warrior, brought an arm of an
                    enemy whom he had encountered to his brother, reproaching him at the same time
                    with cowardice. But the other retorted by telling, that if he had been possessed
                    of the valour which he boasted, he would have brought his enemy entire. On this
                    Aricote threw the arm against the door of his brother’s house. At that instant
                    the whole village was carried up into the sky; and Tamendonare striking the
                    ground with violence, a vast stream of water issued out from it, and continued
                    to flow in such quantity, that in a short time it seemed to rise above the
                    clouds, and the earth was entirely covered. The two brothers seeing this,
                    ascended the highest mountains of the country, and with their wives ascended the
                    trees which grew upon them. By this deluge all mankind, as well as all other
                    animals, were drowned, excepting the two brothers above mentioned and their
                    wives, who having descended when the flood abated, became the heads of two
                    different nations.</p>
                <p>To these American testimonies we may add another from the remote and uncivilized
                    island of Otaheite. Dr Watson, in his discourse to the clergy, informs us, that
                    one of the navigators to the southern hemisphere having asked some of the
                    inhabitants of that island concerning their origin, was answered, that their
                    supreme God, a long time ago. being angry, dragged the earth through the sea,
                    and their island, being broken oft', was preserved. In the East Indies, we are
                    informed by Dr Watson that Sir William Jones, by whom a society .for the
                    advancement of Asiatic literature was instituted at Calcutta, discovered in the
                    oldest mythological books of that country such an account of the deluge as
                    corresponds sufficiently with that of Moses.</p>
                <p>The fact being thus established by the universal consent of mankind, that there
                    was a general deluge which overflowed the whole world, it remains next to
                    inquire by what means it may reasonably be supposed to have been accomplished.
                    There have been many speculations on the instruments employed in bringing about
                    this grand cataclysm; and a great division of opinion has existed as to the
                    effects which it might be expected to have produced on the surface of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted that a quantity of water was created on purpose, and at a
                    proper time annihilated, by divine power. This, however, besides its being
                    absolutely without evidence, is directly contrary to the words of the sacred
                    writer whom the supporters of this hypothesis mean to defend. Iĭe expressly
                    derives the waters of the flood from two sources; first, the fountains of the
                    great deep, which he tells us were all broken open; and secondly, the windows of
                    heaven, which he says were opened: and speaking of the decrease of the waters,
                    be says, the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and
                    the waters returned continually from off the face of the earth. Here it is
                    obvious that Moses was so far from having any difficulty about the quantity of
                    water, that he thought the sources whence it came were not exhausted; since both
                    of them required to be stopped by the same almighty hand which had opened them,
                    lest the flood should increase more than it actually did.</p>
                <p>Dr Burnet, in his <hi rend="italic">Telluris Theoria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacra,</hi> endeavours to show that all the waters in the ocean were not
                    sufficient to cover the earth to the depth assigned by Moses. Supposing the sea
                    drained quite dry, and all the clouds of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756372"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6372-0700"/>atmosphere dissolved into rain, we should still,
                    according to him, want much the greater part of the water of a deluge. To get
                    rid of this difficulty, Dr Burnet and others have adopted Descartes’ theory.
                    That philosopher supposes the antediluvian world to have been perfectly round
                    and equal, without mountains or valleys. He accounts for its formation on
                    mechanical principles, by supposing it at first in the condition of a thick
                    turbid fluid, replete with divers heterogeneous matters, which, subsiding by
                    slow degrees, formed themselves into different concentric strata or beds, in
                    obedience to <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> the law of gravity. Dr Burnet improves
                    on this theory by supposing the primitive earth to have been no more than a
                    shell or crust investing the surface of the water contained in the ocean, and in
                    the central abyss which he and others suppose to exist in the bowels of the
                    earth. At the time of the flood, this outward crust, according to him, broke in
                    a thousand pieces; and consequently sunk down among the water, which thus
                    spouted up in vast cataracts, and overflowed the whole surface. He supposes
                    also, that before the flood there was a perfect coincidence of the equator with
                    the ecliptic, and consequently that the antediluvian world enjoyed a perpetual
                    spring; but that the violence of the shock by which the outer crust was broken
                    shifted also the position of the earth, and produced the present obliquity of
                    the ecliptic. This theory, it will be observed, is equally arbitrary with the
                    former. But it is, besides, directly contrary to the words of Moses, who assures
                    us, that all the high hills were covered; whilst, in opposition to this, Dr
                    Burnet affirms that there were then no hills in existence.</p>
                <p>Other authors, supposing a sufficient fund of water in the abyss or sea, are only
                    concerned for an expedient to bring it forth. Accordingly some have recourse to
                    a shifting of the earth’s centre of gravity, by which, the water being drawn out
                    of its channel, the several parts of the earth were successively
                    overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>Mr Whiston, in his <hi rend="italic">New Theory of the Earth,</hi> shows, from
                    several remarkable coincidences, that a comet descending in the plane of the
                    ecliptic, towards its perihelion, must have passed just before the earth on the
                    first day of the deluge; the consequences of which would be, first, that this
                    comet, when it came below the moon, would raise a vast and strong tide, both in
                    the small seas, which according to his hypothesis existed in the antediluvian
                    earth (for he allows no great ocean there, as in ours), and also in the abyss
                    which was under the upper crust of the earth; and this tide would rise and
                    increase during all the time of the approach of the comet towards the earth, and
                    would be at its greatest height when the comet was at its least distance from
                    the earth. By the force of this tide, and also by the attraction of the comet,
                    he judges that the abyss must have assumed an elliptical figure, the surface of
                    which being considerably larger than the former spherical one, the outward crust
                    of the earth, incumbent on the abyss, must accommodate itself to that figure,
                    which it could not do whilst it remained solid and conjoined. He concludes,
                    therefore, that it must of necessity have been extended, and at last broken, by
                    the violence of the tides and attraction; and that the included water issuing
                    thence was a great means of the deluge, according to what Moses says of the
                    “fountains of the great deep being broken open.” Again, the same comet, he
                    maintains, in its descent towards the sun, passed so close by the body of the
                    earth, as to involve the latter in its atmosphere and tail for a considerable
                    time, and of consequence left a vast quantity of its vapours, both expanded and
                    condensed, on its surface, a great part of which being rarefied by the solar
                    heat, would be drawn up into the atmosphere, and afterwards return in violent
                    rains. And this he takes to be what Moses intimates by</p>
                <p>“the windows of heaven being opened,” and particularly by the “forty days rain.”
                    Lastly, to remove this vast orb of waters again, he supposes a mighty wind to
                    have arisen, which dried up some, and forced the rest into the abyss through the
                    clefts by which it came up; only a great quantity remained in the alveus of the
                    ocean, now first formed, and in lesser seas, lakes, and the like. This theory
                    was at first only proposed as an hypothesis; but, on further consideration, Mr
                    Whiston thought he could actually prove that a comet did at that time {lass very
                    near the earth, and that it was the same which afterwards appeared in 1688. But
                    the uncertainty of the comet’s return in 1758, and the absolute failure of that
                    which ought to have appeared in 1788 or 1789, must certainly render Mr Whiston’s
                    calculations for such a length of time extremely dubious.</p>
                <p>Mr Hutchinson and his followers present us with a theory of the deluge, which
                    they pretend to derive from the word of God itself. This theory has been
                    particularly enlarged upon and illustrated by Mr Catcot, who in 1768 published a
                    volume on the subject. This gentleman asserts, that when the world was first
                    created, at the time when it is said to have been “without form and void,” the
                    terrestrial matter was then entirely dissolved in the aqueous; so that the whole
                    formed, as it were, a thick muddy water. The figure of this mass was spherical;
                    and on the outside of this sphere lay the gross dark air. Within the sphere of
                    earth and water was an immense cavity, called by Moses the <hi rend="italic"
                    >deep</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this internal cavity was filled with air
                    of a kind similar to that on the outside. On the creation of light, the internal
                    air received elasticity sufficient to burst out through the external covering of
                    earth and water. Upon this the water descended, filled up the void, and left the
                    earth in a form similar to that which it has at present. Thus, according to him,
                    the antediluvian world, as well as the present, consisted of a vast collection
                    or nucleus of water, called the <hi rend="italic">great deep,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">abyss.</hi> The breaking up of these fountains was occasioned by a
                    miraculous pressure of the atmosphere, from the immediate action of the Deity
                    himself; and so violent was this pressure, that the air descended to where it
                    had originally been, occupied the space of the abyss, and drove out the waters
                    over the whole surface of the dry land. But this account, so far from being
                    infallibly certain, seems inconsistent with the most common observation. No
                    pressure, however violent, will cause water to rise above its level, unless the
                    pressure is unequal. If therefore the atmosphere entered into the supposed abyss
                    by a vehement pressure on the surface of the ocean, that pressure must only have
                    been on one place, or on a few places; and even though we suppose the atmosphere
                    to have been the agent made use of, it is impossible that it could have remained
                    for any time in the abyss, as the pressure of the water would immediately have
                    forced it up again through those holes which had afforded it a passage
                    downwards.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Beaumont has indulged in the speculation that the sudden appearance of the
                    Cordillera of the Andes may have caused the historical deluge; that the
                    unfathomable ocean was suddenly upheaved, and converted into dry land, thereby
                    displacing a great body of water, and producing a diluvial wave or
                    regurgitation, which inundated the previously existing portion of the earth. An
                    event of this kind, it cannot be disputed, would very probably have produced
                    such an effect as he anticipates; but the sudden elevation of such a
                    mountain-ridge as the Andes to the height of ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand
                    feet, would displace a great volume of atmospheric air, not of water, and, if
                    the velocity of the movement were sufficiently great, might occasion a
                    tremendous hurricane.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that we can pretend to ascertain<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756385" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6385-0701"/> any thing more on the
                    subject than others have done. The following conjectures, however, may be
                    offered as to the manner in which the deluge might have happened, without any
                    violence to the established laws of nature.</p>
                <p>If we consider the quantity of water requisite for the purpose of the deluge, it
                    will not appear so very extraordinary as has been commonly represented. The
                    height of the highest hills is thought not to exceed four or five miles. It will
                    therefore be deemed a sufficient allowance, when we suppose the waters of the
                    deluge to have been four miles deep on the surface of the ground. Now it is
                    certain that water, or any other matter, when spread out at large upon the
                    ground, seems to occupy an immense space in comparison of that which it does
                    when contained in a cubical vessel, or when packed together in a cubical form. A
                    cube of ten miles of water would very nearly overflow two hundred and fifty-six
                    square miles of plain ground to the height of four miles. But if we take into
                    account the vast number of eminences with which the surface of the earth
                    abounds, the above-mentioned quantity of water would cover a great deal more.
                    If, therefore, we attempt to calculate the quantity of water sufficient to
                    deluge the earth, we must make a very considerable allowance for the bulk of all
                    the hills upon its surface. But, to consider this matter in its utmost latitude,
                    the surface of the earth is supposed by the latest computations to contain about
                    199,512,595 square miles. In order to overflow this surface to the height of
                    four miles, there is required a parallelopiped of water sixteen miles deep, and
                    containing 49,878,148 square miles of surface. Now, considering the immense
                    thickness of the globe of the earth, it is by no means improbable that this
                    quantity of water might be contained in its bowels, without the necessity of any
                    remarkable abyss or huge collection of water, such as most of our theorists
                    suppose to exist in the centre. It is certain that, as far as the earth has been
                    mined, it has been found, not dry, but moist; nor have we any reason to imagine
                    that it is not at least equally moist to the centre. How moist it really is
                    cannot be known, nor can the quantity of water requisite to impart to it the
                    degree of moisture it has be ascertained; but we are certain that it must be
                    immense. It was not, however, from the bowels of the earth alone that the waters
                    were discharged, but also from the air; for we are assured by Moses that it
                    rained forty days and forty nights. But this source of the diluvian waters has
                    been considered as of small consequence by almost every one who has written on
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>With reference to this subject we must observe, however, that there is a very
                    general mistake with regard to the air, similar to that above mentioned
                    regarding the earth. Because the earth below our feet appears to our senses firm
                    and compact, therefore the vast quantity of water contained even in the most
                    solid parts of it, and which will readily appear on proper experiment, is
                    overlooked. In like manner, because the air does not always deluge with
                    excessive rains, it is also imagined that it contains but little water. Because
                    the pressure of the air is able to raise only thirty-two feet of water on the
                    surface of the earth, it is therefore supposed that we may ascertain to what
                    depth the atmosphere could deluge the earth if it was to discharge the <hi
                    rend="italic">whole</hi> water contained in it. But we know that the pressure of
                    the atmosphere has not the least connection with the quantity of water which it
                    contains. Nay, if there is any connection, the air, as exhibited by the
                    barometer, seems to be lightest when it contains most water. For these reasons
                    we think that the quantity of water contained in the whole atmosphere ought to
                    be considered as indefinite, especially as we know that by whatever agent it is
                    suspended, that agent must counteract the force of gravity, otherwise the water
                    would immediately descend.</p>
                <p>The above considerations render it at least probable that there is in nature a
                    quantity of water sufficient to deluge the world, provided it were applied to
                    the purpose. We must next consider, therefore, whether there be any natural
                    agent powerful enough to effect this purpose; and we shall take the phrases used
                    by Moses in their most obvious sense. The breaking up of the fountains of the
                    deep we may reasonably suppose to have been the opening of all passages, whether
                    great or small, through which the subterraneous waters could possibly discharge
                    themselves on the surface of the earth. The opening of the windows of heaven we
                    may also suppose to be the pouring out of the water contained in the atmosphere,
                    through those invisible passages by which it enters in such a manner as totally
                    to elude our senses, as when water is absorbed by the air in evaporation. As
                    both these are said to have been opened at the same time, it seems therefore
                    probable that one natural agent was employed to do both. Now it is certain that
                    the industry of modern inquiry has discovered an agent unknown to former ages,
                    the influence of which is so great, that with regard to this world, it may be
                    said to possess a kind of omnipotence. The agent which we mean is electricity.
                    It is certain, that by means of it immense quantities of water can be raised to
                    a great height in the air. This is clearly proved by the phenomena of
                    waterspouts. Mr Forster relates, that he happened to see one break very near
                    him, and observed a flash of lightning to proceed from it at the moment of its
                    breaking. The conclusion from all this is obvious. When the electric matter was
                    discharged from the water, it could no longer be supported by the atmosphere,
                    but immediately descended. Though water-spouts do not often appear in this
                    country, yet every one must have made an observation somewhat similar to Mr
                    Forster’s. In a violent storm of thunder and rain, after every flash of
                    lightning or discharge of electricity from the clouds, the rain pours down with
                    increased violence; thus showing that the cloud having parted with so much of
                    its electricity, cannot longer be supported in the form of vapour, but must
                    descend in rain. It is not indeed yet discovered that electricity is the cause
                    of the suspension of water in the atmosphere, but it is certain that evaporation
                    is promoted by electrifying the fluid to be evaporated. It may therefore be
                    admitted as a possibility, that the electric fluid contained in the air may be
                    the agent by which it is enabled to suspend the water which rises in vapour. If
                    therefore the air be deprived of the due proportion of this fluid, it is evident
                    that rain must fall in prodigious quantities.</p>
                <p>Again, we are assured, from the most undeniable observations, that electricity is
                    able to swell up water on the surface of the earth. This we can make it do even
                    in our trifling experiments; and much more must the whole force of the fluid be
                    supposed capable of doing it, if applied to the waters of the ocean, or to any
                    others. The agitation of the sea in earthquakes is a sufficient proof of this.
                    It is certain that at these times there is a discharge of a vast quantity of
                    electric matter from the earth into the air; and that, as soon as this happens,
                    all becomes quiet on the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p>From a multitude of observations, it also appears that there is at all times a
                    passage of electric matter from the atmosphere into the earth, and, <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> from the earth into the atmosphere. There is
                    therefore no absurdity in supposing the Deity to have influenced the action of
                    the natural powers in such a manner, that for forty days and forty nights the
                    electric matter contained in the atmosphere should descend into the bowels of
                    the earth: if indeed there be occasion for supposing any such immediate
                    influence at all; since it is not impossible that there might have been, from
                    some natural cause, a descent of this matter <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756398"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6398-0702"/>from the atmosphere at that time. But by whatever
                    cause the descent was occasioned, the consequence would be, the breaking open of
                    the fountains of the deep, and the opening of the windows of heaven. The water
                    contained in the atmosphere being left without support, would descend in
                    impetuous rains; whilst the waters of the ocean, those from which fountains
                    originate, and those contained in the solid earth itself, would rise from the
                    very centre, and meet the waters which descended from above. Thus the breaking
                    up of the fountains of the deep, and the opening of the windows of heaven, would
                    accompany each other, as Moses tells us they actually did; for, according to
                    him, both happened at the same time.</p>
                <p>In this manner the flood would come on gradually, without that violence to the
                    globe which Burnet, Whiston, and other theorists, are obliged to suppose. The
                    abatement of the waters would ensue on the ascent of the electric fluid; the
                    atmosphere would then absorb the water as formerly; that which had ascended
                    through the earth would again subside; and thus every thing would return to its
                    former state.</p>
                <p>Having thus shown in what manner an universal deluge might have been produced by
                    means of those natural agents with which we are at present acquainted, we shall
                    next consider some of those remarkable geological facts which place it beyond a
                    doubt, not only that that event did happen, but that the deluge was universal.
                    It has long been a question, even before the commencement of geological
                    researches, whether the deluge mentioned in Scripture was universal in reference
                    to the whole surface of the globe, or only so with respect to that portion of it
                    which was then inhabited by man. Vossius was of opinion, that in the days of
                    Noah, mankind had not extended themselves beyond the borders of Syria and
                    Mesopotamia; and no reason, says he, “obliges us to extend the inundation of the
                    deluge beyond those bounds which were inhabited; yea, it is altogether absurd to
                    aver that the effect of a punishment inflicted upon mankind only, should extend
                    to those places where no man lived. Although we should therefore believe that
                    part of the earth only to have been overflowed by the waters which we have
                    mentioned, and which is not the hundredth part of the terrestrial globe, the
                    deluge will nevertheless be <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> oecumenical, since
                    the destruction was universal, and overwhelmed the whole habitable world.”</p>
                <p>If such an interpretation were admissible, there are two classes of phenomena in
                    the configuration of the earth’s surface, which, according to Professor Lyell,
                    might enable us to account for such an event; <hi rend="italic">first,</hi>
                    extensive lakes elevated above the level of the ocean; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondly,</hi> large tracts of dry land depressed below that level. “When there
                    is an immense lake, having its surface, like Lake Superior, raised six hundred
                    feet above the level of the sea, the waters may be suddenly let loose by the
                    rending or sinking down of the barrier during earthquakes; and hereby a region
                    as extensive as the valley of the Mississippi, inhabited by a population of
                    several millions, might be deluged. On the other hand, there may be a country
                    placed beneath the mean level of the ocean, as is the case with certain parts of
                    Asia; and such a region must be entirely laid under water, should the tract
                    which separates it from the ocean be fissured or depressed to a certain depth.
                    The great cavity of Western Asia is 18,000 square leagues in area, and is
                    occupied by a considerable population. The lowest parts, surrounding the Caspian
                    Sea, are three hundred feet below the level of the Euxine; here, therefore, the
                    diluvial waters might overflow the summits of hills rising three hundred feet
                    above the level of the plain; and if depressions still more profound existed at
                    any former time in Asia, the tops of still loftier mountains may have been
                    covered by a flood.”</p>
                <p>Pallas, and some of the geologists of his day, denied that the summits of the
                    hills had been covered by the deluge; for, according to his hypothesis, the mass
                    of water required to surmount, or even to cover them all round the globe could
                    not be disposed of within the earth, even were its interior wholly made up of
                    caverns. Had the deluge been of this partial and transient description, we
                    should have been led to look for its effects only in certain situations; in
                    those countries, in particular, which we know were inhabited by antediluvian
                    mortals. Such, however, is not the fact; the distinct traces of its action being
                    visible under innumerable circumstances, and in almost every country on the face
                    of the globe. To what, we would ask, do those immense tracts of gravel and loam,
                    so frequent in Prussia, Denmark, and other parts of the European continent, and
                    in situations to which no torrents nor rivers now in action could ever have
                    drifted them, owe their existence? Whence came those vast collections of fossil
                    bones and other animal remains so common in Siberia, in Behring’s Strait, in the
                    valley of the Arno in Tuscany, and in many districts of Germany and England? How
                    were the beds of shells and other marine productions brought together in such
                    profusion, and raised to elevations which the seabreeze never reached? By what
                    means were those large erratic boulders so common among the sand in the north of
                    Germany, and in numerous other places, removed from their original position, and
                    conveyed sometimes hundreds of miles from any rock of a similar description?</p>
                <p>Dr Buckland, in his <hi rend="italic">Reliquiae Diluvianae,</hi> enumerates a
                    great many English localities where remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, hyena,
                    and the other larger animalshave been met with. In Scotland and Ireland they
                    have also been occasionally found. At the village of Theide, near Brunswick, a
                    congeries of tusks, teeth, and bones, were discovered in 1816, some of the
                    former upwards of fourteen feet in length. Within the last ten years, parts of
                    the skeletons of at least a hundred hippopotami have been discovered in the
                    valley of the Arno, and placed in the museum of Florence, along with numerous
                    remains of the rhinoceros and elephant, horse, ox, several species of deer,
                    hyena, bear, wolf, dog, tiger, tapir, hog, beaver, mastodon, and fox. Over the
                    frozen regions of Russia and Siberia their dispersion is also nearly universal.
                    There is not, says Pallas, in all Asiatic Russia, from the Don to the extremity
                    of the promontory of Tchutchis, a stream or river in the banks of which are not
                    to be found the remains of elephants and other animals, now strangers to that
                    climate. These are washed out by the violent floods arising from the thaw of the
                    snows, and have attracted universally the attention of the natives, who collect
                    annually the elephants’ tusks, in order to sell them as ivory. Humboldt has also
                    noticed them in the plains of Mexicoand in the province of Quito. How is it
                    possible, says Buckland, to explain the general dispersion of all these remains,
                    but by admitting that the elephants, as well as all the other creatures whose
                    bones are buried with them, were the antediluvian inhabitants of the extensive
                    tracts of country over which we have been tracing them, and that they were all
                    destroyed together by the waters of the same inundation which produced the
                    deposits of loam and gravel in which they are imbedded.</p>
                <p>• The <hi rend="italic">diluvium</hi> of geologists is the name applied to those
                    deposits of loam and gravel which were formed by the flood, in order to
                    distinguish them from those which are in daily and gradual progress, and
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">alluvium.</hi> The origin of the alluvial
                    formations may be referred to the action of torrents, rivers, and lakes, whilst
                    to the production of the diluvial deposits no cause at present in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756411" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6411-0703"/>action is adequate; and they
                    can therefore only be referred to the waters of a sudden and transient
                    deluge.</p>
                <p>Immense deposits of diluvium have taken place in Holland, Denmark, Holstein,
                    Pomerania, and along the southern shores of the Baltic. The whole coast, from
                    the Thames to the Tweed, consists of such deposits, being composed principally
                    of a tough bluish clay, through which are dispersed irregularly pebbles of
                    different sizes, and containing almost every description of rock. Much gravel is
                    accumulated in the midland counties of England, composed of the wreck of rocks
                    of the most distant ages, and which exist in their native state only in remote
                    quarters of the island.</p>
                <p>The immense boulders, or erratic blocks as they are termed by geologists, which
                    are met with in many parts of Europe, frequently at the distance of several
                    hundred miles from any similar rocks existing <hi rend="italic">insitu,</hi>
                    afford evidences of a stream having overflowed it, capable of overwhelming and
                    disregarding objects, and by which the Nile or the Ganges would have been turned
                    out of their course. In Great Britain we have instances of this in almost every
                    county. Professor Sedgwick, for instance, has remarked, that the blocks of shap
                    granite, which cannot be confounded with other rocks in the north of England,
                    are not only drifted over the hills near Appleby, but have been rolled over the
                    great central chain of England into the plains of Yorkshire—imbedded into the
                    transported detritus of the Tees, and even carried to the eastern coast. Blocks
                    of granite and syenite of a very peculiar character have been drifted from the
                    Criffle Hill, in Galloway, across the Solway Frith, to the base of the mountains
                    in Cumberland. Large blocks of another kind of granite have been transported in
                    still greater numbers from Ravenglass, on the coast of Cumberland, over the
                    plains of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Staffordshire, and may be observed in masses
                    of some tons weight to the west of the towns of Macclesfield and Stafford, and
                    between Dudley and Bridgenorth. Numerous examples of a similar description might
                    be cited; but the most remarkable circumstance attending these erratic blocks
                    is, that they do not occur promiscuously throughout the country, but invariably
                    to the <hi rend="italic">southward</hi> of the rock whence they have been
                    derived. From this it would appear, and indeed it is now pretty generally
                    admitted by geologists, that the direction of the great flood was, in this part
                    of the world at least, from north to south. The boulders on the east coast of
                    England have, according to Mr Philips, been derived both from Norway and from
                    Scotland; and Dr Hibbert mentions boulders three or four feet in height on the
                    northern coasts of Shetland, which do not correspond with any known rock of the
                    country, and were probably derived from the northward. If the supposition that a
                    mass of waters passed over Britain be founded on probability, the evidences of
                    such a passage should be found in the neighbouring continent of Europe, and the
                    general direction of the transported substances should be the same. Now this is
                    precisely what is found to be the case. In Sweden and Russia large blocks of
                    rock occur in great numbers, and no doubt can be entertained that they have been
                    transported from the north. In Sweden the transported materials were observed by
                    Brogniart to run in lines, sometimes inosculating, but having a general
                    direction from north to south. Between Petersburg and Moscow the erratic blocks
                    arc very numerous, and consist of Scandinavian rocks. In some places, especially
                    in Esthonia, these blocks appear at greater or less intervals, apparently owing
                    to the form of the land at the time of their transport: for they occur where
                    escarpments presented themselves; whilst, in places where the land sloped away,
                    or became more or less horizontal, they disappear, thus seeming to show that the
                    steep escarpments caught them in their passage.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De la Beche’s <hi rend="italic">Geological
                    Manual.</hi></p></note> In Eastern Prussia, and in that part of Poland situated
                    between the Vistula and the Niemen, the granite blocks are abundant, and consist
                    of the same varieties as those found in Finland; and thence westward over the
                    whole of the north of Germany, we find boulders whose origin is unequivocally
                    Scandinavian. Thus the hornblende blocks are from Southern and Western Finland;
                    the quartzose blocks are exactly the same as the rocks named <hi rend="italic"
                    >fjall</hi><hi rend="italic">Sandstein</hi> between Sweden and Norway; the
                    porphyritic blocks are of the same mineralogical character as the porphyries of
                    Elfdal in Sweden; and some of the granites contain even particles of orthite, a
                    mineral which has never been noticed anywhere except near Stockholm and in the
                    eastern district of the northern peninsula.</p>
                <p>The same thing has been frequently observed in America; and there also these
                    erratic blocks must have been rolled from the northward. Between Lake Erie and
                    Lake Huron the woods are strewed with masses of gneiss, porphyry, conglomerate,
                    and greenstone; and the summits of some of the highest hills in Nova Scotia,
                    which are composed of slate, are also strewed with large boulders of
                    granite.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis derived from the foregoing facts is further strengthened by the
                    furrows and other marks on the surface of many rocks, which have apparently been
                    produced by the attrition of heavy bodies, set in motion by a great force of
                    water in rapid movement. This phenomenon was first noticed by Sir James Hall,
                    whose elaborate paper on “The Revolutions of the Earth’s Surface,” published in
                    the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, has thrown more light upon
                    this most difficult subject than all the theories that were ever produced. It is
                    well known that the masses of rock carried down by a torrent exhibit traces of
                    that passage by scratches and abrasions of various sorts upon such smooth
                    surfaces as they may have encountered by the way, and on which they could not
                    fail to act as grinders. Such appearances are exhibited on a large scale in many
                    parts of the world; the surfaces of the rocks, to use the words of Sir James
                    Hall, “frequently resembling that of a wet road, along which a number of heavy
                    and irregular bodies have been recently dragged; indicating that every block
                    that passed, and every one of its corners, had left its trace behind it.” In
                    many cases these furrows or scratches have been so deep, and are scooped out on
                    the surface of such hard rocks, as to have resisted all the effects of the
                    weather, and are seen in situations that have been always exposed, sometimes
                    many yards in length. The most remarkable fact, however, is, that these furrows
                    are, with few exceptions, parallel; that they run in one direction across a
                    country; and that, in conformity with what we might be led to expect from the
                    foregoing remarks, the direction is generally from north to south.
                    “Occasionally,” observes Sir James Hall, “single scratches, and parallel sets of
                    them, deviate by five or six degrees from the general direction; but the
                    important circumstance is, that such deviation is rare, the very great majority
                    of both sets agreeing in parallelism with each other, and with the general
                    direction, not only of the scoops and grooves of the rock upon which they occur,
                    but also of the ridges and large features of the district.”</p>
                <p>Sir James Hall’s observations, as illustrated in the paper already mentioned,
                    were made in the vicinity of Edinburgh; and from the direction of the scratches
                    on the surface of Corstorphine Hill, united with other remarkable <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194756424" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6424-0704"/>appearances in the form of
                    the surrounding country, particularly in and around Edinburgh, the lengthened
                    ridges on the eastern side of the Castle Hill, Arthur Seat, and Craigléith, he
                    was induced to suppose (what indeed there is no reason to disbelieve) that the
                    general direction of the great torrent was in these districts from west to east.
                    This, however, arose probably from local circumstances; because, except in this
                    part of the world, we are not aware of any similar indications opposed to the
                    facts already stated. Generally speaking, indeed, they are strongly conclusive;
                    for even in the adjoining counties of Stirling and Berwickshire, the current
                    appears to have flowed from the north-west. In Norway and Sweden, again, these
                    grooves on the bare surface of the gneiss are frequently half an inch deep,
                    maybe traced for many hundred yards, and, with the exception of some slight
                    variations arising from the slope of the mountains, always appear in a direction
                    from north to south.</p>
                <p>Another striking proof which these countries afford, is the long ridges or mounds
                    of sand which extend throughout them for many miles from north to south. These
                    vary much in breadth and in height, sometimes rising from forty to sixty feet
                    above the level of the surrounding plain, at others disappearing for a time
                    entirely; frequently covering many acres, sometimes united with the adjoining
                    fields; here dividing a small lake, like an artificial mound, there forming a
                    promontory jutting out from the side of a large one. These ridges are
                    particularly marked in the southern portion of Sweden, where they intersect the
                    provinces of] Wasteraes, Wermeland, Orebro, and Upland, in almost uninterrupted
                    lines from their northern to their southern extremities.</p>
                <p>In fact, to use the characteristic language of Mr Weaver, “it seems impossible to
                    consider the form of any large portion of the surface of the earth, or to
                    reflect even upon the nature and disposition of its alluvial tracts, without
                    recognising the powerful agency of an agitated fluid in a state of retrocession.
                    The abrupt and curved outlines, the fractured sinuosities of glens, defiles, and
                    valleys, the salient and re-entering angles, the plains—all betray its course
                    and moulding force. To ascribe such appearances to a gradual degradation
                    produced by the influence of the atmosphere, and the current of streams, seems
                    to be assuming causes wholly inadequate to produce such effects.” But in
                    whatever way the crust of our globe had been formed, or how numerous may have
                    been the agents made use of in producing it-—whether its existence be due to
                    Neptunian or Plutonian action, or to agencies yet undiscovered and unknown—is
                    for the Almighty Being who formed it to decide. All that we know is, that every
                    diluvial fact concurs in denoting <hi rend="italic">one inundation,</hi> which
                    overwhelmed the solid mass of the globe; and unless we admit that that
                    inundation was not only <hi rend="italic">universal,</hi> but that it was the
                    last catastrophe to which the earth has been exposed, it is impossible to
                    explain those phenomena which have been already ascertained.</p>
