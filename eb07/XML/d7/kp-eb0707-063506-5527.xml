                    rend="smallcaps">Catherin,</hi> a celebrated historian, was born on the 30th
                    October, at Sacco, a village near Padua. He was the youngest son of Antonia
                    Davila, grand constable of Cyprus, who, on the taking of that island by the
                    Turks in 1570, had been obliged to retire into Spain, from which this family
                    supposed that they had derived their named and origin. From Spain Antonio
                    repaired to the court of France, and settled his son Louis and two daughters
                    under the patronage of Catharine de’ Medicis, whose name he afterwards gave to
                    the young historian. The little Davila was brought early into France; and at the
                    age of eighteen he signalized himself in the civil wars of that country, and had
                    a horse killed under him at the siege of Harfleur in 1594. His last exploit
                    there was at the siege of Amiens, where he fought under Henry IV. and received
                    in the knee a wound from a partizan. After peace had been established in France
                    in 1598 he withdrew <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755540"

                    father, and afterwards entered into the service of the Venetians. While at
                    Venice he wrote his admirable work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi

                    Tommaso Baglioni, 1630, 4to, which contains every thing worthy of notice that
                    passed from the death of Henry II. in 1539 till the peace of Vervins in 1598. He
                    continued to serve the republic of Venice with great reputation, till an
                    unfortunate adventure put an end to his life in 1631. Happening to pass through
                    Verona with his wife and family on his way to Crema, which he had been appointed
                    to defend, and demanding, according to the usual custom of persons in his
                    station, a supply of horses and carriages for his retinue, a brutal Veronese,
                    called <hi rend="italic">II Turco,</hi> entered the room where he and his family
                    were at supper, and being mildly reprimanded for his intrusion by Davila,
                    discharged a pistol at the historian, by which he was shot dead on the spot. The
                    accomplices of the assassin also killed the chaplain of Davila, and wounded most
                    of his attendants. But his eldest son Antonio, a youth of eighteen, revenged the
                    death of his father by killing the murderer on the instant. All the confederates
                    were secured next morning, and publicly executed at Verona.</p>
                <p>There is only one opinion concerning the merit of Davila as a writer. His style
                    is singularly exempt from the vices which prevailed at that time, and, though
                    less pure than that of Guicciardini, is more compact and concise, and at the
                    same time distinguished for its admirable facility. Nor is his manner of
                    disposing and narrating events, of linking them together, of introducing his
                    personages, and making them act and speak, and describe places, towns, fields of
                    battle, feats of arms, assemblies, councils, and the conduct of negotiations,
                    less commendable than the qualities of his style. He appears indeed to have
                    taken great pains to discover the truth, to have derived his information from
                    the best sources, and to have spoken in general with much freedom. But this
                    explicitness is sometimes affected by his individual position and connections,
                    and also by the prejudices of his age and country. An Italian of this period
                    could not possibly hold the balance even between the Catholics and Protestants.
                    A man who owed the fortune of his sister, of his brother, and also the
                    commencement of his own, to Catharine de’ Medicis, and whose very name reminds
                    us that he had been devoted to her service from the period of his birth, could
                    not be an impartial judge of the conduct of the queen-mother. He has accordingly
                    been censured, and not without reason, for the partiality which he evinces
                    towards that bold, bad woman. He dwells upon her address and her prudence, when
                    he should have exposed her profound dissimulation, her perfidy, and her cruelty
                    in meditating and preparing, during more than two years, in masking under
                    deceptive caresses, and, finally, in perpetrating, amidst festivities, the
                    massacre of forty thousand Frenchmen. In one place, however, he admits that the
                    effusion of human blood in no degree alarmed Catharine; and when, at the end of
                    the ninth book, he has finished the relation of her death, and the delineation
                    of her general character, the conscience of the historian at length resumes the
                    empire which it ought always to have exercised. He then adds that the
                    queen-mother was accused of infamous bad faith, the common fault, says he, of
                    all times, but particularly of this age; that she was also charged with an
                    avidity, or rather a contempt, for the effusion of human blood, greater than
                    became the tenderness of her sex, as if such avidity or contempt were naturally
                    characteristic of men; and that on many occasions she appeared to regard as
                    lawful any means which she judged useful for accomplishing her ends, however
                    iniquitous or perfidious these might in themselves be. Davila would no doubt
                    have escaped reproach in regard to Catharine de’ Medicis, if, in describing the
                    different acts of her regency, he had always depicted her as he has done in this
                    tardy and reluctant confession. But notwithstanding some grave faults, on which
                    this is not the place to expatiate, his history remains with all the eminent
                    qualities that distinguish it, whilst as to its defects they can no longer be
                    productive of error or misconception. The course of ages restores every thing to
                    its proper place, and, as always happens after a certain lapse of time, this or
                    that historian ceases to have the power of deceiving us in regard to facts;
                    whilst, on the other hand, facts which are well ascertained enable us to judge
                    of the degree of credit due to the historian himself.</p>
                <p>The edition which Davila published of his history was very incorrect. It is said
                    that he had offered the work to several publishers of Venice, but that they had
                    all refused it, with the exception of Baglioni, whose presses were idle, and who
                    undertook to print it, on the condition, however, that if any preferable
                    employment came in his way, the printing of the history should give way to it.
                    But when the edition was finished, it met with so rapid a sale that the whole
                    was disposed of in a week. It is added that it was reprinted under the same
                    date, and that 15,000 copies were sold in the course of a year; but this appears
                    to be greatly exaggerated. The editions which followed, Venice, 1634 and 1638,
                    Lyons, 1641, and Venice, 1642, were scarcely less faulty than the first; but a
                    better, and indeed a very beautiful one, issued from the royal press at Paris in
                    1644, folio. The work was translated into French by J. Baudoin, Paris, 1642, in
                    two vols. folio, a translation which has been several times reprinted; into
                    Spanish by Basil Varen de Soto, Madrid, 1651 and 1659; and into English, first
                    by William Aylesbury, London, 1647, folio, and next by Charles Cotterell,
                    London, 1666, folio. Lastly, it was translated into Latin by Pietro Francesco
                    Cornazzano, Rome, 1745, in 3 vols. 4to. The best edition of the original work,
                    however, is that printed at Venice in 1733, 2 vols. folio.</p>
