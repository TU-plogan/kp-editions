                    as the spirit intrusted with the inspection and government of mankind. For,
                    according to the philosophers, daemons held a middle rank between the celestial
                    gods and men upon earth, and carried on all intercourse between them; conveying
                    the addresses of men to the gods, and the divine benefits to men. It was the
                    opinion of many, that the celestial divinities did not themselves interpose in
                    human affairs, but committed the entire administration of the government of this
                    lower world to these subaltern deities: <hi rend="italic">Neque enim</hi><hi

                    they became the objects of divine worship. “If idols are nothing,” says
                    Celsus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apud Orig.
                    contr. Celsum, lib. viii. p. 393.</p></note> “what harm can there be to join in
                    the public festivals? If they are daemons, then it is certain that they are
                    gods, in whom we ought to confide, and to whom we should offer sacrifices
                    andprayers to render them propitious.”</p>
                <p>Several of the heathen philosophers held that there were different kinds of
                    daemons; that some of them were spiritual substances of a more noble origin than
                    the human race, and that others had once been men.</p>
                <p>But those daemons who were the more immediate objects of the established worship
                    among the ancient nations were human spirits, such as were believed to become
                    daemons or deities after their departure from their bodies. Plutarch
                    teaches,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vit. Romul. p.
                    36, ed. Paris.</p></note><supplied cert="medium" evidence="conjecture"

                    4</hi></supplied> “that according to a divine nature and justice, the souls of
                    virtuous men are advanced to the rank of daemons; and that from daemons, if they
                    are properly purified, they are exalted into gods, not by any political
                    institution, but according to right reason.” The same author says in another
                    place,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Is. et Osir.
                    p. 361.</p></note> “that Isis and Osiris were, for their virtue, changed from
                    good daemons into gods, as were Hercules and Bacchus afterwards, receiving the
                    united honours both of gods and daemons.” Hesiod and other poets, who have
                    recorded the ancient history or traditions on which the public faith and worship
                    were founded, assert, that the men of the golden age, who were supposed to be
                    very good, became daemons after death, and dispensers of good things to
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>Though <hi rend="italic">daemon</hi> is often used in a general sense as
                    equivalent to a deity, and is accordingly applied to fate or fortune, or
                    whatever else was regarded as a god, yet those daemons who were the more
                    immediate objects of divine worship amongst the heathens were human spirits, as
                    is shown by Farmer in his Essay on Miracles.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">daemon</hi> is used indifferently in a good and in a
                    bad sense. In the former sense, it was very commonly employed amongst the
                    ancient heathens. “We must not,” says Menander, “think any daemon to be evil or
                    hurtful to a good life, but every god to be good.” Nevertheless, those are
                    certainly mistaken who affirm that <hi rend="italic">daemon</hi> was not used to
                    signify an evil being until after the times of Christ. Pythagoras believed in
                    daemons who afflicted with diseases both men and cattle.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diog. Laert. in Vit. Pythagor. p. 514, ed.
                    AmsteL</p></note> Zaleucus, in his preface to his laws,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A pud Stobaeum, Serm. 42.</p></note> supposes
                    that an evil daemon might be present with a man, to influence him to injustice.
                    The daemons of Empedocles were evil spirits, and exiles from heaven; and
                    Plutarch, in his life of Dion, says that it was the opinion of the ancients that
                    evil and mischievous daemons, out of envy and hatred to good men, oppose
                    whatsoever they do. Scarcely did any opinion more generally prevail in ancient
                    times than this, that as the departed souls of good men became good daemons, so
                    the departed souls of bad men became evil daemons.</p>
                <p>It has been generally thought, that by <hi rend="italic">daemons</hi> we are to
                    understand <hi rend="italic">devils,</hi> in the Septuagint version of the Old
                    Testament; but others think that the word in that version is applied to the
                    ghosts of such dead men as the heathens deified. That <hi rend="italic"
                    >daemon</hi> often bears the same meaning in the New Testament, is shown at
                    large by Mr Joseph Mede, in his works; and that the word is applied <hi
                    rend="italic">always</hi> to human spirits in the New Testament, Mr Farmer has
                    attempted to show in his Essay on Daemoniacs. As to the meaning of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">daemon</hi> in the writings of the fathers of the Christian
                    church, it is used by them in the same sense as it was by the heathen
                    philosophers, especially the latter Platonists; that is, sometimes for departed
                    human spirits, and at other times for such spirits as had never inhabited human
                    bodies. In the fathers, indeed, the word is more commonly employed in an evil
                    sense, than in that of the ancient philosophers. Besides the two kinds of
                    daemons before mentioned, the fathers, as well as the ancient philosophers,
                    believed in a third, namely, such as sprang from the congress of superior beings
                    with the daughters of men. In the theology of the fathers, these were the worst
                    kind of daemons.</p>
                <p>Different orders of daemons had different stations and employments assigned them
                    by the ancients. Good daemons were'considered as the authors of good to mankind;
                    whereas evil daemons brought innumerable ills both upon men and beasts. Amongst
                    evil daemons there was a great distinction with respect to the offices assigned
                    them; as some compelled men to wickedness, and others stimulated them to
                    madness.</p>
