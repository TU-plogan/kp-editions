                <p><label type="entry">DENINA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles John Maria</hi></label>,
                    an eminent Italian writer, was born at Revel, in the principality of Piedmont,
                    in the year 1731. Having studied at Saluzzo, he was about to enter into the
                    order of the Grand Augustines at Ceva, at the age of fifteen, when one of his
                    uncles appointed him to a benefice. He accordingly assumed the ecclesiastical
                    habit, and remained two years at Saluzzo, where he learned a little divinity,
                    and acquired a knowledge of the French language through the medium of a Swiss
                    officer. In 1748 he obtained an exhibition, which enabled him to prosecute his
                    studies at the provincial college in the University of Turin. Some time
                    afterwards he took orders, and in 1753 he was appointed professor of humanity at
                    Pignerol. In consequence, however, of a quarrel with the Jesuits, he was obliged
                    to quit Pignerol and the royal schools, and was sent to the schools of an
                    inferior order. In 1756, on taking his degree of doctor in theology at the
                    Palatine schools of Milan, he printed his first work, which was a theological
                    tract. After this he was restored to the royal schools, and appointed
                    extraordinary professor of humanity and rhetoric at the Superior College of
                    Turin; and six months afterwards he had the offer of the situation of an
                    ordinary professor at Chambéry, which he refused. About this period he
                    projected, but did not execute, a work on the literary history of Piedmont. His
                    discourse <hi rend="italic">On the vicissitudes of Literature,</hi> which was
                    printed in 1760, attracted a considerable degree of attention, and drew upon him
                    the vengeance of Voltaire, who attacked him in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homme</hi><hi rend="italic">aux quarante</hi><hi rend="italic">ecus,</hi>
                    published in 1767. The publication of the first volume of his great work <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Revolutions of Italy</hi> obtained for him the
                    professorship of rhetoric in the Superior College of Turin; and twelve months
                    afterwards, on the publication of the second volume, he was preferred to the
                    chair of Italian eloquence, and of the Greek language, at the university. The
                    third volume, which was published in 1771, was still more favourably received
                    than the preceding; while at the same time it tended to augment the number and
                    to increase the virulence of his enemies. The misfortune, however, which he now
                    experienced, was partly occasioned by his own indiscretion. A manuscript,
                    containing some obnoxious opinions, which he had entrusted to Cambiagi at
                    Florence, having been published by authority of the Tuscan censors, but without
                    that of the censors of Turin, Denina was declared to be guilty of an infraction
                    of the Piedmontese laws, and punished with great severity. His book was
                    suppressed, and he was compelled to pay the costs. He was then banished to
                    Vercelli, and afterwards received orders to retire to his native province.
                    Denina’s friend, the Abbé Costa d’Arignan, undertook his defence, and procured
                    the restoration of part of his annual pensions, with permission to return to
                    Turin.</p>
                <p>In 1782 he repaired to Berlin, having before his departure received the honorary
                    title of librarian to the king of Sardinia. On his arrival at Berlin, Frederick
                    II. appointed him a member of the Royal Academy, but he never became a favourite
                    of that prince. He continued to reside in Germany for many years, where he
                    occupied himself with literary pursuits, and published <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    variety of works. Being at Mentz in 1804, he was noticed by Napoleon Bonaparte,
                    who, in the month of October of that year, appointed him his librarian. Denina
                    accordingly went to Paris, where he continued to reside until his death, on the
                    5th of December 1813.</p>
                <p>Denina is esteemed one of the most distinguished of the later Italian authors..
                    The work upon which his reputation is principally founded is his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Revolutions of Italy,</hi> of which an improved
                    edition was published at Turin in 1782, in five volumes 4to. In this work the
                    facts are related with accuracy, and the narrative exhibits considerable talents
                    for history. Some able critics in the Italian language have remarked that there
                    is a great difference between the style of this work and that of the other
                    writings of the same author; and Denina acknowledged that he had submitted his
                    history to the review of his friend the Abbé Costa d’Arignan, afterwards
                    Cardinal and Archbishop of Turin, who made a good many judicious
                    corrections.</p>
