                <p><label type="entry">DARFUR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Darfoor</hi></label>, a
                    considerable kingdom of Central Africa, occupying a large portion of the
                    interval between Abyssinia and Bornou. <hi rend="italic">Pur</hi> would appear
                    to be the proper name, <hi rend="italic">Dar</hi> signifying, in the language of
                    the people, <hi rend="italic">country</hi> in general; but the term Darfur is
                    adopted in compliance with established usage. The boundaries of this kingdom are
                    not well defined. According to the best authorities, it has on the east Kordofan
                    and the country of the Shilluks, which separate it from Sennaar and Abyssinia;
                    on the west Bergoo, which divides it from Begherme and Bornou; whilst the
                    regions to the south are occupied by barbarous nations, extending to and
                    inhabiting the Mountains of the Moon, and the early course of the
                    Bahr-el-Abiad.</p>
                <p>Darfur is destitute of any great river or lake; and accordingly during the dry
                    season the aspect of the country is parched and sterile. The rainy season
                    commences in June, and continues till September. By means of the rain the fields
                    are clothed with luxuriant verdure, and the empty ravines filled with water.
                    This, of course, is the season for sowing, at the commencement of which, the
                    king, with his attendants, goes out into the fields, and with his own hand makes
                    several holes in the ground for the reception of the seed. The vegetable
                    productions of Darfur are found chiefly to the south, where water is most
                    abundant. The ground is extensively covered with*trees, amongst which the
                    tamarind, plane, and sycamore, are found, but not in great abundance. The <hi
                    rend="italic">heglig</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">nebbeh</hi> are two species
                    peculiar to Darfur; their wood is hard, and they are very thorny. There are also
                    two small trees or shrubs called the <hi rend="italic">enneb</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">shair.</hi> The other plants copiously produced are the <hi
                    rend="italic">mimosa nilotica,</hi> the gum of which is carried into Egypt; the
                    water melon, the gourd, hemp, Cayenne pepper, and tobacco; the latter appears to
                    be of native growth. The date tree is here small, and of inferior quality. The
                    wild animals of Darfur are principally the lion, the leopard, the hyena, the
                    wolf, the jackall, <hi rend="italic">canis</hi><hi rend="italic">aureus,</hi>
                    and the wild buffalo; these, however, are chiefly confined to the uncultivated
                    parts of the country, except the jackall and hyena, herds of which enter the
                    villages at night and tear to pieces whatever they meet. To these may be added
                    the elephant, the rhinoceros, the camelopardalis, the hippopotamus, and the
                    crocodile. Camels of all forms and sizes are here exceedingly abundant. They are
                    remarkable for their power of enduring thirst, but not for carrying burdens.
                    Darfur has no good horses except those obtained from Dongola, and no good asses
                    except those from Egypt. The sheep are inferior to the Egyptian, and their wool
                    is very coarse. Goats, however, and horned cattle are numerous, and their flesh
                    is good. Very fine copper is brought from the regions of the south; and gold is
                    plentiful both to the east and west, but it is conveyed to Northern Africa by
                    other channels. The rocks of Darfur consist chiefly of grey granite. Various
                    kinds of marble, alabaster, fossil salt, and sulphur, are also found. Thermal
                    springs are said to be found in a mountain called Gebel Maria.</p>
                <p>The national industry is chiefly occupied in agricultural pursuits. Wheat is
                    raised only in small quantities; the principal grains are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dokn,</hi> which seems to be a species of millet, and another of larger size
                    called kassob. The harvest is conducted by the women and slaves, who break off
                    the ears with their hands and carry them away i:ı baskets; whilst the straw is
                    left standing to be employed in building, and for other useful purposes. The
                    grain, after being thrashed, is buried in the earth, by which means it is
                    tolerably well preserved. The houses are constructed in a very simple manner.
                    The walls are built of clay, sometimes embellished with a coating of plaster;
                    and the roofs are flat, and formed of light beams of wood, with a covering of
                    clay. The principal apartment is a cube of about twenty feet by twelve, secured
                    by a door cut with the axe (for the saw and the plane are unknown), and fastened
                    by a padlock. Being thus secured to a certain extent, it forms the repository of
                    all property belonging to the family. Another apartment, called <hi
                    rend="italic">hournac,</hi> somewhat larger than the above, but of a slighter
                    construction, and destitute of a door, serves for sitting and sleeping in; and a
                    third, somewhat similar to the latter, is appropriated to the women.</p>
                <p>A very precise estimate of the population can scarcely be formed; it is supposed
                    by the most recent travellers not to exceed 200,000. Cobbe, the capital, has not
                    more than 6000 inhabitants. There are only eight other considerable places, the
                    other collective residences being only small villages. The inhabitants are a
                    very mixed race. The capital is wholly, and all the other towns in a great
                    measure, peopled by foreigners. These consist chiefly of merchants, who come
                    partly from Egypt, partly from the eastern countries of Dongola, Sennaar, and
                    Kordofan. Many of the various tribes of Arabs which wander in the surrounding
                    deserts have also settled in the interior of Darfur.</p>
                <p>The government, like that of other Mahommedan countries, is despotic. Beyond the
                    Koran, which is inviolable, the will of the king is unlimited. The Fukhara or
                    ecclesiastics alone are entitled to remonstrate; but if these are rejected, they
                    have no means of enforcing them. A very formidable power resides in the army,
                    which consists of about two thousand men: no sovereign can with impunity act in
                    opposition to that body. On the death of the monarch, the crown constitutionally
                    descends to the eldest son; but if he happens to be a minor, or otherwise unable
                    to enforce his claim, the place is liable to be seized by any stronger or more
                    popular member of the royal family. The revenue of the sovereign is derived from
                    various sources; from a duty on all merchandise imported, amounting in most
                    instances to about a tenth; fines for misdemeanours, which go all to the royal
                    purse, and to which is added, in case of murder, a certain proportion of the
                    property of the village in which it was perpetrated; presents received
                    continually from the great men, merchants, and all descriptions of persons; the
                    tribute of the bordering Arab tribes, which is paid in cattle at various rates,
                    regularly or irregularly, as they consider themselves more <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755397" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5397-0625"/>or less under his power. It
                    is sometimes necessary to exact this tribute by force of arms. Lastly, the king
                    is an extensive merchant, exporting and importing every year a large quantity of
                    goods, for which he has means of procuring a market, which do not fall to the
                    lot of private individuals.</p>
                <p>The troops of Darfur, although capable of enduring thirst, hunger, and fatigue to
                    an almost preternatural extent, are not distinguished either for valour or
                    discipline. The Arabs, who possess in the highest perfection this power of
                    endurance, compose a considerable proportion of the army, though they serve in
                    this capacity rather as tributaries than as subjects. The religion of Mahommed
                    is universally professed; but the people are neither so recluse nor so austere
                    in their manners as they are in Egypt and the East. In their dispositions they
                    are cheerful; and the females are not immured, nor, unless among the great, are
                    their faces even concealed by a veil. Notwithstanding the law of the prophet, a
                    fermented liquor is used by persons of both sexes, and sometimes to a great
                    extent. In the intercourse of the sexes, their manners are extremely loose.
                    Polygamy has no bounds. The sultan in particular has always an amply-furnished
                    seraglio. The closest ties of kindred arc often considered as no bar to the
                    matrimonial alliance. Rigorous fidelity is neither exacted nor observed. Indeed,
                    where any advantage is to be gained, the husband frequently winks at the
                    intrigues of the wife. The vices of thieving, lying, and cheating, prevail
                    almost universally.</p>
                <p>In their persons the Darfurians differ from the negroes on the coast of Guinea,
                    though their complexion is black, and their hair generally short and woolly.
                    They are not remarkable for their personal cleanliness; and ablution is not
                    performed with the usual care of Mahommedans. The Arabs, who are numerous,
                    retain their distinction of feature, colour, and language. The person of highest
                    rank is the faqui, which signifies at once learned man and priest. Some of these
                    are educated at Cairo, but the greater number in native schools. They are
                    ignorant of every thing but the Koran.</p>
                <p>The only commerce of Darfur is inland; but this is extensive, and merchants are
                    the most opulent and important persons in the country. The chief intercourse is
                    with Egypt, and it is carried on entirely by the African system of caravans.
                    These are very uncertain in thajr journeys, two or three years sometimes
                    elapsing without one taking place. They are exposed to great dangers from the
                    attacks of some wild Arab tribes, and to great inconveniences from being badly
                    furnished with the necessaries of life. Among the articles sent into Egypt, the
                    most important are slaves taken in the negro countries towards the south,
                    camels, ivory, the horns, teeth, and hides of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus,
                    ostrich feathers, gum, pimento, parroquets in abundance, and a small quantity of
                    white copper. The imports are extremely various, comprising beads of all sorts,
                    toys, glass, arms, light cloths of different kinds, chiefly made in Egypt, with
                    some of French manufacture, red Barbary caps, small carpets, wrought and
                    unwrought silks, shoes, and a considerable quantity of writing paper. Commerce
                    is carried on entirely by barter, which greatly increases the difficulty of
                    conducting it. The intercourse with Mecca is considerable; in this the objects
                    of trade and religion are combined.</p>
