                    the most learned men whom Scotland has produced, was born at Cliftbog in
                    Aberdeenshire, on the 23d of August 1579, being the twenty-fourth out of
                    twenty-nine children by the same mother. His father, who bore the same name with
                    himself, he describes as proprietor of Muresk, Auchterless, and Killesmont, and
                    <hi rend="italic">prorex,</hi> or lieutenant, of the county of Banff and the
                    district of Buchan. His mother was Jane, the sister of Lesley of Balquhain; and
                    one grandmother was daughter to the last earl of Buehan, of the family of
                    Stewart, and the other<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Laurus Leslaeana explicata, § Gl. Graecii, 1692, fol.</p></note> was sister
                    to Lord Forbes. He was born during the lifetime of his grandfather; at whose
                    decease, the family, more distinguished by its gentility than its opulence, was
                    left in very unprosperous circumstances.</p>
                <p>According to his own account, his first step in learning was as wonderful as any
                    part of his subsequent progress; for, at the age of three years, he completely
                    mastered the alphabet in the space of a single hour. He was afterwards committed
                    to the care of Andrew Ogston, a schoolmaster at Turreff, and was next removed to
                    Aberdeen, where he was initiated in classical learning by Thomas Cargill, an
                    excellent grammarian. In the mean time, the family was involved in ruin, chiefly
                    by the misconduct of James, his eldest brother; of whom he has given an account
                    which it would have been much wiser to suppress. This brother took the
                    extraordinary step of marrying his father’s concubine, Isabella Gordon of
                    Aehavach; and having consequently been disinherited, he attempted to revenge
                    himself by collecting a band of Gordons, and making a violent assault upon his
                    father when he was one morning proceeding on horseback, with the view of
                    transacting some public business. Several attendants of the latter were slain in
                    this encounter, and, amongst others, his brother-in-law Gilbert Lesley; he was
                    himself dangerously wounded. Two of the Gordons were likewise left dead on the
                    field, and several were wounded on both sides.<note anchored="true"

                    >Romance</hi> to King James, he alludes to the same atrocious attempt. Here his
                    father is described as “Banfiae et Buchaniae praefectus atque
                    irenarcha.”</p></note> In order to cut off all hope of succession from such an
                    heir, he sold to the earl of Errol his estate of Muresk, situated in the county
                    of Aberdeen; but the bargain was never fulfilled by the other party, and he was
                    unable to recover either his lands or their price. Thus, we are told, he only
                    left to his son Thomas an empty title. But Thomas, who represents himself as the
                    twenty-fourth child, does not venture to assert that, if the estate had still
                    remained in the family, he was next in the order of succession; and when in
                    various works he styled himself baron of Muresk, he must have been aware, even
                    taking baron in the sense of <hi rend="italic">laird,</hi> that his title was as
                    empty as could well be imagined. After this act of atrocious violence, his
                    brother James fled to the northern islands, and having there collected a band of
                    ruffians, he lived in open defiance of the laws, till he at length set fire to
                    the bishop of Orkney’s palace, and then returned to the country which he had
                    been compelled to abandon. His wife, who had become the mother of seven
                    children, was now discarded; and having made choice of another companion, he
                    sought an asylum in the Netherlands, where <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756515"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6515-0711"/>he served as a captain of horse. But the divine
                    vengeance at last overtook him; for having been guilty of some gross act of
                    violence towards his colonel, he was executed at Utrecht in the most appalling
                    manner; he was torn limb from limb by four horses, and thus, according to his
                    brother’s account, ended a career of more than common crime and infamy.</p>
                <p>In the progress of these events, Thomas, by the advice of his uncle John
                    Dempster, whom he describes as an eminent lawyer of Edinburgh, was induced to
                    seek in another country that fortune from which he seemed to be precluded in his
                    own. In the tenth year of his age, he repaired to Cambridge, where he for some
                    time studied in Pembroke Hall. He afterwards directed his course to France; and
                    having on his journey been robbed of his money and stript of his clothes, he
                    with difficulty made his way to Paris. Here he was kindly treated by some of his
                    countrymen, and was beginning to think of resuming his studies, when he was
                    seized with a contagious disease, which deprived the schools of their auditors,
                    and the city of its inhabitants. When he at length recovered from this dangerous
                    malady, he hastened to the university of Louvain, which was then adorned by the
                    erudition of Lipsius; but not long after his arrival he found that William
                    Crichton, a Jesuit, principal of the Scotish College, had received instructions
                    to send some of his young countrymen to Rome; and those whom he selected,
                    besides Dempster himself, were Patrick Anderson, who was already a Jesuit,
                    Robert Hill, who died professor of philosophy at Montpellier, and Thomas Lyon,
                    who was blind from his infancy. He reached the papal city after a dangerous
                    journey, for the plague was raging in Germany, and Italy was the scene of
                    military operations. By the kindness of Cardinal Cajetano, protector of the
                    Scotish nation, he was admitted as a student in the Roman seminary, and, under
                    the tuition of Stephoni, began the study of poetry, that is, the art of Latin
                    versification: but having again been attacked by a dangerous disease, the
                    physicians recommended a change of climate; and, in company with Andrew
                    Crichton, proceeding by way of Switzerland, he directed his wandering steps
                    towards the Netherlands. At Tournay he experienced the kindness of his
                    countryman James Cheyne, who sent him to the university of Douay, where he was
                    maintained by a pension from the king of Spain and the archduke Albert. He now
                    prosecuted the study of poetry with new vigour, but did not neglect the other
                    branches of learning. In poetry he obtained the first, and in philosophy the
                    second prize. Having taken the degree of A. Μ. he for a short time taught
                    humanity at Tournay; but as his prospects were not there very encouraging, he
                    again presented himself at Paris, and having taken the degree of doctor of the
                    canon law, he succeeded David Sinclair as a regent in the College of Navarre. At
                    that period, according to his own statement, he had not attained the age of
                    seventeen; and he must therefore have obtained his preferment in the year 1596.
                    In what university he afterwards took the degree of doctor of the civil law, he
                    has omitted to mention; but in several of his works he describes himself as <hi
                    rend="italic">Juris utriusque Doctor,</hi> or doctor of both laws, civil and
                    canon.</p>
                <p>From the beginning to the end of his career he was a restless wanderer, and he
                    soon quitted Paris with the intention of settling at Toulouse. On his route, he
                    halted for some time at St Maixant in Poitou. At Toulouse he began to teach
                    humanity; but his zeal in contending for the interests of the university excited
                    the resentment of certain individuals of rank or influence, and he again thought
                    it expedient to change his place of residence. His views were next directed to a
                    professorship of philosophy at Montpellier, whither he appears to have been
                    invited by his countrymen Adam Abernethy and Andrew Currie, the former of whom
                    is still remembered as an author; but, in the mean time, he made his appearance
                    at Nismes, where the professorship of eloquence was to be awarded to the most
                    deserving competitor, and where only one of twenty-four judges decided against
                    him. As this was a seminary appropriated to the Huguenots, Bayle conjectures
                    that he must have suspended his zeal for the Romish faith.<note anchored="true"

                    tom ii. p. 986.</p></note> One of the unsuccessful candidates, Jacob Grasser of
                    Basel, sought to avenge himself by making a violent assault upon Dempster, by
                    publishing a libel against him, and by applying for a legal interdict to
                    prohibit him from discharging the duties of his office; but the professor, who
                    possessed courage as well as strength, repelled the joint attack of Grasser and
                    some of his associates, and found means to have him committed to prison, first
                    at Nismes, and afterwards, when he had made his escape, at Montpellier, and
                    again at Paris. After a tedious litigation of two years, the cause was at length
                    decided in his favour by the parliament of Toulouse, and the libel published
                    against him was ordered to be burnt at Nismes by the hands of the
                    executioner.</p>
                <p>Nor did he long retain his professorship of eloquence. After making a journey
                    into Spain, he accepted the appointment of preceptor to Artus d’Espinay,
                    subsequently bishop of Marseille, a son of the famous Sainte Luc, grandmaster of
                    the artillery of France, who was killed at the siege of Amiens in the year 1597.
                    But a quarrel in which he involved himself at Brissac with one of his pupil’s
                    relations, hastened the termination of this engagement, and he now adopted the
                    resolution of returning to his native country. With the view of recovering some
                    portion of the family property, he brought an action in the court of session,
                    and, according to his own impression, would ultimately have succeeded, if he had
                    not found it expedient to withdraw before the decision was pronounced. His
                    relations were either reduced to poverty, or were unwilling to assist him, on
                    account of his adherence to the popish faith; and for the same reason he was
                    exposed to persecution from the Scotish clergy, chiefly, as he conceives, at the
                    instigation of William Cowper, afterwards bishop of Galloway. With this divine
                    he was for three days engaged in a theological disputation at Perth, and he
                    appears to have been extremely well satisfied with the manner in which he
                    acquitted himself. To the resentment of Cowper in being foiled, not by a
                    theologian, but by a lawyer, he imputes the injurious representations which were
                    made to the king.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Dempsteri Historia Ecclesiastica, p. 195. 677∙</p></note> He again bad adieu
                    to Scotland, and, returning to Paris, was for seven years employed, with honour
                    as well as emolument, as a regent in four different colleges, those of Lisieux,
                    Grassins, Du Plessis, and Beauvais.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A. du Saussay, bishop of Tulle, in his continuation of
                    Bellarmia, has mentioned Dempster in the following terms: “Docuit magno
                    discipulorum concursu, nec minori omnium doctorum aestimatione et plausu: inter
                    ejus auditores in mea juventute constiti. Caeterum tantus vir pugnaci animo et
                    contentioso ac instabili fuit, quo genio ductus plerumque domicilia mutavit.”
                    (De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis, p. 82. edit. Colon. 1684, 4to.)</p></note></p>
                <p>Of the decision and ferocity of his character he exhibited a notable instance in
                    the last of these colleges. Gran-gier, the principal, having occasion to absent
                    himself from Paris, appointed Dempster to act as his substitute, being no doubt
                    persuaded that he had sufficient energy to maintain the most rigid discipline. A
                    student challenged one <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756528"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6528-0712"/>of his companions to fight a duel: the
                    vice-principal was moved with indignation at such a proceeding; and having
                    seized the offender and untrussed his points, he placed him on the back of a
                    sturdy knave, and, in the presence of the whole college, gave him a sound
                    flogging. The young gentleman, burning with resentment, brought one day to the
                    college three of his kinsmen who served in the guards; but Dempster, undismayed
                    at this military invasion, put arms into the hands of the servants, and having
                    ordered them to kill the horses which were left at the gate, made so formidable
                    an attack on the soldiers, that they were speedily reduced to the necessity of
                    begging for mercy. Their lives were spared by the victor, who however detained
                    them for a short time as prisoners in the college belfry. When they had thus
                    ascertained that he was a match for them at their own weapons, they endeavoured
                    to find a more competent remedy; and as he was not persuaded that a legal
                    enquiry into his proceedings would tend to his advantage, he quitted his station
                    in the College of Beauvais, and sailed for England.<note anchored="true"

                    contains this statement displays such a fierce spirit of detraction, as must
                    deprive it of all historical credit. He had been invited to England by King
                    James, who bestowed upon him the title of historiographer royal, and made him a
                    present of two hundred pounds, which at that period was no inconsiderable sum.
                    This gift he received in the thirteenth year of the king’s reign, namely, in
                    1615 or 1616.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nichols’s

                    married Susannah Waller, a woman of great beauty and elegance, who afterwards
                    proved a very precarious acquisition. His hopes of obtaining preferment were
                    defeated by the remonstrances of the clergy, particularly Dr Montague, bishop of
                    Bath and Wells: they endeavoured to impress the king with a sense of the
                    impropriety of thus taking under his protection, and into his favour, a known
                    and zealous catholic. He therefore took his leave of the learned monarch, and
                    again directed his course towards Italy. When he arrived at Rome, he was
                    suspected of being a spy, and for a single night was detained in custody; but
                    his character and pretensions were easily ascertained, and from the pope and
                    several cardinals he obtained letters of recommendation to the grand duke of
                    Tuscany, Cosmo II. Being likewise befriended by Guicciardini, the duke’s
                    ambassador at the court of Rome, he proceeded to Florence, and in the year 1616
                    was appointed professor of the Pandects in the university of Pisa.<note

                    previously distinguished himself by the publication of various works in prose
                    and verse, and had earned the reputation of extensive erudition. At an early
                    period of his life he had betaken himself to the study of the law; and by his
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates</hi><hi rend="italic">Romance</hi>
                    of Rosinus, printed in the year 1613, he had evinced his proficiency as a
                    civilian. The study of the Roman law is so closely blended with the study of
                    Roman history and antiquities, that the one cannot be safely disjoined from the
                    other.</p>
                <p>Soon after he had been admitted to this office, he was furnished with letters and
                    money by the grand duke, and returned to England for the purpose of conveying
                    his wife to Italy. They proceeded by way of Paris; and when they were one day
                    walking in the street, his lady attracted a crowd of gazers, not merely by the
                    beauty of her person, but chiefly by exhibiting a more ample portion of her
                    bosom and shoulders than suited the established usages of the country. So great
                    was the concourse of people, that they were obliged to fly for shelter to an
                    adjoining house.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Erythraci Pinacotheca, tom. i. p. 25.</p></note> In due time he returned to
                    Pisa, and read his inaugural lecture on the second of November. His salary was
                    augmented to four hundred ducats, and he now appeared to have a fair prospect of
                    honour and emolument. He recommended himself to the duke by undertaking his
                    great work <hi rend="italic">De Etruria</hi><hi rend="italic">Regali,</hi> which
                    he must have completed with wonderful energy and dispatch. In the year 1617, he
                    paid another visit to Britain, with the view of arranging some private affairs.
                    But his restless and turbulent disposition did not long permit him to enjoy
                    tranquillity. He involved himself in an angry and pertinacious dispute with an
                    Englishman, whose name he has not thought proper to mention, nor is the origin
                    or progress of this dispute rendered in any degree intelligible by his abrupt
                    narrative. It however appears that his antagonist, who was probably an
                    ecclesiastic, succeeded in producing a favourable impression on the grand duke,
                    who only left Dempster the alternative of making an apology or quitting the
                    Tuscan dominions. The learned civilian was of too stubborn a nature to be
                    readily convinced that he was in the wrong, and too proud to stoop to what he
                    considered as an unworthy compliance: he accordingly accepted the latter part of
                    this alternative, and took his departure from Pisa on the 21st of July 1619.</p>
                <p>Disgusted with Italy, he now reverted to the plan of settling in his native
                    country; but on arriving at Bologna, he paid his respects to Cardinal Capponi,
                    legate of that papal city, who prevailed upon him to abandon his intention, and
                    within the short space of twelve days procured him the appointment of professor
                    of humanity. This was an honourable and a lucrative office, which had been held
                    by men of high reputation, by P. Manutius, Sigonius, and Robortellus. A new
                    office naturally involved such a person in new contentions: the professor of
                    humanity was entitled to take precedence of other professors; and as this place
                    of honour was fiercely contested, he maintained his own rights with his usual
                    pertinacity, and with more than his usual success.</p>
                <p>More serious evils awaited him. The Englishman who had interrupted his
                    tranquillity at Pisa, still infested him at Bologna: he accused the professor of
                    being a catholic of dubious faith, and of being guilty of the crime of having
                    heretical books in his library. Dempster addressed to his adversary a letter,
                    which appears to have been so intemperate as to incur the censure of some of the
                    cardinals; but he proceeded to Rome in person, and after obtaining more than one
                    audience of the pope, was enabled to remove any aspersions which had been aimed
                    at his character. A formal reconciliation was at length effected between these
                    pertinacious antagonists, but the spirit of reconciliation was probably wanting
                    in both parties. The professor mentions that he had prepared a full statement of
                    his case, and that if his adversary recurred to his former practices, it should
                    be transmitted to posterity. In the mean time, he discharged his duty in the
                    university <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756541" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6541-0713"
                    />with diligence and ability. His reputation attracted pupils of a higher rank,
                    and his salary was augmented to eight hundred crowns. His love of wandering
                    seems at length to have abated; for he declined an offer of a thousand crowns a
                    year as professor of the civil law in the university of Padua. Pope Urban VIII.
                    who was himself a Latin poet, treated him with more than usual distinction, by
                    conferring upon him the honour of knighthood, and accompanying this honour with
                    an annual pension of one hundred pieces of money, but of what denomination, is
                    not sufficiently apparent. Dempster likewise became a member of the Accademia
                    della Notte, in which, according to the Italian fashion, he assumed the name of
                    Evantius, and in the proceedings of which he is said to have taken a great
                    interest. He now appeared to have reached a place of rest, when he was overtaken
                    by the severest of all his calamities. After his arrival in Italy, his wife had
                    born a daughter, who did not survive many days, and this was fortunately the
                    only offspring of such a mother. On returning from one of his lectures, he
                    discovered that she had made an elopement, in which one or more of his own
                    pupils were either concerned as principals or accessories. He immediately
                    commenced a pursuit of the fugitives, who seem to have added robbery to their
                    other crime; but when he had proceeded as far as Vicenza, a city of Lombardy, he
                    found that they must already have passed the Alps. This painful journey had been
                    performed during the heat of the dog-days. Oppressed with fatigue of body and
                    anguish of mind, he sought repose and tranquillity at Bu-tri, in the
                    neighbourhood of Bologna; but having been suddenly attacked with a fever, he was
                    removed to his own residence, and there died on the 6th of September 1625, soon
                    after he had completed the forty-sixth year of his age. His remains were
                    interred in the church of St Dominic, where his brethren of the Accademia della
                    Notte erected a monumental stone to his memory, and added a Latin inscription
                    written in a very quaint style. One of their number, Ovidio Montalbani,
                    pronounced his funeral oration, which was published in the course of the
                    following year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Such was the turbulent life, and such the premature death, of Thomas Dempster, a
                    man distinguished by some eminent endowments of body as well as mind. In his
                    person, he was above the ordinary size, and was possessed of proportional
                    strength. He had an ample head, with black hair, and a dark complexion, so that
                    in Italy he might easily have been mistaken for an Italian. He was a man of a
                    noble aspect, and was possessed of undaunted courage. The irritability of his
                    temperament involved him in many quarrels, nor was his sword less formidable
                    than his pen. He never acquired the habit of restraining the natural impetuosity
                    of his mind, and was equally decided and undisguised in his friendships and in
                    his resentments. To his friends he was very pleasant, and equally odious to his
                    enemies. Little inclined to forgive injuries, he pursued his enemies with the
                    most violent animosity, and expressed his tumultuous feelings without any
                    scrupulous regard to decency.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    acceptaeque injuriae tenax, eam aperte agnoscens ac repetens.” These are the
                    expressions of Matthaeus Peregrinus, who has completed the account of Dempster
                    which occurs at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastica.</hi></p></note> In several of his works, we find sufficient
                    evidence of his being somewhat loose in his assertions; J and indeed men of a

                    distinguishing falsehood from truth: they are much inclined to embrace as true
                    whatever is best suited to the state of their mind during its morbid
                    excitement.</p>
                <p>Dempster’s intellectual endowments were likewise of a mixed character. He was
                    endowed with such extraordinary powers of memory, and read with such
                    indefatigable diligence, that he was regarded as a speaking library. It was
                    customary with him to devote fourteen hours a day to study. He was allowed to
                    possess an equal knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages; and his knowledge
                    of both was so familiar, that in either language he undertook to dictate verses
                    as. rapidly as the pen of a ready writer could commit them to paper. He was a
                    poet and philologer, as well as a civilian and historian. He evinces no mean
                    portion of poetical fancy, and his verse is more elegant than his prose. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Musea</hi> is one of the few Latin poems, written by natives of
                    Scotland, which the learned Wasse has recommended for republication.<note

                    diversified erudition, but in many instances his learning appears superior to
                    his judgment. The life which he led was subject to many vicissitudes, and his
                    writings partake of the same desultory character. His style is unequal, and
                    frequently unpolished, nor is he sufficiently scrupulous in selecting words of
                    the purer ages of Latinity.</p>
                <p>His principal work, <hi rend="italic">De Etruria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Regali,</hi> was completed in the space of about three years; and when we
                    consider its great extent, and its ample stores of recondite knowledge, we
                    cannot but regard it as a wonderful performance. Errors and defects may
                    naturally be expected to occur in a work relating to such a subject, and
                    executed with so much rapidity; but sufficient room is still left for our
                    admiration of the author’s vivacity of mind, and resources of learning. His
                    edition of Rosinus likewise displays the copiousness of his reading, and it has
                    supplied materials to all those who have subsequently laboured in the department
                    of Roman antiquities. His juridical works entitle him to a respectable place
                    among civilians. Ludewig, who is himself an able writer, has expressed a wish
                    that his notes on the Institutes of Justinian should be reprinted.<note

                    his character is chiefly to be ascertained from his editions of Claudian and
                    Corippus, two poets who belong to the declining ages of Roman literature, and
                    one of them indeed belongs to the latter part of the sixth century.<note

                    have selected purer models of language and taste; but on various occasions he
                    chose to travel in a by-path of his own, and his annotations on Corippus, as
                    well as on Claudian, have contributed to his reputation as a man of
                    miscellaneous erudition. Among his own works he enumerates notes on Statius and
                    a commentary on Aelian, but there seems no reason to believe that they were ever
                    printed.</p>

                    fierce contentions “de lana caprina,” that they can now excite little interest
                    or curiosity. His <hi rend="italic">Nomenclatura</hi> is a mere catalogue of
                    names, which were to be illustrated in a subsequent work. In his native country,
                    he is most generally known as the author of a book on which he has bestowed the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum,</hi> a title
                    which is by no means descriptive of its contents. It contains a long enumeration
                    of Scotish saints, writers, and other worthies, who lived, or are supposed to
                    have lived, at periods very remote from each other. Of many of his saints and
                    writers, the very existence is considered as more than doubtful, and many of the
                    rest belong, not to Scotland, but to other countries. It is not always easy to
                    distinguish the early Scotish from the early Irish writers. The name of Scotia
                    or Scotland has not been traced in any author who flourished before the third
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Usserit

                    Britain, they still retained the appellation of Scots; although it was not
                    before the eleventh century that the name of Scotland was transferred from the

                    designation. Some degree of confusion may therefore be supposed to be connected
                    with this identity of names, nor has it always been avoided by writers more
                    accurate than Dempster. His notices of persons who lived in earlier times are
                    necessarily very scanty, and are often very erroneous. Nor are his catalogues of
                    books less remarkable than his list of writers: he ascribes various works to
                    various individuals who flourished long before the art of writing was introduced
                    into Scotland; and nothing can be more ludicrous than his formal enumeration of
                    the productions of such imaginary authors. The principal value of his book
                    consists in its notices of those writers who belonged to his own time, and

                    terrarum propagarunt. Viderat ipse Dempsterus multos, quorum meminit,
                    sacerdotes, professores, milites, et interdum mores hominum notat.” (Praef in
                    Hist. Ecclesiast. editionem alteram, p. xii.)</p></note> Relative to these, he
                    presents us with many curious gleanings of information, which is nowhere else to
                    be found; and on many occasions his information is more authentic than his
                    readers may be inclined to suppose. According to Bishop Lloyd, he “was as well
                    inclined to believe a lye as any man in his time ;”<note anchored="true"

                    and to Dr Towers he “seems to have thought it highly meritorious to advance the
                    grossest falsehoods, if those falsehoods would, in any degree, contribute to the
                    honour of his country.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    errors is naturally suspected of many more. Thus, when Dempster speaks of Kidd,
                    or Ca-danus, as being an eminent professor of law in the university of Toulouse,
                    and the author of several works in prose and verse, he has perhaps by some
                    readers been suspected of introducing an imaginary character; and yet: the same
                    individual, utterly forgotten in his native country, is mentioned by Baluze as a
                    professor of great ability and reputation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Deinde per tres continuos annos in academia Tolosana, quae

                    Marea, Archiepiscopi Parisiensis, p. 1Ò. Paris. 1663, 8vo.) Dempster calls him
                    James, instead of William.</p></note> On the continent there were many Latin
                    poems and tracts published by natives of Scotland, during the age of Dempster
                    and a short period immediately preceding; and such of them as were written by
                    individuals who did not acquire any considerable celebrity, have in various
                    instances left but few traces behind them.</p>
                <p>The works of Dempster are very numerous and very miscellaneous. We subjoin a
                    list, which is as complete as we have been able to render it; but he has himself
                    enumerated various others, which do not appear to have been published. All the
                    articles from No. 29 to No. 47 inclusive, are copied from his own list; and it
                    is to be regretted that he has not described them in a more satisfactory
                    manner.</p>

                    work there are many subsequent editions. One of these was published by Pitiscus,

                    without a date, but the dedication is dated at Rome on the fourth of October
                    1620. This work is chiefly directed against a publication bearing the title of
                    “Bri-gida Thaumaturga; sive Dissertatio partim encomiastica in laudem ipsius
                    Santae,” &amp;c. Paris. 1620, 8vo. The anonymous author has subjoined a tract
                    entitled “De Scriptorum Scotorum Nomenclatura a Thoma Dempstero edita
                    Praecidaneum.” This Irishman and his country Dempster treated with the utmost
                    scorn and contempt; and in the following work he was answered in a similar
                    strain: “Hiberniae, sive Antiquioris Scotiae, Vindiciae adversus immodestam
                    Parecbasim Thomae Dempsteri, moderni Scoti, nuper editam: in quibus currente
                    calamo innumerae ipsius Dempsteri imposturae et mendacia deteguntur, atque ipse
                    levi penicillo depingitur, ut intelligat qui quae vult dicit, quae non vult

                    in 1623 both Dempster’s work and this answer were prohibited by the church. In
                    1621 his edition of Rosinus was prohibited till it should be corrected.<note

                    1627, 4to.—This posthumous work is printed in the most negligent manner,
                    insomuch that very many passages are scarcely intelligible. It has recently been
                    reprinted for the use of the Bannatyne Club: “Thomae Dempsteri Historia
                    Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum: sive, de Scriptoribus Scotis. Editio altera.”
                    Edinb. 1829, 2 tom. 4to. This edition was superintended by Dr Irving, who, in a
                    preface of considerable length, has given an account of the author and his
                    singular performance. He has endeavoured to amend a great variety of passages,
                    by referring to writers whom Dempster quotes, by altering the vicious
                    punctuation, by attending to the ordinary rules of grammar, and sometimes, where
                    the sense seemed perfectly clear, by substituting one letter for another. Of the
                    more material changes, he has given a detailed statement in the preface.</p>

                    Britanniae Armigero. Florentiae, 1723-4, 2 tom. fol.—The title-page of the first
                    volume bears an inscription “Regiae celsitudini Cosmi III. Magni Ducis
                    Etruriae,” that of the second, “Regiae celsitudini Jo. Gastonis, Magni Ducis
                    Etruriae;” and Dr Towers has erroneously supposed that the work was published at
                    their expense. It was published at the expense of the editor, Sir Thomas Coke,
                    afterwards earl of Leicester, whose library contained the original manuscript,
                    nor is the book unworthy of so magnificent an editor: it is elegantly printed,
                    and is illustrated with engravings. A supplement to this work was published by
                    Giambattista Passeri under the subsequent title: “In Thomae Dempsteri libros de
                    Etruria Regali Paralipomena, quibus Tabulae eidem operi additae illustrantur.
                    Accedunt Dissertationes de Re Num maria Etruscorum, de Nominibus Etruscorum, et
