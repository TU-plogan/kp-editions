                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">DACIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew</hi></label>, keeper of
                    the books of the king’s cabinet, and member of the French Academy and also of
                    that of Inscriptions and Belles-lettres, was born at Castres on the 6th April
                    1651. He had a great genius and inclination for learning, and studied at Saumur
                    under Tanneguy Le Fevre, who was then, engaged in the instruction of his
                    daughter, who afterwards proved an honour to her sex under the name of Madame
                    Dacier, and with whom her future husband was associated in study. This gave rise
                    to that mutual tenderness which a marriage of forty years could not weaken. The
                    Duke of Montausier hearing of his merit, put him in the list of commentators for
                    the use of the Dauphin, and engaged him in an edition of Pomponius Festus, which
                    he published in 1681. His edition of Horace, printed at Paris in ten volumes
                    12mo, and his other works, procured him a great reputation. He was made a member
                    of the Academy of Inscriptions in 1695. When the history of Louis XIV. by medals
                    had been finished, he was chosen to present it to his majesty; who being
                    informed of the pains which he had bestowed on it, settled upon him a pension of
                    2000 livres, and appointed him keeper of the books of the king’s cabinet in the
                    Louvre. When that post was united to the office of library-keeper to the king,
                    he was not only continued in the privilege of his place during life, but the
                    survivorship thereof was granted to his wife, a favour of which there had been
                    no instance before. But the death of Madame Dacier in 1720 rendered this grant,
                    which was so honourable to her, ineffectual. Her husband died on the 18th
                    September 1722, of an ulcer in the throat. In his manners, sentiments, and whole
                    conduct, he was a complete model of that ancient philosophy of which he was so
                    great an admirer, and which he improved by the rules and principles of
                    Christianity.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dacier,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anne Lefevre,</hi> daughter of
                    Tanneguy Lefevre, professor of Greek at Saumur, in France. She early showed a
                    fine genius, which her father cultivated with great care and satisfaction. After
                    his death she went to Paris, whither her fame had already preceded her. She was
                    then preparing an edition of Callimachus, which she published in 1674. Having
                    shown some sheets of it to M. Huet, preceptor to the dauphin, and to several
                    other men of learning at the court, the work was so highly admired, that the
                    Duke of Montausier made a proposal to her of publishing several Latin authors
                    for the use of the dauphin. She at first rejected this proposal, as a task to
                    which she was not equal; but the duke insisting upon it, he at last gained her
                    consent, and she undertook an edition of Florus, which was published in 1674.
                    Her reputation being now diffused over all Europe, Christina, queen of Sweden,
                    ordered Count Königsmark to compliment her in the name of his mistress; upon
                    which Mademoiselle Lefevre sent the queen a Latin letter, with her edition of
                    Florus, to which her majesty wrote an obliging answer, and not long afterwards
                    wrote another letter to persuade her to abandon the Protestant religion, and to
                    settle at the Swedish court. In 1683 she married M. Dacier, upon which occasion
                    it was pleasantly remarked that this was the marriage of the Greek and the
                    Latin; and she soon afterwards declared her design to the Duke of Montausier and
                    the Bishop of Méaux, of reconciling herself to the church of Rome, which she had
                    entertained for some time; but as Μ. Dacier was not yet convinced of the
                    reasonableness of such a change, they retired in 1684 to Castres, where they had
                    a small estate, in order to examine the points of controversy between the
                    Protestants and the Roman Catholics. They at last determined in favour of the
                    latter, and made a public abjuration of Protestantism in 1685. After this,, the
                    king gave both the husband and wife marks of his favour. In 1693 she applied
                    herself to the education of her son and daughter, who made great progress; but
                    the son died in 1694, and the daughter became a nun in the abbey of Longchamp.
                    Madame Dacier had another daughter, who united in her all the virtues and
                    accomplishments that could adorn the sex; but she unfortunately died at the age
                    of eighteen. Her mother has immortalized her memory in the preface to her
                    translation of the Iliad. Madame Dacier was in a very infirm state of health the
                    two last years of her life; and she died, after a very painful sickness, on the
                    17th of August 1720, aged sixty-nine. She was remarkable for her firmness,
                    generosity, equality of temper, and piety.</p>
