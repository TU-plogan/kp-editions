                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Louis-Jean-Marie</hi></label>, a distinguished naturalist, was born at Montbar,
                    in the department of the Côte d’Or, in France, on the 29th of May 1716. His
                    father, Jean Dauben ton, was a notary in that place, and his mother’s name was
                    Marie Pichenot. In his youth he distinguished himself by the sweetness of his
                    temper, and by his diligent application to his studies. The Jesuits of Dijon,
                    under whose tuition he was first placed, noticed him in a peculiar manner.
                    Having gone through a course of what was called philosophy, under the Dominicans
                    of Dijon, his father, who destined him for the church, and who had made him
                    assume the ecclesiastical dress at the age of twelve, sent him to Paris to study
                    theology. But his predilection for natural history induced him privately to
                    study medicine. Accordingly he attended the lectures of Baron, Martinenq, and
                    Col de Villars, and likewise those of Winslow, Hunault, and Antoine de Jussieu,
                    in the botanic garden. The death of his father in 1736 enabled him to follow his
                    inclination without constraint. Accordingly he took a degree at Rheims in 1741,
                    and returned to his own country with the intention of following the practice of
                    medicine. But fortune destined him for a more brilliant career.</p>
                <p>Montbar had given birth, about the same time, to another man of a very different
                    character, who, though possessed of an independent fortune, a robust
                    constitution, and actuated by a violent passion for pleasure, had determined
                    notwithstanding to devote himself to the cultivation of the sciences. This man
                    was Buffon. Hesitating for some time what branch of physics he should make his
                    peculiar study, he tried by turns geometry, mechanical philosophy, and
                    agriculture. At last his friend Dufay, who during his short superintendence had
                    raised the botanic garden from that state of neglect in which former naturalists
                    had left it, and who had procured for Buffon the reversion of his office, dying,
                    and leaving him his place, Buffon’s choice was fixed on natural history, and he
                    saw before him that wide field which he afterwards traversed with so much
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>Natural history was at that time little else than a dry catalogue of names,
                    destitute of that methodical arrangement, of that precision, and of those
                    interesting details, which have since distinguished it. It occupied a very low
                    station among the sciences, and instead of being a fashionable study, was
                    degraded into the drudge of medicine and surgery. Buffon formed the bold plan of
                    giving life to this dry and apparently sterile mass, of painting nature as she
                    is, always young, always active; of pointing out the harmony of all her parts,
                    and the laws by which they are combined into one system, and of giving his
                    picture all the glow, freshness, and charms of nature herself. But, to secure
                    success, it was necessary to make truth the basis of his system. Every thing
                    must be collected, revised, and examined. The forms and dimensions of animals
                    must be compared, and their internal structure ascertained. The ardent and
                    impatient spirit of Buffon could ill brook a task so tedious and painful, and
                    the imperfection of his sight rendered him unqualified for it. He looked about,
                    therefore, for a man possessed of sufficient judgment, patience, and neatness of
                    hand for his purpose, and at the same time modest enough to submit willingly to
                    act a secondary part. He found such a man in Daubenton, the companion of his
                    infancy.</p>
                <p>The character of these two philosophers was almost opposite in every respect.
                    Buffon was violent, impatient, and rash; Daubenton was all gentleness, patience,
                    and caution: Buffon wished to divine the truth rather than to discover it;
                    Daubenton believed nothing which he had not himself seen and ascertained: Buffon
                    suffered his imagination to lead him from nature; Daubenton, on the contrary,
                    discarded from his writings every expression which was calculated to mislead.
                    They were thus happily fitted to correct each other’s faults; and accordingly
                    the history of quadrupeds, which appeared whilst they thus laboured together, is
                    the most exempt from error of any of the divisions or departments which
                    constitute Buffon’s great work on natural history.</p>
                <p>Buffon drew Daubenton to Paris about 1742, and procured for him the place of
                    demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, at first with a salary of only
                    500 francs, but which was gradually increased to 2000. He furnished him likewise
                    with a lodging, and neglected nothing to secure his comfort and convenience.
                    Daubenton, on his side, devoted himself to second the views of his benefactor.
                    The cabinet of natural history, which was arranged, and in a great measure
                    collected, by bis means, proved of immense service. In the history of
                    quadrupeds, he gave the description and dissection of a hundred and eighty-two
                    species of quadrupeds. These details contained a vast number of new facts,
                    arranged in such a manner that the most curious results are often obtained
                    merely by comparing them together. This work procured for Daubenton a very high
                    reputation, and drew upon him the envy of Reaumur, who at that time considered
                    himself as at the head of natural history. But the credit and reputation of
                    Buffon was sufficient to prevent his friend from falling a victim to the attack
                    of this formidable antagonist.</p>
                <p>In the subsequent parts of his natural history, Buffon was persuaded to separate
                    himself from Daubenton. This injured the precision and value of these parts
                    excessively, whilst it deprived Daubenton of 12,000 francs a year. Afterwards
                    the intimacy between them revived, and continued till the death of Buffon.</p>
                <p>• The number of dissertations on natural history which Daubenton -published in
                    the Memoirs of the French Academy is so great that even a list of them would be
                    too long for this place. Descriptions of different animals, dissections,
                    comparisons between the forms of ^different animals, anatomical examinations of
                    fossil bones, in order to determine the animals to which they had belonged, ⅛e
                    physiology of vegetables, and different parts of mineralogy, successively
                    occupied him; not to mention his experiments on agriculture and rural economy,
                    which, however, were of more service to him afterwards than all the rest of his
                    labours, on account of the reputation among the populace which they had procured
                    him.</p>
                <p>Besides his publications, Daubenton was of great service to science as a
                    lecturer. From 1775 he gave lectures on natural history in the college of
                    medicine. In 1783 he lectured on rural economy. He was appointed professor of
                    mineralogy by the convention at the Garden of Plants, and he gave lectures
                    during the ephemeral existence of the Normal School. He was likewise one of the
                    editors of the Journal des Sçavans, and contributed to both the Encyclopaedias.
                    As a lecturer he was extremely popular, and, what is uncommon, he retained his
                    popularity to the last.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the feebleness of his constitution, he arrived at a very advanced
                    age without much disease or loss of his faculties. This may in some measure be
                    ascribed to the gentleness of his temper, and his remarkable resignation. He was
                    temperate and moderate even in his <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755514"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-5514-0634"/>studies. Part of his time was spent in reading
                    romances with his wife.</p>
                <p>In the year 1799 he was appointed one of the members of the conservative senate,
                    and he resolved to attend the meeting of it. This obliged him to alter his
                    regimen. The season was severe. At the first meeting which he attended he fell
                    from his seat in an apoplectic fit. The most speedy assistance was procured, and
                    by its means he was restored to his senses. With the utmost calmness he pointed
                    out with his fingers the progress of the paralysis in different parts of his
                    body, and died without a struggle on the first of January 1800.</p>
