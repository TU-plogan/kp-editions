                    corruptions in the fourth century, and the forerunner of those who have since
                    testified for scriptural truth, and protested against certain errors of the
                    ancient fathers. Others of the same, or of an earlier period, may have offered
                    some occasional opposition to superstitious practices, as they crept into the
                    church; but Vigilantius openly denounced relic and saint worshippers as <hi

                    upon the obligation to celibacy, the adoration of saints, prayers for the dead,
                    the use of relics, and pilgrimages, and exposed their mischievous tendency, at
                    the critical time when they were sanctioned by such eminent men as Ambrose,
                    Chrysostom, Jerom, and Augustin. He was one of those resolute inquirers, who
                    dare to think for themselves, and who appear at intervals, after the lapse of
                    centuries, to remind Christians that they are to abide by the rule of thought
                    and action, which is laid down in the book of God’s revealed will, and are not
                    to be satisfied with any canon which cannot be examined by that standard. He may
                    therefore have a place given to him in that noble phalanx, in which Claude of
                    Turin, Valdo of Lyons, Luther, and Calvin, took their stand, for the defence of
                    the pure gospel.</p>
                <p>Vigilantius was born about the year 360, at the foot of the Pyrenees, under the
                    warm sun which fertilizes Aquitaine, and in the midst of that majestic scenery

                    young mountaineer under the notice of Sulpicius Severus, the historian, who took
                    him into his service, and employed him in the management of his estate, and in

                    taken into the confidence of his patron, and lived with him more in the

                    extant, which passed between Sulpicius Severus and Paulinus of Nola, in which
                    Vigilantius is mentioned in the warmest terms of affection;<note anchored="true"

                    and no doubt he was indebted to his familiar acquaintance with these two eminent
                    persons Tor his first serious impressions. Had he not been a man of uncommon
                    strength of mind, he would have fallen into the same errors which clouded their
                    religious views. Happily and providentially, however, he was enabled to turn
                    their example to advantage, even on points in which they were misguided, by
                    avoiding the rocks on which they split; and he became a reformer where he might
                    have been a sceptic, or at least a scorner, with such extravagancies before his
                    eyes as they practised under the name of religion. Sulpicius, in a season of
                    great mental distress, went to Martin, bishop of Tours,<note anchored="true"

                    Vigilantius accompanied him on one or two of his visits to that gloomy ascetic,
                    in 392 or 393, and witnessed some of those acts of austerity<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>" One of them is thus
                    described by Paulinus:</p><p>Quin et contexto setis coopertus

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sulp. Sev. Dialogi de
                    Virtutibus Martini.</p></note> which proved Martin to be an impostor or a crazy
                    fanatic, and opened the eyes of the young man to the true character of a system,
                    which turned the head of his master, and made him the victim of a spiritual
                    delusion.</p>
                <p>Sulpicius devoted the whole of his immense property to the exercise of almsgiving
                    and hospitality. His beautiful villas at Primuliac and Elusone, near Tholouse,
                    were made the asylums of the mendicant and the wayfaring man. He built churches;
                    he founded a monastery; he entertained strangers; he treated his domestics as if
                    they were his near relations; and he lived in the practice of every Christian
                    virtue.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Epist. Paulini
                    ad Sulp. Sev.</p></note> He watched, he prayed, he fasted. But this was not
                    enough. Wrought up to the highest pitch of religious fever by Martin, and others
                    of a disordered imagination, he believed that his oblations of faith and piety
                    would be unacceptable to heaven, unless they were accompanied by the most rigid
                    self-denial and self-infliction. But the more he tormented himself, the more did
                    fears, utterly inconsistent with the covenant of reconciliation and the pardon
                    of sins, offered in the gospel, prey upon his heart and understanding.
                    Vigilantius observed the melancholy and maddening effects produced in the noble
                    mind of his protector, and learnt to abominate the lessons which degraded “the
                    Christian Sallust,” as Sulpicius was called, to the level of a credulous and
                    extravagant narrator of false miracles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>He likewise had opportunities of seeing how leaven of the same kind worked in
                    Paulinus of Nola, and how it spoilt his Christianity. That illustrious and
                    amiable saint (for saint he was, in spite of his religious mistakes), was

                    perfect. It is in vain to defend the Christianity of the fourth century from the
                    charge of fanaticism. See Epist. Hieron. ad Paul. 49. Opera iv. par. ii. p.

                    perfection, to renounce the comfort and privileges of wedlock, to live with his
                    wife as if with a sister, to desert his post of duty, to deny himself the
                    necessaries of life, to abandon the world, to practise severities on his person,
                    and to have recourse to superstitious observances, which reduced his body to a
                    skeleton, and his mind to a state bordering on imbecility.</p>
                <p>Vigilantius continued to pass his time in the society of Sulpicius, in Aquitaine,
                    or of Paulinus, in Campania, until the year 394 or 395, and with them he had the
                    best οpportunities of cultivating sacred learning, and of discussing theological
                    questions. But succeeding to considerable property on the death of his father,

                    introduction, which took place after he was in priest’s orders, was a turning
                    point in his life. The errors for which he might have had some respect, in
                    connection with such gentle and humble servants of God as Sulpicius and
                    Paulinus, (and never is error so dangerous as when recommended by good and holy
                    men), became disgusting in the sour and choleric monk of Bethlehem, whose
                    learning gave a sting to his accrbity. It was unendurable to be a spectator of
                    Jerom’s spiritual pride, and to hear him revile every body whose opinions were
                    opposed to his own, while he professed to make the birth-place of the meek and
                    lowly Jesus his abode, in order that he might be the better able to keep his
                    body in subjection. Their disputes ran high, and Jerom, who began by speaking of
                    Vigilantius as “the holy presbyter,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hier. Op. iv. pars ii. p. 568.</p></note> and “Christian

                    was most expressive of contempt and resentment. He punned upon his name, and
                    called him <hi rend="italic">Dormitantius,</hi> and inveighed against him as an

                    “Samaritan,” “worse than a Jew;” these were some of Jerom’s terms of reproach
                    applied to Vigilantius; but we search in vain for any fair grounds of accusation
                    in justification of such language, which has been condemned by some of the best
                    writers of the Romish church. No charges of heterodoxy on the great doctrines of
                    atonement and justification, no imputation of doubtful faith on the doctrine of
                    the Holy Trinity, are advanced against him. The sum and substance of Jerom’s
                    indictment amounts to this, that Vigilantius denied the sanctity of relics; that
                    he refused to worship and to burn lights at the tombs of the martyrs, and to
                    invocate saints; that he disapproved of vows of celibacy, of pilgrimages, and of

                    have nothing left but Jerom’s account of the controversy; and Vigilantius only
                    speaks for himself in the pages of his adversary, in some of which he is
                    represented precisely in the same light, and almost in the same words, as the
                    early Christians were by their pagan calumniators. Jerom hated Vigilantius
                    personally, because he had accused him of inclining to some of the opinions of
                    Origen. Fleury admits that Jerom was too vehement in his controversy with
                    Vigilantius; and Erasmus makes use of a stronger expression, “debacchatur

                    the Valdenses, among whom he found persons entertaining the same opinions as his
                    own. This visit may have been occasioned by a statement of Ambrose relating to
                    the opinions and practice of his mountain clergy. Claude, bishop of Turin, four
                    hundred years afterwards, was said to revive the sect of Vigilantius<note

                    was a strong attempt, at this time, to correct those superstitious practices of
                    the church of the fourth century, which Vigilantius denounced as having an
                    idolatrous tendency. It is quite clear, that the Aquitainian clergy leant, for
                    the most part, towards the opinions of Vigilantius, because nobody was found in
                    southern Gaul to contradict him; and for that reason Jerom undertook to rebuke
                    and refute him, at the request of Riparius and Desiderius. The influence of the
                    Pyrenean presbyter was exercised in another way; he employed much of his time
                    and his fortune in the transcription and circulation of copies of
                    Scripture.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hier. Epist.

                <p>The zeal of Vigilantius in his endeavour to check the progress of corrupt
                    innovation, was unremitting till the time of his death, which took place. It is
                    supposed, during that terrible invasion of the barbarians, the Alans and
                    Vandals, which desolated the south of Europe at the beginning of the fifth
                    century. In 401 and 403, and again in 406, we find Jerome writing against
                    him,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vide Hier. Opera,
                    vol. iv. pars ii.</p></note> and describing his persevering efforts in the
                    dissemination of his principles; but after that no more mention is made of him.
                    The full benefit of his protests against antichristian novelties was not felt,
                    either in his lifetime or in the ages that immediately followed. But he was one
                    of those champions of the faith raised up in fulfilment of the promise, that the
                    gospel of truth shall never be without a witness; and it was reserved for a
                    happier era to establish the doctrines which he so faithfully maintained. (<hi
