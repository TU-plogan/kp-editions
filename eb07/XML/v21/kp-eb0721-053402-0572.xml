                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    cow), is the artificial production of a disease, originally obtained from the
                    cow, (cow-pox), by bringing the matter of that disease in contact with the
                    living fibre.</p>
                <p>To Dr. Edward Jenner we are indebted for the discovery of vaccination. His
                    attention was first directed to the subject by the popular belief which existed
                    in Gloucestershire, where he resided, that those who were infected with matter
                    from the sores on the udder of the cow, were ever after secured from the
                    contagion of small-pox. It was not, however, till the 14th of May 1796, that he
                    made it the subject of direct experiment, by taking matter from the sore on the
                    hand of a dairymaid who had contracted cowpox from the udders of her master’s
                    cows, and applying it, by means of two superficial incisions, to the arm of a
                    boy. Pustules somewhat similar to those of small-pox, but darker in their hue,
                    and filled with a limpid fluid, were produced, and became surrounded with an
                    erysipelatous or red circle, but the whole died away, leaving on the inoculated
                    part scabs and subsequent eschars, without producing any other inconvenience. On
                    the seventh day after the operation, the boy complained of some uneasiness in
                    the arm-pit; on the ninth he became chilly, had headach, loss of appetite, and
                    was otherwise indisposed, and passed a restless night, but was well by next day.
                    As the object of the experiment was to ascertain whether the cow-pox gave
                    immunity from the small-pox, he was on the 1st of July inoculated with smallpox
                    matter, but no disease was produced; and the same result was obtained when this
                    was repeated some months afterwards. Numerous experiments of the same kind were
                    afterwards made; and they ended in establishing the fact that the matter of
                    cow-pox protected the human body from being acted on by the infection of
                    small-pox, while it was itself a mild and safe disease, exciting little more
                    constitutional disturbance than what resulted from the local sore.</p>
                <p>Dr. Jenner accounted for this singular fact, by asserting that cow-pox was
                    nothing else than small-pox modified, or deprived of all its noxious qualities,
                    by having passed through the system of the cow; and that the disease in the heel
                    of the horse, called grease, which he showed was capable of producing the
                    vaccine vesicle in the cow, was also but a variety of the same disease. In fact,
                    he at first regarded both small-pox and cow-pox as originally derived from the
                    horse.</p>
                <p>The publication of such an interesting fact did not fail to excite general
                    attention; and, accordingly, the very same year in which Dr. Jenner’s Inquiry
                    made its appearance, Dr. Pearson published the results of his investigations,
                    which tended to confirm the opinion advanced by Dr. Jenner as to the
                    anti-variolous powers of the cow-pox. In two points alone did he dissent. He
                    regarded cow-pox and small-pox as two very different diseases, and denied that
                    the cow-pox could be produced by the matter of the diseased heel of the horse;
                    and he was supported in his opinion by the inquiries of Sir Isaac Pennington,
                    the arguments of Dr. Parr, and the experiments of Dr. Woodville, and of Mr.
                    Simmons.</p>
                <p>Other experimentalists were, however, much more successful in confirming the
                    opinion of Dr. Jenner as to the analogy or rather identity of the disease of the
                    horse’s heel and the cow-pox. Mr. Tanner succeeded in communicating the cow-pox
                    to the cow, by inserting on the udder some liquid matter taken from the diseased
                    heel of the horse; and the experiments of Mr. Lupton and Dr. John Loy
                    corroborated the same fact. Dr. Loy, indeed, found that even the equine matter
                    produced in man as perfect vaccine vesicles, as that derived from the cow
                    itself, and afforded equal protection from the infection of small-pox. These
                    conclusions have been confirmed by subsequent experimentalists both in this
                    country and on the continent, so that it is now to be regarded as an established
                    fact, that grease and cow-pox are the same complaint, modified by the
                    constitution of the animals in which they occur.</p>
                <p>Dr. Woodville of the London Small-Pox Hospital lent his aid to ascertain, by
                    direct experiment on a large scale, whether the introduction of the mild
                    disease, cow-pox, was worthy of the encomiums bestowed upon it by Dr. Jenner and
                    Dr. Pearson, and whether it really guarded the system from a subsequent attack
                    of that loathsome and fatal disease, the small-pox. The results of these
                    experiments were published in 1799, by which time he had vaccinated six hundred
                    individuals. In most of these cases, small-pox inoculation had been performed at
                    a subsequent period, to test the efficacy of the protective power of the
                    cow-pox, but not one of them took the small-pox. An anomalous occurrence,
                    however, showed itself in nearly three-fifths of the patients vaccinated at the
                    Small-Pox Hospital. Pustular eruptions, more or less numerous, resembling those
                    of small-pox, appeared on various parts of the body, in some cases maturating
                    much in the same way as the pustules do in that disease, in others fading away
                    without proceeding to the formation of matter. Dr. Jenner, at the time when the
                    circumstance occurred, endeavoured to explain it, by supposing that it was owing
                    to some peculiarity in the air which these patients breathed, or to a
                    contamination of the original cow-pox matter with smallpox. That it could not be
                    owing to contamination with small-pox matter, Dr. Woodville showed from the
                    fact, that the same matter, when employed for the vaccination of individuals out
                    of the Small-Pox Hospital, did not produce these same pustular eruptions; and
                    some of the identical matter sent to the country, and used in vaccinating one
                    thousand individuals, only produced pustular eruptions in two cases. Dr.
                    Woodville, therefore, very justly drew the inference, that the cases vaccinated
                    at the Small-Pox Hospital differed from those vaccinated elsewhere, in being
                    placed in the centre of a variolated atmosphere, to the action of which the
                    pustular eruption was to be ascribed; a statement which was in a manner proved
                    at the time by the fact, that though at first nearly three-fifths of all the
                    cases vaccinated showed pustular eruptions, yet the eruptions afterwards
                    diminished so much, that of the last hundred cases which be published in his
                    first Reports, only seven were thus affected <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=573" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0573-0535"
                    />Subsequent observation has shown that this was in reality the true explanation
                    of the fact.</p>
                <p>Dr. Woodville considered small-pox and cow-pox as very closely allied in their
                    nature, indeed, “to a very principal point essentially the same,” and
                    consequently recommended the general adoption of cow-pox, as an effectual
                    preservative from the infection of small-pox, as perfectly sale and free from
                    danger, and incapable of being propagated by infectious effluvia. This last he
                    considered a very strong circumstance in its favour, since small-pox, even in
                    its mildest form, as produced by inoculation, tended greatly to swell the bills
                    of mortality, by spreading the infection from the sick to the healthy.</p>
                <p>It was during the progress of Dr. Woodville’s experiments at the Small-Pox
                    Hospital that the merits of vaccination began to be appreciated, and the
                    practice of it generally introduced into all parts of this country; and the
                    publication of his Observations in 1800 may be regarded as marking this epoch.
                    At this period, indeed, the efficacy of vaccination as an anti-variolous agent
                    was so generally admitted, and the practice so universally adopted, that, in the
                    course of a few months. Its benefits were extended to many thousand persons in
                    all parts of this island, and matter found its way to France. Italy, Germany,
                    Holland, Turkey, most of our colonies, and the United States of North America.
                    Numerous were the publications, in all languages, announcing the success of the
                    practice; and almost every one agreed in this, that it gave as perfect
                    protection from the infection of small-pox, as if the individual had once had
                    the natural or inoculated disease.</p>
                <p>Many of the partizans of vaccination, however, went much farther than this, and
                    asserted that those who had once gone through the vaccine disease, were at no
                    subsequent period of their lives liable to take small-pox. When, therefore,
                    cases of small-pox did occur after vaccination, they endeavoured to explain away
                    the fact, by asserting that it was not true small-pox, or that the individual
                    had not gone through the true, but a spurious vaccine disease. This was, indeed,
                    claiming for vaccination a power which was not possessed by any other disease.
                    There is a class of diseases which usually occur but once during the course of
                    life, but though a second attack is not a common occurrence, still it is every
                    now and then met with; and there are very few medical men of any standing in
                    their profession who have not met with cases of second attacks of measles,
                    scarlet fever, small-pox, typhus, &amp;c. Dr. Thomson of Edinburgh, in his work
                    on the Varioloid Epidemic of 1818, was the first to point out this clearly with
                    regard to small-pox; and had the circumstance been duly attended to when
                    vaccination was first introduced. It would have prevented much of the
                    controversy which has since arisen. It was unreasonable to expect from
                    vaccination a protective power greater than that afforded by small-pox itself;
                    and yet it was from the advocates of vaccination advancing this doctrine, —a
                    doctrine apparently borne out by the perfect immunity afforded to so many
                    thousands vaccinated in all parts of Europe on its finit introduction,—that
                    others, who had seen cases of small-pox after it, were led to deny altogether
                    its anti-variolous power, or at least to affirm that it only gave immunity from
                    the disease for a very limited number of years.</p>
                <p>It was not, however, till the year 1818, that the true value of the protective
                    powers of vaccination was properly understood. During the years 1816-17-18,
                    small-pox raged epidemically in various parts of Europe, and attacked both the
                    vaccinated and variolated, as well as those who had neither had cow-pox nor
                    small-pox. Chicken-pox was at the same time extremely prevalent, and the
                    phenomena of the two diseases were found to be frequently and generally
                    interchanged. Dr. Hodenpyl of Rotterdam, Dr. Thomson of Edinburgh, and MM.
                    Berard and De Lavit of Montpellier, who all described this epidemic, agreed in
                    regarding small-pox and chicken-pox as the same disease, which could be shown to
                    originate from the same source. But the most important fact, and the one most
                    interesting to humanity, was the ascertaining the comparative mortality of
                    small-pox, when it attacked these three classes :—1st, the vaccinated; 2d, the
                    variolated, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> those who had small-pox; and, 3d, those
                    who had neither been vaccinated nor had small-pox. The conclusions at which
                    these different writers arrived were nearly the same. Of those who had neither
                    had cow-pox nor small-pox, 1 out of every 4 who were seized with the disease
                    died; of those who had small-pox naturally, or by inoculation, 1 out of every 25
                    to 1 in 75 died; while of those who had been vaccinated, and were afterwards
                    seized with small-pox, not more than 1 in 330 cases died: thus showing the great
                    superiority of vaccination even to the small-pox itself, in protecting the
                    system from the fatal effects of a second attack. Nor is it difficult to
                    understand how this should happen. Small-pox is a disease not only very fatal,
                    as proved by its cutting off a fourth of all whom it attacks, but it disfigures
                    or renders infirm from an eighth to a tenth of those who recover. Its action is
                    besides found to develope any latent disease, but particularly any scrofulous
                    tendency which may exist in the constitution, and is thus indirectly the cause
                    of death to a much larger portion of the human race than what at first sight
                    appears. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that small-pox, attacking for
                    the second time a constitution thus enfeebled, should cause a much greater
                    proportion of deaths than takes place when it occurs after vaccinal ion; for no
                    fact is more firmly established than this, that vaccination neither develops any
                    latent malady, nor engenders a predisposition to any particular disease.</p>
                <p>The fact above mentioned, of the comparative mortality of the three classes, viz.
                    the vaccinated, the variolated, and the non-vaccinated, has been, since 1818,
                    repeatedly demonstrated. One of the most accurate and interesting details, and
                    one which ought to set the point for ever at rest, is that given by M. Bousquet
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de la Vaccine,</hi> as having occurred at
                    Marseille during the epidemic small-pox of 1825. The population of Marseille,
                    amounting to 40,000, may be divided into three classes, of which the respective
                    numbers stand thus: 30,000 vaccinated; 8000 neither vaccinated nor variolated;
                    and 2000 variolated, that is, who had the smallpox either naturally or by
                    inoculation. Of the 30,000 vaccinated, about 2000 were seized with the prevalent
                    smallpox epidemic, of which number twenty died, or one for every hundred
                    affected. Of the 2000 variolated, twenty were attacked, and four died, or one in
                    every five cases. Of the 8000 non-vaccinated, 4000 were affected, and of this
                    number 1000 died, or one out of every four cases. From this it follows, that
                    one-half of the non-vaccinated, 1—15th of the vaccinated, and only l-100th of
                    the variolated, took the disease. But such was the difference in the comparative
                    severity of the attack in the vaccinated and variolated, that while the
                    variolated part of the population were cut off in the proportion of one out of
                    every 500, the vaccinated part of the population only lost one out of every
                    1500; or, in other words, of an equal number of variolated and vaccinated cases,
                    three variolated died from the second attack, for every one who died of the
                    disease after vaccination.</p>
                <p>Many similar instances might be quoted; all of them demonstrating the very great
                    security to the individual, and the saving of life to the community, afforded by
                    the introduction of vaccination. This is a subject, indeed, which has engaged
                    the attention of political economists; and as it has been calculated that in
                    Britain alone, before the introduction of vaccination, no fewer than 35,000 were
                    annually cut off by small-pox, while in France the deaths from that cause
                    amounted to 85,685, and proportionally large numbers occurred in other parts of
                    Europe and America, the saving <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=574" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0574-0536"/>of
                    life effected by this invaluable discovery must be immense.</p>
                <p>Though the benefits of vaccination were thus clearly proved, the public
                    confidence in it has been attempted to be shaken by raising the outcry, that the
                    vaccine virus, if it really possesses anti-variolous powers, loses them as life
                    advances; so that, at the end of a few years, those vaccinated individuals are
                    as liable to the attack of small-pox as if they had never been affected by the
                    disease. It is fortunately an easy matter to trace such an opinion to its true
                    sources; namely, to a disbelief in the fact, that small-pox can occur twice in
                    the same individual; and to a disbelief in the identity of small-pox and
                    cow-pox. Those holding such opinions as these, see every thing through the mist
                    of prejudice, and represent every instance of the occurrence of small-pox after
                    vaccination as an additional proof of the correctness of their theory; shutting
                    their eyes to the facts daily happening around them, that a second attack of
                    small-pox is not only by no means a very rare occurrence, but that it is a much
                    more dangerous and fatal disease than small-pox after vaccination, cutting off
                    at least three times as many victims.</p>
                <p>As the first of these objections has. It is conceived, been satisfactorily shown
                    to rest on no solid grounds, we are next to examine whether the second stands on
                    any better foundation.</p>
                <p>Every writer who has opposed vaccination, whatever may have been his other
                    grounds of objection, has constantly set out with the proposition, that there
                    are certain diseases which occur but once in the course of life, and which
                    effect some unknown change on the constitution, rendering it unsusceptible of a
                    second attack of the same disease. As they regard smallpox and cow-pox as two
                    distinct diseases, they cannot imagine how the one disease should guard the
                    human frame from the ravages of the other; and one of the latest writers on the
                    subject of vaccination, Dr. G. Gregory of the Small-Pox Hospital, London,
                    actually declares, that “vaccination is not small-pox, but just the reverse—the
                    antagonist principle.” In order to answer such an objection, all that is
                    requisite is, to show that small-pox and cow-pox are really identical, the
                    latter only modified by having passed through the system of the cow, as
                    originally advanced by Dr. Jenner, the father of vaccination.</p>
                <p>It was announced so early as 1802, by Professor Viborg of Copenhagen, that, at
                    Berlin, small-pox was communicated to the cow by inoculation; but the details of
                    these experiments do not appear to have reached this country, and all attempts
                    to repeat them here have failed. It was not till 1830, that any detailed account
                    of successful experiments of this kind were published, when Dr. Sonderland of
                    Barmen announced that he could produce the true vaccine disease in the cow at
                    pleasure, by covering the animal with the blankets from the bed of a patient who
                    had died of smallpox, and by hanging them up around it, that it might breathe
                    the effluvia arising from them. In a few days, he says, the animal became sick,
                    and pustules appeared on the udder and other parts, precisely similar to the
                    cow-pox vesicles, and filled, like them, with lymph. This lymph, transferred to
                    the human subject, he found to produce the genuine vaccine vesicle, together
                    with the usual constitutional disturbance, and to protect the individual from
                    the small-pox virus or contagion. In fact, such a change was effected on the
                    small-pox matter, during its transit through the system of the cow, that it was
                    converted from a virulent and fatal into a mild and safe disease.</p>
                <p>The announcement of this curious experiment incited others to repeat it, though
                    without success; and it was not till 1839 that Mr. Robert Ceely, surgeon to the
                    Buckinghamshire Infirmary, succeeded in proving the identity of the two
                    diseases, by communicating small-pox by inoculation to the cow, and finding it
                    produce the true cow-pox disease. He however failed to communicate small-pox to
                    the cow after the manner found successful by Dr. Sonderland. Mr. Ceely
                    inoculated heifers with the matter of smallpox, and found it to produce genuine
                    vaccine vesicles, which ran their course like the natural or inoculated cow-pox,
                    and furnished limpid lymph for vaccination. The lymph was employed in
                    vaccinating many children, and differed in no respects from that obtained from
                    the natural cow-pox vesicle of the cow. It ran the same course when introduced
                    by punctures on the arm; did not give rise to any eruption on the skin, any more
                    than primary vaccine lymph; and afforded equal protection against small-pox, as
                    found by exposing the children to the small-pox effluvium, and also by
                    inoculating them with small-pox virus; in fact. It did not in any respect differ
                    from ordinary vaccine lymph, as obtained from the natural vaccine vesicle.</p>
                <p>Nothing could be more satisfactory than the result of such an experiment. For
                    here it is proved, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that small-pox and cow-pox
                    are but varieties of the same disease. It is therefore no longer to be regarded
                    as an anomaly, that cow-pox should protect the system from an attack of
                    small-pox, but it is in beautiful accordance with what has been generally
                    admitted to be a law in nature, that certain diseases, once undergone, protect
                    the system from a subsequent attack.</p>
                <p>The chief objection to vaccination having been. It is hoped, answered
                    satisfactorily. It only remains to show, that the protective powers of
                    vaccination do not wear out of the system as life advances, any more than those
                    of small-pox itself. This is a most important inquiry; as nothing is more likely
                    to prove hurtful to the cause of vaccination, and render the public careless of
                    securing to themselves its benefits, than the belief, that they would require to
                    submit to revaccination every ten or fifteen years, and that at no period of
                    their lives they could with certainty reckon on escaping the small-pox.</p>
                <p>Starting from the point which has been proved, that the cow-pox and the small-pox
                    are the same disease, all analogy shows that the system having once passed
                    through this disease, is not in general susceptible of a second attack. More
                    than forty years have now elapsed since vaccination was introduced; and if, as
                    the opponents of vaccination assert. Its anti-variolous powers wore out of the
                    system in a few years, why does it happen that small-pox is not now as deadly a
                    scourge among the grown population, as it was before the introduction of
                    vaccination? It has not been for want of epidemics of small-pox that the grown
                    population has escaped for so many years. At Marseille, after a lapse of
                    twenty-five years. It was found that the protective powers were not in the least
                    diminished. Of the 30,000 who had undergone vaccination in that city, only
                    twenty fell victims to the small-pox, or one out of every 1500 individuals:
                    while of the 8000 who had not been vaccinated, no fewer than 1000 died, or one
                    out of every eight persons. Here was no falling off of the protective power of
                    vaccination after twenty-five years. Nay, the security afforded by vaccination
                    was even greater than that of small-pox itself, for out of a population of 2000
                    who had had small-pox, no fewer than four died, or one out of every 500
                    individuals; exactly three times as many as those who had been protected by
                    vaccination. But this is only one of many similar instances which might be
                    produced.</p>
                <p>It having been found, that from a sixth to a third of those who have been
                    vaccinated are capable of receiving vaccination a second time, after the lapse
                    of a greater or lesser number of months or years, the opponents of vaccination
                    adduce this as an additional argument to prove that its anti-variolous powers
                    wear out of the system. But such assertions will not bear a moment’s serious
                    reflection. Allowing, for the sake of argument, that all those who could be
                    revaccinated successfully, would be equally liable to an attack <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=575" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0575-0537"/>of
                    small-pox, <hi rend="italic">if exposed to its influence,</hi> (which they are
                    not, as it has been clearly proved by experiment that individuals may be
                    successfully revaccinated, and yet be unsusceptible of the poison of small-pox,)
                    what would be the result? Their chances of recovery would be as 100 to one, that
                    of dying as one to 100. Or, in other words, if 100 were attacked with small-pox
                    after vaccination, only one would die; whereas, if 100 who had formerly had
                    smallpox were again attacked, no fewer than twenty would die. Now this is
                    stating the facts in their most favourable light for the opponents of
                    vaccination, as, according to what has occurred in several of the variolous
                    epidemics, only one of the vaccinated has died out of 330 individuals attacked;
                    but either of the statements is quite sufficient to prove the immense
                    superiority of vaccination to inoculation, and also the fact, that the security
                    afforded does not decrease with the advance of life.</p>
                <p>The Royal Academy of Medicine of France, after the fullest inquiry into this
                    subject, have arrived at the conclusion, that vaccination gives, in general,
                    perfect protection from a subsequent attack of small-pox,—a protection fully as
                    perfect as if the individual had gone through the smallpox itself; and when the
                    government applied to them in 1839, to ask their advice as to whether the
                    students at the different public schools and colleges ought to be revaccinated
                    before leaving them, they returned for answer that they ought not, as having
                    been once vaccinated gave protection from small-pox for the remainder of
                    life.</p>
                <p>It is extremely satisfactory to learn that all extended inquiries have led to the
                    same result, that vaccination gives full protection from small-pox for life. Too
                    little attention has, in this country, been paid to the statistics of disease,
                    and also to vaccination, to give anything like accurate results as to the
                    effects of vaccination in diminishing the mortality from small-pox; but in
                    several countries of the continent of Europe, the same remissness has not been
                    shown, and there the advantages of the general introduction of vaccination is
                    demonstrated. One instance may suffice for illustration. In Sweden, in the year
                    1779, no fewer than 15,000 persons were cut off by small-pox; and in 1800, the
                    year before the introduction of vaccination, 12,000 fell victims to the same
                    disease. Great exertions were now made to introduce and carry into effect the
                    beneficial practice of vaccination, when the mortality from small-pox yearly
                    diminished, till it fell so low as eleven in the year 1822, and thirty-seven in
                    the year 1823. Since then, “for a period of eight years, not a single case of
                    small-pox has occurred in the dominions of his Swedish majesty: the whole
                    inhabitants had been vaccinated.”</p>
                <p>If the anti-variolous powers of vaccination failed after a certain number of
                    years, say ten or fifteen, instead of having, as above stated, an annually
                    decreasing number of smallpox cases, we should have seen them occurring in a
                    gradually increasing ratio. But as the practice has now stood the test of a
                    whole generation, and has been found to be as effectually protective at the end
                    of that long period as at the beginning, we may safely acquiesce in the
                    conclusion of the French Academy of Medicine. The truth is, that the ratio of
                    mortality from small-pox, after vaccination, is greatly less than that of almost
                    any disease to which the human frame is subject; and were vaccination as
                    generally practised, and as carefully attended to, in this and other countries,
                    as in Sweden, the sanguine hope of Jenner might yet be fulfilled, that the
                    small-pox might be quite extinguished, (<hi rend="smallcaps">c. m.)</hi></p>
