                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">VALAISE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Wallis</hi></label>, a
                    canton of Switzerland, in the south-western part, a district comprehending a
                    large portion of the Alps and the land between them and Italy. It extends in
                    north latitude from 45° 55' to 46° 30', and in east longitude from 6° 35' to 8°
                    9', containing 1254 square geographical miles. It is bounded on the north-west
                    by the Lake of Geneva and the canton of Vaud, on the north by Berne, on the
                    north-east by Uri and Tecino, on the east, south-east, and south-west by the
                    states of the king of Sardinia.</p>
                <p>This canton is on every side surrounded by lofty mountains, so close to each
                    other that the passes between them are few and very narrow. These ranges on the
                    boundaries present some of the loftiest pinnacles of the Alps, such as Monte
                    Rosa 14,580 feet in height, the Matterhorn orCervin 13,380 feet, St. Bernard’s
                    10,380 feet, the Grimsel 8580 feet, the Col de Baume 7080 feet, and the Simplon
                    6174 feet. The most practicable passes through these ranges, which, however, are
                    often dangerous in winter, though kept open at a vast expense, are that by the
                    Gemmi, the Grimsel, the Furca, and the Antonierberg, to the interior of
                    Switzerland; that by the St. Bernard and the Simplon into Italy; and that by St.
                    Maurice into the canton of Vaud. In the interior there are lower ranges of Alps,
                    generally running from north to south, and thus dividing the whole surface into
                    small vales. These vales differ much in their character; some of them are stoney
                    and marshy, and others sterile, but others of them have valuable meadows, and
                    land, which, when cultivated, yields profitable crops.</p>
                <p>The climate is excessively variable. The lofty Alps protect the canton from the
                    north wind, but the raw east wind brings frost and snow. The west wind brings
                    heat, and the sudden changes are prejudicial to health. To these sudden and
                    violent changes are attributed the fevers which are so prevalent; and in part is
                    attributed to them, though in part to the Tuffa water, the great number of
                    cretins that are to be found in the canton.</p>
                <p>The chief products of the country are cattle, and the butter and cheese which
                    they yield. Much of the cheese is made from the milk of goats, which are much
                    more numerous than sheep. Horses are but rarely seen except on the great road;
                    but many mules are used for riding as well as for purposes of husbandry. The
                    corn grown is principally barley and oats. In some of the southern valleys wine
                    is made to a considerable extent. The growth of various fruits gives much
                    occupation to the inhabitants. In many districts chesnuts are used as a
                    substitute for bread. There is abundance of wood in the forests, but it is
                    chiefly used at home for fuel or building. There are no manufactures except
                    those of the domestic kind, which each family must manage for itself as well as
                    it can.</p>
                <p>The only export articles are wine, cattle, cheese, hides, wool, and dried fruits,
                    which are sold to purchase salt, corn, iron, colonial goods, and clothing for
                    the very few who can afford better dresses than their neighbours. In fact the
                    commonest gratifications which in other countries have become almost
                    necessaries, must be dispensed with, as the mass of the people are too poor to
                    purchase any thing, and therefore must rest satisfied with what their own hands,
                    with native materials, can provide.</p>
                <p>The population of the canton in 1838 amounted to 75,798 persons, of whom 25,000
                    were of German origin, 46,000 of French, and 4750 of Italian, all speaking
                    corrupt dialects of the several races from which they are derived. They are of
                    the Catholic church, and no other public worship is permitted to be exercised.
                    The ecclesiastical divisions are forty-eight parishes, and there are eight
                    monasteries or nunneries. The bishop of Sitten, or Sion, is the head of the
                    church under the pope.</p>
                <p>The constitution is a pure democracy. Each male that has completed his eighteenth
                    year has a vote; when he has completed his twenty-first may be chosen a
                    representative, and after his twenty-fifth may become one of the executive
                    council. The legislature assembles twice in the year, but a committee of it is
                    permanent, and assists the landamman or governor. All the public officers are
                    appointed for two years. Every man is enrolled in the militia. The canton is
                    bound to furnish a contingent of 1280 men to the general confederation, and to
                    pay a contribution to the same of 9600 francs. The whole revenue is 133,100
                    francs, and the annual expenditure 114,820 francs. The capital is Sitten, a
                    small city, with 2500 inhabitants, on the Simplon road.</p>
