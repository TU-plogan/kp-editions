                <p><label type="entry">VIRGINIA</label>, the largest and most central state in the
                    American Union, perhaps the most varied in its productions, and the richest in
                    natural resources, blessed with a happy climate and a fruitful soil, exhibiting
                    a pleasant interchange of the most romantic and lovely scenes. The state borders
                    upon the Atlantic ocean and the river Ohio, extending from 75° 10' to 83° 25' W.
                    Long., having Maryland on the east, and Ohio and Kentucky on the west: on the
                    north are Maryland and Pennsylvania, and on the south Tennessee and North

                    />south is about 200 miles. Its length in the southern part is from 400 to 430
                    miles, and, north of 38°, about half that extent; its area is about 70,000
                    square miles, being but little inferior to Scotland and England united.</p>
                <p>With the exception of Pennsylvania, Virginia is the only state that extends quite
                    across the great Appalachian chains, and it is traversed from north to south by
                    several well-defined mountain ranges. Our knowledge of the course and
                    connections of these chains, which have not been accurately laid down in maps,
                    is yet very imperfect, but some of them have been traced with tolerable
                    precision. The Blue Ridge, although pierced by the Potomac, James, and Staunton
                    rivers, constitutes a well-marked and continuous chain of 260 miles in length.
                    In general it forms rounded, swelling masses, about 2000 feet above the level of
                    the sea, or about 1500 feet above the valleys at its eastern base; but the Peaks
                    of Otter shoot up in projecting summits to the height of 4260 feet. The
                    prolongation of the Kittutinny mountain of Pennsylvania, enters the state in
                    Morgan county, under the name of the Great Ridge, or North mountain, and passes
                    into North Carolina under the name of the Iron mountain. Its height is generally
                    from 2100 to 2500 feet, but the White Top peak reaches the height of 6000 feet.
                    The Great valley, which lies between these two ridges, sometimes called the
                    German valley, is a continuation of the Cumberland and Tulpehocken valleys of
                    Pennsylvania. Through this ridge the New river passes westward, and the James
                    and Potomac eastward. West of this are numerous mountain masses, which are
                    probably prolongations of those which traverse central Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>Every portion of Virginia is traversed by fine rivers and streams, useful either
                    as channels of navigation or for manufacturing purposes. The chief of these is
                    the main trunk of the Potomac, which has already been described under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Maryland.</hi> Its principal tributaries are from
                    this state. The Rappahannock rises on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, and is
                    navigable for small vessels to Fredericksburg, 110 miles. James river is by far
                    the largest and most important of the streams which have their whole course in
                    Virginia, and is not inferior to the Potomac and the Kanhawa in utility and the
                    varied beauties of its scenery. Rising in the Alleghany mountain. It first bears
                    the name of Jackson’s river, and after having received the Cow Pasture river, a
                    considerable stream. It takes the name of King James, passes through the
                    Kittutinny, and several other mountain chains, enters the great valley, and,
                    gathering the waters of that fruitful region, emerges from the Blue Ridge over
                    the Irish Falls. Above Richmond it descends by a fall of seventy feet, in the
                    distance of eight miles, into the low country. Below Richmond it gradually
                    becomes wider and deeper, and in the lower part of its course expands into a
                    long, spacious bay, with sufficient depth for the largest ships. Vessels of 600
                    tons ascend to City Point, seventy-five miles from the bay, although there are
                    some bars and shoals which obstruct the navigation; and vessels drawing fifteen
                    feet of water proceed thirty miles higher, to Warwick, which is within five
                    miles of Richmond, the capital of the state. The Blackwater, Nottoway, and
                    Meherrin, unite in North Carolina to form the Chowan, which enters Albemarle
                    sound. They are all navigable for small coasting vessels. The Great Renawha, and
                    the other rivers of the western section, all reach the Ohio.</p>
                <p>The geological formations of this vast region have as yet been but very partially
                    explored. The mineral wealth of Virginia is almost boundless; gold, copper,
                    lead, iron, coal, salt, limestone, marls, gypsum, magnesian, copperas, and alum
                    earths, excellent marbles, granites, soapstones, freestones, &amp;c., are among
                    its subterraneous treasures. The first coalfield is that of the primary region,
                    the extent of which has not been determined, but indications of coal have been
                    traced from the South Anna, near its mouth, to Prince Edward, south of the
                    Appomattax. The thickness of the coal-seams is very variable, ranging from four
                    or five to thirty, forty, and even sixty feet; the coal is bituminous, and of an
                    excellent quality. On the north branch of the Potomac there is a remarkable
                    bituminous coalfield. Upon a stratum of valuable iron-ore, not less than fifteen
                    feet in thickness, there rests a bed of sandstone, upon which reposes a
                    coal-seam three feet thick; upon this, another bed of sandstone, then a two feet
                    vein of coal; next sandstone, then another coal-seam of four feet; again a
                    stratum of sandstone, and over it a seven feet vein of coal; over this a heavy
                    bed of iron-ore, and crowning the series an enormous coal-seam from fifteen to
                    twenty feet in thickness. West of the Alleghany, there are some of the most
                    extensive and valuable deposits of coal in the world. At Wheeling, on the Ohio,
                    and for fourteen miles down the river, the bank presents an uninterrupted bed of
                    highly bituminous coal, upwards of sixteen feet thick. Salt springs occur in
                    various places. But the most important works are on the Great and Little
                    Kanawha. Gold is at present the most important of the metallic minerals of
                    Virginia. It occurs throughout a belt on the western side of the primary
                    district, stretching from beyond the Rappahannock to the Appomattax. Most of the
                    gold hitherto obtained has been procured by washings from the deposit-mines, but
                    several veins have yielded rich returns. In 1803, at Reid’s mine, a negro found
                    one lump that weighed twenty-eight pounds avoirdupois, worth eight thousand
                    dollars. The largest piece of gold in one mass, ever found in Europe, weighed
                    only twenty-two ounces; and this was found in Wicklow in Ireland. But the mines
                    in Virginia are neither extensively worked, nor fully developed. For several
                    years they have been left to the enterprise of the farmers, or owners of the
                    soil, who occupy themselves with mining when not engaged on their farms; and it
                    is calculated that the product of the mines in this section of the country, will
                    amount to about L.80,000 annually.</p>
                <p>Iron will probably at some future day prove to be a more precious deposit; but,
                    although the ore of several varieties is lavished in profusion on different
                    sections of the state, it is at present but little worked. Copper-ores are found
                    among the altered rocks cast of the Blue Ridge; and numerous openings have been
                    made in Orange, Amherst, Campbell, and Buckingham, for procuring the cupreous
                    rock, which at an early period was ground on the spot, and sent to England to be
                    smelted. Lead occurs in the southwestern part of the state, in the forms of the
                    sulphuret (galena) and carbonate, both of which are wrought, yielding a large
                    per centage of valuable metal.</p>
                <p>A continuous line of railway is nearly completed across the state, from the
                    Potomac to the Roanoke. The Richmond and Potomac railroad extends from Potomac
                    creek in Stafford, through Fredericksburg, to Richmond, seventy miles, having
                    been completed in 1836. Railroads and canals cross the state in every direction,
                    affording ready and convenient means of communication for all purposes.</p>
                <p>Agriculture has always been the chief occupation of the inhabitants, but not to
                    the exclusion of other branches of industry. “There is a great diversity in the
                    agriculture of the state, but it is seldom well managed. On both sides of the
                    Blue Ridge, maize, or Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, and buckwheat, are the
                    principal grain crops. Tobacco is the principal staple of most of eastern
                    Virginia, but in the valley it is cultivated only in the southern portion, and
                    not at all beyond the Alleghany. In the eastern and southern counties cotton is
                    planted to a considerable extent. On the shores of the Chesapeake, barley and
                    the castor oil bean are cultivated; and on some of the best lands above
                    tide-water, hemp is raised to advantage. The Trans-Alleghany county, being
                    exceedingly mountainous and remote<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=699" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0699-0659"/>
                    from market, is chiefly devoted to raising live stock. No more grain is raised
                    than is sufficient to supply the county itself. The culture of tobacco was begun
                    as early as 1616, and that plant soon formed the staple production of the
                    colony. During the latter half of the last century, the annual export amounted
                    to 60,000 or 70,000 hogsheads; of late years the amount produced in eastern
                    Virginia has fallen off considerably, on account of the exhaustion of much of
                    the land suited to this crop; but its cultivation has been much extended beyond
                    the Blue Ridge. The manufactures of Virginia are by no means inconsiderable in
                    value and extent, but they are not in general of the class which involves the
                    nicer and more complicated processes of art, consisting rather of those simpler
                    operations, which convert the native growth of the forest, the products of the
                    mineral kingdom, or the fruits of agricultural labour, into articles of home
                    consumption or commerce. The forests and the coal-beds furnish a cheap and easy
                    supply of fuel, and the numerous water-falls offer an almost unlimited motive
                    power for economical purposes; and within the last few years several cotton
                    mills have been erected for spinning and weaving, in which white operatives have
                    sought employment. The exports of Virginia consist chiefly of agricultural
                    products; lumber, salt, castor oil, ginseng, coal, gold, some furs, &amp;c. The
                    value of the direct exports to foreign countries in 1836, was 6,192,040 dollars,
                    but the internal American trade must exceed that sum. The imports from foreign
                    ports amounted in the same year to only 1,106,814; but Virginia receives her
                    supplies of manufactured goods and foreign productions chiefly from northern
                    ports. The fisheries of the Chesapeake and its tributaries are valuable. The
                    shipping owned in the state amounts to 50,000 tons.”</p>
                <p>The first white settlers in Virginia were English; and the emigration from
                    England continued to be pretty active during a great part of the seventeenth
                    century, particularly from the time of the civil wars to the Restoration, in
                    1660, and toward the close of the century, both before and after the Revolution.
                    Many victims of the political disturbances of those periods were also sent to
                    Virginia as servants; and the captives at Worcester, the followers of Penruddoc,
                    the Irish catholics, and the soldiers of the duke of Monmouth, were sold into
                    servitude in the colony. In the following century, many German emigrants,
                    chiefly from Maryland and Pennsylvania, occupied the valley in the rear of the
                    Blue Ridge, which thence received the name of the German Valley; and in the more
                    western part of the state, great numbers of Irish settlers fixed themselves; and
                    some felons were transported to Virginia, as to other colonies. Negroes and
                    mulattose constitute a large proportion of the population of Virginia, and these
                    are mostly field in slavery. The first negroes were brought into the harbours of
                    the Chesapeake by a Dutch ship in 1620, when twenty were sold to the colonists;
                    but the importation was for a long time so inconsiderable, that at the end of
                    fifty years their number was only 2000. The inhabitants indeed endeavoured to
                    discourage the traffic, and the Assembly made repeated attempts to prevent the
                    further introduction of negroes, but failed in obtaining the requisite sanction
                    of the crown; and up to the time of the revolution-war, from 5000 to 6000 were
                    annually brought into the province by the English slave-traders. It is one of
                    the grievances recited in the constitution of 1776, and reaffirmed in the new
                    instrument adopted in 1830, that George III. had prompted the rising in arms of
                    “those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he had refused us
                    permission to exclude by law ;” and in 1778 the new state prohibited their
                    importation under heavy penalties. The existing black population of Virginia is
                    probably altogether native.</p>

                <p>Besides the loss of population, occasioned by the removal of free labourers and
                    of planters with their forces, the sale and exportation of slaves to other
                    states have been a constant drain to this class of the population, especially
                    during the last ten years. Virginia has the unenviable distinction of being a
                    slave-breeding state, not only supporting slavery within its own limits, but
                    contributing to extend it in other states of the Union. This unnatural and
                    disgusting trade must infallibly demoralize both the white and coloured
                    population; and as a proof of the suffering which it entails upon its wretched
                    victims, no less a sum than 14,412 dollars is stated in the account of the
                    public expenditure of the state for 1833 for <hi rend="italic">transported and
                    executed slaves;</hi> while the next item, the public guard, amounts only to
                    19,225 dollars.</p>
                <p>A few families of Indians of the Nottoway tribe, a branch of the great Iroquois
                    family, are still found on the river of that name, but they have lost the
                    language of their fathers, and have become much mixed with negroes. Of the
                    thirty Powhatan clans found here by the first colonists, not one is believed to
                    survive.</p>
                <p>Richmond, the capital of the state, and its principal city, is pleasantly
                    situated on the left bank of the James, below the lower falls, standing on
                    several eminences, which command fine views of the surrounding country, and give
                    to the city an air of singular beauty. Richmond was declared the capital of the
                    state in 1779, and incorporated as a city in 1782, when however it was merely a
                    small village. In 1800 the population was 5,737, and in 1830 it was 16,060, more
                    than one half blacks; at present, inclusive of Manchester, which is united with
                    it by a bridge, it exceeds 20,000. Richmond is 110 miles from the mouth of the
                    river, which carries fourteen feet of water to Warwick, five miles below the
                    city, and is navigable for boats 220 miles above the falls.</p>
                <p>Such was the state of education in the colony, that one of the early governors
                    thanked God that there were no free schools or printing in Virginia. In 1796, an
                    act was passed for the establishment of primary schools; but in 1809 the
                    governor complained that the law had in no instance been complied with. In that
                    year a literary fund was created by the appropriation of fines, escheats, and
                    forfeitures, to this object; and the money received by the state from the
                    federal government in 1816, for military services rendered during the late war,
                    was afterwards appropriated to the same purpose. In 1833 the fund amounted to
                    1,551,837 dollars, and the income to 78,340 dollars. In 1817 a permanent
                    appropriation was made of 45,000 dollars a-year from this revenue, to be
                    distributed among the several counties and towns, in proportion to their free
                    white population, for the instruction of poor children, and an additional sum
                    was granted for the same object in 1836. In 1833, by returns from one hundred
                    counties, there were 2833 common schools, attended by 17,081 poor children. In
                    order to extend the benefits of this system to all classes of whites, the
                    school-commissioners of any county are authorised to lay off the county into
                    school-districts, and, whenever any district shall have raised three-fifths of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=700"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0700-0660"/>sum necessary to build a school-house, to
                    contribute the remaining two-fifths. They are also empowered to pay a sum not
                    exceeding one hundred dollars towards a teacher’s salary, provided the
                    inhabitants of the district contribute an equal sum towards the same object; and
                    every white child in such district is to be gratuitously taught in such school.
                    There are about fifty-five academies in the state. The higher educational
                    institutions are the university of Virginia at Charlottesville; the college of
                    William and Mary at Williamsburg; Washington college at Lexington, Bockbridge
                    county; Hampden-Sydney college in Prince Edward county; Randolph-Macon college
                    at Boydton, Mecklenburg county; the Union theological seminary in Prince Edward
                    county; the Episcopal theological seminary near Alexandria; and the Virginia
                    Baptist seminary near Richmond. In 1839 there were fifty-two newspapers
                    published in Virginia.</p>
                <p>The legislature, styled the General Assembly, consists of two houses; a house of
                    delegates of 134 members, chosen annually; and a senate of thirty-two members,
                    chosen for the term of thirty-four years. Senators and delegates must be
                    resident freeholders; the latter of the age of twenty-five years, the former of
                    thirty. All laws must originate in the house of delegates. The governor and the
                    council of state, of three members, are chosen by the joint vote of both houses
                    of the assembly, for the term of three years, the senior councillor being
                    lieutenant-governor. The superior judges are chosen by the same bodies, and hold
                    office during good behaviour. The justices of the peace are appointed by the
                    governor on nomination, by the existing justices of the respective counties, and
                    one of their number performs the duties of sheriff. A small property
                    qualification is required to confer the right of suffrage on white male
                    citizens; and at all elections “the votes must be given openly, or <hi
                    rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> and not by ballot.”</p>
                <p>The revenue of the state for the year 1834, was 403,335 dollars, of which 291,581
                    dollars were derived from taxes on land, slaves, horses, and carriages, and
                    101,283 from licences, making, with the balance of 185,221 dollars in the
                    treasury at the close of 1833, a total of 588,556 dollars. The expenditure,
                    during the same year, amounted to 472,337 dollars; some of the principal items,
                    exclusive of payments from literary and other funds, being as follows:</p>
