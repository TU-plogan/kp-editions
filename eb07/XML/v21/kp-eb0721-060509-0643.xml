                    St. Albans, and Baron Verulam.</hi> This illustrious man was born in London, on
                    the 22d day of January 1561. His father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, a courtier, a
                    lawyer, and a man of erudition, stood high in the favour of Queen Elizabeth, and
                    was lord-keeper during twenty years of her reign. Anne, the second wife of Sir
                    Nicholas, and the philosopher’s mother, was the daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke,
                    Edward the Sixth’s tutor, and was herself distinguished among the learned
                    females of the time. One of her sisters became the wife of Elizabeth’s
                    celebrated treasurer, Lord Burleigh. Delicate in health, and devoted to
                    sedentary employment, Francis Bacon exhibited in early boyhood the dawning of
                    those powers whose versatility afterwards became not less remarkable than their
                    strength. As a child he delighted the queen with his precocious gravity and
                    readiness of speech; and before he had completed his twelfth year we see him
                    investigating the cause of a singular echo in a conduit, and endeavouring to
                    penetrate the mystery of a juggler who performed in his father’s house. At the
                    age of thirteen he was matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which
                    Whitgift was then master; but his residence at the university lasted scarcely
                    three years, and his writings contain many expressions of dissatisfaction with
                    the current system of academical education. In his sixteenth year he was sent
                    abroad, and lived for some time at Paris, under the charge of the English
                    ambassador, Sir Amias Paulett; after which he visited the French provinces, and
                    added to his literary and philosophical studies an acquaintance with foreign
                    policy and statistics, the fruit of which soon appeared in his tract upon the
                    State of Europe. In February 1580, his father died, and he immediately returned
                    to England.</p>

                <p>Sir Nicholas left but a scanty fortune; and his son Francis, the youngest of a
                    large family, found himself obliged, in his twentieth year, to devise the means
                    of earning a livelihood. One would have thought powerful friends could not have
                    been wanting to one who, besides his own acknowledged merit, had it in his power
                    to urge the long and honourable services of his father, while his uncle was the
                    prime minister of the kingdom. Of the patronage which thus seemed to be at his
                    command, Bacon attempted to avail himself, desiring to obtain such a public
                    employment as might enable him to unite political activity in some degree with
                    literary study. But his suit was received neglectfully by the queen, and harshly
                    repulsed by his kinsman. Although all the causes of this conduct may not be
                    discoverable, a few lie at the surface. The lord-keeper had, in the later years
                    of his life, lost the royal favour. Burleigh, besides his notorious contempt for
                    men of letters, had to provide for sons of his own, to whom their accomplished
                    cousin might have proved a dangerous rival. From the Cecils, indeed, Bacon never
                    derived any efficient aid, till he had forced his way upwards in spite of them;
                    and there arc evident traces of jealousy and dislike in the mode in which he was
                    treated both by the old treasurer, and by his second son, Robert</p>
                <p>Obliged therefore to betake himself to the law, Bacon was admitted at Gray’s Inn,
                    where he spent several years obscurely in the study of his profession, but with
                    increasing practice at the bar. The friendship of his fellow lawyers, earned by
                    his amiable disposition and his activity in the affairs of the society, bestowed
                    on him offices in his inn of court; but his kinsmen were still cold and haughty.
                    Lord Burleigh continued to write him letters of reproof; and Robert Cecil,
                    already a rising statesman, sneered at speculative intellects, and insinuated
                    their unfitness for the business of life. In 1590, when Bacon was in his
                    thirtieth year, he was visited for the first time with court-favour, receiving
                    then an honorary appointment as queen’s counsel extraordinary; and to this was
                    added a grant of the reversion of a clerkship in the star-chamber, which did not
                    become vacant for eighteen years. But the lawyer’s heart was not in his task.
                    His brilliant professional success, and the awakening friendship of his
                    relations, merely suggested to him renewed attempts to escape from the drudgery
                    of the bar. His views are nobly expressed in a letter which he addressed to the
                    lord-treasurer the year after his appointment.<note anchored="true"

                    years is a great deal of sand ill the hour-glass. My health, I thank God, I find
                    confirmed, and I do not fear that action shall impair it; because I account my
                    ordinary course of study and meditation to be more painful than most parts of
                    action are· I ever bear a mind, in some middle place that I could discharge, to
                    serve her majesty; not as a man born under Sol that loveth honour, nor under
                    Jupiter that loveth business, for the contemplative planet carrieth me away
                    wholly; but as a man born under an excellent sovereign, that deserveth the
                    dedication of all men’s abilities. . . . Again, the meanness of my estate doth
                    somewhat move me; for, though I cannot accuse myself that I am either prodigal
                    or slothful, yet my health is not to spend, nor my course to get. Lastly, I
                    confess that I have as vast contemplative ends, as I have moderate civil ends;
                    <hi rend="italic">for I haut taken all knowledge to be my province;</hi> and, if
                    I could purge it of two sorts of rovers,—whereof the one with frivolous
                    disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the other with blind experiments,
                    and auricular traditions and impostures, have committed so many spoils,—I hope I
                    should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable
                    inventions and discoveries; the best state of that province. This, whether it be
                    curiosity, or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take it more favourably)
                    philanthropia, is so fixed in my mind, as it cannot be removed. . . . <hi

                    edit.)</p></note> We linger with melancholy pleasure over these abortive efforts
                    made by one of the finest and most capacious of intellects to extricate itself
                    from that labyrinth of worldly turmoil, in which its owner was destined to
                    purchase rank and splendour at the expense of moral degradation and final
                    ruin.</p>
                <p>We are henceforth to behold Bacon actively engaged in political life, as well as
                    in the duties of his profession. Two parties then divided the court, equally
                    remarkable in different ways on account of those who headed them. Burleigh was
                    the chief of the queen’s old counsellors, on whom, amidst all her caprices, she
                    always had the prudence to rely for the real business of the state: the young
                    and gay, those who aspired to be ranked as the personal friends or adorers of
                    the withered sovereign of hearts, were led by the high-spirited and imprudent
                    Earl of Essex. To the party of this nobleman Bacon decidedly attached himself,
                    and soon indeed shared with his own elder brother Anthony, the earl’s most
                    private confidence. Valuable advisers were they to their rash patron; and a
                    valuable servant of the nation did Francis Bacon bid fair to become, when, in
                    November 1592, he entered parliament as one of the knights of the shire for
                    Middlesex. His first speech, in February following, contained an urgent pleading
                    for improvements in the law; in another address, delivered in March, he
                    resisted, with exceeding boldness as well as force of reason, the immediate
                    levying of an unpopular subsidy to which the House had already consented. The
                    young lawyer’s exposition of unpleasant truths gave deep offence to the queen.
                    His uncle and the lord-keeper were both commissioned to convey to him the
                    assurance of the royal displeasure; and the two humble, nay, crouching letters
                    of apology, still extant, in which he entreated those ministers to procure his
                    pardon, did not forebode much independence in his subsequent conduct. We do not,
                    indeed, again hear Bacon named as a champion of popular rights.</p>
                <p>In the year 1594, Sir Edward Coke being made attorney-gencral, the solicitorship
                    became vacant; and Bacon’s application for the office was strenuously supported
                    by Essex. But all efforts were in vain. The powerful kinsmen were colder than
                    ever towards one who had chosen another patron. The lord-keeper, Puckering,
                    acted in a manner which drew on him a spirited rebuke from the candidate. The
                    queen hesitated, coquetted, told Essex that his friend, though witty, eloquent,
                    and in some branches learned, was a showy lawyer rather than a profound one.
                    After a delay of many months, the place was given to a plodding serjeant; and
                    Bacon’s generous patron, vexed at the disappointment of his hopes, sought to
                    console both him and himself by a gift equally munificent and delicate. Bacon
                    received from him an estate at Twickenham, worth about eighteen hundred pounds.
                    The present, in all likelihood, came very seasonably; for he appears to have
                    been already involved in those pecuniary embarrassments from which he was never
                    afterwards completely able to extricate himself. He was obliged to sell the land
                    which Essex had given him; two years later he was arrested in the street for a
                    debt of three hundred pounds; and among the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere’s papers,
                    recently published, there is a curious acknowledgment, granted in 1604, for a
                    pledge in security of an advance of fifty pounds to him. These reasons offer the
                    only apology for the addresses which, about the time of his arrest, he paid to a
                    wealthy and shrewish widow, who, fortunately for him, preferred his professional
                    brother and personal enemy, Sir Edward Coke. In the meantime, his legal
                    reputation continued to increase, and his parliamentary exertions were
                    unremitted, though altogether free from that independence which had once
                    characterized them. We thus trace Bacon down to his thirty-ninth<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=645" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0645-0607"/>
                    year, pausing only to remark, that two years earlier, that is, in 1597, his
                    celebrated Essays were first published. Although merely the skeleton of what
                    they afterwards became, these compositions gained high reputation for their
                    author, not only at home, but also on the continent.</p>
                <p>After this, the first step in Bacon’s literary career, we approach what is the
                    most painful task of his biographer, a dark page of his history, over which no
                    ingenuity has ever been able to throw a veil thick enough to disguise its
                    foulness. We have seen him the friend, the adviser, the grateful vassal of
                    Essex; we are now to behold him deserting his benefactor, assisting to destroy
                    him, standing forth in the face of the world as his enemy and accuser. The
                    philosopher’s latest biographer has pronounced his conduct in this matter to be
                    honourable and praiseworthy; and to his pages we must refer those who are
                    curious to canvass arguments of which we are ourselves unable to discover the
                    force. Bacon, unfortunately for himself, had lately risen much in royal favour,
                    and been greatly trusted and employed. Accordingly, in the first stages of
                    Essex’s decline, he had to act a double part,—now offering to his patron advices
                    which were but seldom followed, now seeking excuses to pacify the queen’s rising
                    displeasure. His natural inclination for temporizing, the success which had
                    hitherto attended his cautious policy, the honest wish to serve his generous
                    friend,— all these reasons may have concurred in tempting him to embark in the
                    dangerous channel. But the sunken rocks soon encompassed him, and shipwreck was
                    unavoidable. Alienation either from Elizabeth or from Essex speedily appeared to
                    be the necessary result of the position into which the parties were coming.
                    Bacon had not the courage to take the nobler part, and place himself by the side
                    of his falling friend, at the probable expense of all his worldly prospects.
                    Suspicion and estrangement soon took the place of affectionate confidence; and
                    the trust reposed in him by the queen was purchased by the bitter consciousness
                    that Essex regarded him as treacherous and hostile. A more degrading task was
                    yet to come The first trial of the earl, in reference to his conduct in Ireland,
                    was determined upon; and Bacon’s enemies asserted that he offered himself to act
                    as one of the counsel for the prosecution. In that memoir in defence of his
                    conduct which he wrote in the next reign, and which proves satisfactorily
                    nothing but his own humiliating consciousness of guilt, he states as to this
                    matter what was doubtless the truth. It had been resolved that the proceedings
                    against the rash earl should not be carried out to his destruction, but should
                    only disarm and discourage him; and, a hint being conveyed to Bacon that the
                    queen had not determined whether he should be employed professionally in the
                    affair or not, he thought proper to address to her “two or three words of
                    compliment,” intimating that if she would dispense with his services he would
                    consider it as one of her greatest favours, but that otherwise he knew his duty,
                    and would not allow any private obligations to interfere with what he owed to
                    her majesty. All this was, he adds, “a respect no man that had his wits could
                    have omitted.” Bacon, in short, still wished to serve two masters; but he had
                    now placed himself at the mercy of those from whom he had no forbearance to
                    expect. The queen, suspicious and moody, was jealous of his attachment to Essex,
                    and bent on compelling him to do het service unreservedly: her advisers, or some
                    of them, were glad to have the odium of the earl’s destruction shared with them
                    by one so distinguished, who had. likewise, been the victim’s friend. It was
                    intimated that Bacon’s services could not be dispensed with; but he tells us,
                    (and he probably repeats only what his masters tried to make him believe), that
                    it was resolved his share in the prosecution should be confined to matters which
                    could not do his unfortunate patron any serious harm. Essex’s private censure by
                    the privy-council followed; and, while he was committed to custody-at-large,
                    Bacon incurred, by his appearance against him, an obloquy of which his letters
                    show him to have been painfully sensible. In a few months the earl’s open
                    rebellion took place; he was seized, and put upon his trial in February 1601,
                    along with Lord Southampton; and on this occasion, when his life was at stake,
                    Bacon again appeared as one of the counsel for the prosecution, and delivered a
                    speech of which there is extant an imperfect account. The language is harsh, but
                    less so than addresses of the kind used to be in those days. The topics are
                    oratorical, and, as it has been justly remarked, are less calculated for
                    ensuring conviction (which indeed was certain) than for placing the conduct of
                    the prisoner in an odious light, and hardening the queen’s heart against him;
                    and, although it would be rash to judge of the real temper of the harangue
                    without knowing more of its contents, yet what we possess contains much that
                    cannot possibly be explained so as to do credit to the speaker. We know,
                    likewise, how the object of the attack received it. At one place Essex
                    interrupted his treacherous friend, and called upon him to say, as a witness,
                    whether he had not, in their confidential intercourse, admitted the truth of
                    those excuses which he now affected to treat as frivolous and false. Essex was
                    convicted; and between his sentence and execution, Bacon admits in his
                    exculpatory memoir that he made no attempt to save him; seeing the queen but
                    once, as he says, and on that occasion venturing to do nothing further than
                    pronouncing a few common-places on the blessed uses of mercy. But not even here
                    was the disgrace to end, in which the timid man of the world had steeped
                    himself. The act which had cost Elizabeth’s own heart so much, had also made her
                    unpopular; a defence of the royal policy in regard to Essex was thought
                    necessary, and the pen that drew it up, under the direction of the queen’s
                    advisers, was, we are grieved to find, no other than Bacon’s. The “Declaration
                    of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert Earl of Essex,”
                    was printed, and is extant: “a performance,” says a late writer, “in defence of
                    which, in the succeeding reign, Bacon had not a word to say; a performance
                    abounding in expressions which no generous enemy would have employed respecting
                    a man who had so dearly expiated his offences.” With this humiliating act of
                    service we may consider Bacon’s public life under Elizabeth as closed.</p>
                <p>The reign of her successor was, from its commencement, a more auspicious era for
                    men of letters and philosophy, with whom James, amidst all his imbecility and
                    cold-heart-edness, was not by any means ill fitted to sympathise. Bacon’s
                    learning was no longer open to sneers and contempt; his uncle was dead; his
                    hunchback cousin, Robert Cecil, who soon became Earl of Salisbury, was kept in
                    check by his hereditary prudence; and Coke, who had insulted our philosophic
                    lawyer grossly, as he insulted every one who was defenceless and Within his
                    reach, was in a few years removed to the head of the court of common pleas. From
                    the first hour of James’s reign, Bacon lost no opportunity of recommending
                    himself to favour; but the first mark of it which he received, was orte of which
                    he neither was nor could have been proud, and which, nevertheless, he thought
                    proper to solicit. When the king called upon all persons possessing forty pounds
                    a year in land to be knighted, or to compound for a dispensation from the
                    honour, one effect of this scheme for filling the royal coffers was, that three
                    members of Bacon’s mess at Gray’s Inn appeared among the new knights. That love
                    of external distinctions which was the fatal weakness of his nature, was called
                    into play, and the philosopher was disconcerted by the titles of his companions,
                    beside whom he sat untitled. At the same time, likewise, he had, in his own
                    words, “found out an alderman’s daughter, a handsome maiden, to his liking and
                    the alderman’s daughter was likely to be more easily won if her admirer could
                    offer her <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=646"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0646-0608"/>a showy accession of rank. Accordingly, Bacon
                    wrote to his cousin Cecil, stating his desire to obtain, for these reasons,
                    “this divulged and almost prostituted title of knighthood." The request was
                    granted, but was immediately followed by another. Bacon, heartily ashamed of the
                    company in which he was to appear, entreated that he might be knighted alone;
                    “that,” as he says, “the manner might be such as might grace one, since the
                    matter will not.” This petition was refused; and, on the day of the coronation,
                    Francis Bacon was one of three hundred who received the empty honour. Soon
                    afterwards, being forty-two years old, he was married to the alderman’s
                    daughter, Alice Barnham, who brought him a considerable fortune, but seems, in
                    the latter part of his life at all events, to have contributed little to his
                    domestic happiness.</p>
                <p>These details are in themselves trifles; but they are strange illustrations of
                    the mixed character of one who, while thus soliciting honours of which he was
                    half-ashamed, and eager for public distinctions, which, though more solid, were
                    likewise more dangerous, was not only respected and distinguished as a lawyer
                    and a statesman, as an orator, a scholar, and an author, but was occupied,
                    during his few hours of leisure, in completing the most valuable system of
                    philosophy that has ever been expounded in modern Europe. Smaller compositions,
                    submitted to his friends, showed from time to time the progress of the great
                    work which he had marked out as the business of his life; and among these was
                    the treatise on the Advancement of Learning, published in 1605, in its author’s
                    forty-fifth year. Political tracts alternated with these philosophical
                    speculations.</p>
                <p>In the mean time his public reputation, and his favour with the king, increased
                    and kept pace with each other. In parliament he was actively useful in
                    forwarding favourite and really good measures of the court, such as the union of
                    England and Scotland, and the proposed consolidation of the laws of the two
                    countries; nor was he less usefully employed in taking a prominent part in the
                    select committee of the house upon grievances. In his skilful hands, the report
                    became all that the rulers could have wished, without exciting any general
                    feeling against the framers. In 1604, he was made king’s counsel in ordinary,
                    with a salary of forty pounds, to which was added a pension of sixty pounds. In
                    1607, upon Coke’s promotion to the bench, Bacon was appointed solicitor-general;
                    and he became attorney-general in 1612. His treatises concerning improvements in
                    the law, and the principles of legislation, are more creditable testimonies to
                    the value of his official services than some others of his acts; such as the
                    scheme, first tried in the session of 1614, for securing majorities in the House
                    of Commons by organised corruption, the invention of which has been recently
                    traced to him, although in his place in parliament he ridiculed those who
                    asserted that such a project bad ever been formed. Bacon was likewise officially
                    the prosecutor of Oliver St. John, of Owen and Talbot, and of the old clergyman
                    Peacham, who was examined in the Tower under torture, the founder of modern
                    philosophy being present, and putting the questions. In Peacham’s case there was
                    even an attempt, actively promoted by Bacon, for securing a conviction by
                    previous conference with the judges; a plot which, though at length successful,
                    was defeated for a time by the sturdy resistance of Coke, a tyrant to his
                    inferiors, but a staunch opponent of encroachments upon judicial independence.
                    Bacon’s last remarkable appearance as attorney-general, was in the noted trial
                    of the earl and countess of Somerset and their accomplices, for the murder of
                    Sir Thomas Overbury; and, whatever the foul secret may have been, which was
                    involved in that fiendish intrigue, Bacon’s letters to the king leave little
                    reason for doubting that he at least was in possession of it. His conduct in
                    this matter however gained him great and deserved credit.</p>
                <p>The fall of Somerset was followed by the rise of the new favourite Villiers, who
                    had already profited by his intimacy with the attorney-general, and by the sound
                    advices with which the cautious statesman endeavoured to fortify his youth and
                    inexperience. The worthless Buckingham, destined in a few years to be the
                    instrument of retribution for Bacon’s past desertion of Essex, did not for some
                    time forget obligations, of which he was probably wise enough to desire a
                    continuance. In 1616 Bacon having been sworn of the privy council, relinquished
                    the bar, but retained his chamber practice. In the spring of 1617, the Lord
                    Chancellor Ellesmere resigned the seals, which were immediately delivered to
                    Bacon, with the title of lord-keeper. In January of the succeeding year he was
                    made lord high chancellor of England, and in July was raised to the peerage as
                    Baron of Verulam. His higher title of Viscount St. Albans was not conferred on
                    him till 1621. Without neglecting his political duties, he proceeded zealously
                    to the judicial functions of his office, in which arrears of business had
                    accumulated through the infirmities of his aged predecessor. “This day,” wrote
                    he to Buckingham in June 1617, “I have made even with the business of the
                    kingdom for common justice; not one cause unheard; the lawyers drawn dry of all
                    the motions they were to make; not one petition unanswered. And this, I think,
                    could not be said in our age before. Thus I speak, not out of ostentation, but
                    out of gladness, when I have done my duty. I know men think I cannot continue,
                    if I should thus oppress myself with business; but that account is made. The
                    duties of life are more than life: and if I die now, I shall die before the
                    world be weary of me.” And the man who wrote in this solemn moral strain, the
                    man whose writings throughout are an echo of the same lofty expression of the
                    sense of duty, was also the man who, in less than four years after his elevation
                    to the seat of justice, was to be hurled from it in disgrace, branded as a
                    bribed and dishonest man. “At York House,” says Mr. Montagu, “on the 22d of
                    January 1621, he celebrated his sixtieth birthday, surrounded by his admirers
                    and friends, among whom was Ben Jonson, who composed a poem in honour of the
                    day.</p>
                <p>Hail, happy genius of this ancient pile!</p>
                <p>How comes it all things so about thee smile— The fire, the wine, the men—and in
                    the midst Thou stand’st, as if some mystery thou didst?</p>
                <p>“Had the poet been a prophet, he would have described the good genius of the
                    mansion not exulting, but dejected, humble, and about to depart for ever.”</p>
                <p>He had now arrived at the conviction that his worship of the powers of this world
                    had made it impossible for him to consummate the great sacrifice, which, during
                    his lifetime, he had hoped to lay upon the altar of philosophy. Aged sixty
                    years, and immersed in difficult and anxious business, he felt that his great
                    Restoration of Science, his Instauratio Magna, could not be completed; and he
                    therefore hastened to give to the world an outline of its plan, coupled with a
                    filling up of one section of the outline. “I number my days,” wrote he, “and
                    would have it saved.” The Novum Organum, the result of this determination, was
                    published in October 1620; and the fame which it earned for its author
                    throughout Europe, was in its rising splendour when his fall took place.</p>
                <p>The tempest which was soon to overturn the throne was already lowering on the
                    horizon; and its earliest mutterings were heard in the important parliament
                    which met on the 30th of January 1621. With most of the complaints, whose
                    investigation the king and Buckingham feared so much, we have here little to do:
                    but two gross abuses there were, in which the lord chancellor was personally
                    implicated. He had passed the infamous patents of monopoly, of which the worst
                    were those held by Sir Giles Mompesson, (Massinger’s Overreach,) and by Sir
                    Francis Michell, and shared by Buckingham’s brothers and dependents: and he had
                    allowed himself to be influenced in his judicial sentences by re <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=647" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0647-0609"
                    />commendations of the favourite. The first of these faults admitted of
                    palliation, the second was susceptible of none; but both were real and heavy
                    offences. Yet neither of them was made an article of charge against Bacon. He
                    was attacked upon a different ground. Buckingham, by the advice of his new
                    counsellor Williams, then dean of Westminster, abandoned the monopolists to
                    their fate, contenting himself with sending his own brothers out of the country,
                    and with afterwards publicly denying that he had any hand in assisting their
                    escape. But the storm was not allayed. In March, the parliamentary committee
                    appointed to inquire into the existence of abuses in the courts of justice,
                    reported that abuses did exist, and that the person against whom they were
                    alleged, was the lord chancellor himself. Two cases were specified, of suitors
                    named Aubrey and Egerton, of whom the one had given the chancellor L.100, the
                    other L.400, and against whom he had decided, notwithstanding these presents.
                    Two days after this report was presented, Lord St. Albans presided in the House
                    of Lords for the last time. New accusations accumulated against him; and,
                    alarmed in mind, and sick in body, he retired from the house, and addressed to
                    the peers a letter, praying for a suspension of their opinion, until he should
                    have undergone a fair trial. In no long time the charges against him amounted to
                    twenty-three; and Williams, again called to the councils of Buckingham and his
                    master, advised that no risks should be incurred upon his account. A prorogation
                    of parliament ensued, during which an interview took place between the king and
                    the chancellor; and James, instead of encouraging his accused servant in the
                    resolution he had expressed of defending himself, recommended “that he should
                    submit himself to the House of Peers, and that upon his princely word he would
                    then restore him again, if they in their honours should not be sensible of his
                    merits.” On the 24th of April there was presented to the Lords, by the Prince of
                    Wales, a supplication and submission of the lord chancellor, in which the most
                    important passage is the following: “It resteth, therefore, that, without
                    fig-leaves, I do ingenuously confess and acknowledge that, having understood the
                    particulars of the charge, not formally from the house, but enough to inform my
                    conscience and memory, I find matter sufficient and full, both to move me to
                    desert my defence, and to move your lordships to condemn and censure me. Neither
                    will I trouble your lordships by singling those particulars, which I think may
                    fall off.</p>
                <p>Quid to exempts juvat spinis de pluribus una?</p>
                <p>Neither will I prompt your lordships to observe upon the proofs, where they come
                    not home, or the scruples touching the credits of the witnesses: neither will I
                    represent unto your lordships how far a defence might, in diverse things,
                    extenuate the offence, in respect of the time or manner of the gift, or the like
                    circumstances; but only leave these things to spring out of your own noble
                    thoughts, and observations of the evidence and examinations themselves, and
                    charitably to wind about the particulars of the charge here and there, as God
                    shall put in your minds; and so submit myself wholly to your piety and grace
                    And, there fore, my humble suit to your lordships is, that my penitent
                    submission may be my sentence, and the loss of the seal my punishment; and that
                    your lordships will spare any further sentence, but recommend me to his
                    majesty’s grace and pardon for all that is past.” But not even thus was the
                    humiliation complete. The house resolved that the submission was not specific,
                    nor unequivocal enough to be satisfactory; and that he should be required to
                    furnish categorical answers to the several articles of charge, which,
                    accordingly, were sent to him, being numbered under twenty-three heads. The
                    specific answers which he returned were prefaced and followed by these
                    declarations: “Upon advised consideration of the charge, descending into my own
                    conscience, and call ing my memory to account, so far as I am able, I do plainly
                    and ingenuously confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do renounce all
                    defence, and put myself upon the grace and mercy of your lordships This
                    declaration I have made to your lordships with a sincere mind; humbly craving
                    that, if there should be any mistakes, your lordships would impute it to want of
                    memory, and not to any desire of mine to obscure truth, or palliate anything.
                    For I do again confess, that in the points charged upon me, although they should
                    be taken as myself have declared them, there is a great deal of corruption and
                    neglect, for which I am heartily and penitently sorrow, and submit myself to the
                    judgment, grace, and mercy of the court.—For extenuation, I will use none,
                    concerning the matters themselves: only it may please your lordships, out of
                    your nobleness, to cast your eyes of compassion upon my person and estate. I was
                    never noted for an avaricious man, and the apostle saith, that covetousness is
                    the root of all evil. I hope also that your lordships do the rather find me in
                    the state of grace; tor that, in all these particulars, there are few or none
                    that are not almost two years old, whereas those that have an habit of
                    corruption do commonly wax worse and worse; so that it hath pleased God to
                    prepare me, by precedent degrees of amendment, to my present penitency. And for
                    my estate. It is so mean and poor, as my care is now chiefly to satisfy my
                    debts.”</p>
                <p>This declaration being read, a deputation of the lords was appointed to wait on
                    the unfortunate man in the chamber where he sat deserted and alone, and to
                    demand whether it were his own hand that was subscribed to it. Among them was
                    Shakspeare’s friend Lord Southampton, who had been condemned to death along with
                    Essex. Bacon replied to them, “It is my act, my hand, my heart. I beseech your
                    lordships, be merciful unto a broken reed.” Again the fallen judge prayed the
                    king to intercede for him; and again the king, his haughty son, and their
                    thankless favourite, refused to interfere. On the 3d of May 1621, the lords
                    pronounced a sentence which, stamping him at all events with indelible disgrace,
                    was terrible even in the punishment which it actually inflicted. Bacon, found
                    guilty upon his own confession, was sentenced to a fine of forty thousand
                    pounds, and to confinement in the Tower during the king’s pleasure; he was
                    pronounced incapable of public employments, and of sitting in parliament; and
                    prohibited from coming within the verge of the court. His judges indeed knew
                    that the harsher part of the sentence would not be executed. Accordingly, though
                    committed immediately to the Tower, he was released after two days’
                    imprisonment; and the fine was remitted in the course of the autumn, although it
                    is a fact dishonourable (in the circumstances) to his enemy and successor Bishop
                    Williams, that the pardon was stayed at the seal, till the king in person
                    ordered it to be passed.</p>
                <p>From the whole tenor of this afflicting history. It is plain that Bacon’s memory
                    cannot be cleared from very heavy imputations. Indeed, the case against him may
                    be stated, if we push it to the utmoβt, in an alternative form which admits of
                    no honourable solution. Convicted of corruption, as he was, upon his own
                    confession, we must either believe the confession, and pronounce him a corrupt
                    judge, or we must disbelieve it, and pronounce him a liar. Most of his
                    biographers adopt the former alternative. Mr. Montagu’s elaborate defence is
                    really founded on something which is not very far distant from the latter. And,
                    humiliating as either supposition is, we have, for our own part, no hesitation
                    in believing that the truth lies nearest to that theory which imputes to the
                    unhappy chancellor insincerity and cowardice rather than wilful corruption. We
                    cannot indeed go so far as his enthusiastic biographer, who insists that the
                    acts charged and confessed, were in themselves, if not quite free from moral
                    blame, yet palliated, not only by general usage, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=648" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0648-0610"
                    />but by intentions strictly honest;—that he was sacrificed by the king and the
                    king’s minion, although, if he had stood a trial, he could have obtained a full
                    acquittal. This, we must venture to think, is a position which, if maintained to
                    its whole extent, cannot be even plausibly defended. Neither, as we must also
                    believe, is justice done by that other view, which has been stated more recently
                    with such force and eloquence, that the case was one of gross bribery, gross and
                    glaring even when compared with the ordinary course of corruption in these
                    times; a case so bad, that the court, anxious, for their own sakes, to save the
                    culprit, dared not to utter a word in extenuation.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The fact which possesses the greatest importance for the elucidation of this
                    unfortunate story, is that which has been founded on so elaborately by Mr.
                    Montagu, and lately illustrated further by another writer for a different
                    purpose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh
                    Review, No. 143, p. 38, 39. Life of Raleigh.</p></note> The custom of giving
                    presents was then general, not to say universal, in England. It extended much
                    farther than the <hi rend="italic">épices</hi> of the French parliaments; for
                    the gifts were not fixed in amount, nor, though always expected, were they
                    recognised as lawful perquisites. The advisers of the crown received presents
                    from those who asked for favours: the sovereign received presents from those who
                    approached the throne on occasions of pomp and festivity. Both these
                    improprieties were not only universal but unchallenged. Further, judges received
                    presents; and under certain conditions,—when, for instance, the giver had not
                    been, and was not likely to be, a suitor in the judge’s court, or even when,
                    though he had been a suitor, the cause was ended,—this dangerous abuse was
                    scarcely less common than the other, and scarcely regarded in a more
                    unfavourable light. That it was wrong, all men felt; but we fear there were few
                    indeed, who, like Sir Thomas More, refused absolutely to profit by it. High as
                    Coke himself stood for honesty, and well as he deserved praise for this (almost
                    his only redeeming virtue), we doubt whether his judicial character could have
                    emerged quite untainted from a scrutiny led by common informers, discarded
                    servants, and disappointed litigants, like that to which his unfortunate rival
                    was subjected. Pure Bacon was not; purer than he, several of his contemporaries
                    probably were; but we believe him to have been merely one of the offenders, and
                    very far indeed from being the worst, in an age when corruption and profligacy,
                    senatorial, judicial, and administrative, were almost at the acme of that excess
                    which an indignant nation speedily rose to exterminate and to avenge.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the charges in detail, and of the evidence adduced, with Bacon’s
                    articulate answers, as to the candour of which there is no reason to doubt,
                    would really exhibit little or nothing which, after fair allowances are made for
                    imperfect information and other causes of obscurity, would afford a distinct
                    contradiction to the chancellor’s own solemn averment, made in a letter to the
                    king at an early stage of the investigation. “For the briberies and gifts
                    wherewith I am charged, when the book of hearts shall be opened, I hope I shall
                    not be found to have the troubled fountain of a corrupt heart, in a depraved
                    habit of taking rewards to pervert justice; howsoever I may be frail, and
                    partake of the abuses of the times." While he lay in the Tower, he addressed to
                    Buckingham a letter containing these expressions: “However I have acknowledged
                    that the sentence is just, and for reformation sake fit, I have been a trusty,
                    and honest, and Christ-loving friend to your lordship, and the justest
                    chancellor that hath been in the five changes since my father’s time." This last
                    sentence, indeed, when carefully weighed, will be found to contain more of truth
                    than the writer himself perhaps intended. A judge not altogether unjust he may
                    have been, if we compare him with his contemporaries; but he was also a trusty,
                    and trusting, and servile friend of the royal favourite, and of other men in
                    power. He was a lover of the pomp of the world, to an extent highly dangerous
                    for one who had but little private fortune, insufficient official remuneration,
                    and habits which disqualified him for exercising a strict superintendence over
                    the expenses of his household, or the conduct of his dependents generally. His
                    emoluments as chancellor did not amount to three thousand pounds a-year; and,
                    immediately on his appointment, he had used vain endeavours to have the office
                    put on a more independent footing. His servants habitually betrayed both him and
                    the suitors; but there can be no doubt that, continually embarrassed in
                    circumstances, he himself was only too glad to receive the customary gifts when
                    they could be taken with any semblance of propriety. As to his confession, while
                    we believe it to be true in every particular instance, we believe it also in its
                    general admission of corruption; but we likewise believe that the general
                    admission ought to have been qualified by certain references, which would have
                    established the truth of a remark made by Bacon in his hour of deepest
                    suffering, that “they upon whom the wall fell were not the greatest offenders in
                    Israel.” And this, as we conceive it, was the danger which the court were so
                    eager to avert, the danger which filled the king and Buckingham with such
                    dismay. This was their reason for insisting that Bacon should sacrifice his own
                    character, and abandon that line of defence which might not improbably have
                    precipitated the revolution. Upon this assumption, their conduct throughout is
                    intelligible and consistent; and, although one is reluctant to believe it, the
                    assumption is not contradicted by any thing in the chancellor’s character. Lofty
                    as may still have been his abstract notions of morality, his practical views
                    were darkened and debased by his long servitude to public office in a corrupt
                    age. The stain which, as he well knew, the sentence of the parliament would
                    affix upon his name, may have seemed a light thing to one who was aware how the
                    same brand might have been justly imprinted on almost every eminent name in the
                    kingdom. And again, neither Bacon nor his master, nor those others who were the
                    royal advisers, were able to comprehend, in this instance, any more than
                    elsewhere, the spirit which had already gone abroad. They did not anticipate the
                    severity of the sentence pronounced by the House of Lords; still less did they
                    anticipate (Bacon at least did not, nor perhaps did Williams) the universal
                    indignation which was aroused by the fact that the highest judge in the realm
                    had been displaced for bribery. The court gained its immediate purpose, in
                    removing to a subsequent time the fatal struggle; but there soon arrived the
                    fulfilment of Bacon’s prophecy, that the successful attack on him would be but
                    an encouragement and strengthening to those who aimed at the throne itself.</p>
                <p>After his release from the Tower, Bacon, although strangely anxious to continue
                    in London, was obliged to retire to his paternal seat of Gorhambury, near St.
                    Albans. There he immediately commenced his History of Henry the Seventh, a work
                    displaying but too unequivocal proofs of the dejected lassitude which had crept
                    upon his mind. Early in next year he offered himself unsuccessfully for the
                    provostship of Eton College, and proceeded with other literary undertakings.
                    These included the completion of the celebrated treatise, “De Augmentis,” an
                    improvement of the older work on the Advancement of Learning. This was the last
                    philosophical treatise which he published; although the few remaining years of
                    his life were incessantly devoted to study and composition, and gave birth to
                    the New Atlantis, the Sylva Sylvarum, and other works of less consequence.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0649-0611"/>
                <p>Shortly before the king’s death, he remitted the whole of the sentence on Bacon,
                    who, however, did not again sit in parliament. His health was already broken;
                    and in December of that year, 1625, he made his will, in which, although his
                    affairs were really in extreme confusion, he writes as if he considered himself
                    a wealthy man. In the spring of 1626, on his way from Gray’s Inn to Gorhambury,
                    he exposed himself to a sudden chill, by performing in a cottage an experiment
                    which had suggested itself to him, regarding the fitness of snow or ice as a
                    substitute for salt in preserving dead flesh. Unable to travel home, he was
                    carried to the earl of Arundel’s house at Highgate, where, after seven days’
                    illness, he died early in the morning of Easter Sunday, the 9th of April, in the
                    sixty-sixth year of his age. In obedience to his will, he was buried in the same
                    grave with his mother, in St. Michael’s church, near St. Albans.</p>
                <p>It is sad beyond expression to turn to those reflections which are suggested by
                    the life of this great man, however leniently one may be disposed to regard his
                    weaknesses. He who founded the philosophy of modern Europe, he who brought down
                    philosophy from heaven to earth, disentangling it from airy abstractions, and
                    anchoring it on practical truths,—he who aided science alike by his improvements
                    on its procedure, and his enlarged views of its end and aim, indicating
                    observation of individual truths as the only sure guide to universal
                    conclusions, and practical utility as the only quality which makes such
                    conclusions worth the labour they cost,—he who did all this, was destined to
                    furnish by his own pitiable example, a pregnant illustration of the great
                    principles which his writings taught. A slave to the world and its vanities, he
                    was betrayed by the evil genius whom he served. Unable to subject reason, and
                    passion, and imagination, to the stern control of the moral sense, he expiated,
                    by a life of discomfort and dependence, ending in an old age of sorrow and
                    disgrace, the sin of having misapprehended the mighty rule, which alone can save
                    the empire of the mind from becoming a scene like ancient chaos.</p>
                <p>Bacon’s philosophy has been analysed in other parts of this work, and on his
                    literary character we have left ourselves no space to enlarge. We can only
                    remark the powerful effect which his singular versatility of talents exercised
                    over the dissemination of his scientific views. “The reputation which Bacon had
                    acquired from his Essays," says a late writer, “a work early translated into
                    various foreign languages,—his splendid talents as an orator,—and his prominent
                    place in public life,—were circumstances strongly calculated to attract the
                    curiosity of the learned world to his philosophical writings.” And these
                    writings in themselves partake admirably of the character belonging to their
                    author’s works of a different class. Philosophy has seldom made herself more
                    attractive; never has she made herself equally so in communicating lessons of
                    such sterling value. If the works of this wonderful man were worthless as
                    repositories of scientific thought and knowledge, they would still demand
                    reverential study. A masterly eloquence, a union of diversified qualities of
                    style in the highest sense of the word, distinguished even the earlier among
                    them, and entitled those which were produced in the writer’s maturer years, to
                    rank, notwithstanding the faults they share with all prose compositions of their
                    time, as monuments nowhere excelled in the compass of English literature.<note
