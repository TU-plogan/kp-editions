                <p><label type="entry">VIENNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Upper</hi></label>, a department
                    in the north-west of France, formed out of the Upper Limousin, and the districts
                    of La Marche and Poitou. It is situated in north latitude between 45° 26', and
                    46° 24', and in east longitude between 0° 33', and 1° 41'. It is bounded on the
                    north by the departments of Vienne and of Indre, on the east by that of the
                    Creuse, on the south by the Correze and the Dordogne, and on the west by the
                    Charente. It is 2165 square miles in extent, is divided into four
                    arrondissements, and those into twenty-seven cantons, containing 198 communes or
                    parishes. It contained in 1836 a population of 293,011, all of whom adhere to
                    the Catholic church. They are represented as indolent and uninstructed, but kind
                    and charitable, as penurious, and yet hospitable. The institutions for
                    instruction are few and very ill conducted. The face of the country consists of
                    mountains, hills, deep chasms, and narrow valleys, but presents no extensive
                    plain. The mountains are of granite. The highest of them are in the south part
                    of the frontiers of the department of the Creuse and the Correze, and decline
                    gradually in height towards the departments of the Charente and the Vienne. The
                    greatest height of any of them does not exceed 3000 feet. The rivers, which
                    amount to thirty-eight in number, are rapid, and in their course have worn
                    themselves deep beds in the granite or schistose hills. The principal are the
                    Vienne, 240 feet wide at Limoges, the Gartempe, the Ardoer, the Venaise, the
                    Graire, and the Issoire, none of which are navigable. There are some lakes, but
                    none of great extent. The climate is damp, cold, and highly variable. The frost
                    begins early, and ends late. The medium heat of the year at Limoges is from
                    eight to nine of Reaumur greater than in Paris, though it is three degrees south
                    of that city. The appropriation of the soil is, according to the “Statistique de
                    la France,” 554,266 hectares, which is divided nearly in the following order
                    :—Ploughed land, 248,599 hectares; water meadows, 93,960; upland pasture,
                    47,516; 9870 commons, 2969 vineyards, 33,563 chesnut wood, 39,580 forests, 4300

                    lakes, and 64,173 uncultivated heaths. Little alteration has taken place in
                    agriculture during the last two hundred years, except by the introduction of
                    potatoes. As the natives speak a patois something like the Provençal, they have
                    less means of becoming acquainted with the improvements made in the other parts
                    of France; and almost the whole is cultivated on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metayer</hi> system. Frequent fallows are necessary, and with them very little
                    wheat is raised; about the same quantity of buck wheat, and about eight times as
                    much rye. The oats, barley, and maize do not together yield half as much grain
                    as the wheat alone. The most beneficial husbandry is the breeding of cattle:
                    these are sold for the markets in the large cities near it, and some even in
                    Paris. The annual sale to other departments is about 10,000, and 15,000 oxen and
                    cows. In the department, there are about 600,000 sheep of small size, and with
                    coarse wool, but they are much annoyed by the wolves. One important product is
                    the chesnut, of which more than a million quintals are annually harvested. They
                    are used as a substitute for bread by the inhabitants, but some are sent to
                    other districts. The forests have been much neglected, and now yield little
                    timber for building, and but a scanty supply for fuel.</p>
                <p>There are mines of antimony, tin, and iron, but the product of them is
                    inconsiderable. There are some valuable clays adapted for making porcelain. The
                    manufactures are mostly of the domestic kind, such as that of spinning flax, and
                    weaving it into linen. Some woollen and cotton goods are made in the city of
                    Limoges, the capital of the department.</p>

                    on the left bank of the river Rhone, from which it rises like an amphitheatre.
                    It consists of narrow and crooked streets, but has a fine promenade recently
                    formed on the side of the stream. It has a cathedral of great beauty, several
                    other churches, a museum, a theatre, and some extensive barracks. In 1836. It

                    goods, iron and copper ware. It is one of the most ancient cities of France, and
                    the capital of the ancient Gauls; and various reliques of antiquity are from
                    time to time discovered.</p>
