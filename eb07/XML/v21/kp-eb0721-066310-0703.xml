                <p>PART I.—GALVANISM.</p>
                <p>The science of <hi rend="italic">galvanism</hi> derives its name from some
                    interesting experiments performed in 1789 by Μ. Galvani, professor of anatomy at
                    Bologna. When one of his pupils was using an electrical machine, a number of
                    frogs were lying skinned on an adjoining table for the purposes of cookery. The
                    machine being in action, the young man happened to touch with a scalpel the
                    nerve of the leg of one of the frogs, when, to his great surprise, the leg was
                    thrown into violent convulsions. Madame Galvani, having observed the fact,
                    communicated it to her husband, who speedily repeated and extended the
                    experiment. He found that the convulsions took place when a spark was drawn from
                    the prime conductor; and when the blade of the knife, or any other good
                    conductor, was brought into contact with the nerve. When a frog formed part of
                    an electric circuit, a very small quantity of electricity, whether common or
                    atmospheric, produced convulsions in the muscles. Having hung a number of frogs
                    by metallic hoops on an iron railing, he observed that the limbs were frequently
                    convulsed when no electricity was indicated in the atmosphere. In studying this
                    experiment, he was led to the conclusion that the convulsions were not produced
                    by extraneous electricity, but that they always took place when the muscle and
                    nerve of a frog were each placed in contact with metallic bodies, themselves
                    connected by a metal. A still more powerful effect was produced when two metals,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">silver,</hi> were
                    employed, the nerve being <hi rend="italic">armed</hi> or coated with one of
                    these metals, the muscle brought into contact with the other, and the two metals
                    joined by an electrical conductor.</p>
                <p>This experiment is shewn in fig. 1, where Z is the rod of <hi rend="italic"
                    >zinc</hi> and C the rod of <hi rend="italic">copper.</hi> The extremity B, of
                    the zinc is brought into contact with the <hi rend="italic">armed</hi> muscle of
                    the suspended limb FD, while the extremity of the copper is brought into contact
                    with the nerve at D. When the two metals are made to touch at A, the limbs are
                    convulsed, and take the dotted position Galvani explained this phenomenon by
                    saying, that the muscle of the frog was a sort of Leyden phial, the nerves
                    representing the interior, and the muscles the exterior coating of the phial,
                    and the discharge or shock taking place by the metal or metals, which form a
                    communication between the two electrified coatings. The fluid which thus passed
                    along the nerves and muscles was called the <hi rend="italic">Galvanic
                    fluid.</hi></p>
                <p>The publication of Galvani’s discoveries excited great interest. The subject was
                    prosecuted by Valli, Fowler, Robison, Volta, Wells, Humboldt, Fabbrici, and
                    others; but the labours of Volta were the most successful, and, by his discovery
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Voltaic pile,</hi> he may be considered as the great
                    founder of the science. In his earliest inquiries, Volta saw the true cause of
                    the phenomena described by Galvani. He maintained that the exciting fluid was
                    ordinary electricity, produced by the contact of the two metals, and that the
                    convulsions of the frog arose from the electricity thus developed passing along
                    its nerves and muscles. Volta afterwards proved that the force, which gave rise
                    to these phenomena, was generated by the contact of heterogeneous bodies, that
                    it decomposed their natural electricity at the point of junction, continually
                    separating the two fluids, and making the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi>
                    electricity pass along the one and the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> along the
                    other.</p>
                <p>According to this view of the subject, every two heterogeneous bodies form a <hi
                    rend="italic">galvanic circle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">are,</hi> as it is
                    sometimes called, in which electricity is generated; and hence Volta was led, in
                    1800, to invent the <hi rend="italic">Voltaic pile,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >compound galvanic circle.</hi></p>
                <p>This apparatus, shewn in figs. 2, 3, consists of a number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >single galvanic circles,</hi> ZC, ZC, &amp;c., each of which is composed of a
                    disc of <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> and another of <hi rend="italic"
                    >copper.</hi> These single galvanic circles are separated by a disc D, of paper,
                    card, or cloth soaked in <hi rend="italic">water</hi> or any other <hi
                    rend="italic">fluid.</hi> When thirty or forty <hi rend="italic">pair</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">couple</hi> of zinc and copper discs, four inches square, are
                    combined, as in fig. 2, the electricity developed will be sufficient to make the
                    gilt leaves of an electroscope diverge, the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">zinc</hi> end with <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lower</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> end with <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> electricity; and if we touch the upper end with the
                    wetted fingers of one hand, and the lower end with the wetted fingers of the
                    other, a distinct electrical shock will be experienced.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">zinc extremity</hi> of the pile is therefore called the <hi
                    rend="italic">positive extremity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pole,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">copper extremity</hi> the <hi rend="italic">negative
                    extremity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pole.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>
                    card, or disc, which separates each pair of metallic discs is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">conductor.</hi></p>

                <p>In order to understand how the electricity of each galvanic pair is accumulated
                    in the pile, let C, fig. 4, be a plate of <hi rend="italic">copper,</hi> or a
                    <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> element, communicating with the ground by a wire
                    or chain, W. When a plate of <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> Z, or a <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> element, of the same size, is placed above it, a
                    decomposition of electricity will take place at the instant of contact; the <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> electricity will pass into the copper and through
                    the wire W into the ground; while the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi>
                    electricity will enter the <hi rend="italic">zinc,</hi> and accumulate, till its
                    tension, or the thickness of the electrical stratum, is a maximum which we shall
                    call 1. If we were to make the zinc plate Z communicate with the ground by
                    another wire, the positive electricity with which it is charged will be carried
                    off like the negative electricity from the copper disc, and the electricity, set
                    free by the contact of the two metals, would be carried off as soon as it is
                    generated. By uniting the extremities of the two wires the electricities would
                    be recomposed, and a continual circulation of electricity would take place. The
                    disc of <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> C, communicating with the ground as in the
                    figure, and the <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> disc Z, having an electrical
                    intensity equal to 1, let us place upon Z a wet disc D of card. The positive
                    electricity will pass from Z to D till the tension of the electricity in D is
                    equal to 1, a fresh supply arriving from the contact of the two metals. The same
                    electrical state will continue when a second plate of copper, C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, is placed above the disc D. But if we place a second
                    plate of zinc, Z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. It will acquire from the copper
                    beneath it and the wet disc an electrical intensity equal to 1, and from its own
                    action on the copper it will acquire another portion of electricity equal to 1,
                    so that its electrical intensity will be 2. While this is going on, the negative
                    electricity developed in the copper will be neutralised by the positive
                    electricity which it possesses, and in the first pair, CZ, there will be a new
                    development, by which the first zinc disc Z will be brought back to an intensity
                    1, as well as the disc D and the second copper C <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.
                    Hence the second zinc disc, Z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, can be in
                    equilibrium only when it has an intensity double of that possessed by the first.
                    In like manner the third zinc disc will have an intensity 3, the fourth 4, and
                    so on, the fortieth having an intensity 40.</p>
                <p>In the voltaic pile which we have now described, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative,</hi> or copper pile, communicates with the earth, and the intensity
                    of the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> electricity increases, at every pair,
                    from 1 to 40. If we take another pile of similar dimensions, in which the zinc
                    or positive pile communicates with the earth, then the intensity of the negative
                    electricity will increase from 1 to 40. Let us now place these two poles
                    together, so that the two poles in communication with the ground are supported
                    by a wet disc of card, we shall have a pile of eighty pair of plates, in the
                    middle of which the electricity is in its natural state. Its intensity being
                    there 0, while at one end there will be a <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> pile
                    whose intensity is 40, and at the other end a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi>
                    pile whose intensity is also 40.</p>
                <p>In a voltaic pile thus insulated we have electricity of opposite kinds
                    accumulated at its two poles, and of any intensity we choose. If we now place a
                    wire in contact with one pole, and another wire in contact with the other, and
                    bring their extremities together, we shall observe an <hi rend="italic">electric
                    spark.</hi> By separating them and again bringing them together, another spark
                    will be seen, so that there is a continual current of fire passing from the one
                    extremity or pole of the wire to the other.</p>
                <p>If we now unite the two extremities of the two wires, so as to close the circuit,
                    every thing will appear to be at rest, but, notwithstanding this state of
                    apparent repose, the elec trical actions are still going on; the electrical
                    fluid is decomposed in each pair of plates, and again recomposed in the
                    conducting wires. In order to prove this, we have only to interpose a piece of
                    slender wire between the extremities or poles of the conducting wires, when it
                    will either become hot, or red hot, or white hot, or be fused, according as it
                    is longer or shorter, or of a greater or a less diameter. In like manner, water,
                    acids, and other compound substances are all decomposed when placed between the
                    poles and the wires, so as to form part of the galvanic circuit.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—DESCRIPTION OF GALVANIC APPARATUS.</p>
                <p>In performing these experiments, and drawing from this powerful agent all the
                    electrical energy which it is calculated to yield, a great variety of apparatus
                    has been employed. When a voltaic pile consists of many couples, their
                    superincumbent weight presses all the water or other fluid from the discs of
                    card or cloth, and thus injures the action of the pile. In order to avoid this,
                    Volta introduced the <hi rend="italic">“couronne des tasses,”</hi> which is
                    represented in fig. 5, where A, B, D, &amp;c., are three or more glass vessels
                    containing acidulated water or diluted sulphuric acid; the plates Z and C of
                    zinc and copper, about two inches square, are soldered to the ends of a bent
                    metallic wire, M, N, &amp;c., and are immersed in the water in the vessels.
                    About thirty of these cups are sufficient to give a shock. When the circuit is
                    closed, by joining the ends of the wires W, W,gas is actively evolved at all the
                    surfaces of the plates, but when the circuit is broken the evolution of gas
                    ceases in the copper plate, and becomes less copious in the zinc.</p>
                <p>A valuable modification of the “<hi rend="italic">couronne des tasses,”</hi>
                    called the <hi rend="italic">trough battery,</hi> was suggested by Dr Wilkinson
                    and Dr Babington. Plates of zinc and copper, about four inches square, are
                    joined together in pairs, by being soldered at one point. The pairs of plates
                    are then attached to a strip of well dried and varnished wood, A B, fig. 6, so
                    that the whole can be placed in a trough, T T, made of earthenware or wood, with
                    as many partitions as there are pairs of plates. When the trough is of
                    earthenware the partitions are of the same substance, but if they are made of
                    wood the partitions are made of glass. When diluted sulphuric acid is poured
                    into the cells of the trough T T, the battery A B, is immersed in it, so that
                    each pair shall be separated from the adjoining one by a partition of the
                    trough. This apparatus has the great advantage of allowing us to clean or repair
                    the plates, without pouring out the fluid, which can also be changed with great
                    facility. The powerful voltaic battery, constructed for the Royal Institution by
                    Mr Eastwick, under the direction of Sir H. Davy and Mr Children, is upon this
                    plan. It consists of 2000 double plates, and its acting surface is 128,000
                    square inches. When a battery consists of a number of these troughs united<pb

                    troughs are joined by slips of copper, which unite the zinc end of one trough
                    with the copper end of the other.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">galvanic trough,</hi> as it is called, is shewn in fig. 7,
                    as constructed by Mr Cruikshanks of Woolwich. Plates of zinc and copper C Z, C
                    Z, &amp;c., figfl, soldered together, are made to constitute the partitions of a
                    trough, T T, of baked wood, by fixing them into grooves formed in its side, all
                    the zinc surfaces being on one side and all the copper ones on the other. The
                    spaces or cells between them are then filled with a solution of salt and water,
                    or with diluted muriatic or sulphuric acid. Troughs of this description are very
                    apt to get out of order from the warping of the wood by the action of the acid
                    solution, from the cracking of the cement, and other causes which affect the
                    condition of the cells. This trough was still farther improved by keeping the
                    plates of zinc and copper separate as at Z, C, but united at their summits S,
                    with a small ribbon of copper. Each of these double plates was then placed upon
                    the earthenware or glass partitions of a trough like that in fig. 6.</p>
                <p>Dr Wollaston found that the power of a galvanic battery was greatly increased,
                    when each surface of the zinc plate was opposed to a surface of copper, and in
                    1815 he constructed on this principle what be calls an <hi rend="italic"
                    >elementary galvanic battery.</hi> From a series of experiments, made for the
                    purpose of ascertaining the most compendious form of apparatus, by which visible
                    ignition might be shewn, he found that a single plate of zinc, <hi rend="italic"
                    >one inch</hi> square, when rightly mounted, was more than sufficient to ignite
                    a wire of platina <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    3000</hi> dth of an inch in diameter, even when the acid is very diluted (fifty
                    parts of water to one of sulphuric acid). “But for this purpose,” he adds, “each
                    surface of the zinc must have its counterpart of copper, or other meta), opposed
                    to it; for when copper is opposed only to one face, the action on the posterior
                    surface of the zinc is wasted to little or no purpose. The smallest battery that
                    I formed of this construction consisted of a thimble without its top, flattened
                    till its opposite sides were about <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths of an inch asunder. The bottom part was then
                    nearly one inch wide, and the top about <hi rend="superscript"> 8/</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths, and as its length did not exceed <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths of an inch, the
                    plate of zinc to be inserted was less than ¾ths of an inch square.”<note

                <p>The plan thus suggested by Dr Wollaston was employed by Mr Children in the
                    construction of a magnificent battery, in which each plate presented a surface
                    of thirty-two square feet; the plates being six feet long, and two feet eight
                    inches broad. The plates are attached to a strong wooden frame, suspended by
                    ropes and pullies, which, being counterpoised, is easily lowered and elevated,
                    so as to immerse the plates in, or raise them out, of the acid. The cells of the
                    battery were twenty-one in number and their united capacities 945 gallons.<note

                <p>Having seen a new battery of Dr Wollaston’s, constructed on a large scale by
                    Newman, Mr Hart<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edin.
                    Journal of Science, No. vii. p. 19, Jan. 1826.</p></note> of Glasgow conceived
                    the idea of adding sides and bottoms to the double copper plates, so as to make
                    them form cells of themselves, for holding the acidulous liquid. In this way,
                    each galvanic pair became a <hi rend="italic">triad,</hi> consisting of <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> plates of copper inclosing one of zinc. The following is
                    the method of constructing such a battery as given by Mr Hart :—</p>
                <p>“The cells are formed by cutting the copper in the form represented by fig. 9,
                    they are then folded up as seen in fig. 10, and the seams grooved. A drop of tin
                    is run into each lower corner, to render the cells perfectly tight, and at the
                    same time to increase the positive state of the copper. Fig. 11. represents the
                    zinc plate cast in the usual manner, and having a piece of screwed brass wire
                    cast into the top of it, in order to suspend it by.</p>
                <p>“Fig. 12. is a section of the battery, showing how the copper tail of the first
                    cell is connected with the zinc plate of the second, and so on. This connection
                    is rendered perfect, by joining them with a drop of solder. The zinc plates are
                    kept firm in their place in the cells by three small pieces of wood, in the same
                    manner as in Dr Wollaston’s battery; the whole are then fixed (by means of screw
                    nuts fitted on the brass wires) to a bar of baked wood, previously well
                    varnished. Fig. 13 represents the battery in its complete state.</p>
                <p>"When the battery is small, two may be suspended on one frame. When used for
                    shocks, they may be arranged with the positive or negative poles together, and
                    joined with wire to complete the circuit; but when employed for deflagration,
                    the batteries ought to be placed alongside of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=707" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0707-0667"
                    />each other, with all the positive poles at one end, and the negative at the
                    other, and the poles of the same name joined. This arrangement will increase the
                    surface, while the number is the same.</p>
                <p>“When the battery is to be used. It is to be lifted off the frame, and dipped
                    into a wooden trough lined with lead, into which the acid has been poured, or it
                    may be placed in the leaden trough, and the liquid poured into it, till the
                    cells are full. It is then to be placed on the frame, and the rest charged in
                    succession.”</p>
                <p>Mr Candie of Glasgow constructed six batteries on this principle, of twenty-five
                    triads each, and they were found superior to a battery on Wollaston’s
                    construction, “with the same number of plates, but the plates of which contained
                    double the surface.” This comparison was made in the manner proposed by M. Μ.
                    Gay Lussac and Thenard. “Two of Dr Wollaston’s batteries, each containing ten
                    triads in porcelain troughs, evolved a certain volume of gas in <hi
                    rend="italic">seventeen</hi> minutes, while a battery of the new construction,
                    with the same number of triads, but presenting only one half the surface of the
                    other, yielded the same volume of gas in <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi>
                    minutes.” This effect, as Mr Hart remarks, could arise only from the superior
                    means of insulation possessed by his battery.</p>
                <p>Very great improvements have been made on the galvanic battery by Dr Robert Hare
                    of Philadelphia, whose <hi rend="italic">Galvanic deflagrator,</hi> as he calls
                    it, is represented in fig. 14, which represents an apparatus consisting of two
                    troughs, each of which is ten feet long. Each trough contains 150 galvanic
                    pairs. The galvanic series, A B, in the upper trough, is shewn, as it appears
                    when the acid is off the plates, CD being the part of the trough containing the
                    acid when it is off the plates. In the lower trough EF, the galvanic series is
                    omitted, in order that the interior may be better understood. The series
                    belonging to this trough is shewn in fig. 15. The pairs are contained in three
                    boxes, each containing fifty pairs. In placing these <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> boxes in the trough, a little space is left between them and that
                    side of the trough in which the acid enters, so that instead of flowing over
                    them. It may run down outside, and rise up within them.</p>
                <p>The pairs of the series consist of copper cases, about seven inches long, three
                    wide, and half an inch thick, each containing a zinc plate equally distant from
                    its sides, and prevented from touching it by grooved stripes of wood. Each zinc
                    plate is soldered to one side of the adjacent case of copper, as shewn in fig.
                    16, the copper cases being open only at the top and bottom. The copper cases are
                    separated from each other by very thin veneers of wood.</p>
                <p>The two troughs, AB, EF, are joined lengthwise, edge to edge, so that when the
                    sides of the one are <hi rend="italic">vertical,</hi> those of the other must be
                    <hi rend="italic">horizontal.</hi> Hence, by turning the handle H a quarter of a
                    revolution, the two troughs thus united upon pivots which support them at the
                    ends, will be so raised that any fluid in the one trough must flow into the
                    other, and by reversing the action must flow back again. In this way, the
                    galvanic series being placed in one of the troughs, and the acid in the other,
                    the plates may, by means of the handle H, be all simultaneously subjected to the
                    action of the acid, or relieved from it. The pivots are made of iron, coated
                    with brass or copper, and a metallic communication is made between the coating
                    of the pivots and the galvanic series. The lower trough, EF, is connected with
                    the upper one, AB, by metallic rods, <hi rend="italic">mn, op,</hi> joining the
                    two handles, H, <hi rend="italic">h.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the course of his experimental researches in electricity, Dr Faraday was led
                    to the construction of a voltaic trough, in which the coppers, passing round
                    both surfaces of the zincs, should not he separaten from each other, except by
                    an intervening thickness of paper, or in some other way, so as to prevent
                    metallic contact, and should thus constitute a compact, powerful, and economical
                    instrument. He found, however, that Dr Hare had in the trough, which we have
                    above described, anticipated him in his contrivance. The arrangement of Dr Hare,
                    who separated the copper plates by thin veneers of wood, and poured the acid on
                    and off the plates, by a quarter revolution of an axis, which carries both the
                    troughs with the plates, and another trough to collect and hold the liquid, was
                    applied by Mr Faraday as the most convenient. His zinc plates were cut from
                    rolled metal, and, when soldered to the copper ones, had the form shewn in
                    fig.</p>
                <p>17. They were then bent over a guage into the shape fig. 18, and when packed in
                    the wooden trough, were disposed as in fig. 19, small plugs of cork being used
                    to prevent the zinc from touching the copper plates, and a single or double
                    thickness of cartridge paper being interposed between the contiguous surfaces of
                    copper to prevent their contact. A trough of forty pairs of plates could thus be
                    unpacked in five minutes, and repacked again in half an hour; and the whole
                    series occupied only fifteen inches in length. A trough of this kind, with forty
                    pairs of plates <hi rend="italic">three</hi> inches square, was compared with
                    one of forty pairs of four inch plates, having double coppers, and used in
                    porcelain troughs, with insulating cells, and having the same strength of acid;
                    and the former was found equal to the latter in the ignition of platina wire, in
                    the discharge between points of charcoal, and in the strength of the shock. The
                    following are the advantages of this form of trough enumerated by Dr Faraday:—1.
                    It is so compact that one hundred pair of plates may go into a trough three feet
                    long. 2. The copper bearings, on which the pivots rest, afford fixed
                    terminations, which Dr Faraday connects with two cups of mercury fastened in
                    front of the stand of the instrument. These fixed terminations give <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=708"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0708-0668"/> the great advantage of arranging an apparatus to
                    be used in connection with the battery, before the latter is put in action. 3.
                    The trough is ready for use in a few seconds, a single jug of diluted acid being
                    sufficient to charge one hundred plates. 4. When the trough has performed a
                    quarter of a revolution. It becomes active, and the experiment has the advantage
                    of the <hi rend="italic">first contact</hi> of the zinc and acid, which is <hi
                    rend="italic">twice,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">thrice,</hi> that
                    which the battery can produce a minute or two after. 5. When the experiment is
                    finished, the liquid can be instantly poured from between the plates, and hence
                    the latter is never needlessly wasted, the acid unnecessarily exhausted, or the
                    zinc uselessly consumed. The charge, too, is mixed and made uniform, and the
                    advantage of a <hi rend="italic">first contact</hi> is obtained in the next
                    experiment. 6. The saving of zinc is so very great, that Dr Faraday estimates
                    the zinc to be <hi rend="italic">thrice</hi> as effective as that in the
                    ordinary form of battery. 7. The surfaces of the zinc and copper plates may be
                    brought much nearer to each other when the battery is constructed, and remain so
                    till it is worn out. 8. Thinner plates of zinc will do the duty of thicker ones,
                    and rolled zinc, which is the purest,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Faraday found rolled Liege or Moiselman’s zinc the
                    purest.</p></note> may be used. 9. The purity of the diluted acid is
                    proportioned to the quantity of zinc dissolved. 10. The acid is more easily
                    exhausted, so that we need not use an old charge a second time. 11. By using a
                    due mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid for the charge, no gas is evolved from
                    the troughs. Among the defects of this form of the battery, Dr Faraday
                    enumerates the precipitation of copper on the zinc plates, which he considers as
                    arising chiefly from the papers between the coppers retaining acid when the
                    trough is emptied, which acid, acting slowly on the copper, forms a salt, which
                    gradually mingles with the next charge, and is reduced on the zinc plate by the
                    local action, and hence the power of the whole battery is reduced. Dr Faraday
                    proposed to remedy this evil, by using slips of glass to separate the coppers at
                    their edges.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil.
                    Trans. 1835, Parc ii.</p></note></p>
                <p>The defect thus pointed out by Mr Faraday, was particularly experienced by Mr
                    James Young of the Andersonian University, Glasgow, who has proposed a form of
                    battery in which these papers are not required, and having constructed several
                    dozens of instruments in the new form, he found that from the same surfaces of
                    zinc, electricity, the same in quantity and tension, is produced in both Dr
                    Hare’s form and his, but that in the new construction, this effect is produced
                    with <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the quantity of sheet copper, which arises from
                    both sides of the copper plates being presented to surfaces of zinc. The
                    following is Mr Young’s construction. Supposing the breadth of the required
                    plates to be two inches, the sheet copper and zinc are cut into ribbands, two
                    inches broad and five inches long, and a portion cut out as in fig. 20. The
                    ribbon is thus divided into two squares of two inches, and united at A, and
                    having a piece projecting at B. Fig. 20, representing a single plate, either of
                    zinc or copper, is bent at A, as in fig. 21. A plate of zinc thus bent, is then
                    united to a similar one of copper, by soldering together the projecting parts
                    BB, as in fig. 22, and this is the only metallic communication existing between
                    them. Each pair of plates is constructed as in fig. 22. In arranging a number of
                    pairs to form a battery, they are interlaced so that a copper square comes in
                    between each couple of zinc squares, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> This
                    arrangement is not easily described. At the positive end of the battery there is
                    a single copper plate, which is soldered at the top to the last double copper
                    plate, as seen in fig. 23, which represents three pairs properly arranged, and
                    also the way in which they should be fitted up, and kept steadily apart in a
                    wooden frame. This frame is made of two solid pieces of wood, into which are
                    dove-tailed two cross bars, <hi rend="italic">ee, e',</hi> in front, with two
                    similar ones behind. The grooves in the cross bars for receiving the edges of
                    the plates, are formed by placing the four cross bars together, and sawing a
                    little way into one side of them all every eighth of an inch or so in their
                    length, so as to form a set of parallel grooves. This affords us a better
                    security against metallic contact than the wedges of cork in Dr Hare’s battery,
                    which are apt to slip out.</p>
                <p>The frame, fig. 23, with its plates, may be introduced into a porcelain or wooden
                    trough, TT, containing the diluted acid. Mr Young prefers a single trough to Dr
                    Hare’s two connected troughs, and by means of an axis of stout wire, A B,
                    carrying two pullies, P P, the frame and battery can be raised out of the
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>Mr Warren de la Rue made an important step, by using a solution of sulphate of
                    copper as the exciting agent in voltaic batteries. Oxygen is thus supplied to
                    the zinc by the oxide of copper; no gas is evolved; and the action being thus
                    rendered continuous, the effect is fully equal to that momentarily produced by
                    immersion in acids. The battery which Μ. de la Rue considers best adapted to the
                    use of sulphate of copper, is shown in fig. 28. Thezinc plateis shown in fig.25.
                    It should be tinned on the top A, previous to the amalgamation of the rest of
                    the plate. The zinc plate is retained in its place by grooves cut out of the two
                    slips of wood BB, to within 3-4ths of an inch of the bottom. The copper plates
                    are formed into cells, painted on the outside (as in fig. 26,) five inches
                    square and one inch wide, E,E, being two ears of copper for suspending the cell
                    in its place, and A, a slip of copper to be soldered to the zinc plate in the
                    adjacent cell. As the zinc plates do not descend lower than within 3-4ths of an
                    inch of the bottom of the cells, the space thus left may contain the deposits
                    arising from decomposition of the sulphate of copper. The cells are supported in
                    a long wooden frame, by means of the ears E,E, by hooks driven through them as
                    shown in fig.</p>
                <p>27. In order to receive the charge when the battery is in action, Μ. de la Rue
                    employs the contrivance shown in fig.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=709"

                <p>28. A spout L, a quarter of an inch deep, is placed at the top of each cell, and
                    these spouts overhang a wooden gutter extending along the frame. The solution of
                    the sulphate must then be renewed by means of a funnel with a long neck, the
                    long end being made to descend nearly to the bottom of the cell. When the fresh
                    solution is thus poured in, the spent liquor will run out by the spout into the
                    gutter. When a series of experiments is over, the battery must be emptied, and
                    the plates well cleaned by dashing water between the cells.<note anchored="true"

                    April 1837, vol. x., p. 244.</p></note> Mr Noad justly recommends this battery
                    as a very valuable one, and as likely to supersede the <hi rend="italic">acid
                    charged</hi> battery altogether. Its initial action was equal to one of
                    Wollaston’s batteries of equal surface, and what is of far more importance. Its
                    action was permanent.</p>
                <p>Professor DanieD has published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1836, an
                    account of two new voltaic batteries, possessing valuable properties. The first
                    of these he calls the <hi rend="italic">dissected battery,</hi> by means of
                    which he says, “many detached facts well-known before, had become clear, and of
                    more importance, from their connection and comparison with each other by its
                    means.” The following is Mr Daniell’s own description of it :—The battery
                    consists of ten glass cells, a section of one of which is represented in the
                    accompanying figures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">"abed,</hi> fig. 29, is a foot of solid glass, containing a
                    cavity <hi rend="italic">e f g h,</hi> the upper part of which is fitted with a
                    stopper, <hi rend="italic">g h.</hi> Through this stopper the stems of the two
                    plates <hi rend="italic">i; k l in n,</hi> pass into the lower part of the
                    cavity, which is divided into two cells by the partition <hi rend="italic">o
                    p,</hi> and each of which contains mercury, into which the wires respectively
                    dip. This arrangement admits of the plates being changed at pleasure with little
                    difficulty. The plates may be connected together, or with the plates of other
                    cells, by means of wires, <hi rend="italic">ρ q,</hi> passing through the
                    lateral holes, <hi rend="italic">t, u,</hi> and dipping also into the cups of
                    mercury. To the glass foot thus arranged, a glass shade <hi rend="italic">v w x
                    y z z,</hi> is fitted by grinding, and constitutes a cell for the reception of
                    the liquid. A graduated glass jar, A, B, may be suspended over either plate by
                    means of a brass clip, proceeding from a rod placed by the side of the cell in
                    the manner represented by fig. 30, which is a perspective drawing of a circular
                    arrangement of ten such cells.</p>
                <p>Fig. 31 represents the section of a cell which is adapted to the same purposes,
                    but is less expensive in construction. It is supported in a perforated table C,
                    D, by its projecting rim <hi rend="italic">v w y z,</hi> and the stems of the
                    plates pass through the glass stopper <hi rend="italic">a b c d,</hi> into the
                    exterior mercury cups <hi rend="italic">o, p,</hi> by means of which all the
                    necessary connexions may be made.</p>
                <p>The circular arrangement of the cells of the battery, fig. 30, admits of their
                    being combined together in various ways with the greatest facility, by means of
                    small cups of mercury <hi rend="italic">g, h, i,</hi> placed at proper
                    intervals. My next disposition was to connect all the platinum plates together
                    by wires radiating from them to a central cup <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> of
                    mercury, and all the zinc plates by wires, dipping into a ring of the same
                    metal, placed in a groove <hi rend="italic">a b c d e f,</hi> surrounding the
                    whole arrangement. In this state of things no action was of course manifest, for
                    there was no complete circuit; but upon making a connection by means of a wire,
                    between the centra) cup and the exterior circle of mercury, the current was
                    enabled to circulate, and was manifested by the simultaneous evolution of gas
                    from all the cells. The inequality of action became again apparent, and the
                    differences between the cells was nearly the same, as when they were connected
                    in separate single circuits.”</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the numerous improvements which have been made in the voltaic
                    battery, no successful attempts had been made till the time of Professor
                    Daniell, to discover the causes of the variations and decline of its force,
                    after the first immersion of the plates in the diluted acid. The principal
                    causes of these variations he proved to be the evolution of hydrogen gas from
                    the negative metallic surface, which not only consumes a considerable portion of
                    the generated electricity, but reduces at the conducting plates the oxide of
                    zinc, formed by the action of the battery at the generating plates, and here the
                    conducting plates were ultimately so encrusted with metallic zinc, as to
                    diminish and finally annihilate the circulating force. Hence he was led to the
                    construction of what he calls a <hi rend="italic">constant battery,</hi> for
                    producing an invariable current of force, and therefore applicable to many
                    important researches, which cannot be successfully carried on under variation of
                    the voltaic current. But beside the attainment of this great object, Professor
                    Daniell considers it as promising the following advantages:</p>
                <p>1. The abolition of all local action, by the facility of applying amalgamated
                    zinc.</p>
                <p>2. The trifling expense of replacing the zinc rods when worn out, and the total
                    absence of any wear of the copper.</p>
                <p>3. The dispensing with the use of nitric acid, and the substitution of the
                    cheaper materials, sulphate of copper and oil of vitriol, and the absence of any
                    annoying fumes; and,</p>
                <p>4. The facility and perfection with which all metallic communications may be
                    made, and different combinations of the plates arranged.</p>
                <p>The following is Professor Daniell’s description of this valuable instrument.</p>
                <p>Fig. 32 represents a section of one of the cells, ten of which are shown in
                    connexion at fig. 53; <hi rend="italic">a b c d</hi> is a cylinder of copper six
                    inches high and three and a half inches wide; it is open at the top <hi
                    rend="italic">a b,</hi> but closed at the bottom, except a collar, <hi
                    rend="italic">er,</hi> one and a half inch wide, intended for the reception of a
                    cork into which a glass siphon-tube, <hi rend="italic">g h i j k,</hi> is
                    fitted. On the top, <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> a copper collar, corresponding
                    with the one at the bottom, rests by two horizontal<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=710" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0710-0670"/>
                    arms. Previously to the fixing of the cork siphontube in its place, a membranous
                    tube, formed of a part of the gullet of an ox, is drawn through the lower
                    collar, <hi rend="italic">e f</hi> and fastened with twine to the upper, <hi
                    rend="italic">l in n o;</hi> and when tightly fixed by the cork below, forming
                    an internal cavity to the cell, communicating with the siphon-tube in such a way
                    as that, when filled with any liquid to the level <hi rend="italic">m o,</hi>
                    any addition causes it to flow out at the aperture <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> In
                    this state, for any number of drops allowed to fall into the top of the cavity,
                    an equal number are discharged from the bottom, <hi rend="italic">p q,</hi> is a
                    rod of cast zinc, amalgamated with mercury, six inches long and half an inch
                    diameter, supported on the rim of the upper collar by a stick of wood, <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi>, <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, passing through a hole drilled
                    in its upper extremity; <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is a small cup for the
                    reception of mercury, by which, and the cavity <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, at the
                    top of the zinc rod, various connexions of the copper and zinc, of the different
                    cells, may be made by means of wires proceeding from one to the other.</p>
                <p>In fig. 33 the ten cells are represented as connected in single series, the zinc
                    of one with the copper of the next. They stand upon a small table in a circle,
                    with the apertures of the siphon-tubes turned inwards, surrounding a large
                    funnel, communicating with the basin underneath, for the reception of any liquid
                    which may overflow. A smaller funnel is supported over the internal cavity of
                    each cell by a ring sliding upon rods of brass placed between each pair of
                    cells. One of these only is shown in the drawing to avoid the crowding of the
                    sketch.”</p>
                <p>In the preceding construction, Mr Daniell had two main objects in view. 1. To
                    remove out of the circuit the oxide of zinc as soon as its solution is formed;
                    and, 2. To absorb the hydrogen evolved upon the copper without precipitating any
                    substance injurious to the latter. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of these
                    objects is completely effected by suspending the rod in the membranous cell,
                    into which fresh acidulated water is allowed to drop slowly from the funnel
                    above, whi1st the heavier solution of the oxide is withdrawn from the bottom at
                    an equal rate by the siphon-tube, <hi rend="italic">g h i j k.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> object was attained by charging the space round the
                    membrane with a saturated solution of sulphate of copper instead of dilute acid.
                    When the circuit was completed the current passed freely through this solution,
                    no hydrogen appeared upon the conducting plate, but a beautiful thick coating of
                    pure copper was precipitated upon it, thus perpetually renewing its surface.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these charges, there was still a gradual, though very slow,
                    decline in the force of the battery, which Mr Daniell traced to the weakening of
                    the saline solution by the precipitation of the copper, and consequent decline
                    of its conducting power. In order to remedy this defect, he suspended some solid
                    sulphate of copper in small muslin bags, which just dipped below the surface of
                    the solution in the cylinder, and kept it in a state of saturation by its
                    gradual dissolution. With this improvement the voltaic current became perfectly
                    steady for <hi rend="italic">six</hi> hours together. An improvement upon this
                    arrangement is shewn in fig. 34, where <hi rend="italic">a c f h,</hi> is a
                    perforated colander of copper, into which, instead of muslin bags, the sulphate
                    of copper is placed. The central collar, <hi rend="italic">b d e g,</hi> rests
                    by a small ledge upon the rim of the cylinder. The membrane is then drawn
                    through the collar, and, after being turned over its edge. It is fastened with
                    twine.</p>
                <p>Professor Daniell having found it of great advantage to increase the number of
                    cells, he now places them in two parallel lines, of ten each, upon a long table,
                    the siphon-tubes being disposed opposite each other, and hanging over a small
                    gutter, placed between the rows to carry off the refuse solution when the acid
                    requires to be changed; and as a uniform action may be kept up by occasionally
                    adding a small quantity of fresh liquid, he now dispenses with the dripping
                    funnels.</p>
                <p>Professor Daniell considers a battery of twenty cells as amply sufficient for all
                    the purposes of demonstration and investigation. It keeps eight inches of
                    platinum wire, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>
                    th of an inch in diameter, permanently red hot in the open air, and it is even
                    an economical source of the purest oxygen for laboratory purposes. For this
                    latter purpose he has fitted up a cell by inclosing a platinum plate, instead of
                    the zinc rod, within the membranous tube, which is closed at the upper end by a
                    glass tube bent in a convenient form to deliver the disengaged gas under a
                    receiver. When this cell is included in the circuit of double cells, the
                    hydrogen is absorbed as formerly by the oxide of copper, but the oxygen is
                    evolved from the platina at the rate of eighty-four cubic inches in the
                    hour.</p>
                <p>In a subsequent paper on voltaic combinations<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans, vol. xxxvii. p. 119, &amp;c</p></note>
                    Professor Daniell found that the power of the battery was greatly increased by
                    an increase of temperature. Having dissolved the sulphate of copper in standard
                    acid, in place of water, the battery produced thirteen in place of eleven cubic
                    inches of mixed gases every five minutes. On another occasion, he added one part
                    of sulphuric acid to eight parts of the saturated solution of the sulphate, and
                    poured it into the cells, when of the high temperature produced<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=711" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0711-0671"/>
                    by the disengagement of heat during the mixture, which was about 110°. The

                    minutes.</p>
                <p>Wishing now to try the effect of higher temperatures, he replaced the membranous
                    tubes with cylinders of porous earthenware. These cylinders, closed at the lower
                    ends, had their diameter one and a half inches, and the same height as the
                    copper cells. The bottoms of the latter are fitted with sockets in which the
                    tubes are placed, and which confine them in their proper position, the
                    perforated colanders, which hold the sulphate of copper, passing over their
                    upper ends. These porous tubes require to be thoroughly soaked in dilute acid.
                    The increase of temperature was obtained from steam, and the general result of
                    many experiments was, <hi rend="italic">that the working rate of this battery
                    was nearly doubled at a temperature of</hi> 212°, provided no secondary action

                <p>In the interesting paper which contains these observations, Professor Daniell has
                    described an improved <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> battery of large
                    dimensions, the effects of which exceeded his most sanguine expectation, and
                    which he thinks cannot be farther improved in point of simplicity and cheapness.
                    This battery consists of <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> copper cells, twenty inches
                    high, and three and a half inches diameter. The interior partitions are formed
                    by merely tying the open ends of the oxen’s gullets to the rings of the
                    colanders which hold the blue vitriol, and which are made deeper than before,
                    and suspending them in the cells, to the bottoms of which they reach. Each bag
                    contains rather more than a quart of the dilute acid. The zinc rods are
                    five-8ths of an inch in diameter, and well amalgamated, and their connexions the
                    same as formerly. At the temperature of 67° this battery produces, in the
                    voltameter, twelve cubic inches of the mixed gases per minute, or 720 in the
                    hour. It has great power of ignition, and while it will maintain six inches of
                    platinum wire, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>
                    of an inch in diameter, red hot. It will still decompose water at the rate of
                    fourteen cubic inches in <hi rend="italic">jive</hi> minutes. When the battery
                    is not in use, the zinc rods are taken out and wiped, and the membranous bags
                    carefully lifted out of their cells, emptied of their acid, filled with water,
                    and suspended from a frame placed for their reception. Professor Daniell adds,
                    that there is no reason to think that the limits of efficiency have yet been
                    nearly attained, and the gullets could easily be connected together so as to
                    obtain bags of any required length. Professor Daniell has more recently put in
                    action seventy series of his large constant battery, which, on the 16th February
                    1839, fused titanium, and heated sixteen feet four inches of No. 20 platinum
                    wire.</p>
                <p>Another form of the constant battery we owe to J. W. Mullins, Esq., M.P., who
                    calls it the <hi rend="italic">quantity battery.</hi> It consists of an
                    earthenware pot six inches deep and four wide, which is shewn in action in fig.
                    35, and in perspective in fig. 36, a cylinder of amalgamated zinc, Z, Z,
                    standing on legs half an inch long, and cut out of the cylinder, is placed in
                    the pot; the height of the cylinder, including the legs, is only two inches.
                    Within this cylinder, and at the distance of three-8ths of an inch from it, is
                    placed a copper vessel <hi rend="italic">c c</hi>, having round its outer edge a
                    rim a quarter of an inch wide, round which a thin bladder, well cleaned and
                    moistened, is tied. The bottom of the pot rests on a circular piece of baked
                    wood projecting a quarter of an inch beyond the cylinder. The bladder is then
                    drawn all over and fastened round the upper rim by a cord, and it is kept clear
                    of the copper by the circular piece of wood. The copper cylinder c c, which is
                    as deep as the pot, is perforated with six holes equidistant from the top and
                    bottom. These holes form communications with an inner cylinder of copper C, C,
                    three quarters of an inch distant from the outer one. The shelf bottom of the
                    space between the two cylinders, is on a level with the lower edge of the holes,
                    and soldered to the large cylinder. The object of this cylindrical chamber is to
                    hold crystals of sulphate of copper when required, and to contain the solution,
                    which should not rise higher than the upper edge of the holes. A small quantity
                    of sal-ammoniac, (muriate of ammonia,) in the proportion of five parts of the
                    saturated solution to 100 of water, is then poured outside the bladder till it
                    reaches the upper edge of the zinc cylinder Z Z. The solution of sulphate of
                    copper will require a few crystals of the sulphate to be added every four hours,
                    but the ammoniacal solution needs no renewal. The connexions are formed, as in
                    fig. 36, by strips of copper soldered to the zinc cylinder Z Z, and to the inner
                    copper cylinder C C. The wires bend over the edge of the pot and enter two cups
                    holding mercury, from which the wires that transmit the electrical current
                    through any apparatus, may proceed. The action of this battery will continue as
                    long as a particle of metallic salt remains in solution. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >six</hi> drops of a saturated solution of the sulphate of copper are added to
                    the exhausted and colourless solution, the battery instantly resumes its
                    original power. A constant current, therefore, may be kept up by having a few
                    crystals of the blue vitriol on the shelf, which, by being gradually dissolved,
                    will pass to the external surface of the copper.</p>
                <p>Mr Mullins has constructed also a battery for intensity, of the effects of which
                    he has given the following description:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lend, and Edin. Phil. Mag. 1836, vol. ix. p. 283.</p></note>
                    —“I have put,” he says, “as in the quantity battery, a shallow cylinder of zinc
                    within, and close to the internal surface of the earthenware pot, next the
                    copper cylinder, as before; but, instead of letting the inside of this cylinder
                    go for nothing, the internal surface of the copper is lined with very thin
                    caoutchouc for insulation; then comes another small cylinder of zinc, then a
                    copper one lined as the last, then a zinc, and lastly, a copper cock, copper, of
                    course, enveloped in membrane. In this battery the power is immense in
                    proportion to the quantity of the metals used, which, in my opinion, depends
                    upon a new principle, which is developed in this mode of construction and
                    arrangement, that is, <hi rend="italic">restricting</hi> the electric current to
                    gradually <hi rend="italic">diminishing metallic surfaces</hi> as it advances,
                    so that, as the quantity accumulates, the conducting surfaces are <hi
                    rend="italic">reduced,</hi> and of course a much higher degree of intensity is a
                    necessary consequence. By merely altering the connexions of the plates, which,
                    by the mode I have adopted, can be done with the utmost facility, this battery
                    can be turned into a powerful quantity one, and probably a wine glass full of
                    the solution is amply sufficient.”</p>
                <p>Having found that a single piece of zinc, of three square inches, surrounded by a
                    membrane, could be easily fitted up, Mr Shillibear constructed the galvanic
                    apparatus shown <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=712"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0712-0672"/>in figs. 37 and 38. It consists of a copper
                    trough, C C, three inches deep, and two and a quarter wide, divided into as many
                    compartments, with copper partitions, as we wish to have zinc plates. A section
                    of a trough, for <hi rend="italic">five</hi> plates, is shewn in fig. 38. The
                    zinc plates are soldered firmly to a copper bar, and this copper bar is fastened
                    by a screw to a piece of hard wood which serves as a cover to the battery. The
                    <hi rend="italic">pole director,</hi> shewn at the top of fig. 37, for directing
                    the course of the electric current, is constructed thus. In the wood cover, C C,
                    there is cut a groove on each side of the screw B, in connexion with the zinc,
                    and into this groove is fitted a copper slide, which carries two moveable wings,
                    D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Ee, which may be easily brought into contact with
                    the copper or zinc. When the wing D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is in contact with
                    C, and Ee with B, the current of electricity will go out from the wire in
                    connection with the wing D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and return by the wire
                    connected with the wing Ee, into the zinc plates through B. If we now shift the
                    slide, so that E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is in contact with C, and D <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> with B, the current will be reversed, going out by the wire
                    at Ee, and returning by the wire at Dd, to the zinc through B. In order to
                    prevent any precipitation of the sulphate of copper upon them, the zinc plates
                    should be lightly covered with bladder. When the trough is to be employed for
                    sustaining a weight, the membranes should be slipped off, and diluted nitrous
                    acid used instead of the sulphate of copper solution.<note anchored="false"

                <p>A galvanic battery of a very simple kind, and easily constructed, has been

                    ><p>Id. Id. p. 214.</p></note> A piece of thin sheet copper, coiled up in the
                    form of a cylinder, 4 inches by 2½, is kept in that state by a fine copper wire.
                    The cylinder is then placed in a small bladder tied round the copper with
                    pack-thread. The bladder is open at top, and its bottom forms the bottom of the
                    cylinder. A sheet of rolled zinc is coiled up in a similar manner, and a piece
                    of copper wire, previously soldered to each zinc and copper cylinder, forms the
                    connexion between them. This battery may then be placed in a jelly-pot. It is
                    excited by a saturated solution of sulphate of copper, poured into the copper
                    cylinder. Another solution of common salt is poured in on the outside of the
                    copper, and in contact with the zinc. If it be required to keep the battery in
                    action for two or three days, a few crystals of sulphate of copper must be
                    added, to keep up the strength of the solution within the copper cylinder.</p>
                <p>Before concluding this part of the subject, we must notice the spiral galvanic
                    batteries. The first battery of this kind on a large scale, was made by Dr
                    Robert Hare, who called it a <hi rend="italic">calorimotor</hi> from its
                    remarkable power of producing heat. It consists of sheets of zinc and copper
                    formed into coils, the copper coil encircling the zinc at a distance not
                    exceeding a quarter of an inch. The sheets of zinc were about 9 inches by 6, and
                    the copper 14 by 6, more of the copper being necessary as shown in fig. 39,
                    where ZZ represents the zinc, and C C the copper coil. Each coil was about 2½
                    inches in diameter, and they were 80 in number. All these coils were let down by
                    means of a lever, into 80 glass jars, 2¾ diameter, and 8 inches large,
                    containing the acid solution for exciting them.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Μ. Pouillet constructed one of these with twelve couples for the Faculty of
                    Sciences at Paris, and found it very powerful in producing great quantities of
                    electricity with low tension.</p>
                <p>Mr Pepys constructed a similar instrument on a grand scale, for the London
                    Institution, in 1822, for electro-magnetic purposes. It is represented in fig.
                    40, where M is the battery, C C the conductors, W the counterpoise weight, and T
                    T the tubs, one for holding the dilute acid, and the other water. The battery M,
                    consists of two plates of copper and zinc each <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> feet
                    long, and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> wide, exposing a superficial surface of 400
                    feet. They are rolled or wrapped round a cylinder of wood, with three ropes of
                    horse hair between each fold to keep them from contact, and these ropes are kept
                    in their position by notched sticks, occasionally introduced in the rolling. Two
                    conductors CC, of copper about three quarters of an inch thick, are soldered to
                    the end of each plate, from which the electric force is obtained when the
                    instrument is in action. The battery is suspended by ropes and pullies, with a
                    counterpoise W, to permit its immersion in a tub of diluted acid, or when not in
                    use in a tub of water. It requires about 55 gallons of fluid, and the solution
                    used contains about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>A very excellent galvanic battery for producing electricity of different

                    a plate of rolled zinc, 9 inches wide and 12 long, inserted in copper cases,
                    open at top and bottom. These elements are suspended in groups of 11 pairs, or 8
                    sets in all; and each of the 8 troughs which are raised up to the elements, are
                    divided into 11 cells by wooden partitions coated with cement</p>
                <p>An electric apparatus, in which the phenomena were supposed to be independent of
                    chemical action, was invented by J. A. de Luc, in 1809. It consists of a great
                    number of alternations of small discs of zinc, and silvered paper, about an inch
                    in diameter. These discs succeed each other in the following order: zinc,
                    silver, paper; zinc, silver, paper. When from 500 to 1000 discs are enclosed in
                    a dry glass tube, and the plates are pressed together by a brass cap and screw
                    at each end, the pile will produce distinct electrical effects. When the columns
                    of 1000 series each, are fitted up as in fig. 41, and placed vertically in a
                    glass receiver, a brass ball, suspended by a thread of raw silk, will, by the
                    action of the two piles, continually strike the two bells placed at the lower
                    end of the piles. Mr B. M. Forster succeeded in making an apparatus analogous to
                    the preceding, which rung continually for five months. Mr Singer made one, which
                    rung continually for 14 months, and De Luc had a pendulum which kept vibrating
                    for more than two years.</p>
                <p>Mr Singer found that when the paper was perfectly dry, the pile lost all its
                    power, and that it was deteriorated when too much moisture was present. M.
                    Jaeger, however, observed, that when the paper, after being dried to excess, was
                    heated by exposing the pile to a temperature of from 104° to 140°, the pile
                    began to act as powerfully as before. When the paper is in its driest natural
                    state, the pile is active, and it loses its activity only when the paper is
                    subjected to a degree of heat capableof scorching it. By means of a pile of
                    20,000 groups of silver, zinc, and double discs of writing paper, a series of
                    distinct sparks were obtained. A jar, having a coated disc of 50 square inches,
                    was charged in 1.0 minutes, and gave a disagreeable shock in the elbows and
                    shoulders. The charge of this jar fused one inch of platina wire, the
                    five-thousandth of an inch in diameter. This pile, though exhibiting such power,
                    did not exercise the slightest chemical action.</p>
                <p>The two ends of the electric pile are in opposite electric states, the <hi
                    rend="italic">zinc</hi> extremity being <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> extremity <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> the
                    middle part being in a neutral state.</p>
                <p>M. de Luc and Μ. Hausman observed that the rays of the sun increased the power of
                    the column, an effect which they thought was not due to heat. Mr Singer,
                    however, found that his column was always more powerful in summer than in
                    winter, and in a room with a fire than in one without it.</p>
                <p>M. De Luc has shown how the dry pile may be used in determining the conducting
                    power of bodies, and also their insulating qualities, and he has likewise
                    employed it as an aerial electroscope for indicating the electrical changes
                    which take place in the atmosphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In 1812, Professor Zamboni of Verona made a considerable improvement on the pile
                    of De Luc. He dispenses entirely with the discs of zinc, and employs only discs
                    of paper, one of whose surfaces is silvered, or rather <hi rend="italic"
                    >tinned,</hi> and the other covered with a thin film of the peroxide of
                    manganese pulverised in a mixture of milk and flour. The faces of tin are placed
                    in contact with those of manganese, the <hi rend="italic">tin</hi> being <hi
                    rend="italic">the positive,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the peroxide</hi> the
                    negative element. M. Zamboni has been endeavouring during the last 20 years, to
                    produce by this pile a <hi rend="italic">perpetual</hi> or long-continued
                    motion; but the motion, though often long-continued, frequently ceases for a
                    while, and sometimes altogether, when the electric force of the apparatus has
                    been enfeebled.</p>
                <p>Chemists and natural philosophers had in vain endeavoured to produce chemical
                    effects by means of the dry pile; but M. Gassiot has very recently<note

                    chemical power. Having constructed a pile of 10,000 series of discs of laminated
                    zinc, paper, and oxide of manganese, each about one inch in diameter, he divided
                    it into separate piles of 1000 each. With this apparatus he succeeded in
                    obtaining sparks which passed through the space of <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of an inch. When the distance of the
                    points was <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> th of
                    an inch, the stream of sparks was so powerful as to produce that peculiar
                    phosphorescent odour which is always perceptible in the action of the electrical
                    machine. With one of the piles of 1000 series, a spark passed through a space of
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5000</hi> dth of an
                    inch; but what was of more interest, M. Gassiot succeeded, after many trials, in
                    obtaining chemical decomposition of a solution of <hi rend="italic">iodide</hi>
                    of <hi rend="italic">potassium.</hi> He fastened about two inches of platinum
                    wire to each end of the pile of 10,000 series, the two points of his micrometer
                    electrometer being brought parallel to each other, so as to be about a quarter
                    of an inch apart. A piece of bibulous paper saturated with a solution of iodide
                    of potassium was placed on a slip of glass, and then brought into contact with
                    the ends of the wires from each extremity of the pile. The iodine then appeared
                    invariably on the end of the wire attached to the end of the pile, which
                    terminated with the oxide of manganese.</p>
                <p>The dry pile has been applied with much success by Μ. Bohnenberg, in constructing
                    an electroscope of great delicacy. Having suspended between the two opposite
                    poles of two piles a single strip of gold leaf, he found that this leaf, however
                    slightly it was electrified, was drawn to one or other of the poles, according
                    to the nature of the electricity with which it was influenced. In this way he
                    obtained an instrument, not only sensible to small electrical influences, but
                    capable of indicating the kind of electricity which was present.<note

                <p>Before concluding this part of the subject, we shall describe some series of
                    apparatus, which have been employed in the most recent researches, both in this
                    country and on the continent, in conducting the important researches to which we
                    shall afterwards refer, respecting the reduction of oxides and earths by <hi
                    rend="italic">weak electric</hi> currents. Μ. Becquerel employed only a single
                    pair of plates, in connection with his decomposing cell. Having closed a glass
                    tube at one end by a plug of moistened clay, he immersed it in a weak solution
                    of common salt. The solution of the metallic salt to be decomposed, was then
                    placed in this glass tube, and a compound metallic arc, formed of zinc and
                    platinum, was placed in the solution in such a manner, that the platinum leg was
                    immersed in the tube containing the metallic solution (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative tube</hi> of BecquereD, while the zinc dips in the solution of salt.
                    Chemical decomposition then takes place, and in a few hours or more, sometimes a
                    few weeks, the metal appears on the plate of platinum, in a form more or less
                    crystallised.</p>
                <p>Dr Golding Bird, in prosecuting similar researches, has contrived a simple form
                    of the battery, which with Becquerel’s cell, enables us to perform this class of
                    experiments with facility and certainty. It consists of a large glass cylinder
                    A, (tig. 42,) 8 inches deep and 2 in diameter. Within<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=714" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0714-0674"/>
                    this is fixed, by means of corks, another glass cylinder B, 1½ inch in diameter,
                    and 4 inches long, and closed at one end with a plug or bottom, D of plaster of
                    Paris, 0∙7 of an inch in diameter. A piece of sheet copper C, 6 inches long, and
                    3 wide, loosely coiled up, and having the conducting copper wire F, soldered to
                    it, is placed, in the cylinder D, while an equal sized piece of zinc E, loosely
                    coiled up, and furnished with a conducting wire G, is placed in the cylinder A.
                    When the cylinder A is nearly filled with weak brine, and the smaller one B,
                    with a saturated solution of sulphate of copper, the apparatus is complete; and
                    if the fluids in the two cylinders are kept at the same level, a continuous
                    current of electricity will be maintained for some weeks. The mode of connecting
                    this battery with the decomposing cell, is shown in fig. 43. This cell is the
                    counter part of the battery, consisting of two glass cylinders, A, B, the latter
                    having a plaster of Paris bottom. The tube B, is about 3 inches long and half an
                    inch wide, and receives the metallic or other solution to be decomposed, the
                    outer tube A being filled with weak brine. Into this brine is plunged a strip of
                    amalgamated zinc C, connected with the wire F, of the battery, while a strip of
                    platinum foil D, is immersed in the metallic solution, and is connected with the
                    wire G of the battery. This apparatus, therefore, consists of an active single
                    battery, of which C, E, is one of the two metallic elements, and C and D the
                    other; and the fluid between C and E, separated by the porous diaphragm D, one
                    fluid element, and the fluid between C and D, separated by a porous diaphragm,
                    another fluid element.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Another instrument necessary in voltaic researches is the volta-electrometer, or
                    voltameter, invented by Dr Faraday, for measuring the quantity of voltaic
                    electricity, by means of the quantity of oxygen and hydrogen generated by the
                    battery. It consists of a graduated glass tube, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, fig.
                    44, closed at the upper end. Platina wires <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">b',</hi> terminating in two platinum plates within the tube, pass
                    through the tube, and are fused into the glass. The tube is fitted by grinding
                    into one of the necks of a two necked bottle. If the bottle is ½ or <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ds full of dilute
                    sulphuric acid. It will by enclosing the tube, flow into the tube, and fill it.
                    When an electric current, therefore, is passed through the instrument between
                    the plates, the evolved gases collect in the upper part of the tube, without
                    being subject to the recombining power, of the platina, the stopper <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is taken out.</p>
                <p>By receiving the wires connected with δ, δ', replacing the stopper, and refilling
                    the tube with the liquid by inverting the bottle, a second measure of gas may be
                    obtained on replacing the wires at <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b'</hi>.</p>
                <p>Dr Faraday has given in fig. 45, another form of the voltameter, which he found
                    very useful in experiments continued for days together, and where large
                    quantities of indicating gas are to be collected. The gases, in place of being
                    measured in the tube, as in fig. 44, are carried by the bent tube δ, into a
                    graduated jar, placed in a small pneumatic trough.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II —ON THE GENERAI. PHENOMENA AND EFFECTS OF GALVANISM.</p>
                <p>In our article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vol. viii p. 574, 5.</p></note> we have
                    already given a brief account of the results obtained by Dr Faraday, which
                    established the identity of all the various kinds of electricity, and the
                    relation by measure of ordinary and voltaic electricity, as obtained by the same
                    distinguished philosopher, and of his new law of electrical conduction.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the identity of character of <hi rend="italic">common</hi> and
                    and <hi rend="italic">voltaic</hi> electricity, the effects which they produce
                    are almost infinitely varied, some of these effects being exalted, while others
                    are diminished. All these variations, however, are explicable by the differences
                    in quantity and intensity of these two kinds of electricity.</p>
                <p>In the case of ordinary electricity, a piece of glass or sealing-wax, excited by
                    friction and kept near the cap of a gold leaf electrometer, will produce a great
                    and instantaneous divergence of the leaves; but in voltaic electricity the same
                    effect is not produced, even by a battery of 100 pair of plates.</p>
                <p>When the extremities or poles of such a battery are examined by the electrometer,
                    they are found to be <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative,</hi> the gold leaves <hi rend="italic">repelling</hi> each other at
                    the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> pole, and <hi rend="italic">attracting</hi> each
                    other at <hi rend="italic">different</hi> poles, even when above half an inch of
                    air intervenes. Hence <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> differs from <hi
                    rend="italic">voltaic</hi> electricity, in having a much higher degree of <hi
                    rend="italic">tension,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intensity,</hi> that is, in
                    acting with a greater elastic force in a given direction. From this property it
                    acts so powerfully on the electrometer, and is discharged with such facility
                    through air, whether highly rarefied or heated. On the other hand, <hi
                    rend="italic">voltaic</hi> differs from <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>
                    electricity in the enormous quantity of electricity which it delevopes and puts
                    in motion, and in the continuity or perpetual reproduction of the current.</p>
                <p>In order to convey some idea of the immense difference in this respect of the two
                    electricities, Dr Faraday has stated that “the chemical action of a grain of
                    water upon four grains of zinc, can evolve electricity equal in quantity to that
                    of a powerful thunder-storm.” That if a Leyden battery is charged with 30 turns
                    of a large and powerful plate electrical machine in full action. It would
                    require 800,000 such charges to supply electricity to decompose a single grain
                    of water, or to equal the quantity which is naturally associated with the
                    elements of that grain of water, endowing them with their mutual chemical
                    affinity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Faraday’s Exp.
                    Researches, p 263, 258, and 861, 873.</p></note> Or to put the comparison
                    differently, the quantity of electricity in 25¼ grains of water is equal to
                    above 24 millions of charges of the Leyden battery above mentioned, or would
                    keep any length of platina wire <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                <p>We have already seen that voltaic electricity at rest, like ordinary electricity,
                    produces attractions and repulsions. We shall therefore proceed to give an
                    account of the effects of voltaic electricity in motion, or of voltaic

                <p>These results are, generally speaking, greatly at variance, the only ones that
                    admit of comparison being those of Becquerel and Mr Snow Harris. Much depends on
                    the purity of the metals; and Mr Harris has ascertained that the conducting
                    power of alloys is very different from that of their component metals. This
                    appears very distinctly from the number for brass, which bears no relation in Μ.
                    Pouillet’s column, to the measures for copper and zinc, and also from his
                    measure for gold of 18 karats, which we find to be only the 7th of copper, and
                    the 6th of fine gold. The conducting power in the same metal increases directly
                    as the area of the section of the wires, and inversely as the length of the
                    wire.</p>
                <p>Μ. Pouillet has found that the same law holds in liquids included in cylindrical
                    tubes. By comparing, in this way, the conducting power of different saline
                    solutions, the conducting wires being formed of the metal whose oxide was in
                    solution, he found, as Fechner had done, that the intensity was rigorously in
                    the direct ratio of the section and the inverse ratio of the conductibility. In
                    this way he found that 433 feet of platinum wire 0·006 inch in diameter, had the
                    same conducting power as a column of saturated solution of sulphate of copper 3¼
                    feet in length, and 0∙8 inch in diameter, from which it follows that the
                    conducting power of the platinum is <hi rend="italic">two million and a
                    half</hi> times greater than that of the solution.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the results of his observations, the conducting power
                    of the copper solution at 59° Fahr., being taken as unity.</p>

                <p>The conducting power of solutions increases as the quantity of salts dissolved,
                    but more slowly as the solution approaches to saturation. The preceding table
                    shows that the <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> solutions have the <hi rend="italic"
                    >greatest,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">alkaline</hi> and neutral solutions,

                <p>The relation between the contractibility of non-metallic bodies in the solid
                    state, and that of the same bodies in the liquid state, has been investigated by
                    Dr Faraday, with his usual ability and success. Having found that a thin plate
                    of <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> stopped the electric current, while the same
                    current passed when the ice was converted into water, Dr Faraday examined a
                    great number of non-metallic solids, and found that they assumed the conducting
                    property during liquefaction, and lost it during congelation; but what was
                    remarkable, all those bodies underwent decomposition when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=716" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0716-0676"
                    />fluid, with the single exception of the <hi rend="italic">periodide of
                    mercury,</hi> which, though it insulated when solid, and conducted when fluid,
                    was not decomposed in the latter state. Dr Faraday found also a great variety of
                    bodies, which acquired no conducting power in the fluid state, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">sulphur, phosphorus,</hi> &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.,</hi> and
                    they were not decomposed in this last state.</p>
                <p>The relation between conduction and decomposition is a very important one; but no
                    less so is the relation of the conducting power for electricity to that for
                    heat. “As the solid becomes a fluid,” says Dr Faraday, “it loses almost entirely
                    the power of conduction for heat, but gains in a high degree that for
                    electricity; but as it reverts back to the solid state. It gains the power of
                    conducting heat, and loses that of conducting electricity.”</p>
                <p>Dr Faraday has given the following summary of the conditions of electric
                    conduction in bodies:—</p>
                <p>“1. All bodies conduct electricity in the same manner from metals to lac and
                    gases, but in very different degrees.</p>
                <p>“2. Conducting power is in some bodies powerfully increased by heat (such as in
                    sulphuret of silver, fluoride of lead, periodide of mercury, and corrosive
                    sublimate), and in others diminished, yet without our perceiving any
                    accompanying essential electrical difference, either in the bodies, or in the
                    changes occasioned by the electricity conducted.</p>
                <p>“3. A numerous class of bodies, insulating electricity of low intensity, when
                    solid, conduct it very freely when fluid, and are then decomposed by it.</p>
                <p>“4. But there are many fluid bodies which do not sensibly conduct electricity of
                    this low intensity; there are some which conduct it, and are not decomposed, nor
                    is fluidity essential to decomposition.</p>
                <p>“5. There is but one body yet discovered (periodide of mercury, to which Dr
                    Faraday subsequently added corrosive sublimate), which, insulating a voltaic
                    current when solid, and conducting it when fluid, is not decomposed in the
                    latter case.</p>
                <p>“6. There is no strict electrical distinction of conduction which can, as yet, be
                    drawn between bodies supposed to be elementary, and those known to be
                    compounds.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Researches,

                    II.— <hi rend="italic">On the Intensity and Direction of Voltaic
                    Currents.</hi></p>
                <p>The two electricities of the pile, when disengaged by the chemical action of its
                    elements, tend continually to reunite and form a neutral fluid, by entering the
                    conducting bodies in their vicinity. The quantity of electricity which remains
                    free, constitutes the <hi rend="italic">tension</hi> of the pile, or the
                    intensity of the current, as we have already explained.</p>
                <p>The tension of the pile is affected by various causes. When its two extremities
                    are united by a metallic arc, the tension at first diminishes rapidly, but the
                    diminution becomes slower and slower, till it reaches its limit, beyond which
                    the tension no longer decreases, however great is the length of time during
                    which the circuit is closed.</p>
                <p>The loss of tension in a given time increases with the number of voltaic couples,
                    and the pile is longer in reaching the limit beyond which the tension does not
                    decrease.</p>
                <p>The loss of tension is more rapid when the liquid exercises a more powerful
                    chemical action on the oxidable metal of the voltaic couple, and the longer it
                    is in reaching the limit of decrease. In these experiments, which we owe to
                    Marianini, the conducting power of the metallic arc has no influence.</p>
                <p>The electric tension lost under the preceding circum stances, is again restored
                    by opening the pile, that is, reversing the metallic arc which united its
                    extremities; but it requires more time to recover its primitive tension, the
                    longer the circuit has been closed.</p>
                <p>In studying the change produced upon the tension when the circuit is not closed
                    by a metallic arc, M. Marianini found, that a battery with new plates loses less
                    tension in a given time, than one with oxidated plates, the new apparatus
                    reaching its limit sooner than the old one. In piles consisting of gold and zinc
                    couples, tension diminishes more rapidly than in the ordinary pile, and reaches
                    its limit in a very short time; whi1st in piles with lead and zinc, the tension
                    diminishes less rapidly than with copper and zinc.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> as well as the intensity of electric
                    currents, depends on the degree of chemical action exerted by the liquid on one
                    of the metals, particularly the most oxidable one. When the liquid and the
                    metals are therefore known, the direction of the current can be predicted. The
                    metal most acted upon takes away from the liquid negative electricity. Zinc, for
                    example, is more attacked by brine than copper, and therefore takes from the
                    brine its negative electricity; but if the liquid is a solution of sulphuret of
                    potassium, which affects the copper more than the zinc, the copper will take
                    from the solution its negative electricity, and the current will take an
                    opposite direction. Hence, in a pile with brine, the <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi>
                    extremity will give <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> electricity; whereas, in a
                    pile with a solution of sulphuret of potassium, the <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi>
                    extremity will give <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> electricity.</p>
                <p>M. Delarive obtained the following interesting results, by immersing different
                    voltaic couples in nitric acid of different strengths. Each metal in the two
                    columns is <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> in relation to the one which precedes
                    it.</p>

                    chemical action of the fluid. With a voltaic couple of <hi rend="italic"
                    >iron</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arsenic,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">iron</hi>
                    is strongly <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> compared with the arsenic, when they
                    are immersed in diluted acid, which acts slightly upon the arsenic; but when
                    they are immersed in potash kept in fusion, the <hi rend="italic">arsenic,</hi>
                    upon which the potash acts powerfully, becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive.</hi></p>
                <p>M. Delarive has illustrated this branch of science with a number of valuable
                    experiments on the changes produced upon electric currents, while passing
                    through liquid conductors, interrupted by metallic plates. The following are the
                    results at which he arrived :—</p>
                <p>1. One or more metallic laminae (platina), placed perpendicularly to the
                    direction of the electric current, in a liquid conductor, diminish the intensity
                    of the current which traverses them.</p>
                <p>2. This diminution is almost nothing when the electric current is very energetic,
                    and proceeds from a pile containing a great number of couples; but the intensity
                    diminishes the more rapidly in passing through the same number of plates, as its
                    original intensity is less energetic.</p>
                <p>3. If one or two electrical currents of the same intensity, the one an original
                    one, and the other one which has previously passed through several metallic
                    plates, the first will have its intensity much more diminished by the
                    interposition of a plate than the second. Hence, these currents have <pb

                    stated by BecquereD, as light and heat which have passed through absorbing
                    media.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Becquerel, to
                    whose excellent work we are indebted for the latest and best information on this
                    subject, asks, “if we will from analogy say, that the current, in traversing
                    different plates, <hi rend="italic">acquires</hi> a polarisation similar to that
                    of light.” Certainly not. When while light passes through a certain thickness of
                    any coloured medium, or any similar number of coloured plates. It loses a
                    certain portion of its rays, say 9-10ths, and the transmitted light is red. Now,
                    this <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light may be transmitted through the same number
                    of the same plates, and yet not lose 1-10th of its light; but there is no
                    polarisation. The first plates absorbed all the rays but the red. and having the
                    property of transmitting the red rays freely and more copiously than any other,
                    they passed through in greater abundance. As these transmissions are all at a
                    vertical incidence, polarisation can have nothing to do with the
                    matter.</p></note> We have no doubt, therefore, that currents which have passed
                    through plates of metals, will have thus acquired, or have possessed previous to
                    their separation, other properties than that of passing more freely through
                    other metallic plates.</p>
                <p>From the preceding results, M. Delarive has explained the difference between the
                    effects of a pile with a small number of couples, and a pile with a larger
                    number. The first produces more easily the effects which took place when the
                    circuit is closed by a very good conductor, while the second may be best
                    employed in producing phenomena which take place in the circuit of an imperfect
                    conductor, such as a fluid, the transmitted currents in the latter case having
                    acquired, in passing through a greater number of plates, a greater facility of
                    traversing an imperfect conductor.</p>
                <p>As the intensity of the electric current had been found to increase with the
                    surface, acted upon by the fluid, M. Delarive endeavoured to determine the law
                    of increase. He found that an increase of surface facilitated the transmission
                    of the current; that the augmentation of intensity produced by a greater extent
                    of surface, increased in a <hi rend="italic">greater ratio than the surface</hi>
                    when the current is <hi rend="italic">feeble,</hi> and in a less ratio when the
                    current is intense; so that we gain more by increasing the surface when the
                    current is weak than when it is strong.</p>
                <p>With regard to the influence of fluid conductors in diminishing the intensity of
                    the electric current, Μ. Delarive found that nitric acid diminishes the
                    intensity least, then muriatic acid, then sulphuric acid. Nitric acid, pure and
                    greatly diluted, produces a less diminution than concentrated acid. The contrary
                    takes place with sulphuric acid, which is a bad conductor. The silver solution
                    came next, then potash and ammonia, which differ little from each other.</p>

                <p>The phenomena of light and heat, and the ignition of metals and wires by ordinary
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> having been fully described under that
                    article, we shall here confine ourselves to the analogous phenomena produced by
                    voltaic currents.</p>
                <p>Soon after the discovery of the pile, Van Marum, Pfaff, and Tromsdorff discovered
                    that thin leaves and fine wires of metal placed between the poles of a pile,
                    became incandescent. and even burned while conducting the electrical current;
                    and some time afterwards, M.M. Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Thenard observed that
                    piles with large plates deflagrated metals more powerfully than piles with a
                    great number of plates of smaller surfaces.</p>
                <p>It was in England, however, that the calorific and luminous effects of the pile
                    were principally developed. In 1813, the immense battery of the Royal
                    Institution, composed of 2000 couples, and exposing 28,000 square inches,
                    enabled Sir H. Davy to produce light and heat of the highest intensity. When the
                    ends of the wire from each pile terminated in two charcoal points, the most
                    dazzling light passed from the one to the other, and continued for several
                    hours. Platina, sapphire, quartz, and lime, &amp;c., when exposed to this source
                    of heat, were instantly melted, and the diamond and charcoal disappeared, as if
                    they were completely volatilised; and these effects were produced in vacuo as
                    well as in air.</p>
                <p>By means of the splendid battery described in a preceding part of this article,
                    Mr Children obtained many important and curious results. His experiments
                    commenced in 1809, but it was in 1815 that he brought into play the powerful
                    instrument which we have already mentioned. He found that metallic wires
                    connecting the two piles of the battery became red-hot in the following order
                    :—</p>
                <p>Platinum. Copper. Zinc. Iron. Gold. Silver.</p>
                <p>And hence Mr Children concluded, that the conducting power of these metals was in
                    the inverse order, silver being the most conducting, and platinum the least.</p>
                <p>With this battery, five feet six inches of platinum wire, 0∙11 inch in diameter,
                    were brought by Mr Children to a red heat throughout, so as to be visible in
                    day-light.</p>
                <p>Eight feet six inches of platinum wire, 0∙44 inch in diameter, were heated
                    red.</p>
                <p>A bar of platinum <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>
                    th of an inch square, and 2∙25 inches long, was heated red, and fused at the
                    end.</p>
                <p>The oxides of tungsten, uranium, cerium, titanium, and molybdenium, were fused.
                    Having filled an opening in an iron wire with diamond powder, the diamond
                    disappeared, and the iron was converted into steel.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ See Phil. Trans. 1815.</p></note></p>
                <p>At the same time that Mr Children was constructing the greatest voltaic battery
                    ever made, Dr Wollaston was occupied in constructing the smallest. He took a
                    small thimble, and having removed the bottom, he flattened the remaining
                    cylinder, till its sides were about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> th of an inch distant. He then placed between these two
                    surfaces a small plate of zinc, which did not touch either side of the thimble.
                    With a platinum wire about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 40</hi> th of an inch long, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3000</hi> dth of an inch in diameter, he united externally the
                    plate of zinc with this thimble; and when this little galvanic couple was
                    immersed in acidulated water, the platinum wire became red-hot, and was melted!
                    This important result led Dr Wollaston to the valuable conclusion, that in order
                    to obtain powerful calorific effects, we must increase the surface of the copper
                    in negative metal.</p>
                <p>In repeating the experiments of Davy on the light developed by charcoal points,
                    Μ. Brandes discovered that this light, like that of the sun, affected the
                    combination of chlorine and hydrogen, and the decomposition of muriate of silver
                    and other bodies.</p>
                <p>By means of the powerful voltaic battery, which Dr Hare calls a <hi rend="italic"
                    >deflagrator,</hi> and which we have already described, this able chemist
                    obtained some splendid results. A brilliant light, equal to that of the sun, was
                    produced between charcoal points; and plumbago and charcoal were fused by
                    Professors Silliman and Griscom. By a series of 250, baryta was deflagrated; and
                    a platina wire, <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi>
                    ths of an inch in thickness, “was made to flow like water.” In the experiments
                    with charcoal, the charcoal on the copper side had no appearance of fusion, but
                    a crater-shaped cavity<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=718" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0718-0678"/>
                    was formed within it, indicating that the charcoal was volatilised at this side,
                    and transferred to the other, where it was condensed and fused, the piece of
                    charcoal at this pile being elongated considerably. This fused charcoal was four
                    times denser than before fusion.</p>
                <p>Owing to its superior conducting power, a continued voltaic current will
                    maintain, in a state of incandescence, a greater length of silver wire than of
                    platinum or iron; but if we form a wire of short pieces of silver and platinum
                    wire alternately, the platinum portion will become red-hot, while the silver
                    ones remain cold. In this case, the current which passes readily along the
                    silver wire, encounters the degree of obstruction in the platinum which produces
                    the red heat. This fact is no doubt connected with the very remarkable one
                    observed by M. Peltier, in the passage of weak currents through metallic
                    circuits, where <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> was produced at the points of
                    junction of certain crystallizable metals.</p>

                    Voltaic Electricity.</hi></p>
                <p>In a preceding article we have given a full account of the general chemical
                    effects of <hi rend="italic">ordinary electricity.</hi> We shall therefore
                    confine ourselves at present to the chemical effects of the voltaic pile. No
                    sooner was this apparatus made known in England, than Messrs Nicholson and
                    Carlisle applied it to chemical inquiries. Although Volta had inferred from the
                    shock, that the action of the pile was electrical, yet it was to the above
                    inquirers that we are indebted for determining by means of the revolving
                    doubler, that the <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> end of the battery was in a <hi
                    rend="italic">negative,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> end in a
                    positive state of electricity. In the course of their experiments, they observed
                    a disengagement of gas, which smelt of hydrogen, from water which happened to be
                    in the circuit; and on the 2d of May 1800, they discovered that water was
                    decomposed into its elements, viz. oxygen and hydrogen, when the water formed
                    part of the circuit between the positive and negative ends of the pile. Mr
                    Cruickshanks of Woolwich confirmed this result, and found that <hi rend="italic"
                    >hydrogen</hi> was always emitted from the <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">copper</hi> end of the pile, and <hi rend="italic">oxygen</hi>
                    from the other. He discovered also the important fact, that metals could be
                    revived from their solutions, under the same circumstances, the reduced metal
                    being deposited at the end of the wire; and he succeeded in decomposing some of
                    the neutral salts. Dr Henry decomposed the nitric and sulphuric acids and
                    ammonia; and he reduced the oxymuriatic to the state of muriatic acid.</p>
                <p>The attention of our illustrious countryman, Sir H. Davy, was about this time
                    attracted to the subject. So early as 1802, he had made experiments on the
                    chemical agency of the pile; but in 1806, in his first Bakerian Lecture, he was
                    led to the conclusion, <hi rend="italic">that chemical attraction and repulsion
                    were produced by the same cause, acting in the one case on particles, in the
                    other on masses, and that the same property, under different circumstances, was
                    the cause of all the phenomena exhibitedby differ entvoltaic combinations.</hi>
                    In October 1807, he decomposed potash and soda, and proved that they were oxides
                    of two new metals, <hi rend="italic">potassium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sodium.</hi> With a voltaic battery of 2000 plates, he decomposed several of
                    the earths, and discovered their metallic bases, <hi rend="italic">barium,
                    strontium, calcium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">magnesium.</hi> In attempting to
                    decompose the proper earths, he was less successful. He succeeded in proving,
                    however, that they consist of bases united to oxygen, but the completion of the
                    inquiry was left to Wohler, Bussy, and Berzelius, who found that all the bases
                    of these earths, except silica, were metallic, and capable of uniting with
                    iron.<note anchored="false" cert="medium" place="bottom" resp="pl"

                    of different philosophers, in effecting decompositions by the voltaic battery.
                    We shall content ourselves with giving a brief account of the researches of our
                    distinguished countryman, Dr Faraday, to whom this branch of science owes its
                    greatest acquisitions.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of electro-chemical decomposition have been generally ascribed to
                    two opposite powers residing in the two poles of the voltaic battery.

                    1806, tom. lviii. p. 61,</p></note> regards the pile as an electric magnet with
                    <hi rend="italic">attracting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">repelling</hi> poles,
                    the one attracting hydrogen and repelling oxygen, and the other attracting
                    oxygen and repelling hydrogen. The force exerted upon each molecule of the body
                    is supposed to be inversely as its distance from the poles, and a succession of
                    decompositions and recompositions is supposed to exist among the intervening
                    molecules. Sir H. Davy adopts the idea of attractions at the poles, diminishing
                    to the middle or neutral points, and he thinks a succession of decompositions
                    and recompositions probable. Messrs Riffault and Champre regard the <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> current as collecting and carrying the acids on to
                    they <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> pole, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> current as doing the same, with the bases toward* the <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> pole. Μ. Biot attributes the effects to the opposite
                    electrical states of the decomposing substances in the vicinity of the two
                    poles. M. de la Rive considers the portions decomposed to be those contiguous to
                    both poles, the current from the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> pole combining
                    with the hydrogen or the bases which are there present, and leaving the oxygen
                    or acids at liberty, but carrying the substances in union with it across to the
                    negative pole, where it is separated from them, entering the conducting metal,
                    and leaving on its surface the hydrogen, or its bases. Dr Faraday regards the
                    poles as exercising no specific action, but merely as surfaces or doors by which
                    the electricity enters into or passes out of the substance undergoing
                    decomposition. He supposes that “the effects are due to a modification of the
                    electric current, and the chemical affinity of the particles through or by which
                    that current is passing, giving them the power of acting more forcibly in one
                    direction than in another, and consequently making them travel by a series of
                    successive decompositions and recompositions in opposite directions, and finally
                    causing their expulsion or exclusion at the boundaries of the body under
                    decomposition in the direction of the current, and that in larger or smaller
                    quantities, according as the current is more or less powerful.</p>
                <p>In resolving a compound body into its elements, liquidity is an essential
                    condition of the body. A plate of iron, the 16th of an inch thick, placed
                    between the two sides of the pile, will stop completely the most powerful
                    electrical current.</p>
                <p>When the elements of a body are separated by electric action, the current
                    communicates to each a definite direction, the oxygen travelling towards the
                    zinc, and the hydrogen towards the platina pole.</p>
                <p>By an irresistible body of evidence, Dr Faraday has established the important
                    proposition, “that the chemical power of a current of electricity is in direct
                    proportion to the absolute quantity which passes and this is true of all bodies
                    capable of electro-chemical decomposition.</p>
                <p>The same eminent philosopher has also deduced, from a variety of facts, the
                    following conclusion, “that the quantity of electricity, which, being naturally
                    associated with the particles of matter, gives them their combining power, is
                    able, when thrown into a current, to separate these particles from their state
                    of combination; or, in other words, that <hi rend="italic">the electricity which
                    decomposes, and that which is evolved by the decomposition of a certain quantity
                    of matter, are alike.”</hi> According to this theory, “the equivalent weights of
                    bodies are simply those quantities of them which contain equal quantities of
                    electricity, or have naturally equal electric<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=719" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0719-0679"/>
                    powers. It being the <hi rend="italic">electricity</hi> which determines the
                    equivalent number, because it determines the combining force; or if we adopt the
                    atomic theory or phraseology, then the atoms of bodies which are equivalents to
                    each other in their ordinary chemical action, have equal quantities of
                    electricity naturally associated with them.”</p>
                <p>When exposed to the voltaic current, bodies are decomposed with different degrees
                    of facility. Dr Faraday found by experiment, that the following bodies were
                    decomposed with currents of different intensities, those at the top of the list
                    being decomposed by currents of lowest intensity.</p>

                    discovered the very remarkable fact, that metals and other bodies had the power
                    of promoting the combination of gaseous bodies. When a plate of clean platinum
                    was put into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gas, the two gases gradually
                    disappeared, in consequence of having united and formed water. When the platinum
                    plate was made very clean, by placing it in sulphuric acid. It acted with such
                    energy on the gases, that the tube became warm, the platina became red-hot, and
                    the residue of the gases was inflamed. A solution of tartaric or acetic acids
                    gave the platinum plate the power of producing explosion in the mixed gases, but
                    strong sulphuric acid was most certain and powerful. <hi rend="italic">Gold</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">palladium,</hi> when acted on by hot oil of vitriol,
                    possess also the power of combining oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Dobereiner had previously discovered the remarkable property possessed by
                    platinum, which, in the state of a fine black powder, or spongy, became hot, and
                    ignited a jet of hydrogen. This is the well known instantaneous light apparatus.
                    The following is the theory of these remarkable facts. The particles of hydrogen
                    repel each other, so do those of oxygen; but the strong adhesion of the gaseous
                    particles to the platina suspends, as it were, upon its surface, the above
                    repulsive forces, and brings the particles of oxygen and hydrogen within the
                    influence of their mutual affinity.</p>
                <p>Spongy platinum also decomposes ammonia, and its salts when mixed with
                    atmospheric air, and passed over the metal at 572° of Fahr. Non-metallic bodies,
                    such as pounded glass and charcoal, have, at 600° Fahr., the same property as
                    platinum.</p>

                <p>The precipitation of metals from their solutions, by the presence of other
                    metals, has been long known. A plate of copper, for example, will throw down
                    metallic silver from a solution of the nitrate. Ritter, Sylvester, and Bucholz
                    found that these precipitations were owing to electric currents, and obtained
                    some interesting results. It is to Μ. Becquerel, however, a distinguished member
                    of the lnsti-tute of France, that we owe the successful investigation of this
                    curious subject. In 1826, he found that, by very feeble electric forces, metals
                    easily reducible were precipitated from their solutions, by plates of the same
                    metal as that held ln solution. In 1627, he formed chlorides and iodides in the
                    same way, and also double chlorides and double iodides. In 1829, he succeeded in
                    forming sulphureis, iodides, and bromides by similar methods; and when the
                    electric energy of the apparatus was exceedingly feeble, and the decomposition
                    slow, the sulphurets had time to assume a regular crystalline form, and he thus
                    obtained crystals of almost all the metals. In a similar manner, he obtained
                    distinct crystals of the metallic iodides.</p>
                <p>In 1830, M. Becquerel found that new compounds were formed during these
                    processes, by the reaction of the oxide of the metal at the positive pole of a
                    solution. By the reaction of two solutions, one of which was the
                    sulpho-carbonate of potash, and the other the sulphate of copper, and by
                    employing an arc of copper and lead, the copper plunging into the sulphate, and
                    the lead into the sulpho-carbonate, he succeeded in depositing on the lead small
                    octahedral crystals of sulphur, with rhomboidal faces, exactly si.</p>

                <p>milar to the natural crystals of this substance. In this manner, by a skilful
                    combination of solutions and metallic arcs, and a profound knowledge of the
                    reactions which arise from the contact of these different substances, he
                    succeeded in obtaining, in a crystalline state, compounds which had never been
                    procured under that form.</p>
                <p>Μ. Becquerel has been equally successful in reducing the bases of certain oxides,
                    and in obtaining immediately from their solutions, in their metallic, and even
                    crystallised state, iron, zirconium, glucium, and magnesium. In 1832, he also
                    obtained crystals of metallic oxides, such as those of the anhydrous black oxide
                    of copper, of the red oxide, of the protoxide and peroxide of lead, and the
                    oxide of cobalt.</p>
                <p>The same distinguished philosopher has employed the effects of weak electric
                    forces to explain the process of cementation, by which iron is converted into
                    steel, by the combination of carbon with all the interior molecules of the iron;
                    and that remarkable mineralogical process by which the elements of many rocks
                    are transferred from within to without, and replaced by others without any
                    disintegration. The process of cementation is the consequence of the opposite
                    electric state of the carbon and the iron, which, with the aid of high
                    temperature, produces electric currents that convey the atoms of carbon from
                    molecule to molecule to the very interior of the iron. In like manner, pieces of
                    iron, which have been buried in the metallic state, are almost wholly oxidated;
                    and ancient copper medals have been found changed entirely into the protoxide of
                    copper.</p>
                <p>By studying this class of phenomena, Μ. Becquerel has been led to an explanation
                    of the phenomena of phosphorescence, which he ascribes to the recomposition of
                    the natural electricities of each molecule, which have been separated by heat or
                    some other cause. The restoration of phosphorescence to bodies that have lost
                    this property, or that never possessed it, by repeated electrical discharges, as
                    ascertained by Mr Pearsal, confirms the ingenious explanation of M.
                    Becquerel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Ann. de

                <p>Our countryman, Mr Andrew Crosse of Bromfield, by processes differing from those
                    of Becquerel, arrived at similar results, not long after the publication of the
                    discoveries of the French philosopher. There can be no doubt, however, that Mr
                    Crosse was unacquainted with these discoveries; and that his results were
                    entirely independent of them. By means of voltaic electricity, he obtained the
                    following substances, namely, calcareous spar, arragonite, quartz, red oxide of
                    copper, arseniate of copper, blue carbonate of copper, phosphate of copper,
                    sulphuret of copper, carbonate of lead, sulphuret of silver, carbonate of zinc,
                    chalcedony, oxide of tin, yellow oxide of lead, the sulphurets of antimony and
                    zinc and iron, protoxide of iron, and crystals of sulphur.</p>

                <p>This new class of phenomena are remarkable from their beauty and singularity, as
                    discovered by Μ. Nobili. They may be produced by a small battery like that of
                    Wollaston, with twelve elements of an inch square, in the manner shown in fig.
                    46. A small apparatus, not shown in the figure, is constructed so as to move up
                    and down the pincers R S, which hold two pieces of large platinum wire P N,
                    pointed at their extremity, the one communicating with the positive, and the
                    other with the negative pole of the battery. A polished metallic plate A B,
                    intended to receive the coloured rings, is placed horizontally in a saucer or
                    plate which contains the fluid to be used, suppose a solution of sulphate of
                    copper.</p>
                <p>When the solution of copper is poured into the saucer above the silver plate AB,
                    and the point of one of the wires N brought as near as possible to <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> while the other point <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is plunged
                    in the solution, there will be formed round the point <hi rend="italic">n,
                    four</hi> or <hi rend="italic">five</hi> concentric circles, alternately bright
                    and dark. When the point <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> is used, there will be formed
                    round it <hi rend="italic">three</hi> small circles of copper. The <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> extreme circles are of a deep red colour, and the middle
                    one of a higher colour; sometimes <hi rend="italic">four</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">five</hi> are formed, which alternate like the preceding.</p>
                <p>When a solution of <hi rend="italic">acetate of lead</hi> is used, and the plate
                    of gold or silver is positive, while the point is negative, the concentric rings
                    are as brilliant as the coloured rings of Newton. When we increase the number of
                    negative points, there are formed as many systems as there are points of
                    concentric wires or rings which never cross each other, but which, when they
                    meet, extend outwards so as to form only one exterior ring.</p>
                <p>The effects are the reverse with a solution of <hi rend="italic">acetate of
                    copper,</hi> that is, the concentric rings are formed only when the plates are
                    negative, while positive plates exhibit nothing remarkable.</p>
                <p>When the fluid is <hi rend="italic">urine</hi> and the plate silver and positive,
                    several orders of very brilliant-coloured rings are formed round a dark centre.
                    Μ. Nobili has obtained very remarkable effects of colour by using different
                    animal substances, such as milk, white and yoke of an egg, saliva, &amp;c. and
                    vegetable substances, such as the juice of carrots, onions, parsley, grapes,
                    apples, &amp;c. Animal and vegetable substances yield colours more beautiful and
                    brilliant than ordinary chemical solutions. The colours produced by the leaves
                    of plants are more marked than those arising from the decomposition of the
                    roots. In some chemical solutions the phenomena are equally beautiful on the
                    positive as on the negative plate; but when the circles meet, the two figures
                    experience, as it were, a sort of compression, and when the coloured rings are
                    impressed only on one plate, they may be made to disappear, if not wholly, at
                    least in part, by inverting the direction of the current.</p>
                <p>Μ. Nobili has drawn the following conclusions from a great number of
                    experiments:—1. Certain electro-negative substances possess the property, in
                    some circumstances, of attaching themselves to the surface of some of the less
                    oxidable metals, in layers so thin and regular as to exhibit under an infinity
                    of varied forms, the beautiful phenomena of coloured rings. 2. That when
                    electro-negative substances do not deposit themselves in thin layers on polished
                    metals, they attack their surface, not uniformly, but at regular intervals.</p>
                <p>The most varied and remarkable appearances were obtained by Μ. Nobili when the
                    polished metal was positive; but he succeeded in obtaining equally remarkable
                    phenomena when the metal was negative, either by augmenting the force of the
                    current, or by using compound solutions.</p>
                <p>He took, for example, a mixture of acetate of copper and nitrate of potash, and
                    upon a negative plate of silver he formed a series of concentric rings, the
                    centre of which retained the metallic brilliancy. The two next circles were
                    green, then came rings of white, red, and green, then a zone of copper of a fine
                    red colour. This zone was surrounded with a blue circle, marked with radiating
                    lines, like a graduated circumference. Its rays extending even to the circle of
                    copper: Then came a second copper zone wider than the first, but equally
                    brilliant, surrounded with a circle of beautiful green, which terminated the
                    figure. The same appearances were obtained on gold and platina.<note

                <p>The galvanic shock is not conveyed through the skin of the human hand in the same
                    manner as the electric shock. This arises from its low intensity, in consequence
                    of which it can be transmitted only through good conductors. The best way is to
                    grasp with both hands wet, two silver spoons, or two metallic belts, and by
                    means of them form a connection between the poles of the battery.</p>
                <p>A luminous spark is produced by voltaic electricity, when the eye forms part of
                    the circuit. This may be done by placing a piece of silver between the gums and
                    the upper lip, and inserting a silver probe into the nostrils. If a piece of
                    zinc is then laid upon the tongue, and the two metals brought into contact, the
                    flash will be seen. This, and other affections of the eye, were observed by
                    Ritter, who declares that when the positive pole was inserted, in his eye he <hi
                    rend="italic">saw objects darker and less,</hi> and when the negative pole acted
                    upon the eye, he saw the same objects <hi rend="italic">brighter and
                    larger.</hi> But according to Purkinje, the only difference is, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> pole excites less light than the negative pole.
                    Purkinje also observed, that by the application of the positive pole to the eye,
                    a <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> light was excited, while the <hi rend="italic"

                    principally at the base of the optic nerve, and at the <hi rend="italic">foramen
                    centrale</hi> of the retina. With the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> pole the
                    base of the nerve exhibited a bright <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light, and
                    the dark foramen was surrounded with a double rhomboidal limb of <hi

                    pole the base of the nerve was <hi rend="italic">black,</hi> and the foramen was
                    <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> and surrounded with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet</hi> rhomboidal limb, at a little distance from the foramen. He noticed
                    also, that when the voltaic circuit was broken, the preceding colours passed
                    into their opposite or complementary ones.</p>

                <p>The influence of voltaic electricity upon the muscles of animals after death, is
                    very remarkable. This subject has been recently investigated by Marianini,
                    Nobili, Peltier, and Becquerel; but our limits will not permit us to give even
                    the shortest account of their labours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    content ourselves with mentioning a few interesting facts. If the negative and
                    positive wires are inserted in the ears of an ox or sheep taken from the body of
                    the animal recently killed, strong convulsive motions will be excited in the
                    muscles of the face, whenever the circuit is completed, provided the battery
                    have an hundred pair of plates. Lite seems to be restored, and the animal to be
                    under great suffering. The eyes open and shut, and roll in their sockets; the
                    pupils dilate; the nostrils expand and vibrate; and the jaws move as in
                    mastication. If a horse is subjected to powerful galvanic action, when recently
                    killed, the struggles of its limbs can scarcely be restrained by several
                    persons.</p>
                <p>Similar experiments were made in Glasgow in 1811, by Dr Ure, on the body of a
                    criminal after execution. He used a battery of 270 pair of four inch plates.
                    When the spinal marrow and sciatic nerve were made the points of communication
                    with the positive and negative poles, the whole body shudderea as with cold. The
                    left side was most powerfully convulsed; and upon moving one of the rods from
                    the hip to the heel, the knee being previously bent, the leg was thrown out with
                    such violence as nearly to knock over one of the assistants. By acting upon the
                    nerves connected with the respiratory system, a laborious breathing instantly
                    commenced, and the chest heaved and sunk. When a communication was made between
                    the super-orbital nerve and the heels, “most extraordinary grimaces,” says Dr
                    Ure, “were exhibited, by running the wire in my hand over the edges of the
                    plates in the last trough, from the 220th to the 278th pair. Thus, fifty shocks,
                    each greater than the preceding ones, were given in two seconds. Every muscle of
                    his countenance was simultaneously thrown into fearful action. Rage, horror,
                    despair, and anguish, and ghastly smiles, united their hideous expression in the
                    murderer’s face, surpassing far the wildest representations of a Fuseli or a
                    Kean. At this period, several of the spectators were obliged to leave the room,
                    from terror or sickness, and one gentleman fainted.” The last experiment made by
                    Dr Ure consisted in transmitting the voltaic current from the spinal marrow to
                    the ulnar nerve. “The fingers now moved nimbly, like those of a violin
                    performer. An assistant who tried to close the fist, found the hand to open
                    forcibly in spite of his efforts. When one rod was applied to a slight incision
                    on the top of the fore finger, the fist being previously clenched, the fingers
                    extended instantly; and from the convulsive agitation of the arm, he seemed to
                    point to the different spectators, some of whom thought he had come to life." In
                    these experiments the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> wire communicated with the
                    <hi rend="italic">nerve,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> with the
                    <hi rend="italic">muscles.</hi></p>
                <p>M. Becquerel mentions he effect produced by a pile of 100 plates, upon the head
                    of a person who had been guillotined. The two poles of the pile communicated
                    with the two ears, wetted with salt water. The muscles of the face experienced
                    the strongest contractions, and the action of the eye-lids was extremely
                    distinct. Aldini obtained analogous, though feebler effects, in experiments on a
                    body after a natural death. Experiments of a similar kind have been made upon
                    insects and fishes. Μ. Zanotti of Bologna, having killed a cigala,
                    (grasshopper,) he placed it in contact with the two extremities of the pile,
                    when it immediately moved, and emitted the sounds which are peculiar to it. M.
                    Becquerel mentions also, that a fish whose head had been cut off half an hour
                    before, struck the table with its tail, when excited by the voltaic current, and
                    its whole body leaped about the table.</p>

                    of Electric currents.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr Faraday has shown that many cases of voltaic decomposition of substances held
                    in solution by water, such as nitric acid, ammonia, &amp;c., are due not to the
                    direct action of the current, but to the secondary agency of the elements of
                    decomposed water. He, however, conceived that the hydracids in solution are
                    directly decomposed by the current. Mr Connell has endeavoured to show that the
                    decomposition of these substances also is secondary. This he did by connecting
                    them by asbestus with distilled water, and making the acid negative and the
                    water positive, when it was found that no chlorine or iodine was carried to the
                    positive pole until after some time, when the acid itself had been carried over;
                    whereas, when the battery was reversed so as to cause evolution of oxygen in the
                    acid solution, chlorine or iodine immediately appeared by the combination of the
                    nascent oxygen with hydrogen of the hydracid. From an extensive series of
                    experiments on solutions in water, alcohol, and other solvents, Mr Connell has
                    been <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=722"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0722-0682"/>led to the general conclusion, that “when
                    solutions of primary combinations of elementary bodies in water, and in those
                    liquids, such as alcohol and pyroxylic spirit, which contain water as such as an
                    essential constituent, are submitted to voltaic agency, the dissolved substance
                    is not directly decomposed by the current, but only the water of the solvent.”
                    The rule of course does not include solutions of combinations of the second
                    order, such as ordinary salts, consisting of an acid and an alkali, but those of
                    primary compounds of elementary bodies, such as acids, alkalies, &amp;C.<note

                <p>When absolute alcohol, holding a minute quantity of pure caustic potash in
                    solution, such as <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    500</hi>, is subjected to moderate voltaic agency, hydrogen gas is evolved from
                    the negative pole, and no elastic fluid from the positive; and if a powerful
                    battery, such as 200 pairs of four-inch plates, is employed, the same effect is
                    obtained with absolute alcohol holding nothing in solution. A long investigation
                    showed that this result is due to the direct voltaic decomposition of the water
                    entering into the constitution of absolute alcohol; its hydrogen being evolved
                    at the negative pole, and its oxygen being engaged in producing various
                    secondary changes on the hydro-carbon of the alcohol. The effect of the potash
                    is merely to give conducting power to the alcohol, and to favour the secondary
                    action by its affinity for some of the secondary products. The addition of a
                    minute quantity of potassium answers better than that of the hydrate of potass,
                    because we thus, by the oxidation of the potassium, in effect add anhydrous
                    potass, and avoid any addition of water, although in reality the water of the
                    hydrate has no influence whatever on the result. Even <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10000</hi> of potass has a very decided effect in
                    promoting the voltaic agency, and various other saline bodies when dissolved

                    constitution of absolute alcohol. A similar conclusion was drawn from similar
                    experiments on the analogous substance, pyroxylic spirit.</p>
                <p>It was found that pure rectified ether showed no symptom whatever of
                    decomposition, when acted on by 200 pairs of four-inch plates; nor did the
                    previous solution in it of as much caustic potass as it could take up, lead to
                    any action of the voltaic current. It was therefore concluded that ether is not
                    a hydrate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Transactione

                <p>There is perhaps no science, not even excepting chemistry, which has made such
                    donations to the fine and useful arts as voltaic electricity. Those which depend
                    on galvanism are the art of protecting the copper sheathing of ships; the
                    galvano-plastic art, or that of multiplying works of art in metals,
                    electro-metallurgy, and the reduction of the metals, the electrotype, or the art
                    of copying and multiplying engravings, and galvanic etchings.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Protection of copper Sheathing.</hi> This art, invented by
                    Sir H. Davy, has been already sufficiently described in our article, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Davy,</hi> vol. 7, p. 662.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Art of Multiplying Works of Art in Metal.</hi> This
                    beautiful art seems to have been invented about the same time by Mr Jacobi of St
                    Petersburg, and Mr Spencer of Liverpool. Mr Jacobi, who announced his discovery
                    in October 1831, called it the galvano-plastic process, and Mr Spencer had,
                    previous to the knowledge of Mr Jacobis' labours, executed medals in copper,
                    which were called electrotypes or voltatypes. Both Mr Jacobi and Mr Spencer had
                    confined their invention to the deposition of copper upon metallic bodies; but
                    Mr Murray announced in January 1840, that non-conducting substances, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">plaster of Paris, wax, wood,</hi> &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.,</hi>
                    might have metallic copper thrown down upon them by previously <hi rend="italic"
                    >metallising</hi> their surface with black lead.</p>
                <p>The single cell apparatus for taking casts of coin and medals is shewn in fig.
                    47, which consists of an outer vessel A, containing a saturated solution of
                    sulphate of copper, and some undissolved crystals of the sulphate suspended near
                    the upper surface of the fluid. The medal <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> to be
                    copied, is suspended in the copper solution. The inner vessel B, made of porous
                    earthenware, contains the usual dilute acid, which acts upon a rod or plate of
                    zinc Z, the upper end of which is connected with the bent wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi> which suspends the medal <hi rend="italic">m</hi>. When the medal has
                    remained two or three hours in the copper solution, the copper will be found to
                    have deposited itself on every part of its surface, so as to afford a perfect
                    intaglio or <hi rend="italic">hollow</hi> impression of the medal. If the
                    surface of the medal or any part of it is greased, no copper will be deposited
                    on the greased part. The obverse and reverse of the coin or medal being thus
                    copied, and the two retained at their proper distance, the next step is to place
                    them at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in the copper solution, and we obtain in the
                    same manner a <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> impression from the intaglio one,
                    accurately resembling the original.</p>
                <p>Instead of obtaining the intaglio cast directly in copper it is thought best to
                    take it either in fusible or type metal, or in some non-conducting substance,
                    such as sealing wax, bees’ wax, rosin, plaster of Paris, stearine, &amp;c. When
                    nonconducting substances are employed, those which are absorbent, such as
                    plaster of Paris, must be prevented from absorbing the fluid, by rubbing the
                    surface of the intaglio mould with tallow or spermaceti; they are then to be
                    metallised by covering their surface with black lead.</p>
                <p>When we wish to form gold and silver medals, a gold or silver surface is
                    necessary, as non-conducting bodies are not well fitted for this branch of the
                    art. For a gold medal, a strong nitro-muriatic solution of gold should be used,
                    and the medal to be copied should, according to Mr Smee, be connected with the
                    zinc end of a series of from four to twelve batteries. A very fine platinum
                    wire, according to the same author, immersed in the solution<note

                    the battery, and the deposit of gold will then take place. For silver medals a
                    solution of the nitrate, sulphate, or acetate, may be used. The solution should
                    be weak at first, and then gradually increased. If we do not wish to have the
                    whole medal of solid gold and silver, a thin layer may be deposited, and the
                    rest completed by copper. On the same principles medals of platinum or palladium
                    may be formed from their solution. Great care must be taken to prevent bubbles
                    of air from forming on the mould.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of coining large medals gives great value to this art. Mr Smee
                    mentions a very fine medal of Boulton, about four inches in diameter, which
                    required no less than 300 blows to insure a perfect impression. Seals <pb

                    difficulty of procuring good and pure copper plate for engraving, has been
                    entirely removed by this new art. A prepared copper plate with a good surface
                    may have copper deposited on its surface, so that the deposited plate has the
                    same perfect surface, with the additional advantage of consisting of pure
                    copper. It is advisable, however, to hammer and prepare with charcoal the
                    deposited plate to give it elasticity, &amp;c., and such plates have been found
                    superior to all others for the purposes of engraving.</p>
                <p>The method of copying <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> copper plates, of the most
                    delicate execution, is shewn in fig. 48, where D is a vessel, a gallipot for

                    line, E E, is a copper cylinder six and a half inches high and five in diameter,
                    and Ο Ο O is a porous cylinder, which may be made of brown paper when a quick
                    action is wanted, but, in general, a thin unglazed gallipot is preferable. A
                    cylinder of zinc, Z Z, as large as possible, is then placed within the porous
                    cylinder without touching it, nearly at the distance of one-8th of an inch. A
                    perforated cover, S S of earthenware, is made to rest either on the copper
                    cylinder EE, or upon a rim in the gallipot about an inch from its top. The
                    object of it is to hold crystals of sulphate of copper for keeping the solution
                    in a state of saturation. Wires X, Y, are soldered to the cylinders of copper
                    and zinc, and these are connected with the wires in the other vessel by a
                    binding screw <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, fig. 49, used by Mr Spencer, uniting the
                    two wires M, N. The square cell A B, contains the engraved plate <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> to be copied, and connected by the wire, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b x,</hi> with the zinc cylinder of the battery; and <hi rend="italic">c b</hi>
                    is the plate to be oxydised and to be attached to the zinc cylinder of the
                    battery. The secondary cell, or precipitating trough, which may be made of
                    earthenware, wood, or glass, is filled with a saturated solution of sulphate of
                    copper. In this way a reverse copy of the plate itself is obtained in relief,
                    and from this copy, or relief, another copy in intaglio is to be taken by the
                    same method. It is considered preferable, however, to take a perfect mould from
                    the engraved plate in white wax or plaster of Paris. When this mould is rubbed
                    with black lead, an electrotype plate is then deposited upon it. In like manner
                    steel plates may be copied by first taking moulds from them in lead, wax, or
                    plaster. It is a curious fact, that the deposited plate is always superior to
                    the engraved plate. Mr Palmer has succeeded in thus copying the works of our
                    finest engravers. For farther information on this subject, see Spencer’s <hi

                    described by Mr Smee, the copper plate having the design drawn upon the etching
                    ground, as in ordinary etching, and having its back and sides coated with wax,
                    is connected, by means of a wire, with the silver plate of one of Mr Smee’s
                    batteries. “A piece of copper,” says Mr Smee. “of the same size as the plate,
                    should then be connected to the zinc, when both the copper plate and the piece
                    of zinc are to be placed in a solution of sulphate of copper. Immediately copper
                    will be reduced from the solution on the negative plate, and copper from the
                    etching plate will be dissolved to keep up the strength of the solution.
                    Whatever is favourable to the increase of electricity causes the copper to be
                    more quickly acted upon, and whatever diminishes the galvanic current retards
                    the solution of the metal; so that the nearer the etching plate, forming the
                    positive pole, and the piece of copper, forming the negative, are approximated,
                    the more rapid will be the action. In the same way the intensity of the battery
                    also affects the rate at which the plate is bitten in. The negative plate of
                    copper, however, should not exceed in size the copper plate on which the etching
                    is executed, or else there is a risk of some of the lines being more deeply
                    bitten in; and, in like manner, if any considerable part of the plate has a
                    great deficiency of lines, compared with other parts, that part must be stopped
                    out rather before the other, to ensure a uniformity of depth, or else the
                    negative copper opposite the part must be so bent, that it is at a greater
                    distance. The advantages of galvanism for etching are, the absence of poisonous
                    nitrous fumes, which are evolved in the ordinary process; the greater uniformity
                    of action which takes place than when acids are used, and that the rapidity of
                    biting may be regulated to the greatest nicety. The lines may be made of any
                    depth, and are sharper and clearer than when acid is used; and lastly, no
                    bubbles are evolved, which the engraver well knows are apt to tear up the
                    ground, or to cause unequal action.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    upon <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> and <hi rend="italic">brass,</hi> by
                    electricity, to M. de Larive, who was led to it by witnessing the dreadful
                    effects which are produced at Geneva by the use of mercury in gilding. Gold,
                    platinum, palladium, silver, copper, and carbon, when their surfaces are smooth
                    and chemically clean, and freed from adhering air, may be gilt by means of a
                    feeble voltaic current which deposits the gold from a weak nitro-muriate
                    solution of that metal, and in this way a coating of any thickness can be
                    obtained. By a similar process, metals may be platinated or palladinated by
                    using the nitro-muriate solution of those metals. Metals may, in like manner, be
                    covered with nickel by means of its nitrate.</p>
                <p>By similar means fruit, vegetables, leaves, seeds may be coated with copper; and
                    crystallised copper may be deposited on wicker work, baskets, &amp;c., after
                    they are blackleaded, or upon articles of earthenware. Mr Smee has succeeded in
                    coating copper with almost every other metal; but for an account of De Larive’s

                <p>PART II—ON ELECTRO-MAGNETISM.</p>
                <p>Various insulated facts and experiments, observed and made by Franklin, Van
                    Marum, Cavallo, Ritter, Mojon. and Maschmann, led to the belief that electricity
                    produced magnetical effects; and this opinion was strengthened by the magnetical
                    changes which had been repeatedly observed in compass needles struck by
                    lightning. It was not however, till 1820, that electro-magnetism was discovered
                    by Professor H. C. Oersted of Copenhagen. In the month of July of that year,
                    after obtaining several feeble magnetical effects from wires conducting the
                    galvanic current, he at last succeeded, by using larger wires, in establishing
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=724"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0724-0684"/>fundamental law, that <hi rend="italic">the
                    magnetical effect of the electrical current</hi> has a circular <hi
                    rend="italic">motion round the current.</hi></p>
                <p>Soon after this important discovery was made, M. Ampere established a second
                    fundamental law of electro-magnetism, that the two conducting wires from the
                    poles of the battery, when conveniently suspended, <hi rend="italic">attract
                    each other when they transmit electrical currents moving in the same direction,
                    and repel each other when the currents which they transmit have opposite
                    directions.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 25th September 1820, M. Arago communicated to the French Institute the
                    important discovery, that the electrical current possesses, in a very high
                    degree, the power of developing magnetism in iron and steel. Sir H. Davy
                    communicated a similar fact to Dr Wollaston on the 12th November 1820, and Dr
                    Seebeck laid before the Royal Academy of Berlin a series of experiments on the
                    same subject. Μ. Savary of Paris has more recently found that steel needles,
                    placed at different but small distances from a wire conveying an electrical
                    discharge, are not all magnetised in the same direction.</p>
                <p>The most important addition to voltaic electricity, since the discovery of
                    Oersted, is that of Dr Seebeck, who found that electro-magnetic currents can be
                    produced by heat alone, a subject which will be treated in a separate chapter on
                    <hi rend="italic">Thermo-electricity.</hi></p>
                <p>When we join the two poles of a galvanic battery by a metallic wire, this wire is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">conductor,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">uniting
                    wire,</hi> and the galvanic circle is said to be <hi rend="italic">closed</hi>
                    when this wire is single and unbroken, or when it consists of two wires in
                    contact. When these two wires are not in contact, the circuit is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">open,</hi> in which case the wires have no action upon magnetic
                    needles.</p>
                <p>Let A B, fig. 50, be the conducting wire of a closed galvanic circuit, along
                    which electricity is carried from A to B, A being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> end, and B the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> end: then, if a
                    delicate magnetic needle is suspended near A B. its direction is changed in the
                    following manner:</p>
                <p>1. When the needle is <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the wire. Its north pole will
                    <hi rend="italic">go</hi> from the observer as at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> in
                    the upper part of the ellipse, <hi rend="italic">c d e f,</hi> fig. 50.</p>
                <p>2. When the needle is <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the wire. Its north pole will
                    approach the observer, as at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in the lower part of the
                    ellipse.</p>
                <p>3. When the needle is in the same horizontal plane as the wire, and stands
                    between the observer and the wire. Its north pole is <hi rend="italic"
                    >elevated,</hi> as at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></p>
                <p>4. When the needle is in the same plane, but on the other side of the conductor.
                    Its north end is <hi rend="italic">depressed,</hi> as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence. It appears, that the direction of the magnetic current is <hi
                    rend="italic">c d e f,</hi> when the electrical current is in the direction A
                    B.</p>
                <p>If the uniting wire is bent into parallel directions, as in fig. 51. the two
                    exterior surfaces of the branches AC, BD, will exercise similar actions on a
                    needle NS, and so will the two interior surfaces, the actions at <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> being similar, and also those
                    at <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h.</hi></p>
                <p>From these experiments, Professor Oersted concluded, <hi rend="italic">that the
                    magnetical action of the electric current describes circles</hi> round the
                    conductor, and hence he gave the name of r <hi rend="italic">evolving
                    magnetism</hi> to this magnetical action.</p>
                <p>This action of <hi rend="italic">revolving magnetism</hi> was at first opposed by
                    Professor Schweigger, on the ground that if it were true, a magnet might be made
                    to revolve round the uniting wire. Dr Wollaston drew the same conclusion, but
                    for the purpose of producing such a revolution. Before he had effected his
                    purpose, however, Dr Faraday went a step farther, and found experimentally not
                    only <hi rend="italic">that a magnet could be made to revolve round the uniting
                    wire, but that a moveable uniting wire might be made to revolve round a
                    magnet.</hi> An apparatus for exhibiting these remarkable properties is shewn in
                    fig. 52. A wire <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> from the voltaic battery, passes into
                    the glass vessel M, through a hole in its bottom, so as to communicate with
                    mercury contained in the vessel. The lower end of a small magnet <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> of the form of a cylinder, is fixed by a thread to the
                    bottom of the vessel, so that it floats almost vertically in the mercury. A wire
                    <hi rend="italic">Ced,</hi> communicating with the other end of the battery, by
                    means of the brass pillar C, dips with its lower end <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    into the mercury in M; and as soon as the voltaic current is established in the
                    direction of the arrows, or <hi rend="italic">a d e</hi> C <hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> the pole <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the magnet will revolve round the
                    fixed conductor <hi rend="italic">deC.</hi></p>
                <p>The revolution of the conductor round a magnet is exhibited in the same figure,
                    where N is a glass vessel containing mercury, and having a small cylindrical
                    magnet F fixed to its bottom, and projecting a little above the surface of the
                    mercury. The wire <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> being attacl&gt;ed by a hook to the
                    horizontal arm C, will commence its revolutions round, as soon as the voltaic
                    current passes in the direction of the arrows, or <hi rend="italic">x</hi> F,
                    <hi rend="italic">d C.</hi> If we make the current pass in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">a d e</hi> C F <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, from the zinc to the
                    platinum end of the battery, both the above revolutions will go on
                    simultaneously. When the current was made to pass in the opposite direction, the
                    direction of the rotation was likewise changed.</p>
                <p>The rotation of a magnet round its own axis was first effected by M. Ampere. The
                    magnet was made to float vertically in mercury, by a platina weight at its lower
                    end. When the electrical current descended through the upper half which stood
                    above the mercury. It was carried off by the mercury without entering the other
                    halt of the magnet. Had a positive current entered the other half, after passing
                    through the first half. It would have tended to make the upper pole revolve from
                    left to right, and the under pole fiom right to left, and these contrary forces
                    would have balanced each other; but when it is prevented from entering the lower
                    half, the positive current produces a rotation in the magnet from left to right.
                    Mr Watkins<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Popular
                    Sketch of Electro-Magnetism.</p></note> has constructed the apparatus in fig.
                    53, for shewing this experiment in a' better way. A flat bar magnet M is
                    supported vertically by the bent wire WSW, fixed to the stand AB. The lower end
                    of the magnet, which is pointed, rests in an atrate cup C, while its upper end
                    is a pivot, turning in a hole in the screw S. At the centre and lower end of the
                    magnet are circular grooves containing mercury, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=725" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0725-0685"/>
                    into which dip small bent and pointed wires, fixed to the magnet, as seen in the
                    figure. When the voltaic circuit is completed in the usual manner, the current
                    passes only through the lower half of the magnet, and being a moveable part of
                    the circuit. It turns round on its two pivots with a velocity depending on the
                    strength of the magnet, the power of the battery employed, and the freedom from
                    friction at the pivots. A current from another battery might be passed from the
                    top of the magnet to its centre, which, by producing a rotation in the same
                    direction, would increase the velocity of revolution.</p>
                <p>Upon the same principles, a conductor may be made to revolve round its axis. An
                    instrument for shewing this was invented by Professor Barlow, and which has been
                    improved by Mr Watkins, by applying it to the horse-shoe magnet.<note

                    Electro-Magnetism.</p></note></p>
                <p>The rotation of liquid conductors may likewise, as Sir H. Davy has shewn, be
                    produced by the pole of a magnet. If mercury is placed in a shallow dish,
                    between the two poles of a battery, a magnet placed either above or below the
                    mercury, will cause the mercury to revolve round the points from which the
                    currents issue. The rotation of the flame produced by the passage of a powerful
                    voltaic charge between two charcoal points, arises from the same cause.
                    Professor Daniell gives the following pleasing method of shewing this effect. He
                    makes a powerful horse-shoe magnet part of the conducting wire of a constant
                    battery of a moderate number of cells; the flame which may then be drawn from
                    one of its poles will revolve in one direction, while that from the other will
                    revolve in the opposite direction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Soon after the discovery of electro-magnetism, Μ. Ampere made the important
                    discovery, that the conductors attract each other when they are transmitting
                    electrical currents having the same direction, but repel each other when the
                    currents have opposite directions. This may be proved experimentally by the
                    apparatus in fig. 54, invented by Μ. Ampere. It consists of a bent wire,
                    ABCDEFGH, the parts of which at B and G, are kept insulated by a non-conducting
                    substance <hi rend="italic">m, to</hi> which they are tied. The extremities A,
                    H, with steel points dip into iron cups of mercury, K, M, at the ends of the
                    brass wires, JK, LM, fixed into a piece of wood, NO. When the electric current
                    enters at J, passes along the conductor ABCDE, &amp;c., and issues at L, the
                    conductor is put in motion by means of a magnet. When the south pole of a magnet
                    is directed against the side BCD. It will repel the conductor, but will attract
                    it when directed against the opposite side.</p>
                <p>The conductor in the above apparatus may also be moved by the earth’s magnetism.
                    For this purpose the plane, CDEF, must stand perpendicularly to the magnetic
                    meridian. When the current enters at A, the vertical part FE will be placed
                    towards the west, but if the current enters at H, the part FE will be placed
                    towards the east.</p>
                <p>Ampere’s electro-dynamic cylinder is shewn in fig. 55, where M is the extremity
                    of a wire, with a steel point resting in a cup of mercury. The wire, after
                    descending to A, passes horizontally through a glass tube AB, and is then
                    wrapped round it to form a helix or spiral, returning to A. It then passes to C,
                    where it is wrapped in a similar manner round the glass tube CD; and when it
                    reaches the end D. It returns through the tube to C, when it descends vertically
                    with its steel point into another mercury cup N. This instrument is a complete
                    imitation of a magnetic cylinder, and, while an electric current is passing
                    through it. It possesses all the properties of a magnet, and may in every case
                    be substituted for one.</p>
                <p>Another electro-dynamic cylinder, invented by Ampere, and improved by Mr Marsh,
                    is shewn in fig. 56. It consists of a coil or helix of wire AB, the ends of
                    which return along its axis to its middle point C, and are there fixed to the
                    wires, <hi rend="italic">n, p,</hi> of a small voltaic battery MN, which
                    consists of a single plate of zinc z, surrounded by a plate of copper <hi
                    rend="italic">cc,</hi> and floating in a basin of diluted acid, in which it can
                    freely move. This spiral ACB, will place itself in the magnetic meridian, when
                    acted upon by the magnetism of the earth, and will likewise yield to the action
                    of another magnet placed near either of its poles.</p>
                <p>Various forms have been given to these electro-dynamic cylinders. In some the
                    coils all lie in one plane, as in Fig. 57, where one face of the coil has north,
                    and the other south polarity, the magnetic poles being as it were situated in
                    the centre of each disc.</p>
                <p>When the helix is constructed, as in fig. 58. Its power is so great, that a small
                    steel bar SN, placed within it, and supported perpendicularly, will, as soon as
                    the connection is made with the voltaic battery, by means of the mercury cups P,

                    Mahomet’s coffin, it will remain suspended without any visible cause, and in
                    opposition to the power of gravitation.</p>
                <p>We owe also to M. Ampere the very interesting apparatus of a small voltaic
                    battery made to revolve round a magnet. This is shewn in fig. 59, where ABCD,
                    <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> exhibits a section of two cy-lindersof coppers
                    oldered to a copper bottom, so as to hold a fluid. This double cylindrical
                    vessel is suspended by a bent wire <hi rend="italic">a</hi> F <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> (having a cavity at F,) upon the north pole N of a vertical magnet NS. A
                    light cylinder of zinc <hi rend="italic">zz</hi> is also suspended by a bent
                    wire zEr, and a steel pivot at E upon the same pole N of the magnet. The
                    cylinder <hi rend="italic">zz</hi> can therefore revolve upon this pivot. When
                    the cylinder ABD <hi rend="italic">dbac</hi> CA, is filled with dilute acid, so
                    as to constitute a small battery, the cylinder <hi rend="italic">zz</hi> will
                    revolve<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=726"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0726-0686"/> from left to right when N is the north end or
                    south pole, and from right to left when N is the south end or north pole. Owing
                    to the attraction of the fluid, the cylinder of zinc is often drawn to one side,
                    and prevented from moving; but this may be avoided by making the space Ac
                    sufficiently wide. Mr Watkins has ingeniously applied this contrivance to the
                    poles of a horse-shoe magnet, as in fig. 60. It consists of a horse-shoe magnet
                    AB, fixed to a stand SS. Above each pole is suspended a double cylindrical
                    copper vessel, with a bent metallic wire fixed to the top of the inner cylinder,
                    and a vertical wire pointed at each extremity, fixed in the middle of the bent
                    wire. The lower ends of the vertical wires of each cylinder rest in the holes at
                    each pole of the magnet. Within the above double copper vessels are placed two
                    hollow cylinders of zinc, having similar bent wires with holes in the lower side
                    of each, in which holes the upper ends of the vertical wires are inserted. When
                    the copper cylinder is filled with dilute acid, the voltaic action begins, all
                    the four cylinders revolving round their respective axes. The copper cylinders
                    turn slowly and heavily, from their weight, in opposite directions to one
                    another, and the zinc cylinders, with great velocity, in opposite directions to
                    the copper ones. Very delicate suspensions are necessary to ensure the rotation
                    of the copper cylinders.</p>
                <p>A very simple apparatus for showing the magnetic state of a single coil, is shown
                    in fig. 61, where Z and C represent the elements of a small galvanic battery of
                    one zinc and one copper plate attached to a cork which floats on dilute acid.
                    Each plate is half an inch wide, and two inches long. A piece of copper wire W,
                    with silk thread wrapped round it, is bent into a ring, one end of which is
                    soldered to the zinc, and the other to the copper plate. An electric current now
                    passes in the direction of the arrow, and the ring W becomes a flat magnet,
                    having its poles in the centre of its two surfaces, the one being north and the
                    other south. This floating magnet will, when acted upon by a real magnet,
                    exhibit the usual magnetic attractions and repulsions. Mr Marsh has improved
                    this apparatus by doubling the copper plate, as in fig. 62, and converting it
                    into a vessel for holding the dilute acid. The plates are then placed in a glass
                    cylinder which may float in water.</p>
                <p>A very beautiful apparatus for exhibiting helical rotations has been constructed
                    by Mr Watkins, and is shown in fig. 63. A horse-shoe magnet, with its poles
                    uppermost, is fixed upon a wooden box S. Two helices of copper, having slender
                    bars across their summit, with needle or steel points in their centre, move in
                    conical holes drilled in the poles of the magnet, with small platina cups to
                    hold a small portion of mercury. The lower extremities of each helix terminate
                    in steel points, which dip into the mercury in wooden cups below, screwed to the
                    legs of the magnet. A wire likewise goes from the lower end of each cistern, and
                    being bent upwards, terminates in a small cup with mercury. The brass rod R,
                    fixed to the stand, carries a forked piece MN, the ends of which are two points
                    which dip in the mercury in the platina cups. On the top of the coil, another
                    mercury cup is placed on the fork MN; and when the voltaic current is made to
                    pass through the apparatus, the helical coils will revolve rapidly in opposite
                    directions, the directions changing with the disposition of the wires which
                    connect them with the voltaic battery.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned the fine discovery of Μ. Arago, of the power of
                    electrical currents to develope magnetism in iron and steel. Μ. Arago found that
                    the uniting wire of a powerful voltaic battery attracts iron filings often with
                    such force as to form a coating round the wire ten or twelve times thicker than
                    itself. This attraction, as he found, did not originate in any magnetism
                    previously possessed by the iron filings, which he ascertained would not adhere
                    to iron; and that it was not a case of common electrical attraction, was evident
                    from the fact that copper and brass filings were not attracted by the uniting
                    wire. Μ. Arago likewise found, that the iron filings began to rise before they
                    came in contact with the uniting wire, and hence he drew the conclusion, that
                    the electric current converted each small piece of iron into a temporary magnet.
                    In following out this view, the French philosopher converted large pieces of
                    iron into temporary magnets, and also small steel needles into permanent ones.
                    Sir H. Davy and Dr Seebeck obtained analogous results without knowing what had
                    been previously done in France. Μ. Savary of Paris obtained also some very
                    important results relative to the magnetic action of the uniting wires at
                    different distances, but we have already given a brief account of them, as well
                    as of the experiments of Professor Erman, in our article, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 574.</p>
                <p>The next step in the progress of discovery, was that of making magnets of
                    extraordinary power by means of a voltaic battery. This seems to have been first
                    accomplished by Professor Moll of Utrecht and Professor Henry of Princetown
                    College, who was able to lift thousands of pounds’ weight by his apparatus, but
                    as we have already given a full account of the construction of such magnets, and
                    of the experiments of Μ. Quetelet of Brussels, and Mr Watkins of London, in our
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism,</hi> in Sect, xiii. p. 761, vol. viii.,
                    we must refer our readers to that part of the work.</p>
                <p>Since these important discoveries, however, were made, an electro-magnet of
                    extraordinary power has been constructed by the Rev. N. J. Callan,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sturgeon’s Annals of
                    Chemistry, &amp;c., July 1837.</p></note> Professor of Natural Philosophy at

                    copper wire one-sixth of an inch in diameter, is wrapped round the bar from one
                    pole to the other. The total length of this thick wire is 490 feet, but it is
                    divided into seven parts, each 70 feet in length. A copper <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=727" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0727-0687"
                    />wire, about the fortieth of an inch in diameter, is soldered to one of the
                    thick wires, about a foot from one of its extremities, and is wrapped round the
                    horse-shoe bar in the same direction as the thick wire, and in one continuous
                    helix. When the opposite ends of the seven thick wires are connected with the
                    opposite poles of a voltaic battery, the horse-shoe bar is converted into a
                    magnet of extraordinary power, and when the battery communication is broken, an
                    electric current of singular intensity is established in the long coil of small
                    wire. The armature or keeper of Mr Callan’s magnet was a horse-shoe bar of iron
                    20 inches long, two and a-half in diameter, and weighing 28 lbs. Its poles were
                    seven inches apart, and the apex of the arch seven inches high. Such was the
                    power of the magnet that it was found impossible to separate the keeper from it
                    by any force acting in a direction perpendicular to the touching surfaces. The
                    calorimotor, consisting of a single pair of plates, with 18 square feet of
                    copper, and 16 of zinc, was found by Mr Noad more effective in exciting the
                    magnetism than a Wollaston battery of 100 double pairs highly excited. When the
                    connexion was broken between the battery and the charcoal points fixed to the
                    thick wires, the succession of sparks formed a continued blaze of brilliant
                    light, and when a succession of sparks was sent rapidly through a large fowl,
                    they produced instant death.</p>
                <p>The idea of applying the powerful agency thus developed in a bar of iron, as a
                    mechanical power, naturally suggested itself; but there is reason to believe
                    that Mr Thomas Davenport of Brandon, in the county of Rutland, and state of
                    Vermont, was the first person who thought of applying it in producing rotatory
                    motion. This uneducated individual, by trade a blacksmith, having, in 1833,
                    accidentally seen one of Professor Henry’s electro-magnets, purchased it with
                    the idea of employing it as a mechanical power. In July 1834, he is said to have
                    constructed a voltaic engine; and on the 16th March 1837, he took to Newhaven
                    two machines; one a <hi rend="italic">rotatory machine, composed of revolving

                    reciprocating motion by magnetic attraction and repulsion, aided by
                    electromagnetic action; and as the contrivance seems to have been overlooked in
                    this country, we shall lay before our readers his own drawing and description of
                    it.</p>
                <p>In Fig. 64, AB is an electro-magnet of soft iron, about</p>
                <p>'seven inches long, and moveable on an axis at the centre</p>
                <p>S. Its two extremities, when placed in a horizontal line, are about one inch from
                    the north poles of the upright magnets C and D. G and F are two large tumblers
                    containing dilute acid, in each of which is immersed a plate of zinc, surrounded
                    with copper. <hi rend="italic">l, m, s, t,</hi> are four brass thimbles soldered
                    to the zinc and copper of the batteries, and filled with mercury.</p>
                <p>“The electro-magnet AB is wound with three strands of copper bell wire, each
                    about twenty-five feet long. The similar ends of these are twisted together, so
                    as to form two stiff wires, which project beyond the extremity B, and dip into
                    the thimbles <hi rend="italic">s, t.</hi></p>
                <p>"To the wires <hi rend="italic">q, r,</hi> two other wires are soldered, so as to
                    project in an opposite direction, and dip into the thimbles <hi rend="italic">l,
                    m.</hi> The wires of the electro-magnet have thus, as it were, four projecting
                    ends; and by inspecting the figure it will be seen that the extremity <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> which dips into the cup attached to the copper of the
                    battery in G, corresponds to the extremity <hi rend="italic">r</hi> connecting
                    with the zinc F.</p>
                <p>“When the batteries are in action, if the end B is depressed until <hi

                    the motion is at first very rapid and powerful, but it soon almost entirely
                    ceases. By partially filling the tumblers with weak acid, and occasionally
                    adding a small quantity of fresh acid, a uniform motion, at the rate of
                    seventy-five vibrations in a minute, has been kept up for more than an hour.
                    With a large battery, and very weak acid, the motion might be continued for an
                    indefinite length of time.</p>
                <p>“The motion here described is entirely distinct from that produced by the
                    electro-magnetic combination of wires and magnets. It results directly from the
                    mechanical action of ordinary magnetism—galvanism being only introduced for the
                    purpose of changing the poles.”</p>
                <p>Professor Green, to whom Professor Henry first exhibited this machine in motion,
                    recommended the substitution of electro-magnets for the two vertical ones C, D.
                    Though Professor Henry described this apparatus as a toy, yet he distinctly
                    states, that in the progress of discovery, the same principle, or some
                    modification of it on a more extended scale, might hereafter be applied to some
                    useful purpose.</p>
                <p>These contrivances have been followed by several others of great ingenuity. The
                    Rev. J. W. Macgauley exhibited a working model of an electro-magnetic machine,
                    to the British Association at Dublin in 1835; and in the sixth report of the
                    Association he mentions his having “in his possession a machine of not
                    inconsiderable power.” Mr Sturgeon of Woolwich mentions that he had a galvanic
                    machine in use on his premises, for pumping water, and for other mechanical
                    purposes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Report on,

                    machinery for impelling a boat on the Neva at St Petersburg; and Mr Davidson of
                    Aberdeen has made a similar application to a turning lathe.</p>
                <p>A series of beautiful instruments, of great practical value, have been invented
                    for increasing minute voltaic effects, by electro-magnetic action. The first of
                    these was constructed by Professor Schweigger of Halle, immediately alter the
                    discovery of electro-magnetism. It is exhibited in fig. 65 where a magnetic
                    needle SN, is placed or suspended within several bendings of the uniting wires
                    ABCDE. Now, as each of the branches of this wire acts upon one of the poles of
                    the needle in the same direction, the effect will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrupled;</hi> and hence the direction of the needle becomes a means of
                    measuring any minute voltaic effects produced in the uniting <pb break="no"

                    increase with the number of windings in the uniting wire, as the resistance to
                    transmission increases with the length of the wire, thus diminishing the
                    conducting power of the wire. Professor Orested improved the multiplier<note

                    shewn at JKL, fig. 66, which can be placed so as to repel the nearest end of the
                    needle, or index, or to attract it. In the position in the figure the first of
                    these effects is produced; but by turning the angle of the bent magnet towards
                    the needle, the second effect is produced. By causing the pillar which carries
                    this magnet to approach to, or recede from the needle, the directive power of
                    the needle may be made scarcely sensible. In this state the instrument will shew
                    the difference in the voltaic effects produced by two pieces of metal, which
                    differ only by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>
                    th of alloy when a powerful liquid is used. Professor Cumming, we believe, first
                    suggested the idea of neutralizing the directive force of the needle, arising
                    from the earth’s magnetism, which he did by placing a magnetized needle
                    immediately beneath the moveable or index needle.<note anchored="true"

                <p>M. Nobili has improved this instrument by using two needles, as in fig. 66; but
                    he fixed the neutralizing needle S'N', to the moveable one NS, placing the one
                    above the other, with their poles reversed. The two needles are fixed in a piece
                    of straw’ GH, and suspended by a silk fibre at G. The needles were twenty-two
                    lines long, three wide, and one-fourth thick, and GH was five lines. The wire
                    was a copper one, one-fifth of a line in diameter, and thirty feet long, and
                    covered with silk. It made seventy-two evolutions round the frame.</p>
                <p>M. Lebaillif has extended this principle by using four needles in place of two,
                    each pair being exactly the same as in fig. 66, the one being brought near the
                    upper surface of the coil, and the other near the under surface. In this
                    instrument the increased weight of the needles may compensate any additional
                    sensibility possessed by the approximation of the needles to the sides of the
                    coil. The instrument is shewn in fig. 67, where <hi rend="italic">ab, ab</hi>
                    are the four needles, <hi rend="italic">mnop</hi> the square bobbin, around
                    which the wires are coiled, one or two feet of their length at each end being
                    left free, as at <hi rend="italic">gi, gf,</hi> that the electric current may
                    enter at the one, and issue from the other. Instead of a single wire 300 feet
                    long, M. Lebaillif employs <hi rend="italic">five</hi> parallel ones, each end
                    of which is stripped of the silk, and united by strong pressure into a bundle.
                    The electric current thus divided into five parts, flows in five channels,
                    which, according to M. Pouillet, transmit a proportionally larger quantity of
                    electricity, while the diminished intensity produced by a great length of wire,
                    is avoided.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pouillet’s

                    shewn in fig. 68. Having covered a fine copper wire with a thin coat of sealing
                    wax, he rolls it about a heated cylinder, an inch or two in diameter, ten,
                    twenty, or any number of times. The opposite sides of the circular coil are then
                    pressed together, till they become parallel, and about one or one and a half
                    inches long. The coil W is then fixed on a proper sole, and the ends of the
                    wires connected with two metallic mercury cups C, C. A graduated disc of paper
                    is then placed horizontally on the upper half of the coil, having a black line
                    drawn through its centre, parallel with the middle line of the coil. A small
                    magnet SN, made of a common sewing needle, is then fixed to the lower end of a
                    fine glass thread, while the upper end is securely fixed with sealing wax, in
                    the centre of a moveable index I, as in the torsion balance. This is inclosed in
                    a glass tube T, fitted into a disc of thick plate glass, which forms the upper
                    surface of the box. When a voltaic current passes through the coil W, the needle
                    SN is deflected. The glass thread is then twisted by turning the index I, till
                    the needle is brought back to its former position, and the number of degrees of
                    torsion will be an accurate measure of the quantity of electricity, whose
                    deflective power over the needle is exactly balanced by the torsion of the glass

                <p>A very ingenious galvanoscope, for ascertaining merely the existence and

                    fibre, placed between four vertical spiral coils, the centres of which are
                    brought very near the poles of the needle. The same voltaic current is made to
                    circulate through all the four spirals, which have their turns such as to
                    produce repulsion of the contiguous pole on the one side, and attraction of the
                    same pole on the other side. The wire of the four spiral discs proceeds from the
                    mercury cup P, and terminates in another cup N. In this admirable instrument,
                    the current is brought as near as possible to the needle, so that its action is
                    very powerful. The whole force of the four discs is quadruple that of a single
                    one, as they all concur in giving the needle a deviation in the same
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Gold-leaf has been employed in the formation of the <hi rend="italic">gold-leaf
                    galvanoscope,</hi> which is similar in construction to Bennet’s gold-leaf
                    electrometer. The strength of the current is indicated by the curvature of the
                    strip of gold-leaf <hi rend="italic">fh,</hi> fig. 70, which is held loosely by

                    terminating in a mercury cup, the one, P, being above, and the other, N, below.
                    The gold-leaf is enclosed in a glass case, the middle of which is placed
                    equidistant between the poles M, <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> of a horse-shoe
                    magnet. When the electric current passes through the gold-leaf, <pb break="no"

                    the leaf is bent, or <hi rend="italic">attracted</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >repelled</hi> laterally by the poles of the magnet, according as the current

                    curvature is easily ascertained, Dr Roget considers this instrument as affording
                    “the most delicate test possible of the existence and direction of a weak

                <p>We shall now conclude this part of the article with an account of a very
                    ingenious contrivance of Ampere’s for quickly altering the direction of the
                    electric current in voltaic batteries. Two grooves R, R, fig. 71, are made in
                    the table TT, some lines in depth, and also four similar cavities <hi
                    rend="italic">νv', tth,</hi> communicating diagonally by means of the plates of
                    copper <hi rend="italic">ll, mm,</hi> which are kept separate at their crossing
                    by a non-conducting substance. Mercury is then placed in the grooves and
                    cavities, after they have been varnished with mastic. If the positive wire of a
                    battery is immersed in the groove R, and the negative one in the groove R', the
                    current will not flow until a metallic communication is made between each of the
                    grooves, and one of the cavities. To do this, <hi rend="italic">b, bl</hi> are
                    two plates, fig. 72, for transmitting the current; the plate <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> may become positive or negative, according as the cavity R communicates
                    with <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and R' with <hi rend="italic">tl,</hi> or when R
                    communicates with <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and R' with <hi rend="italic"
                    >v'.</hi></p>
                <p>In the first case, the current follows the direction R <hi rend="italic">t</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">bb', t</hi> 'R', in the second it goes from R to <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> then traverses the plate <hi rend="italic">ll',</hi> and
                    afterwards goes from <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> into <hi rend="italic">bt,</hi>
                    and from <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> into R. Now, these communications may be
                    easily made or interrupted, by means of a wooden rod BB', which turns round its
                    axis in the holes <hi rend="italic">o, o'.</hi> Four metallic arcs <hi
                    rend="italic">bbl, dd',</hi> are fitted to this rod, so that by merely raising
                    or depressing it, the communications are changed. When <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">bl</hi> are depressed, R and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    communicate through <hi rend="italic">rbc,</hi> and R and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Mr Edward Clarke has improved this instrument, and, we believe, given it the name
                    of electripeter. It is shown in fig. 73, where <hi rend="italic">a, a, a',
                    a'</hi> are four mercury cups, communicating with wires beneath the stand SS'.
                    Large mercury cups A, A', B, B', are similarly con structed for conveying the
                    current from the battery to a machine to be set in motion. The wires CC' are
                    moveable about a horizontal axis. Suppose them to be in the position in the
                    figure, and that the current is passing from A to B, and back again, from any
                    apparatus from B' to A, then, by merely pressing the other ends of the wires CC'
                    into their respective cups <hi rend="italic">a,a,</hi> the direction of the
                    current will be immediately changed, and it will pass from A beneath the stand,
                    to B', and back from B to A. By retaining the wires horizontally which keep
                    their ends out of the cups, the passage of the current will be stopped.<note

                <p>Although the idea of conveying signals along wires by means of electric currents,
                    must have occurred to many persons, yet the value and success of the invention
                    must depend on the principles and methods by which that idea is carried into
                    effect. Professor Wheatstone and Mr Cook have taken out a patent for this
                    invention, and, in March 1840. It was in practical operation on the Great
                    Western railway, throughout a distance of 14 miles from Paddington to West
                    Drayton. It is also in operation on Blackwall railway. Professor Wheatstone has
                    recently made an entirely new arrangement for his telegraph, which possesses
                    great advantages over the old one: It is extremely portable; and any child can
                    both read and send the messages with scarcely a minute’s instruction. It
                    requires only a single pair of wires, and 30 or 40 letters can be successively
                    sent by it in a minute. The telegraph with its accompanying alarm, is included
                    in a case not larger than that of the smallest table clock. From the utility,
                    simplicity, and cheapness of this new contrivance, we are convinced that its
                    application will not be confined to long telegraphic lines, but will also be
                    extensively employed in public and private establishments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wheatstone’s Electro-magnetic Clock.</hi></p>
                <p>To the same ingenious author we owe one of the most beautiful inventions of
                    modern times, the electro-magnetic clock, the detailed construction of which has
                    not yet been published. The following is a brief abstract of the account of it
                    which was read at the Royal Society on the 26th November 1840.</p>
                <p>The object which Professor Wheatstone had in view was <hi rend="italic">to enable
                    a single clock to indicate exactly the same time in as many different places
                    distant from each other as may be desired.</hi> In an observatory, for example,
                    every apartment may be furnished with a cheap and simple clock, scarcely liable
                    to derangement, and giving the time so accurately, <hi rend="italic">that it
                    will beat dead seconds audibly with as great precision as the standard
                    astronomical timepiece with which it is connected.</hi> Hence the necessity is
                    avoided, in such scientific establishments, of having several clocks, and of
                    being at the trouble of winding them up and regulating them individually. “In
                    like manner, in public offices and large establishments, one good clock will
                    serve the purpose of indicating the precise time in every part of the building
                    where it may be required, and an accuracy ensured which it would be difficult to
                    obtain by independent clocks, even putting the difference of cost out of
                    consideration. In the electro-magnetic clock, which was exhibited in action in
                    the apartments of the Society, all the parts employed in a clock for maintaining
                    or regulating the power are entirely dispensed with. It consists simply of a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=730"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0730-0690"/> face with its second, minute, and hour hands, and
                    of a train of wheels which communicate motion from the action of the second hand
                    to that of the hour hand, in the same manner as in an ordinary clock train; a
                    small electro-magnet is caused to act upon a peculiarly-constructed wheel
                    (scarcely capable of being described without a figure) placed on the second’s
                    arbor, in such a manner that whenever the temporary magnetism is either produced
                    or destroyed, the wheel, and consequently the second’s hand, advances a sixtieth
                    part of its revolution. It is obvious, then, that if an electric current can be
                    alternately established and arrested, each resumption and cessation lasting for
                    a second, the instrument now described, although unprovided with any internal
                    maintaining or regulating power, would perform all the usual functions of a
                    perfect clock. The manner in which this apparatus is applied to the clocks, so
                    that the movements of the hands of both may be perfectly simultaneous, is the
                    following :—On the axis which carries the scape-wheel of the primary clock a
                    small disc of brass is fixed, which is first divided on its circumference into
                    sixty equal parts; each alternate division is then cut out and filled with a
                    piece of wood, so that the circumference consists of thirty regular alternations
                    of wood and metal. An extremely light brass spring, which is screwed to a block
                    of ivory or hard wood, and which has no connection with the metallic parts of
                    the clock, rests by its free end on the circumference of the disc. A copper wire
                    is fastened to the fixed end of the spring, and proceeds to one end of the wire
                    of the electro-magnet; while another wire attached to the clock-frame, is
                    continued until it joins the other end of that of the same electro-magnet: A
                    constant voltaic battery, consisting of a few elements of very small dimensions,
                    is interposed in any part of the circuit. By this arrangement the circuit is
                    periodically made and broken, in consequence of the spring resting for one
                    second on a metal division, and the next second on a wooden division. The
                    circuit may be extended to any length; and any number of electromagnetic
                    instruments may be thus brought into sympathetic action with the standard clock.
                    It is only necessary to observe, that the force of the battery and the
                    proportion between the resistances of the electro-magnetic coils, and those of
                    the other parts of the circuit, must, in order to produce the maximum effect
                    with the least expenditure of power, be varied to suit each particular
                    case.”</p>
                <p>In Professor Wheatstone’s paper, of which the above is an abstract, he has
                    pointed out several methods of effecting the same purpose. In one of them he
                    substitutes Dr Faraday’s magneto-electric currents, in place of the voltaic
                    battery, and he likewise describes a modification of his clock which will enable
                    it to exercise its controlling power with a weaker electric current than when
                    constructed on the plan above described. Professor Wheatstone has likewise
                    pointed out other most important purposes to which his invention is
                    applicable.</p>
                <p>PART III—MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.</p>
                <p>In the preceding chapter, we have detailed the leading phenomena produced by
                    electric currents, or electricity in motion, for no magnetic effects are
                    produced by accumulated electricity. We come now to give an account of the new
                    science of magneto-electricity, which we owe to Dr Faraday. Although certain
                    effects of the <hi rend="italic">induction</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By <hi rend="italic">induction</hi> Dr
                    Faraday intends to express the power of electrical currents “to induce any
                    particular state upon matter in their immediate neighbourhood otherwise
                    indifferent." <hi rend="italic">Experimental Researches,</hi> p. 1.</p></note>
                    of electrical currents had been discovered. It had always appeared to Dr Faraday
                    unlikely that these could be the only effects which induction by currents could
                    produce; and whatever theory of the phenomena might be adopted. It still seemed
                    to him “very extraordinary, that as every electric current was accompanied by a
                    corresponding intensity of magnetic action, at right angles to the current, good
                    conductors of electricity, when placed within the sphere of this action, should
                    not have any current induced through them, or some sensible effect produced
                    equivalent in force to such a current. With these views, and under the
                    expectation of obtaining electricity from ordinary magnetism, he investigated
                    experimentally the inductive effect of electrical currents.”</p>
                <p>If the uniting wire of a voltaic battery is placed parallel to the wire
                    connecting the two ends of a delicate galvanometer, the most powerful current
                    along the uniting wire will produce no deviation in the needle. But if the
                    current along the uniting wire is stopped, by <hi rend="italic">breaking the
                    circuit,</hi> a momentary deviation of the needle takes place, as if a wire
                    passed in the same direction as that of the voltaic current. When the needle has
                    become stationary, a similar impulse is given to it in the opposite direction,
                    by <hi rend="italic">restoring the circuit.</hi> Dr Faraday found that similar
                    effects took place, when the <hi rend="italic">current along the uniting wire
                    being uninterrupted,</hi> the uniting wire was made to approach or to recede <hi
                    rend="italic">suddenly</hi> from the wire of the galvanometer, the <hi
                    rend="italic">approximation</hi> inducing a current in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">contrary</hi> to the inducing current in the uniting wire, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">division</hi> inducing a current in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >same</hi> direction as the inducing current.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Experimental Researches, p. 5.</p></note> To
                    this inductive action of the voltaic current Dr Faraday has given the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">volta-electric induction.</hi></p>
                <p>As the preceding effects were clearly produced by a transverse action of the
                    current, in the first case at the instant where the current was annihilated or
                    generated, and in the second by the mechanical motion of the uniting wire, Dr
                    Faraday expected to obtain similar results, by the sudden induction and
                    cessation of the same magnetic force, either by means of a voltaic current, or
                    by that of a common magnet. By various experimental arrangements, Dr Faraday
                    verified these anticipations; but in order to connect his experiments on
                    volta-electric induction with the present ones, he constructed a combination of
                    helices upon a hollow cylinder of pasteboard. The wire was 1-20th of an inch in
                    diameter, and the different spires were prevented from bending by a thin
                    interposed twine. Each helix was covered with calico. Eight lengths of copper
                    wire were used, or nearly 220 feet of wire. “Four of these helices were
                    connected end to end, and then with the galvanometer; the other intervening four
                    were also connected end to end, and the battery of 100 pairs discharged through
                    them. In this form, the effect on the galvanometer was hardly sensible, though
                    magnets could be made by the induced current. But when a soft iron cylinder, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> ths of an inch thick,
                    and 12 inches long, was introduced into the pasteboard tube, surrounded by the
                    helices, then the induced current affected the galvanometer powerfully. It
                    possessed also the power of making magnets with more energy apparently than when
                    an iron cylinder was used. When the iron cylinder was replaced by an equal
                    cylinder of copper, no effect beyond that of the helices alone was produced.”
                    “Similar effects,” continues Dr Faraday, “were produced with ordinary magnets.
                    Thus, the hollow helix just described had all its elementary helices connected
                    with the galvanometer, by two copper wires each five feet long; the soft iron
                    cylinder was introduced into its axis; a couple of bar magnets, each 24 inches
                    long, were arranged, with their opposite poles at one end in contact, so as to
                    resemble a horse-shoe magnet, and then contact made between the other poles and
                    the ends of the iron cylinder, so as to convert it for the time into a magnet;
                    by breaking the magnetic contacts, or reversing them, the magnetism of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=731"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0731-0691"/> the iron cylinder could be destroyed or reversed
                    at pleasure. Upon making magnetic contact, the needle was deflected; continuing
                    the contact, the needle became indifferent, and resumed its first position: on
                    breaking the contact. It was again deflected, but in the opposite direction to
                    the first effect, and then it again became indifferent. When the magnetic
                    contacts were reversed, the deflections were reversed. When the magnetic contact
                    was made, the deflection was such as to indicate an induced current of
                    electricity in the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> direction to that fitted to
                    form a magnet, having the same polarity as that really produced by contact with
                    the bar magnet.”</p>
                <p>But in order to show that it was by the approximation of the magnets that the
                    momentary induced current was excited, Dr Faraday substituted for the soft iron
                    cylinder a cylindrical magnet 8½ inches long, and ¾ths of an inch in diameter.
                    He introduced one end of this magnet into the axis of the helix, and then, the
                    galvanometer needle being stationary, the magnet was <hi rend="italic">suddenly
                    thrust in,</hi> the needle was then instantly deflected in the same direction as
                    if the magnet had been formed by any of the two preceding processes. “Being left
                    in, the needle resumed its first position, and then the magnet being <hi
                    rend="italic">withdrawn,</hi> the needle was deflected in the opposite
                    direction. These effects were not great, but by introducing and withdrawing the
                    magnet, so that the impulse each time should be added to those previously
                    communicated to the needle, the latter could be made to vibrate through an arc
                    of 180° or more.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Although the law which governs the evolution of electricity by magneto-electric
                    induction, is very simple, yet Dr Faraday has found it rather difficult to
                    express it, except in reference to diagrams. We shall therefore give it in his
                    own words. “If in fig. 74, PN represent a horizontal wire passing by a marked
                    magnetic pole, so that the direction of its motions shall coincide with the
                    curved line proceeding from below upwards; or if its motion parallel to itself
                    be in a line tangential to the curved line, but in the general direction of the
                    arrows; or if it pass the pole in other directions, but so as to cut the
                    magnetic curves<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By
                    magnetic curves, I mean the lines of magnetic forces, however modified by the
                    juxtaposition of poles, which would be depicted by iron filings, or those to
                    which a very small magnetic needle would form a tangent.</p></note> in the same
                    general direction, or on the same side as they would be cut by the wire if
                    moving along the dotted curved line; then the current of electricity in the wire
                    is from P to M. If it be carried in the reverse direction, the electric current
                    will be from N to P. Or if the wire be in the vertical position, as at P'N', and
                    it be carried in similar directions, coinciding with the dotted horizontal
                    curve, so far as to cut the magnetic curves on the same side with it, the
                    current will be from P' to N ’. If the wire be considered a tangent to the
                    curved surface of the cylindrical magnet, and it be carried round that surface
                    into any other position, or if the magnet itself be revolved on its axis, so as
                    to bring any part opposite to the tangential wire; still, if afterwards the wire
                    be moved in the directions indicated, the current of electricity will be from P
                    to N; or if it be moved in the opposite direction, from N to P; so that as
                    regards the motions of the wire past the pole, they may be reduced to two,
                    directly opposite to each other, one of which produces a current from P to N,
                    and the other from N to P.</p>
                <p>“The same holds true of the unmarked pole of the magnet, except that if it be
                    substituted for the one in the figure, then, as the wires are moved in the
                    direction of the arrows, the current of electricity would be from N to</p>
                <p>P, and when they move in the reverse direction, from P to N.</p>
                <p>“Hence the current of electricity which is excited in metal when moving in the
                    neighbourhood of a magnet, depends for its direction altogether upon the
                    relation of the metal to the resultant of magnetic action, or to the magnetic
                    curves, and may be expressed in a popular way, thus: Let AB (fig. 75) represent
                    a cylinder magnet, A being the marked pole, and B the unmarked pole; let PN be a
                    silver knife-blade resting across the magnet, with its edge upward, and with its
                    marked or notched side towards the pole A; then in whatever direction or
                    position this knife be moved edge foremost, either about the marked or the
                    unmarked pole, the current of electricity produced will be from P to N, provided
                    the intersected curves proceeding from A abut upon the notched surface of the
                    knife, and those from B upon the unnotched side. Or, if the knife be moved with
                    its back foremost, the current will be from N to P in every possible position
                    and direction, provided the intersected curves abut on the same surfaces as
                    before. A little model is easily constructed, by using a cylinder of wood for a
                    magnet, a flat piece for the blade, and a piece of thread connecting one end of
                    the cylinder with the other, and passing through a hole in the blade, for the
                    magnetic curves; this readily gives the result of any possible direction.</p>
                <p>“When the wire under induction is passing by an electro-magnetic pole, as for
                    instance, one end of a copper helix traversed by the electric current the
                    direction of the current in the approaching wire is the same with that of the
                    current in the parts or sides of the spirals nearest to it, and in the receding
                    wire the reverse of that in the parts nearest to it.</p>
                <p>“All these results show that the power of inducing electric currents is
                    circumferentially exerted by a magnetic resultant, or axis of power, just as
                    circumferential magnetism is dependent on, and is exhibited by an electric
                    current.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Experimental

                <p>Dr Faraday has made several experiments with the large compound magnet of Dr G.
                    Knight, belonging to the Royal Society, and consisting of 450 bar magnets, each
                    15 inches long. The electrical effects which it exhibited were very striking.
                    When a soft iron cylinder, 13 inches long, was put through the compound hollow
                    helix, with its ends arranged as two general terminations, and these connected
                    with the galvanometer; then, when the iron cylinder was brought in contact with
                    the two poles of the magnet, so powerful a rush of electricity took place, that
                    the needle whirled round many times in succession. When Dr Faraday brought the
                    helix alone near to or between the poles, the needle was thrown 80°, 90°, or
                    more, from its natural position.</p>
                <p>Dr Faraday failed in obtaining evidence of chemical decomposition by the magnet,
                    or any sensation on the tongue, or any effect on a frog, but he afterwards, by
                    an armed loadstone of Professor Daniell’s, lifting 30 pounds, not only thought
                    that he perceived a sensation on the tongue, and a flash before the eyes, but
                    was able to produce a very powerful convulsion in the limbs of a frog, every <pb

                    convulsive effect increasing with the suddenness with which the contact was
                    broken and restored.</p>
                <p>Dr Faraday, as we have now seen, was the first person who obtained, in November
                    1831, the electric spark from a magnet. The spark which he obtained was got from
                    a soft iron magnet, made by the influence of a voltaic current. Professor

                    common artificial magnet; and Professor Forbes (March 1832) obtained the
                    electric spark from a soft iron magnet, made by the influence of a natural

                <p>That the action of magneto-electricity is the converse of that of
                    electro-magnetism, is well shown in the rotatory apparatus in fig. 77. It

                    handle H. A powerful horse-shoe magnet, AB, is so placed that the edge of the

                    the needle of the galvanometer is deflected. If the disc revolve from left to

                <p>After Dr Faraday’s great discovery of <hi rend="italic">magneto-electric</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">volta-electric induction,</hi> various machines were
                    constructed for experimental investigation and exhibition. M. Hippolyte Pixii of
                    Paris exhibited to the Academy of Sciences in 1832, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >magneto-electric</hi> machine. A powerful magnet was made to revolve with great
                    rapidity before its keeper or armature, which had round it a coil of copper wire
                    about three thousand feet long. By this means sparks and severe shocks were
                    obtained, a feeble charge was accumulated in a Leyden phial, the gold leaves of
                    an electrometer were made to diverge, and water was decomposed.</p>
                <p>A very ingenious and complete machine was exhibited by Mr Saxton, at the meeting
                    of the British Association in June 1833, as shewn in fig. 78. The magnet A is a
                    horse-shoe one of great power, composed of many steel plates, closely applied to
                    each other, or it may be a soft iron electro magnet of the same shape. A keeper,
                    CD, of the purest soft iron, has each of its ends bent into a right angle, and
                    is so mounted that the surfaces of their ends are exactly opposite and close to
                    the poles of the magnet. In this position the keeper CD may be made to revolve
                    round the horizontal axis EF, by means of the wheels C and E, and band GE fixed
                    to the upright pillar B. Round each end, C, D, of the keeper, are coiled two
                    series of copper wires, covered with sdk, so as to form compound helices. The
                    ends of these wires, which have the same direction, are joined together, and are
                    likewise connected with a circular disc, revolving with the keeper in a cup of
                    mercury, with which in every position of the disc it is in metallic
                    communication. The other ends of the wires are joined, and passing together
                    without metallic contact through the spindle EF, terminate in a slip of copper,
                    with two opposite points, as at <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, at right angles to the
                    axis. These points alternately dip into, and rise above the mercury, in another
                    cup, K, which may be connected with the first by means of a copper wire. Now,
                    whenever the ends of the keeper are opposite the poles of the magnet, the keeper
                    becomes a temporary magnet, and it ceases to be so when the line joining them is
                    at right angles to the line joining the two poles. The instantaneous generation
                    and extinction of the magnetic force, which takes an opposite direction in the
                    keeper according as its opposite ends are close to the same poles, and induce
                    corresponding opposite electric currents in the copper wire, provided the
                    circuit is complete by the immersion of the points at <hi rend="italic">i.</hi>
                    The arrangement of the points at <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is such, that they
                    just rise from the mercury as the ends of the keeper come opposite to the poles
                    of the magnet; and hence the sudden breach of the circuit makes the current pass
                    in the form of a brilliant spark. If a fine platinum wire, instead of the
                    dipping points, forms the communication between the revolving disc and spindle.
                    It may be kept at a red heat. Its light slightly intermitting from the
                    alternation of the currents. If a communication is formed between<pb break="no"

                    the two cups of mercury by two copper cylinders grasped in the hands, a strange
                    sort of shock will be experienced, which is sometimes almost intolerable.
                    Chemical decompositions are also readily effected, and the amount will be
                    proportioned to the quantity of electricity in circulation.</p>
                <p>The magneto-electric machine has been greatly improved by Mr E. M. Clarke,
                    magnetical instrument maker, London. It is represented in fig. 79, where A is
                    the battery of bent bar magnets resting against the vertical board B, and by
                    means of a bar of brass C, with a bolt and screw-wheel, the magnets can be drawn
                    firmly to the board B, or taken from it. One of the keepers or armatures D is
                    screwed into a brass mandrill between the poles of the magnets, and it is made
                    to revolve by the multiplying wheel E. This armature has two coils of fine
                    copper wire 1500 yards long wrapped round its cylinders, the beginning of each
                    coil being soldered to the armature D, from which also projects a brass stem
                    carrying the break piece H, which can be fastened in any required position by a
                    binding screw. A hollow brass cylinder K, to which the ends of the coils are
                    soldered, being insulated by means of a piece of hard wood attached to the brass
                    stem. An iron wire spring O presses at one end against the cylinder K, and is
                    kept in contact with it by a screw in a brass strap M in the wooden block L. A
                    square brass pillar P fits also a square opening in the other brass strap N on
                    the other side of the block L. A metallic spring Q rubs gently upon the break
                    piece H, and is retained in perfect metallic contact with it by a screw in the
                    pillar P, the two straps of brass M, N, are connected by a piece of copper wire
                    T, and in this state the parts D, H, Q, P, N are in connexion with the
                    commencement of each coil, and the parts K, Ο, M with the termination of each
                    coil. The perfect metallic contact thus obtained by the spring and break,
                    enables Mr Clarke to dispense entirely with the use of mercury, which is at all
                    times a troublesome accompaniment of machinery.</p>
                <p>But the great superiority of Mr Clarke’s machine arises from his employing two
                    different armatures, and thus being enabled to produce the separate effects of
                    quantity and intensity to the full extent of the power of his battery. Having,
                    in November 1834, tried the effects of coils of wire of different thicknesses,
                    he found that the thick copper bell wire gave brilliant sparks, but no
                    perceptible shock, while very fine wire gave powerful shocks, but very feeble
                    sparks. By means of the <hi rend="italic">intensity armature,</hi> which is that
                    shewn in fig. 79, the various experiments made with a number of separate
                    galvanic plates may be performed, while the intense agony produced by its shocks
                    is intolerable: It can, at the same time, electrify the most nervous person
                    without occasioning the least uneasiness. It decomposes water and the neutral
                    salts. It deflects the gold leaves of the electroscope, charges the Leyden jar;
                    and by an arrangement of wires from the mercury box to the battery, the
                    electricity is made visible, passing from the magnetic battery to the armature,
                    and sparks and brilliant scintillations of steel can be obtained.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">quantity armature</hi> differs greatly from the intensity
                    one, as is shewn in fig. 80, which exhibits the method of producing the spark.
                    The weight of the iron in the cylinders is much greater than in the intensity
                    one, the copper wire is much thicker, and its length is only forty yards. By
                    this armature all the experiments can be made which are usually performed by a
                    single pair of voltaic plates of large surfaces, or by a calorimotor; but it
                    will not do for any of the intensity experiments. It produces such large and
                    brilliant sparks, that a person can read small print from the light it produces.
                    Il ignites gunpowder and platina wire, without enclosing the wire in a
                    hermetically sealed glass case. It deflagrates gold and silver leaf, and
                    produces brilliant scintillations from a small steel file. It produces also
                    rotatory motions in delicately suspended wire frames round the poles of a
                    vertical horse-shoe magnet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    electricity.</p>
                <p>Several very curious and unexpected results were obtained on a magneto-electric
                    machine of very large dimensions, which Mr Clarke exhibited at the meeting of
                    the Electrical Society. The battery was separated into two parts connected by
                    the armatures, the quantity armature being at one side, and the intensity one at
                    the other. The quantity armature had a short coil of thick insulated copper
                    wire, and the intensity one had 15,375 yards of fine copper wire. The intensity
                    arrangement, to the surprise of every body, gave no decomposition, but gave an
                    excruciating, and even dangerous shock, while the quantity arrangement gave one
                    cubic inch of the mixed gases in four minutes. Considering these unexpected
                    results as owing to a compound action produced by the rotation of the two
                    armatures, he arranged the magnets as in his first machines, the only difference
                    being in the size of the new machine, and in the armatures being moved by a
                    crank and treadles. The battery was composed of ten cut and polished steel bars,
                    each four feet long, the whole weighing 156 lbs. According to Mr Noad,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lectures on Electricity, p.
                    352.</p></note> the novel results of the experiments were the great amount of
                    gas given by the quantity armature, viz. one cubic inch in one and a half
                    minutes, and the trifling decomposing effect of the intensity armature. The
                    intensity spark was long, straggling, and noiseless, like a spark at the
                    striking distance from the prime conductor of an electrical machine, while the
                    quantity spark had the usual stellar form, but was attended with a loud snapping
                    noise, as in the discharge of a Leyden jar. Both the sparks, however, were
                    equally luminous. By employing a secondary coil, Mr Noad has given shocks with
                    the quantity armature, almost as powerful as those obtained from the intensity
                    one, by using the form of coil first proposed by Professor Callan of Maynooth,
                    and the contact-breaker of Dr Golding Bird.</p>
                <p>The following arrangement (fig. 81 ) for producing powerful shocks, and strong
                    chemical action by secondary currents, was first given by Dr Golding Bird. Upon

                    d,</hi> communicating with the extremities <hi rend="italic">s, s', of</hi> the
                    thin coil. The intensity of the secondary or reduced current is greatly
                    increased, by inserting a bar <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, of soft wire, or what is
                    better, a bundle of soft iron wires in the hollow axis of the steel, which
                    becomes magnetic.</p>
                <p>The ingenious method of breaking contact in this arrangement, which we owe to Dr
                    Golding Bird, though shewn in fig. 81, is more distinctly represented in fig.
                    82. It consists of a base of wood, eight inches long and three broad, having at
                    both ends a piece of hard wood, A, B, each piece having two holes excavated in
                    it to hold mercury. The holes in A communicate with those in B, by thick copper
                    wires D, D. A piece of soft iron wire EF, five inches long, and one-eighth inch
                    diameter, supported with screws with milled heads, moves in a vertical plane
                    upon the upright stem C. Round the wire EF are wound two helices of thin
                    insulated copper wire in the same direction from right to left, so that the two
                    ends of one helix may terminate in the copper points G, H, and those of the
                    other in the points KNL. The small horse-shoe <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi>
                    magnets, shewn in fig. 82, are fixed on proper supports, near the ends of the
                    bar EF, so that in depressing the end F of the bar. It may be opposite one,
                    suppose the <hi rend="italic">south</hi> pole of one magnet, and consequently
                    the end E will be opposite the other, the <hi rend="italic">north</hi> pole of
                    the second magnet. On raising the end F, the contrary will take place, and to
                    effect this the similar poles of the magnet should be in the same direction.
                    Upon connecting the mercury cups in A or B, as shewn in fig. 81, with the small
                    voltaic battery at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the wire EF will become a temporary
                    magnet, if the ends of either helix are allowed to dip in the mercury; and if
                    connection with the battery is properly made, the ends or poles of the temporary
                    magnet will be repelled by the poles of the permanent magnet to which they are
                    opposed; the bar EF will therefore move, and make the ends of the second helix
                    dip in the other cups of mercury,—repulsion will again take place, and so on
                    ;—in this way, about 300 oscillatione of EF can be obtained in a minute. Upon
                    connecting the ends <hi rend="italic">p,p,</hi> of the thick helix with a single
                    voltaic pair, by means of this contact-breaker, a series of powerful induced
                    currents will be obtained from the extremities <hi rend="italic">s, s’,</hi> of
                    the larger helix. This connection is best made, as in fig. 82, where R is a
                    section of the reel, S one end of the short helix, connected with a cup of
                    mercury in the piece B, Z the other end of the short helix, connected with one
                    plate of the battery, while the wire C connects the other cup of mercury in B
                    with the other plate of the voltaic pair. When the points G, H, K, L, leave the
                    mercury, very brilliant sparks are produced. A loud snapping noise accompanies
                    them, and a vivid combustion of the mercury, clouds of the oxide of mercury
                    being largely evolved. If the ends P, R, fig. 82, or <hi rend="italic">s</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">s'</hi>, fig.81, have platinum points, and are immersed in
                    water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, torrents of minute bubbles of oxygen and
                    hydrogen are evolved; and if, instead of water, the points are pressed upon
                    paper, moistened with iodide of potassium, iodine and oxide of potassium are
                    separated. Solutions of sulphate of potash and soap, chloride of potassium,
                    sodium, antimony, and copper, are also rapidly decomposed. Dr Page was the first
                    person who suggested the application of permanent magnets for the purpose of
                    breaking contact, though Dr Bird afterwards, and without knowing this, made the
                    same application.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>We shall now conclude this chapter with a brief notice of some very recent
                    investigations of Dr Draper of New York, on the electromotive power of heat. The
                    apparatus which he employed is shewn in fig. 83, where AA is a glass vessel
                    about three inches in diameter, with a neck wide enough to receive a mercurial
                    thermometer <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the extremity of a pair of
                    thermo-electric wires about a foot long, and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                    rend="italic">s</hi> with hard solder. The free extremities of these wires dip
                    into the glass cups <hi rend="italic">d, d,</hi> filled with mercury, and
                    immersed in a trough <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> containing water and pounded ice.
                    By means of the copper wires <hi rend="italic">f, f,</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    deviations are determined by the torsion of a glass thread, as invented by Dr
                    Ritchie. When a copper and iron wire are used, they indicate temperatures with a
                    promptitude and accuracy quite surprising. In <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=735" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0735-0695"
                    />using this apparatus, the vessel AA is filled two-thirds with water, the bulb
                    of the thermometer being in the middle of the vessel, and the soldered extremity
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the wires in contact with it. The wires <hi
                    rend="italic">f, f</hi> are then placed in the cups, and the trough <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> filled with water and pounded ice, and carefully surrounded
                    with flannel. The water in AA is then brought to the boiling point with a
                    spirit-lamp, and kept at that temperature till the astatic needles and
                    thermometer are steady. For temperatures above 212°, Dr Draper substitutes for
                    the glass vessel a tubulated retort containing quicksilver. Dr Draper’s
                    experiments were all made with the metals in the form of wires, and he obtained
                    the following general results:—</p>
                <p>1. Equal increments of heat do not set in motion equal quantities of
                    electricity.</p>
                <p>2. The tension undergoes a slight increase with increase of temperature.</p>
                <p>3. The quantity of electricity evolved at any given temperature is independent of
                    the amount of heated surface, a point being as efficacious as an indefinitely
                    extended surface.</p>
                <p>4. The quantities of electricity evolved in a pile of pairs is directly
                    proportional to the number of the elements.</p>
                <p>Dr Draper has been led to the following forms of construction, which give
                    peculiar advantages to thermo-electric combinations.</p>
                <p>In fig. 84, A, let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be a bar of antimony, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> one of bismuth, soldered at <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi> and
                    let the temperature be raised at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> a current is excited,
                    which does not pass round the bars <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ft, but in a shorter
                    and readier path, through the metals between <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi>
                    circulating as shewn by the arrows. Nor will the whole current pass round the
                    bars till the temperature of the soldered surface has become uniform. The
                    combination A will therefore be improved, by giving it the form in fig. B, a
                    part being cut out at the dotted lines. In this form the whole current will be
                    immediately forced to pass along the bars, and in such a pair the temperature
                    will change very quickly. Dr Draper considers the form in fig. C, as the best
                    for a thermo-electric couple. In this form <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a
                    semi-cylindrical bar of antimony, ft one of bismuth, united together by the
                    opposite corners of a lozenge-shaped piece of copper <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    From its extent of surface, the copper becomes readily hot and cold, and may be
                    made very thin. With a pair of bars, three-fourths of an inch thick, and a
                    circular copper plate <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, with both surfaces blackened, Dr
                    Draper repeated the greater part of those experiments, which M. Melloni made
                    with his multiplier. Dr Draper found that thermo-electric currents, evolved by
                    pairs of different metals, do not differ specifically, like the rays of light
                    and heat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Lend, and

                <p>CHAP. IV ON THERMO-ELECTRICITY.</p>
                <p>While investigating the influence of heat in voltaic combinations, Dr Seebeck of
                    Berlin was led to the important discovery that magnetism was developed in two
                    metals forming a circuit, when the equilibrium of temperature in that circuit
                    was disturbed.</p>
                <p>If A B C D, for example, fig. 85, be a metallic circuit, consisting of an arch of
                    <hi rend="italic">bismuth,</hi> A B C, and an arch of <hi rend="italic"
                    >copper,</hi> A D C, then if one of the junctions, A, is heated, an electrical
                    current is established, passing into the heated junction from the bismuth to the
                    copper. From many experiments, Dr Seebeck found that, in various circuits formed
                    with bismuth and other metals, the current always passes from the bismuth to the
                    other metals, the bismuth losing <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> electricity, or
                    becoming <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> with all the other metals.</p>
                <p>The order of the metals, beginning with galaena, in which they are negative in
                    reference to those which precede them, is given in the following table, which,
                    excepting some additions and alterations, was drawn up by Professor Oersted.</p>

                <p>Although Dr Seebeck found that most of the metals which stand near each other in
                    the above series produce feeble thermo-electricity, and those more distant a
                    more powerful effect, yet this law did not always hold. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tellurium,</hi> for example, is less thermo-electric with bismuth, and most of
                    the other metals, than antimony is; and with <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> it is
                    more effective than most of the metals above it. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antimony,</hi> too, is more effective with <hi rend="italic">cadmium</hi> than
                    with mercury; while <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> is very feebly thermo-electric
                    with most of the other metals, especially <hi rend="italic">nickel</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">cobalt.</hi></p>
                <p>The effects of the sulphurets Dr Seebeck found to be remarkable. Sulphuret of
                    lead becomes negative even in contact with the bismuth. The sulphurets of iron,
                    arsenic, cobalt and arsenic, and copper, all of which have a <hi rend="italic"
                    >maximum</hi> of sulphur, stand near to bismuth; while all the sulphurets, with
                    a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of sulphur, have nearly the same power as
                    antimony. The sulphuret of copper, with a minimum of sulphur, occupies a place
                    even below antimony. Concentrated <hi rend="italic">nitric</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sulphuric</hi> acids stand above bismuth; while concentrated

                    are below antimony and tellurium.</p>

                <p>The structure or the crystalline arrangement of the particles of bodies seems to
                    exercise some influence over their thermo-electric powers. In a thermo-electric
                    combination of <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">silver,</hi>
                    for example, the electricity increases with the temperature up to about 250° of
                    Fahrenheit, when it ceases altogether, and by increase of temperature the
                    electric current is re-established in an opposite direction.</p>
                <p>In order to measure the thermo-electric power of different binary combinations of
                    metals, from the same differences of temperature, a compound circuit must be
                    formed of all those which we desire to compare. The junctions of the metals must
                    be kept at the temperature of melting ice, excepting the junction which is to be
                    made active, and which is to be plunged into hot oil. In this way the mere
                    conducting power of the circuit is the same in every experiment, and the results
                    obtained become strictly comparable.</p>

                <p>If we compare the numbers in the last column, we shall find, as Μ. Becquerel
                    states, that, for a temperature of 36°, each metal acquires such a degree of
                    thermo-electric <hi rend="italic">power</hi> that the intensity of the current,
                    produced by the contact of the two metals, is equal to the difference of the
                    quantities which represent each of these actions in each metal. Thus, if we call
                    the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of each metal <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> we
                    shall have, in the case of the iron and copper junction, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi> iron — <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> platina = 36∙07∙ Substracting the
                    first from the second, we have <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> copper— <hi
                    rend="italic">p.</hi> platina = 8∙11, instead of 8∙55, given by experiment. The
                    iron and tin junction gives 31∙24, and that of copper and tin 3∙50. The
                    difference in that of iron and copper is thus 27·74, in place of 27·96 by
                    experiment. The intensity of the thermo-electric current being, therefore, equal
                    to the difference of the thermo-electric action produced in each metal by the
                    same temperature, we shall obtain the powers of each of these metals as follows:

                    as M. Becquerel states, arises from the mutual reaction of the two portions of
                    water of different temperatures.</p>
                <p>It did not escape the sagacity of Dr Seebeck, that the thermo-electric current
                    might be increased, by forming a compound thermo-electric current, and arranging
                    the metallic couples in a series analogous to those in the voltaic circuit.
                    Having met, however, with some obstacles in this part of his inquiry, he
                    discontinued the investigation, which was taken up without their knowing that he
                    had entered upon it, by Baron Fourier, and Professor Oersted. They first
                    employed a hexagonal combination of three pieces of bismuth, and three of
                    antimony, soldered together. One side of the hexagon was placed in the magnetic
                    direction, and a compass put below it. <hi rend="italic">One</hi> of the
                    junctions was then heated, then <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> not adjacent. then
                    <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> always leaving one junction not heated between the
                    two heated ones. By heating <hi rend="italic">one</hi> junction the needle
                    deviated some degrees, still more by heating <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> and
                    still more by heating <hi rend="italic">three</hi> junctions. When <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> junctions were cooled with ice, the other three having
                    the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere, effects still more distinct were
                    produced. When <hi rend="italic">three</hi> alternate junctions were <hi
                    rend="italic">heated,</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">three</hi> cooled
                    with ice, the needle deviated sixty degrees.</p>
                <p>In a rectangular circuit, with twenty-two bars of antimony, and twenty-two of
                    bismuth soldered together, the same effects were obtained. After dissolving one
                    of the junctions, a little mercury cup was soldered to each of the disjoined
                    bars, so that the circuit could be re-established by different means. A copper
                    wire, four inches long, and l-25th of an inch in diameter, nearly re-established
                    the current; and it was completely re-established by two parallel pieces of the
                    same ware. A wire of the same diameter, but <hi rend="italic">three</hi> feet
                    long, was found a tolerably good conductor; but a platina wire, about sixteen
                    inches long, and 1-50th of an inch in diameter, scarcely transmitted a <hi
                    rend="italic">fortieth</hi> part of the effect. Acids, and solutions of
                    alkalies, and other metallic oxides, though good conductors in the voltaic or
                    hydro-electric circuit, insulated entirely the thermoelectric current. The same
                    effect was produced by two discs of silver, separated by the thinnest blotting
                    paper, moistened with sulphate of copper. In these experiments, the intensest
                    current produced no chemical effects, no ignition of the wires, and no electric
                    condensation; but a prepared frog was made to palpitate.</p>
                <p>In thermo-electric currents, which differ only in lengths, the shortest is the
                    most powerful, a circuit of double length having little more than half the
                    effect. In order to find the law of increased effect, as depending on the number
                    of junctions, Professor Oersted composed circuits of equal length with different
                    numbers of junctions.</p>
                <p>In fig. 86, is shewn a simple circuit consisting of one bar, <hi rend="italic">a
                    a,</hi> of antimony, and one, <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> of bismuth, and in
                    fig. 87, a complex circuit of the same length and materials. When one of the
                    junctions in fig. 86 was heated or cooled, and two of the junctions at the
                    extremities of the diagonals in fig. 87. heated or cooled to the same degree,
                    the deviation of the needle was 22° in the first case and 30° in the second.</p>
                <p>In like manner, open circuits, as in figs. 88, 89, having each the same length,
                    but double that of the preceding two, had, the one <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    junction, and the other <hi rend="italic">three</hi> junctions, heat-or cooled
                    equally, the first gave a deviation of about 14°, and the other nearly 32°.</p>
                <p>“In several complex circuits,” says Professor Oersted,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, Art. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thermo-Electricity</hi>, vol. xviii. p. 585.</p></note> “it is
                    found that the heating or cooling of one junction only produces twice the
                    angular deviations of that added by the addition of one active junction more.
                    The effect of one active junction, when the others are at rest, is, by
                    experiment, found to be twice the effect of all the arrangements divided by the
                    sum of the elements + one. The effect of each addition of a new active junction
                    is only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> this quantity, and seems even to be in a
                    decreasing ratio when the number of junctions is great.”</p>
                <p>From these and other observations. It appears that the thermo-electric current
                    produces a prodigious quantity of electricity, but in a state of very feeble
                    intensity, while the voltaic current has a very great intensity. The former is
                    impaired by the resistance opposed to it by a long multiplying wire, while the
                    latter is increased in surmounting this resistance. Μ. Pouillet has endeavoured
                    to compare the intensity of these two currents, by passing the hydro-electric
                    current through a platinum wire long enough to reduce it to an intensity which
                    will just balance the thermo-electric current. In one case he found that 590
                    feet of platinum wire, ∙006 of an inch in diameter, including the resistance of
                    the battery, reduced a hydro-electric current, produced by twelve pair of plates
                    with double coppers, to an equilibrium with that of one thermo-electric pair of
                    bismuth and copper, in a circuit of 65∙6 feet of copper wire, ·039 of an inch in
                    diameter, with a difference of temperature of 76° Fahrenheit. By computing the
                    rotation between the electro-motive forces and the resistance in these two
                    cases, he found that the hydro-electric current had an intensity 114,000 times
                    greater than that of a single pair of bismuth and copper, produced by a
                    difference of temperature, between the two junctions, of 108’ of
                    Fahrenheit.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Becquerel’s

                <p>In order to compare the conductibility of metals for thermo-electro currents, M.

                    Exp. liv. v. chap. v. § 426.</p></note> employed <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    equal thermo-electric currents. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> was weakened by

                    traversing lengths, more or less great, of another wire, which served as the

                <p>Hence it appears that <hi rend="italic">palladium</hi> is the best conductor of
                    thermo-electricity, and <hi rend="italic">mercury</hi> the worst, having <hi
                    rend="italic">sixty</hi> times less conductibility than palladium. That which
                    has a slight effect on the conductibility of mercury produces a prodigious
                    variation in that of iron or steel. Even the heat of the hand produces very
                    sensible effects, and what M. Pouillet justly thinks still more wonderful, the
                    heating to redness of some millimetres of the length of a wire of iron or steel,
                    is sufficient to make its conductibility <hi rend="italic">three</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> times less.</p>
                <p>When thermo-electric currents are produced by a single element, and the
                    thermo-electric power remains the same, M. Pouillet found that the intensity of
                    the current which it produces, is inversely as the length of the circuit, and
                    directly as the conductibility of the wire or rod which forms the current. He
                    found, also, that in a thermo-electric circuit, composed of wires of different
                    sections, the elementary force of the current is the same in all powers, if we
                    take equal intervals on these different wires the direct currents will be found
                    to have different intensities, which are nearly in the inverse ratio of the
                    sections of the wires in the intervals of deviation. M. Pouillet succeeded,
                    also, in establishing the curious fact, which had been recognised by M.

                    propagate themselves in the interior of bodies, as if they were alone, like
                    light and heat.</p>
                <p>The first persons who succeeded in constructing thermoelectric piles, were MM.
                    Nobili and Melloni, who employed them successfully in their experiments on
                    radiant heat. This instrument, however, has since been improved by Melloni, and
                    we shall, therefore, describe it in preference after Μ. Becquerel. M. Melloni
                    constructed his thermo-electric pile of fifty small bars of bismuth and antimony
                    placed in a bundle, as shewn in fig. 90, the length of the bundle being 30
                    millimetres, and its section 96 centimetres square. The two terminal faces are
                    blackened. The bars of bismuth, which alternate with those of antimony, are
                    soldered at their extremities, and separated throughout their whole lengths by
                    an insulating substance. The first and the last bar have each attached to them a
                    copper wire, abutting against one of the pins <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">c'</hi>, of the same metal, passing through a piece of ivory fixed
                    in the ring AA'. The interval between the interior surface of this ring and the
                    elements of the pile is filled with insulating matter. The free extremities of
                    the two wires communicate with the ends of the wire of a multiplier, the needle
                    of which indicates when the temperature of the anterior face of the pile rises
                    or falls above that of the posterior face. Two metallic tubes B, B, polished
                    without, and blackened within, are fitted to the two ends of the pile, to
                    protect them from lateral radiations. The multiplier is shewn in fig. 91, where
                    AB <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the frame enveloped by the copper wire, whose
                    extremities abut against the metallic tubes FF', fig. 92. This frame is fixed on
                    a horizontal stage DE, which can turn in its own plane, and round its centre, by
                    means of a toothed wheel and pinion placed below, and moved by the milled head

                    the silk fibre VL, and the cylinder of glass RS covers the apparatus, and rests
                    on the base KL Fig. 92 is a section of the apparatus, by a plane passing through
                    the support, and one of the tubes of communication. The needles are 53
                    millimetres long, the diameter of the copper wire is 0.76 mm., and it is doubly
                    covered with silk, and makes 150 circumvolutions round the frame, which is 6
                    millimetres high, having its length a little greater than that of the
                    needles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Becquerel’s

                <p>We have already seen that thermo-electricity possesses the same general
                    characters as common and voltaic electricity. Although Oersted failed in
                    obtaining chemical action from his thermo-electric combinations, yet Professor
                    Botto<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bibliothèque
                    Universelle, Sept. 1832.</p></note> of Turin subsequently decomposed acidulated
                    water. His apparatus consisted of a metallic wire or chain, composed of 120
                    pieces of platinum wire, each an inch long, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> th of an inch in diameter, alternately with the
                    same number of pieces of soft wire of thesamedimensions. This chain was wrapped
                    spirally round a wooden rule 18 inches long, so that the joints were placed
                    alternately at each side of the ruler, receding from the wood at one side to the
                    distance of four lines. By using a spirit-lamp the same length as the helix, and
                    a Nobili’s galvanometer, a very energetic current was shewn to <pb break="no"

                    />exist, and the decomposition of acidulated water was increased, by
                    substituting copper in place of platinum poles, in which case hydrogen only was
                    set free. An increased temperature augmented the current and the decomposition.
                    Μ. Botto obtained still more powerful effects by a pile of bismuth and antimony,
                    consisting of 140 elements forming a parallelopiped, with a base of 2¼ inches,
                    and a height of 1 inch.</p>
                <p>A distinct electric spark has also been obtained from the thermo-electric pile,
                    by the Chevalier Antinori of Florence. Professor Linari<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>L’Indicatore Sanese, No. 50, Dec.

                    with a Nobili’s pile of 25 elements and temporary magnet, with an
                    electro-dynamic spiral 805 feet long. With this apparatus he obtained a
                    brilliant spark visible in open day, whenever the contact was broken. With this
                    pile and temperatures from freezing to boiling water, he readily decomposed
                    water, and also nitrate of silver. The same thermo-electric current magnetised
                    an unmagnetic needle, and produced the phenomenon of the palpitation of mercury.
                    Professor Wheatstone verified these experiments in 1837, by a thermo-electric
                    pile of 33 elements of bismuth and antimony, forming a bundle three-fourths of
                    an inch in diameter, and 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 5</hi> th long. The poles were connected by two thick wires, with a spiral of
                    copper ribbon 50 feet long and 14 inch broad, the coils being insulated by brown
                    paper and silk. One face of the pile was heated by red-hot iron brought near it,
                    and the other cooled by ice. Two strong wires connected the poles of the pile
                    and the spiral, and the contact was broken, when necessary, in a mercury cup,
                    between one extremity of the spiral and one of these wires. A distinct spark was
                    seen in open day whenever the contact was broken.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The thermo-electric pile has been greatly improved by Mr Watkins, who employs a
                    flat copper ribbon coil. In piles varying from 15 to 30 pairs of elements, he
                    obtains brilliant sparks, by merely pouring hot water on one end, while the
                    other has the temperature of the air.</p>
                <p>Professor Andrews of Belfast has recently succeeded in developing thermo-electric
                    currents, by simply bringing two metallic wires at different temperatures into
                    contact with a fused salt, between which and the wires no chemical action takes
                    place. This result he first obtained by means of fused borax. He took two
                    similar wires of platina, and connected them with the extremities of the copper
                    wire of one of Gourjon’s galvanometers, and fused a small globule of borax in
                    the flame of a spirit-lamp on the free extremity of one of the platina wires,
                    and having introduced the free extremity of the other into the flame, he brought
                    the latter, raised to a higher temperature than the former, into contact with
                    the fused globule. When this was done, the needle of the galvanometer was
                    instantly driven with great violence to the limit of the scale. The direction of
                    the current was always from the hotter platina wire, through the salt, to the
                    colder wire. Professor Andrews obtained a permanent electric current in the same
                    direction, by simply fusing the globule between the two wires, and applying the
                    flame of the lamp in such a manner, that the wires, at their points of contact
                    with the fused salt, had different temperatures. Fused carbonate of soda gave
                    similar, but more powerful currents than borax. Carbonate of potash, chloride
                    and iodide of potassium, sulphate of soda, chloride of strontium, heated glass,
                    &amp;c. produced similar currents; and even boracic acid, though such an
                    imperfect conductor, deflected the needle 40°.</p>
                <p>The currents thus produced have an intensity inferior to that of the
                    hydro-electric currents, and they are capable of decomposing with great facility
                    water and other electrolytes.</p>
                <p>Before the salts were actually fused, Professor Andrews found that electrical
                    currents were generated whose directions no longer followed the simple law, but
                    varied in the most singular and perplexing manner, passing first from the hot to
                    the cold wire, then by more heat from the cold to the hot, and by more heat
                    still from the hot to the cold wire.</p>
                <p>Professor Andrews obtained similar currents, by interposing certain minerals
                    between unequally-heated platina wires. <hi rend="italic">Mica,</hi> heated very

                <p>Thermo-electric rotations were, we believe, first produced by Professor Cumming,
                    by means of a very simple apparatus. He formed a rectangle of silver and
                    platina, as shewn in fig. 93. The three upper sides are formed of silver, and
                    the lower of platina. When suspended, as shewn in the figure, and when one of
                    the junctions was heated. It revolved from <hi rend="italic">left</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">right,</hi> when the pole of a magnet was presented to another
                    junction. When the rectangle was suspended upon the loadstone itself, and heat
                    applied to one of the junctions, the rectangle soon began to turn.</p>

                <p>In studying the effects of thermo-electric currents, Μ. Peltier made the
                    interesting discovery, that <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> instead of heat, is
                    produced at the points of junction of certain crystallisable metals. The
                    instrument by which he obtained these interesting results is shewn in fig. 94,
                    where A B are two thermo-electric couples in bismuth and antimony, C a copper
                    wire which unites the antimony <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> of the upper couple to

                <p>If we now place wires of different metals between the thermo-electric pincers F,
                    H, and vary the intensity of the current, we shall observe a rise of temperature
                    when the conductors are homogeneous, the heat being the same throughout the
                    whole length of the wires, with the exception of their extremities, where it
                    increases or diminishes according as the pincers which retain the wire are worse
                    or better conductors than itself. When copper pincers are used, a depression of
                    temperature is felt at the distance of two or three centimetres, according to
                    the intensity of the current. M. Peltier has found that when the current has
                    double the intensity, or when the section of the conductor is one-half, the
                    temperature is tripled. The results obtained by Μ. Peltier tend to prove that
                    the two electricities produce heat by their union, however feeble be their
                    intensities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ.

                <p>We shall now conclude this article with a description of two thermo-electric
                    instruments, viz. Μ. Peltier’s thermo-electric hygrometer, for determining by
                    the change of temperature whether a solution or a chemical combination has taken
                    place when two bodies are brought into contact, and Mr Locke’s thermoscopic
                    galvanometer. M. Becquerel had long ago shewn that when a simple solution takes
                    place, no electrical effect is produced, but that when two substances chemically
                    combine, positive electricity passes from an alkali to an acid, and negative
                    electricity from an acid to an alkali. The nature of the electric wires
                    therefore determine by means of a multiplier, whether combination or simple
                    solution has taken place. But as a change of temperature also takes place, M.
                    Peltier has employed this as the means of deciding whether solution or
                    combination has taken place, cold being produced in the one case, and heat in
                    the other. This hygrometer is shewn without the galvanometer in fig. 95, where A
                    is a wooden disc for supporting the thermo-electric couples, being itself
                    supported by a rod and a bar; B, B, B, three couples of bismuth or antimony
                    forming the thermoscopic support; W, W, the wires leading to the multiplier; D,
                    a platina capsule filled with distilled water, which is to be placed on the
                    couples; E E, a cylinder of card; and F F, a glass receiver open at top, but
                    surrounded with paper to prevent radiation. When distilled water is placed in
                    the capsule. Its spontaneous evaporation produces a depression of temperature
                    which varies ordinarily from 40° to 60°<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The degrees of the galvanometer we presume. Μ. Becquerel’s
                    Traité, &amp;c., tom. v., p. 243.</p></note>. As this apparatus is very
                    sensible, the needle of the multiplier arrives rapidly at 90°; but this
                    inconvenience is removed by placing in the circuit supplementary conductors,
                    which diminish the intensity of the current, and bring back the needle to the
                    first 20°. Tables are then formed which give the ratio between the deviations of
                    the needles, the intensities of the current, and the differences; a very
                    extended scale is thus formed which may begin at 150° above zero, and descend
                    indefinitely. To compare this instrument, we have only to determine the extreme
                    dryness produced with muriate of lime placed in a close vessel. When the
                    saturation of the air produces no evaporation, the capsule remains at the
                    surrounding temperature, and the needle at zero. When we have determined the
                    force corresponding to the number of degrees given by extreme dryness, we
                    divided this force into 100 parts, corresponding to 100 degrees of ordinary
                    hygrometers.</p>
                <p>Dr Locke, professor of chemistry in the medical college of Ohio, has lately
                    constructed a new thermoscopic galvanometer, the peculiarity of which is the
                    massiveness of the coil, which affords a free passage to currents of the most
                    feeble intensity, and enables them to deflect a very heavy needle. The coil is
                    made of a copper fillet about 50 feet long, one-fourth of an inch wide, 9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> thick, and weighing
                    between 4 and 5 pounds. This coil is not made in a pile at the diameter of the
                    circle in which the needle is to revolve, but is opened out, the several turns
                    lying side by side, and covering almost the whole of that circle above and
                    below. It is wound closely and in parallel turns on a circular piece of board
                    11½ inches in diameter, and half an inch thick, covering the whole of it except
                    two small opposite segments of about 90° each. The board being extracted, leaves
                    a cavity of its own shape, to be occupied by the needle. The copper fillet is
                    not covered with silk or any other coating, but the turns of it are separated at
                    their ends by veneers of wood just so far as to prevent contact throughout. The
                    coil is supported on a wooden ring with brass feet and levelling screws, and
                    surrounded by a brass hoop with a flat glass cover, in the centre of which is
                    inserted a brass tube for suspending by a silk fibre, one of Nobili’s double
                    astatic needles, each part being about 11 inches long, one-fourth of an inch
                    wide, and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 60</hi> th
                    thick. The lower part plays within the coil, and the upper part above it, and
                    the thin white deal placed upon it. This instrument is peculiarly fitted for
                    experiments in a class. It is very sensible to a single pair of thermo-electric
                    metals, to the action of which it seems peculiarly adapted. With a battery of
                    five couples of bismuth and antimony, the radiation of a person 12 feet distant,
                    without any reflector, and when the temperature of the air was 72°, moved the
                    needle sensibly. If a thermo-electric pile, massive in proportion to the coil,
                    is used, this thermoscope would exhibit the experiments of Melloni
                    satisfactorily to a large class. A more detailed account of this instrument will
                    be found in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, October 1837, vol.
                    xi., p. 378.</p>
