                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">VAUD or <hi rend="smallcaps">Waadt</hi></label>, a canton of
                    Switzerland, in the westernmost part of it, extending in north latitude from 46°
                    17' to 47° 5',and in east longitude from 5° 54' to 7° 1’. It is bounded on the
                    north by the canton and lake of Neuchâtel, on the east by Freyburg, on the
                    south-east by Berne and Valais, on the south by the lake of Geneva, on the
                    south-west by Geneva, and on the west by the kingdom of France. It is 893 square
                    geographical miles in extent, and is divided, under a new constitution
                    introduced in 1831, into nineteen districts, and subdivided into sixty circles,
                    each of which comprehends either one or two, and a few three, communes or
                    parishes. The population in 1838 amounted to 183,582 persons, of whom 175,000
                    are of French extraction, and speak that language; the remainder are of the
                    German race. The prevalent religion is the Calvinistic, which possesses 167
                    parish churches; but in the district of Eschallans, the Catholic worship is
                    established over seven parishes, and it is tolerated in all other parts of the
                    canton. By the new constitution a simple democracy has been established. The
                    legislative body consists of 184 deputies, who are chosen every fifth year by
                    all the inhabitants. The executive and administrative power is vested in a
                    council of seven members, selected from the members of the legislature, and
                    appointed for six years. The judicial power is in a state of transition. The
                    military administration is in a board, and it superintends the army, or rather
                    militia, which comprehends horse, foot, and artillery. The force mustered
                    exceeds 24,000 men of all arms; and there are at Lausanne and at Morges
                    institutions for the education of military students. The civil and moral
                    education is conducted in two academies, seven colleges, and 613 primary or
                    parish schools. The annual revenue is derived from a land tax, a tax on patents
                    or licenses to trade, a salt tax, a stamp tax, and some smaller items. It
                    amounts to about one million francs, and the expenditure is nearly equal to it.
                    The contribution to the general confederation is 59,280 francs, and the
                    contingent of troops is fixed at 2964 men.</p>
                <p>The face of the country in Vaud is generally undulating, with hills of moderate
                    height and pleasing vales, but inclosed by chains of mountains, which in the
                    south reach the highest point among the Alps. The greater part of the canton is
                    the finest part of Switzerland. It presents to the view rich and beautiful
                    plains, valleys varying in extent, gentle acclivities, verdant meadows, and
                    delightful shores around the most wonderful lakes of this romantic division of
                    Europe. It must however be acknowledged, that in these plains the soil is
                    generally so heavy and difficult to work, and that in the more elevated spots so
                    thinly covered with vegetablemould, that agriculture is by no means a profitable
                    pursuit, and the inhabitants are mostly occupied in the breeding of cattle and
                    the cultivation of the vine. The best wine, called Vaud wine or Ryff wine, is
                    made between Vevay and Lausanne. Those called Vins de la Cote, made between the
                    latter city and Geneva, are all white, while the best red wine is that made on
                    the lake of Neuchâtel; but much is made in other districts. The growth of fruit
                    is very extensive, and there are many extensive woods of chesnuts. 'tobacco is
                    raised of good quality, and in some parts hemp and flax. The main object of
                    rural husbandry is however the breeding of cattle.</p>
                <p>In the mountains of Aigle and Bex is the only salt spring in Switzerland. There
                    is very little manufacturing industry, except for domestic utensils. Some
                    leather is tanned, and a few cutlery articles are made at Vallorbe; and there is
                    a little porcelain and some coarse pottery ware prepared in different districts.
                    The commerce consists chiefly of the transport of French wares to the interior
                    of Switzerland and to Germany, and in the export of wine and cheese, and of live
                    cattle. The imports consist of French brandy, snuff, sugar, coffee, woollen and
                    cotton cloths, iron, leather. The corn grown is seldom equal to the consumption,
                    and in most seasons wheat and barley form a part of the import articles.</p>
