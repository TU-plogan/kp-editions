                <p><label type="entry">VIENNA <hi rend="smallcaps">(Wien)</hi></label>, the capital
                    of the circle of Austria, and of the whole Austrian empire, is situated upon an
                    arm of the Danube, to the south of the main stream, at the mouth of the rivulet
                    Wien, about 500 feet above the level of the sea, and in north latitude 48° 12',
                    and east longitude 16° 22'. The city, properly so called, is very small,
                    consisting in 1827, of only 1227 houses, while the suburbs contained 7415. It is
                    surrounded with a strong and compactly built brick wall, rising from fifty to
                    seventy feet above the outer ditch, and forming a fine terrace, which serves as
                    a public promenade, called the Bastey. The Bastey is externally surrounded by
                    the Glacis, an open space, varying in width from about 1200 to 1600 feet, and
                    rising gradually into eminences upon which the thirty-four suburbs are built.
                    These are also surrounded with a wall, the external circumference of which is
                    about fourteen miles, but are completely separated from the city by the Glacis,
                    which has been laid out with fine walks, thus affording, in the very midst of
                    the town, every facility for air and exercise to the inhabitants. Within the
                    narrow circuit of the Bastey, which may be walked round in fifty minutes, is
                    contained almost every object of interest or importance; the Imperial palace,
                    the offices of government, the residences of the higher classes, most of the
                    public museums, libraries, and galleries, the best shops, and, with one
                    exception, all the good hotels. But, like those of most other old towns, the
                    streets of the city are narrow, the places small, and the houses lofty, rising
                    to four or five stories, occupied by different families, and, like those of
                    Edinburgh and Paris, approached by a common stair. Their average number of
                    occupants is about forty; but in the very heart of the city, there are large
                    masses of building, containing more inhabitants than many a large village. They
                    are generally built in the form of a square surrounding a small dark court, and
                    are under the superintendence of a <hi rend="italic">Hausmeister,</hi> a person
                    appointed by the proprietor to watch over the building and its tenants, to
                    preserve the cleanliness of the common passages, and attend to the street door.
                    It is however fashionable to reside in the city; and even a tradesman
                    domiciliated there holds a higher rank than his brethren in the suburbs. The
                    suburbs are not so splendidly built as the city; but their more elevated
                    situation, their wide and regular streets, and the inferior height of the
                    houses, would seem to render them a preferable residence, were it not for the
                    domineering influence of fashion.</p>
                <p>Among the numerous public buildings which adorn Vienna, the following may be
                    enumerated as the principal. The Kaiserburg, or imperial palace, is a very large
                    building, of a most irregular form, consisting indeed of a conglomeration of
                    edifices erected at different times, but presenting, nevertheless, many portions
                    remarkable for their magnificence, and the beauty of their architecture. It
                    stands on the south side of the city, incloses several courts, one of which,
                    Joseph’s Platz, is adorned with a fine equestrian statue, in bronze, of the
                    emperor Joseph II. The part used as the residence of the sovereign is called the
                    Schweit-zerhof, and is an extensive building forming two sides of a square, but
                    its appearance is not very striking. It however contains large collections of
                    valuable works of art. The rest of the building is devoted to various purposes,
                    comprising, among others, the Hof-Bibliothek, or imperial library, the chancery
                    of the empire, the imperial riding-school, and the theatre of the palace. The
                    library is a temple worthy o. the intellectual treasures which it enshrines. It
                    contained, in 1839, 425,631 volumes of printed books in every language, and
                    17,136 manuscripts, mostly of great value. The palaces and mansions of the
                    nobility are among the most interesting buildings in Vienna, while those devoted
                    to public purposes are seldom worthy of the smallest notice. Among these
                    mansions may be noticed the palace of the Archduke Charles, and the gorgeous
                    palace of the Prince of Liechtenstein. The ancient palace of Prince Eugene,
                    called the Belvedere, was converted into a museum by Joseph IL, to whose
                    munificence and taste Vienna is thus indebted for one of the best collections of
                    paintings in Europe, particularly rich in the works of the Flemish and the
                    German <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=684"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0684-0644"/>schools. The ground floor of the Belvedere also
                    contains a fine collection of ancient armour, and of portraits of the most
                    distinguished persons connected with the house of Hapsburg. The arsenal likewise
                    contains collections of weapons of war ingeniously arranged; and, in the city
                    arsenal, besides sufficient arms for 30,000 men, and a proportional artillery,
                    there is a large collection of Turkish trophies, including the head of the grand
                    vizier, Kara Mustapha, who commanded the Turks at the siege of Vienna in 1683.
                    Vienna is indeed well calculated to afford gratification to the antiquary and
                    the admirer of the fine arts; for, besides the imperial and public collections,
                    many noblemen have their separate galleries and collections, and all are of easy
                    access.</p>
                <p>Vienna contains fifty-seven Catholic, one Lutheran, one Calvinist, and four Greek
                    churches, with two Jewish synagogues. The principal of these is the cathedral
                    church of St Stephen, almost in the heart of the city; a beautiful Gothic
                    building, with a steeple remarkable for its symmetry and height. It was begun by
                    the first duke of Austria, before the middle of the twelfth century; in the
                    thirteenth it was twice destroyed by fire, and then rebuilt in its present form.
                    Its greatest length is 355 feet, and its extreme breadth 230; the height of the
                    steeple is 420 or 434 feet, and it is ascended by 753 steps. Next in rank to the
                    cathedral the Viennese reckon the church of St Carlo Borromeo, in the suburb
                    Wieden, erected by the emperor Charles VI., between 1715 and 1737. It is a large
                    massy structure, surmounted by an oval dome cased in glittering copper, and
                    having in front a porticoof six Corinthian columns. Before the church are placed
                    two Doric columns, each of thirteen feet diameter, and having their shafts
                    adorned with a spiral band of bas relief; those of the one representing the life
                    and death, and those of the other the actions of the saint. The church of the
                    Capuchins is only remarkable for containing the sepulchral vault of the imperial
                    family, where the remains of its members have been deposited, since the emperor
                    Matthias, in 1619. The coffins are of bronze, oblong in form, and very large.
                    But the hearts of the deceased are deposited in one of the chapels of the
                    Augustinians, and their other viscera in St Stephen’s. We may also mention St
                    Peter’s church, a poor imitation of St Peter’s at Rome; the church of the
                    Augustinians, remarkable for its extent, and for the tomb of the archduchess
                    Christina, the work of Canova; and the church of St Rupert, remarkable for its
                    antiquity, having been originally built in A.D. 740, restored in 1436, and again
                    in 1703.</p>
                <p>Vienna is most liberally provided with scientific institutions and charitable
                    establishments. The university, founded in 1237, possesses an astronomical
                    observatory, an anatomical theatre, a laboratory, a good library of 100,000
                    volumes, a museum of natural history, a botanical garden, and forty-two
                    professors. It was established on its present footing, and the building which it
                    occupies was erected by the empress-queen Maria Theresa, in 1755. Besides the
                    university garden, the late emperor Francis II. established, at the Upper
                    Belvedere, another botanical garden, where may be found almost all the plants
                    indigenous to Germany. There is also a gymnasium, equally well appointed, and a
                    commercial academy, in which pupils are instructed, not only in the usual
                    routine of school learning, but also in the science and the history of commerce,
                    the knowledge of merchandise, and mercantile law, the productions and advantages
                    of all the commercial states in the known world, and those objects of natural
                    history that furnish materials for commerce, manufactures, and philosophy;
                    chemistry asap-plied to the useful arts; correspondence on all kinds of
                    business; drawing, mechanics, mathematics, &amp;c. For all these branches the
                    pupils pay only three florins (six shillings and twopence) a-month; and for a
                    small additional sum they are taught the Latin, English, French, and Italian
                    languages. The oriental academy is unique of its kind. Here young men are
                    instructed in the oriental languages, and also in the political relations of
                    Austria with the Eastern nations. When their studies are finished, they are
                    employed as secretaries to ambassadors, consuls, or other agents of the
                    government in the East. This excellent institution was founded by the emperor
                    Joseph II., and has produced some of the most distinguished men in the recent
                    history of Austria. The Theresian academy was founded by the empress-queen Maria
                    Theresa, for the education of the sons of the nobility; but her philosophic son,
                    Joseph II, thinking they would be better fitted to perform the duties of good
                    citizens, if educated in a school of more mixed character, suppressed it, and
                    distributed the revenues in pensions to meritorious civil and military officers.
                    His nephew, however, the late emperor Francis II, re-established it on the
                    original plan. It is under the superintendence of a director, and has twenty-one
                    professors, ten masters of modern languages, and several tutors. The
                    medicochirurgical academy, founded by Joseph II, is one of the finest buildings
                    in Vienna. It has accommodation for 1200 patients; the science is taught by six
                    professors; and the collection of anatomical figures in wax, by Fontanor, is
                    little inferior to that of Florence. The general hospital for the sick, also
                    founded by the same emperor, contains 111 rooms, with 2000 beds, and is computed
                    to receive annually about 10,000 patients. Adjoining to this is the
                    lying-in-hospital, another monument of Joseph’s benevolence. There is likewise a
                    foundling hospital, and many other charitable institutions, which reflect the
                    highest honour on the founders, and on the liberality of the government which
                    supports them. Besides the scientific establishments already mentioned, there
                    are also at Vienna an academy of military engineers established in 1717, in
                    which seventy-nine pupils are gratuitously educated; a veterinary school; and
                    the imperial polytechnic school, designed for the instruction of tradesmen in
                    their various arts and professions. The general state of science is however
                    represented as far from flourishing. The number of scientific men is small; and,
                    with the exception of a small medical society, there is no institution, by means
                    of which they can keep up an intercourse with each other. Medicine and the
                    various branches of natural history are the sciences most cultivated. The
                    botanical gardens are good; and the imperial museum of natural history, which
                    occupies several large rooms in the palace, is particularly important. Of all
                    accomplishments, however, a proficiency in music holds the highest place in the
                    estimation of the Viennese; and, in the practice of this art, they are certainly
                    as much above the other nations of Europe (except the Italians), as they are
                    below them in more solid and useful pursuits.</p>
                <p>Besides the Bastey and the Glacis, already mentioned, Vienna possesses several
                    other public walks and gardens of great value and importance to the health and
                    recreation of the citizens. The most celebrated of these is the Prater, said to
                    be the finest public park in Europe. It is situate on the north-east of the
                    city, in a large island, formed by two branches of the Danube. From the
                    entrance, the principal drive extends about half a mile in length, divided by
                    rows of trees into five alleys, of which the two outer are appropriated to
                    pedestrians, the next two to equestrians, and the inner one to carriages. Beyond
                    its termination, is the more rural part of the Prater. There the wood becomes
                    thicker, the alleys are no longer straight and forma), but wind irregularly till
                    they are stopped by the banks of the Danube itself. On each side of the drive
                    stretches a verdant lawn, plentifully studded with coffeehouses, and therefore
                    much frequented by the listless pedestrians, who seat themselves under shady
                    awnings, or on the grass beneath clumps of trees, enjoying in idle gaiety their
                    ices, coffee, and cigars. The Prater is frequented daily by the rich <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=685"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0685-0645"/> and the great, on horseback or in carriages. On
                    Sundays and other festivals the shopkeepers and mechanics likewise resort to it
                    in flocks, to amuse themselves and their children with ninepins, conjurors,
                    see-saws, and roundabouts, and to dine under the trees and the pavilions. Three
                    or four times a-year fireworks are displayed in the Prater, each exhibition of
                    which lasts forty minutes, and represents tern - ples, grottoes, parterres of
                    flowers, fortresses, &amp;c. To the westward of the Prater, communicating with
                    it by two alleys, and on the same island, is the Augarten, a large enclosure,
                    intersected by regular walks, and containing two large eating-rooms, where
                    parties are supplied with dinner, a billiard-room, a dancing-room, and a
                    coffee-room. On the first of May this garden is crowded to excess. The
                    Brigitenau is a large meadow to the west of the Augarten, divided from it by the
                    wall of the suburb, and still on the same island. It contains a church and two
                    public houses, and has its share of company in fine weather. On the first Sunday
                    and Monday after St Bridget’s day, a fête is held here; and the number of
                    persons who then come to dance and amuse themselves usually amounts to about
                    thirty thousand. The island which contains these parks and gardens, is connected
                    with the city and the southern suburbs by six bridges. The Volksgarten is a
                    large enclosure, between the Kaiserburg and the south wall of the city; it is in
                    fact the palace garden, but the people are freely admitted, and it forms a
                    favourite promenade. It contains a semicircular building where coffee and other
                    refreshments may be procured; and also a Doric temple, built on the model of
                    that of Theseus at Athens, to contain a group by Canova, of Theseus killing the
                    Minotaur. For in-door amusement, there are several theatres. Two of these are in
                    the city, namely the Burg, or Palace theatre, and the Kaernth-nerthor
                    (Carinthian gate) theatre. There are others in the suburbs, and one of them,
                    near the Wien, is capacious and handsome. The imperial theatre, where operas are
                    performed, is not remarkable for its architecture or its stage decorations; but
                    its instrumental and vocal performances may, generally speaking, be called the
                    best in Europe.</p>
                <p>The police in Vienna has long been celebrated as one of the most perfect in the
                    world. But its functions are not confined to the ordinary duties of repressing
                    crime, and watching over the public health and convenience; it also takes care
                    that no one presume to discuss too freely affairs of state, or canvass the
                    measures of the government in a spirit opposed to its wishes. Foreigners, and
                    especially those who come from countries where liberal opinions are prevalent,
                    are therefore kept under a vigilant inspection, and any offensive conduct on
                    their part is instantly followed by an order to quit the city. As a necessary
                    appendage to this system, spies are employed, whose official duties are not
                    confined to coffeehouses, and other places of public resort, but extend even to
                    the privacy of domestic life. For the more legitimate, or at least more laudable
                    purposes of police, the city and suburbs are divided into eight districts, to
                    each of which is appointed a physician, a surgeon, an apothecary, and an
                    accoucheur, all paid by government. It is their duty to attend the necessitous
                    sick at their own houses, and to administer advice and medicine gratis. These
                    functionaries are the guardians of the public health, and make a daily report to
                    the police of the births and deaths; and, to guard against secret crimes, the
                    proprietors of houses are obliged to announce to them the deaths of any of their
                    inmates, nor can any person be interred without producing their certificate. In
                    short, their surveillance, in conjunction with that of the police, is extended
                    to the minutest circumstances that can affect the public health. In what may be
                    called compulsory clcanliness, Vienna might serve as a model to every other
                    city. No dirt of any kind is permitted to be thrown into the streets; no
                    accumulated mass of decayed vegetables is ever to be seen in the mar kets; no
                    slaughter-houses are to be seen throughout the city. Putrefying provisions are
                    never allowed to be sold; no adulterated bread, for that is not only weighed,
                    but chemically analyzed, if suspected to contain improper ingredients; and woe
                    to the offender, for the fine is generally ruinous. The police also regulate the
                    markets and the price of provisions.</p>
                <p>Yet notwithstanding all this care, Vienna is decidedly unhealthy, and the climate
                    is generally fatal to delicate constitutions. Colds, catarrhs, and pulmonary
                    complaints are frequent and most malignant. This insalubrity arises from its
                    peculiar situation; for it is exposed to the frequent prevalence of easterly
                    winds, which, blowing over the cold plains of Russia, Poland, and Hungary, the
                    icy tops of the Carpathians, and the waters and marshes of the Danube, increase
                    continually in coldness and dampness till they reach Vienna. To the north wind
                    the city is also equally exposed, while, from the softer influences of the south
                    and the west. It is excluded by a neighbouring chain of mountains, behind which
                    rise the everlasting snows of the Tyrolian and the Carnic Alps. Alternations
                    from heat to cold, and from cold to heat occur two or three times a-day, almost
                    throughout the year. The narrow streets preclude any benefit from the sun, even
                    when he shines; and in dry weather the clouds of dust are intolerable. The mean
                    temperature is from 7° to 9° below zero of Reaumur’s thermometer.</p>
                <p>Vienna is the most important manufacturing town in the empire, more than 60,000
                    persons finding employment in different branches of industry. The principal
                    manufactures consist of silk and other stuffs, gold lace, silver lace, ribbons,
                    hardware, and ironmongery goods, needles, philosophical instruments, carriages,
                    and paper. The carriages are prized in most parts of Germany. There are also
                    several porcelain works, one of which employs 150 painters, and about 1500 work
                    people. There are also made steel ornaments, jewels, watches, musical
                    instruments, and chemical productions. There is a cannon-foundry, and a
                    manufactory of arms, belonging to government. Vienna is indeed the centre of
                    Austrian commerce, and of the capital and circulation requisite to maintain it.
                    The produce of its industry gives rise to an exportation sufficient annually to
                    furnish cargoes for 6000 boats, and loads for nearly 2,000,000 of waggons. The
                    canal of Newstadt serves for a communication, not only with that town, but also
                    with the Danube, through the lower part of the Wien. Three annual fairs are held
                    in the town, and the number of mercantile houses amounts to about a thousand.
                    Besides the canal of Newstadt and the Danube, by which Vienna communicates with
                    Hungary and the upper parts of southern Germany, communications have recently
                    been, or are in the course of being, formed with other provinces, by means of
                    railways. The Ferdinand railway, 276 miles in length, commences in the Prater,
                    extends through Moravia and Silesia by Brunn, Olmutz, and Troppau, to the salt
                    mines of Bochnia, beyond Cracow, with various branches; one of which goes to
                    Presburg, and another from Brunn to Prague. Baron Lina’s railway extends from
                    Vienna to Newstadt, and onward to Raab, with branches to Modling, Lachenburg,
                    and Baden. It then goes to Oedenburg, and south of the Neusiedler See to Raab.
                    The Mittelbahn, or Central railway, extends from the Ferdinand railway at
                    Gausendorf to Presburgh, Romorn, Pesth, and Debreczin, crossing the Theiss by a
                    very long bridge. The total length of this railway is 326 miles. A line has also
                    been projected to connect Vienna with Trieste; but the difficulty of passing so
                    many large rivers and lofty mountains as intervene, is such as would involve a
                    most enormous outlay, even if the execution of the project were found to be
                    practicable.</p>
                <p>The population of the city and suburbs was found, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=686" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0686-0646"
                    />1830, to amount to 319,873 souls, without counting the garrison and strangers:
                    including them, the total might be 332,000.</p>
                <p>The roads immediately beyond the gates of the suburbs are worse than those around
                    any other capital in Europe; and, for several miles, the country is dreary and
                    devoid of interest. But the more distant environs are highly beautiful, and
                    offer numberless interesting excursions to the citizen and the traveller. On the
                    north are the islands of the Danube; on the west the lofty summit of the
                    Calenberg; on the south the mountains of Styria, covered with forests and
                    vineyards; and on the east, towards Hungary, extensive plains, along which the
                    eye ranges unobstructed to the distant horizon. A few miles east of the capital
                    is the imperial palace of Schoenbnmn (Pretty spring,) which was occupied by
                    Napoleon as his head-quarters in 1805 and 1809∙ It was built by Maria Theresa,
                    who used it as her favourite residence. The building is large and superbly
                    furnished; the gardens are well laid out and very beautiful; and the situation
                    is delightful. Lachsenburg or Laxenburg is another imperial palace, where the
                    emperor has two residences; the one an ordinary palace, with a theatre and other
                    appendages; the other a sort of model of an ancient baronial castle, with a
                    moat, portcullis, arched gateway, court, hall, chapel, chambers, dungeons,
                    walls, passages, galleries, communications, turrets, and every other proper
                    accompaniment of an ancient fortress. The interior is fitted up in a
                    corresponding style; and at a little distance there is a regular tilting ground,
                    where occasionally mock tournaments have been held for the emperor’s amusement.
                    We may also mention Maria Hitzing, near Schoenbrunn, which possesses a theatre
                    and baths, and has been considered the finest and most picturesque village in
                    Austria; Penzing, noted for its ribbon manufactures; Meidling, for its mineral
                    waters; and Baden, fifteen miles south-east of Vienna, a fine town, with 3000
                    inhabitants, and frequented annually by four or five thousand strangers, to
                    drink its mineral waters; and, near Baden, Weilburg, a magnificent palace
                    recently erected by the archduke Charles.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding all its disadvantages of climate and situation, few places
                    possess such ample resources, such general means of enjoyment, both intellectual
                    and physical, as this imperial city. Its magnificent imperial library, scarcely
                    inferior to any in Europe, and its admirable museums and public galleries, are
                    all open to the public, in a manner so perfect as to arrangement and
                    accommodation, as to render them practically and generally useful. The theatres
                    and the opera are all excellent. The streets are crowded with a lively, active,
                    bustling population. Nothing occurs to annoy or molest the passenger; and in no
                    capital of continental Europe does the stranger, whose passports are regular,
                    and conduct orderly, experience or perceive so little of the interference of the
                    police as at Vienna. No beggars are to be seen; no appearance of poverty meets
                    the eye; no one appears badly dressed. The Viennese are indeed a happy and
                    enjoying people; frugal, cheerful, and contented, they seek no alteration in
                    their condition; they know little of their government but its mild and paternal
                    influence; and they dread changes of any kind as fraught with evil. They see
                    their princes mixing among them with all the simplicity and kindness of private
                    citizens; and they love them with an affection which they believe to be
                    reciprocal. Their general tone of character forms them for tranquil enjoyment in
                    themselves, and promoting it mothers; and the lower classes, as well as the
                    higher, are generally found to be mild, kind, and obliging. They are, however,
                    said to be more addicted to sensual than to intellectual pleasures; and the
                    standard of morality is very low among all classes.</p>
                <p>Vienna is a place of considerable antiquity, and has been the scene of many
                    historical events. It was originally a small village, encircled by marshes and
                    forests, and peopled by fishermen; but here the Romans established <hi
                    rend="italic">castra stativa,</hi> or a standing intrenched camp, which
                    gradually became a town, with the name of <hi rend="italic">Vindobona;</hi> and
                    it was here that the emperor Marcus Aurelius died, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 180. On the decline of the Roman empire. It fell successively into
                    the hands of the Goths and Huns; and in 791 was, with the rest of Austria,
                    attached by Charlemagne to his dominions. The origin of the modern town is
                    commonly ascribed to Henry the First, duke of Austria, who is said to have
                    founded it in or about the year 1142. In 1241 it was taken by the emperor
                    Frederick II, and again, in 1297, by the emperor Rudolph, who bestowed it, with
                    the duchy of Austria, upon his son Albert, who became the founder of the
                    archducal, now the imperial family. It was vainly besieged by the Hungarians in
                    1477; but, eight years afterwards. It was obliged to surrender to Matthias, king
                    of Hungary and Bohemia. It was besieged by the Turks in 1529, and again in 1683;
                    and was relieved, on the latter occasion, only by the arrival of a Polish army,
                    under their king, Sobieski, who beat the Turks with great slaughter before the
                    city. In 1805. It surrendered to the emperor Napoleon; and again in 1809, after
                    a short resistance. Six miles east of the city is the island of Lobau, in the
                    Danube, where the French were encamped for six weeks, in 1809; and opposite it,
                    near the north bank of the river, are the villages of Aspern, Essling, and
                    Wagram, where were fought the desperate battles which decided the fate of the
                    Austrian monarchy at that time. <hi rend="smallcaps">(c.h.)</hi></p>
