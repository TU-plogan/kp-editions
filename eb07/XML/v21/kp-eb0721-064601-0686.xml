                <p><label type="entry">VIENNE</label>, a department of the south-west division of
                    France, formed out of the ancient province of Upper Poitou. It extends in north
                    latitude from 46° 8', to 49° 9', and in longitude from 0° <hi rend="italic"
                    >7'</hi> east, to 0° 58' west. It is bounded on the north by the departments of
                    Mayence and Indre-Loire, on the east by the Indre and Loire, on the south by
                    Upper Vienne and Charente, and on the west by the two Sèvres. The extent is 2640
                    square miles. It is divided into five arrondissements, thirty-one cantons, and
                    three hundred communes. It sends two deputies to the legislative chamber, and
                    contained in 1836, 288,002 inhabitants. They all adhere to the Catholic church,
                    except about 14,000 Calvinists, settled in and around Rouille. The people adhere
                    rigidly to their ancient manners and practices, and are reported to be enemies
                    to all improvement, and to be careless, idle, and ignorant. They are chiefly
                    agriculturists, and live, as their ancestors lived, in a state of great filth
                    and destitution, on the half produce of the land; the other half being delivered
                    to the landlords, who pay out of it the territorial imposts.</p>
                <p>The surface of the department is an elevated plain, uninterrupted by any
                    remarkable hills or valleys. In some parts it is sandy, in others clayey, but in
                    all of tolerable fecundity, with the exception of about one-fourth, which is
                    uncultivated heath land, but which might be made productive if capital could be
                    found, and the ancient prejudices and customs were exchanged for the more modern
                    usages. Most of these neglected wastes are situated in the eastern division of
                    the department, on the arrondissements of Chatelherault and Montmorillon. The
                    principal river, the Vienne, passes through the department, from north to south,
                    about fifty-six miles, and is the only one that is navigable, and that only for
                    a short distance, and with vessels of a small burden. It receives in its course
                    the water of numerous small rivers. The climate is in general mild and
                    temperate, but the north-west winds often bring early and sudden frosts, which
                    occasionally do great injury both to the corn land and the vineyards.</p>
                <p>The product of corn is insufficient for the consumption, and potatoes, but
                    especially chesnuts, are used as substitutes for grain. The quantity of wine
                    produced is considerable, and some of it has the property of being improved by
                    keep <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=687"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0687-0647"/>ing for many years. Much of it is made into
                    brandy. In some years, 250,000 hogsheads of wine have been made. The forests
                    have been neglected, and now yield an insufficient supply of fuel, especially as
                    there is some demand for it from the few iron works in the department. The
                    cattle are stated to be only 50,000 oxen, and 175,000 sheep; but there are
                    numerous swine in proportion to the other animals, amounting to about 45,000.
                    These are mostly sent for the supply of Nantz, Rochelle, and Rochefort.
                    Sufficient hemp and flax are grown to provide employment in spinning, and linen
                    cloth for common use. The only manufactures besides iron already noticed, are
                    some paper, earthenware, leather, and coarse woollen goods, but barely
                    sufficient for the internal demand. From the water communication being slight,
                    and the roads in bad condition, there is little commerce, and that consists of
                    the export of mules, swine, walnuts, chesnuts, wine, brandy, and, in years of
                    extraordinary productiveness, a little corn.</p>
