                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">VIDA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marco GeroNIMO</hi></label>, a
                    very elegant Latin poet, was a native of Cremona, but the time of his birth is
                    uncertain. Different writers have placed it in 1470, 1480, and 1490. His parents
                    were noble, but not wealthy. He prosecuted his studies at Padua and Bologna, and
                    at an early age was admitted into the congregation of the canons regular of St
                    Mark at Mantua. Here however he did not long remain, but removed to Rome, where
                    he became a canon of St John of the Lateran. His poetical talents recommended
                    him to the favour of Leo the Tenth, who bestowed upon him the priorship of St
                    Sylvester near Tivoli. Vida published a collection of his poems at Rome in the
                    year 1527. This collection, a quarto of 110 leaves, contains De Arte Poetica
                    libri iii., De Bombyce libri ii., De Ludo Scacchorum, Hymni, Bucolica. Leo
                    recommended to him the subject of a sacred poem, which was not completed till
                    after the death of that pontiff. Under the title of “Christiados libri sex,” it
                    was published at Cremona in 1535. In 1532 Clement the Seventh had promoted him
                    to the bishopric of Alba. Another pope, Paul the Third, destined him for the
                    bishopric of Cremona, but died before he could fulfil his intentions. Vida
                    composed several other works in verse, and some in prose. When his episcopal
                    city was attacked by the French and the imperialists in 1542, he displayed his
                    courage by urging the garrison to make a strenuous defence, and he afterwards
                    contributed to the recovery of this conquest out of their hands. He accompanied
                    the papal legates to the council of Trent; and upon that occasion composed a
                    prose work, entitled “Dialogi de Reipublicae Dignitate,” and printed at Cremona
                    in 1556. He died at Alba on the 27th of September 1566, and his remains were
                    interred in the cathedral. Vida possessed a very elegant taste, and was a great
                    master of Latin versification. The art of poetry, the operations of the silk
                    worm, and even the game of chess, he has discussed with singular grace and
                    harmony. The encomium of Pope rendered his name familiar to English ears:</p>
                <p>Immortal Vida, on whose honoured brow</p>
                <p>The poet’s bays and critic’s ivy grow.</p>
                <p>Of his poems there are several collective editions. A collection, exclusive of
                    his sacred poems, was published by Thomas Tristram, A.M. Oxon., 1722-3, 2 part.
                    8vo. But the best edition, containing all the poems which he acknowledged as
                    his, together with the Dialogi, appeared soon afterwards, “curantibus J. Ant. et
                    Cajetano Vulpiis. Patav. 1731, 2 tom. 4to. Some of Vida’s poems have been
                    translated into various languages. Of the Poetics an English translation was
                    published by Pitt in 1725, and another by Hampson in 1793. Of the poem on Chess
                    an English version is said to have been published by Erskine in 1736. A
                    translation of another work, accompanying the original, appeared under the title
                    of “The Christiad, a Poem in six books: translated from the Latin of Marcus
                    Hieronimus Vida, by J. Cranwell, M.A., Rector of Abbots Ripton in
                    Huntingdonshire." Cambridge, 1768, 8vo.</p>
