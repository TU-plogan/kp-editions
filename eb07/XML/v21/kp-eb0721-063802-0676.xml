                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">VIADUCT</label>. The contract for a brick viaduct should
                    clearly define the site and extent of the whole of the sections; the gross
                    amount to be paid, as well as the detail prices at which any additions or extra
                    works are to be paid; an enumeration of the plans, sections, and drawings, which
                    should be signed by the engineer and contractor; and, attached to the contract,
                    the mode in which the work is to be paid for, the time for its completion, and
                    the time the contractor is to uphold the work, together with the penalty for
                    non-completion. It should state in a precise manner any diversions of roads or
                    streams, the nature of the foundations, and whether the contractor is to find
                    cofferdams, centerings, scaffolding, and all other machinery and materials. With
                    respect to the time for completion. It will be best to divide it. If, for
                    example. It is a viaduct of ten to twelve arches of fifty feet span, and forty
                    feet high, in twelve months at the farthest the brick work and masonry of the
                    abutments, piers, and wing walls, should be up to the springing of the arches.
                    The remainder of the work may be divided into two portions of six months each,
                    so that the whole should be complete in two years. We are well aware that such a
                    work could be executed in much less time, but it would be at a corresponding
                    increase of expense.</p>
                <p>The contractor should be bound to execute the work to the satisfaction of the
                    engineer, or whoever may be appointed by the parties for whom the viaduct is to
                    be erected, and at all times to keep a sufficient number of men on the work, or
                    the engineer should have power to send the requisite number. This will of course
                    be dome at the contractor’s expense; and it should be expressly stated, that all
                    materials, scaffolding, and machinery, on the spot, will be used by the
                    engineer, and that he will provide any other materials which may be requisite,
                    in order fully to employ his men. The number of competent foremen to be employed
                    by the contractor should be stated; and the engineer should have power to
                    supersede any of them for incapability or improper conduct, and in default of
                    there being a sufficient number, to employ as many more as should be found
                    requisite, up to the specified number. An account of the foremen and workmen
                    employed, should be furnished to the engineer weekly, each trade being classed
                    under a separate head, under a penalty of five pounds per week.</p>
                <p>The contractor should be bound to enclose the whole area before commencing the
                    work, and to comply with all local regulations and the act of parliament, if
                    there is one, under which the work is to be done, so as to prevent all trespass
                    on the adjoining lands, and to maintain the said fence till the works shall be
                    completed; but if any of the adjoining land would be of use to the contractor.
                    It should of course be procured for him, by his undertaking to pay the expenses.
                    He should be bound to deposit any spoil earth taken out for the foundations,
                    wherever the engineer may appoint. Any temporary roads which he may require,
                    should be set out and made entirely at his own expense, he compensating the
                    owners of the land. Before he commences any excavation or work for any of the
                    abutments, piers, or wing-walls, or commences any arch, proper notice should be
                    given to the engineer, under a penalty of not less than twenty pounds.</p>
                <p>Should the parties for whom the viaduct is to be built, be called upon to pay any
                    damages to the owners of the adjoining property, or to any other person, through
                    the negligence or wilfulness of the contractor’s workmen, they should reserve
                    the power of deducting the money so paid from any sums which may be due to the
                    contractor for the performance of the work. No subcontract, except for labour,
                    should be allowed, without the the engineer’s consent in writing. Should the
                    contractor become bankrupt, or should he, from any other cause, cease to
                    continue the works, the engineer should have power, after serving him with a
                    written notice, to carry on the work himself, placing the amount of all monies
                    expended by him, in constructing the work, to the contractor’s account, and
                    using all the materials and machinery on the ground, which should become the
                    property of the parties for whom the viaduct is built, from the time they are
                    brought upon their ground, till the completion of the works, and should not be
                    removed without their consent. When materials are brought on the ground of an
                    improper sort, or unsound, or of an inferior quality in the opinion of the
                    engineer, the contractor should be bound to remove them forthwith, and to supply
                    their place by others, in default of which the engineer should have power to
                    remove them after two days’ notice, without being amenable for either loss or
                    damage in so doing. The expense of the removal, of course, should in all cases
                    fall on the contractor.</p>
                <p>Should the engineer discover that any part of the work is unsound, or imperfectly
                    executed, or not performed in strict accordance with the conditions of the
                    specification, plans, sections, or drawings, he should have power to order it to
                    be immediately taken down and executed in a proper manner, without any extra
                    charge whatever, and without any delay ensuing in the completion of the several
                    parts of the work; and if the contractor should refuse or neglect to do so after
                    proper notice, the engineer should have power to cause it to be done, charging
                    the expenses to the contractor, and removing the materials, and then proceeding
                    to erect the work in a proper manner.</p>
                <p>The contractor should be bound to make any alterations, additions, or omissions
                    in the work, on being authorized to do so by the engineer; the omissions being
                    set off quantity for quantity against the additions, or by measurement and
                    valuation, as may be agreed on, and the balance accounted for to either party.
                    There should be no alterations whatever allowed, except under the signature of
                    the engineer. The contractor should be furnished with copies of the drawings and
                    specification, but he should be bound to see they are correct, and should also
                    be required himself to set out the whole of the work. Should there be any
                    buildings, trees, or other matters on the site of the works, the property in
                    them should be secured to the parties for whom the viaduct is to be built; the
                    contractor removing them to the nearest public road, giving a week’s notice
                    previously to his doing so, and stating the place to which they will be removed.
                    All damage done to the works during their progress, or to the materials or
                    implements thereon, whether arising from accident or the carelessness of the
                    workmen, should be made good at the contractor’s expense; and he should be
                    bound, not only to execute such works as are expressly described respectively in
                    either the specification, plans, sections, and drawings, but also such other
                    works as may be necessarily implied, or reasonably inferred to be done; and in
                    case of any dispute arising, the decision of the chief engineer should be
                    considered final.</p>
                <p>The mode and times of payment for the work, and the nature and extent of any sums
                    which may be retained from the periodical payments, as a security for the due
                    performance of the contract, should be clearly defined, and also the time when
                    the retained money will be paid, which in all cases should be dependent on the
                    engineer being perfectly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=679" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0679-0639"
                    />satisfied with the state of the works. It is usual to make the contractors of
                    these works an allowance, when they have a large quantity of materials on the
                    ground, as part payment; for instance, when two million or more bricks are on
                    the spot, fifty per cent. on their value is usually advanced; and, generally
                    speaking, if it is seen that the contractor is proceeding with his work in a
                    spirited manner, he should be encouraged by every reasonable assistance in the
                    power of the parties by whom he is employed.</p>
                <p>The schedule of prices for extra and additional works should include every thing
                    which is at all likely to be required; such as fencing, excavations, brickwork,
                    concrete, stonework, specifying the nature and quality of the stone, and the
                    description of the work; such as string courses, coping, ashlar work, imposts,
                    cornices, caps to pilasters, quoins, &amp;c.; the price of wrought and cast-iron
                    work, of culverts, drains, and ditching, specifying the size in each case; of
                    timber, stating the size and description; pruning and levelling at the ends of
                    the viaduct; piling for foundations; the formation of roads; laying railways,
                    distinguishing the price with blocks from those with sleepers; and all other
                    things which it may be necessary to order in the course of the work.</p>
                <p>It is usual to take security from the contractors for these works. Many an
                    excellent contractor may not be able to find substantial sureties. In this case,
                    his character from his last work will form the best criterion. It is always
                    advantageous to get a zealous, active, and substantial contractor, even at a
                    higher price, for all large works.</p>
                <p>The specification should state in a clear manner the site of the viaduct. Its
                    intended use, and what work is to be included in the contract, with, any other
                    information, so as to enable the contractor clearly to see his way. The level
                    should be stated, the span, height, and form of the arches, whether any are
                    askew, and if so, the angle of their inclination; the radius of the curve, if
                    there is any; the nature and quality of the principal material; and if this
                    should be brick, then whether there are to be stone arch quoins, springing
                    courses, string course, plinth, or coping; also, what pilasters, &amp;c. are
                    intended; what is to be the form of the piers, whether they project from the
                    face line of the arch; what description of wing walls, and whether they are to
                    be built plumb, or battened, or curved, and what arched openings they may have,
                    and if so, whether there are to be inverts to them, and also any other internal
                    openings which may be intended; for instance, in railway viaducts, walls will be
                    required in the abutments for the support of each line of rails; but these may
                    be built considerably cheaper, by lightening them with arched openings, having
                    inverts underneath. In this case, the wing walls might be built plumb, and
                    extended just far enough for the required slope of the embankment at each end.
                    The space between the walls, for supporting the four lines of rails, should be
                    arched over with nine-inch brickwork for supporting the earth and ballasting of
                    the railway. The spandril walls should be perpendicular, and a wall should be
                    run, if the height requires it, under each rail, extending over the arches,
                    piers, and abutments; the spaces between these walls being arched over in a
                    similar manner to those described above.</p>
                <p>The form and dimensions of every part of the viaduct should be shown in the
                    drawing, which should contain an elevation, plan of foundations, plan of the
                    roadways or waterways, if any; sections through the square and askew arches and
                    piers, the abutments and parapet walls, showing the form of the string course,
                    plinth, and coping; and lastly, a longitudinal section throughout the whole
                    length of the viaduct. The nature of the ground should be carefully studied,
                    before the footings of the piers and abutments are decided on; and if at all
                    doubtful, concrete should be used; but in all cases, the footings should be
                    stipped outwards, and carried so low as to rest on an entirely good and solid
                    foundation. Should there be any waterways under any of the arches, the outer
                    course of materials of the piers on each side the water, should be laid in Roman
                    cement, high enough to ensure their safety in this respect. The piers of askew
                    arches may generally be lightened in the interior, and the mode of doing this
                    should be shown in the drawing.</p>
                <p>The spring course should if possible be of stone, not less than twenty inches
                    thick on the face, say for an arch of fifty feet span, and rising behind, so as
                    to form the proper skewback of the arch. These should be laid over the tops of
                    the piers and abutments, each stone not being less than three feet six inches in
                    the bed, each course consisting of not less than eight stones in the width of a
                    viaduct of about twenty-eight feet broad; and no stone should be less than three
                    feet six inches in length, dowelled and leaded to the adjoining one. If the
                    viaduct is brick, the upper surface of the stones, at the springing of any askew
                    arches, should be made in steps or notches, for receiving the brick-work of the
                    arch, each step taking five courses of bricks, and being cut at right angles to
                    the brickwork, rising behind at the proper summering for forming the skewback of
                    the arch. The five courses of bricks agreeing with each arch stone, should all
                    fit into a corresponding step in the springing course.</p>
                <p>The form of arches is so much a matter of taste, that no general rules can be
                    given without assuming some particular one. We shall therefore take a segment of
                    a circle, a very substantial viaduct in that form having been built by Robert
                    Stephenson, Esq. They were fifty feet span, thirty feet eight inches in length,
                    and three feet thick. The thickness of each arch quoin was equal to five courses
                    of bricks; and they were alternately three feet three inches, and two feet six
                    inches in length on the soffit from the face of the arch, and rising in steps to
                    receive the horizontal courses of the spandril walls.</p>
                <p>Great care should be taken in giving all the arch quoins a true and perfect bed
                    throughout each stone; and no pinning should be used in any part. The joints of
                    the arch stones should be neatly chamfered rustic, and the faces of them fair
                    tooled, and projecting about an inch from the brick work. The proper summering
                    should be given to the bricks in the arch; and any irregularity of form, arising
                    from imperfection in the laggings, workmanship, centering, or any other cause,
                    should be removed, and immediately-corrected by the contractor. The centres
                    should in no case be struck without one week’s notice to the engineer. After
                    they are removed, the whole of the brickwork in the soffit of the arches should
                    be carefully and neatly pointed. With respect to keeping the arches dry—a point
                    which it has been found extremely difficult to effect, and without which the
                    brick work soon becomes damaged—we believe that puddling, if carefully and
                    properly done, will always succeed. Drainage by pipes through the piers has been
                    tried, and failed. A mixture of coal tar and lime has been found to succeed, and
                    so has coal tar alone, boiled ten or twelve hours, so as to evaporate the water
                    and ammoniacal liquor. As, in cooling. It sets moderately hard. It must not be
                    laid on in wet weather, and the surface of the brickwork should be clean swept
                    previous to applying it. Leading the arches with about five pound lead is a sure
                    preventive; but the process is expensive. The asphaltic cement is also a certain
                    cure, but is dear compared with coal tar.</p>
                <p>The backing should be built up to the required height, with good brickwork, well
                    grouted. The wing walls of a railway viaduct should consist of six walls, built
                    plumb up to the level of the crown of the arches, and extending in the direction
                    of the railway towards the embankment at each end. They should be well bouded
                    into the abutments, and lightened by arched openings. The top of the exterior
                    walls should be brought to a proper level with the upper side of the arches, for
                    receiving the string course <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=680" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0680-0640"
                    />and parapet walls. The outer walls for the sized arches we have assumed should
                    be about three feet thick, and constructed with bricks laid in horizontal
                    courses, properly jointed with the arch quoins. The interior walls should be
                    eighteen inches thick.</p>
                <p>A string course should be laid along the whole length of each front of the
                    viaduct, projecting uniformly with the face line of the arches. No stone in this
                    string course should be less than three feet six inches in length, neatly tooled
                    on the exterior, with the joints made to fit close for the whole bed of the
                    stone. The parapet walls will have a bolder and handsomer appearance, if they
                    stand on a stone plinth, about eighteen inches high, and eight inches wide,
                    placed upon the string course; the remaining portion of the wall being
                    brickwork, fourteen inches thick; the courses being carefully laid parallel with
                    picked bricks; the exterior faces of the plinth being fair tooled, and the whole
                    of the walls throughout forming a uniform and regular line.</p>
                <p>The coping should be of stone, the form and dimensions for which should be shown
                    in the drawing; and no stone should be less than three feet in length, neatly
                    jointed, and the exterior faces fair tooled or chisel-dressed, each stone being
                    dowelled or leaded to the adjoining one. The spaces round the footings of the
                    abutments and wing walls should be firmly rammed up with clay, if it can be
                    procured, to the level of the ground, in courses of one foot in thickness, each
                    layer being properly beaten before a succeeding one is put on. It will sometimes
                    be convenient to make a new channel for water-courses, so as to bring them
                    through a given arch of the viaduct. In this case, the old channel should not in
                    any way be impeded, till the new channel is formed; after which, the excavation
                    which has been taken out to form the new channel, may be used in filling up the
                    old.</p>
                <p>Great care should be taken in the selection of materials for the construction of
                    these works. The bricks should be hard, sound, and well burnt; those used in the
                    face of the work being selected of a uniform size and colour. The quarries from
                    which the stone is to be brought, should be named, and care taken that the whole
                    is of a good and hard quality, free from flaws of every description. The mortar
                    should be made of lime to be named in the specification, and mixed in the
                    manner, and in the proportions between the lime and the sand, which is known to
                    be best for the particular kind of lime, and be thoroughly incorporated of the
                    proper consistence. The Roman cement should be recently made, and kept from
                    contact with the atmosphere, or any moisture. An equal quantity of good sand or
                    road dust should be mixed with it; and no more than what is required for
                    immediate use should be mixed, or any that has set be worked up again.</p>
                <p>The brickwork should be laid either in English or Flemish band, as may be
                    ordered; and in no case should any joint of mortar exceed a quarter of an inch
                    in thickness; no broken bricks should be allowed to be used, either internally
                    or externally, unless absolutely necessary as closers; nor should any difference
                    be made in the exterior and interior <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the work. The
                    whole of the brickwork should be grouted at every course, and the exterior
                    neatly pointed. All the stonework should be truly bedded, and the vertical
                    joints cut square back for the whole bed of the stone; no pinning of any kind
                    being allowed.</p>
                <p>After the piers have all been brought up to the level of the springing of the
                    arches, the contractor should fix the centering, and complete the brickwork and
                    masonry of the three arches, and their backing next adjoining to an abutment;
                    the wing walls and spandril walls being also carried up to the same height as
                    the backing. When these three arches have all been completed, and properly
                    backed, the centering may be removed from the arch nearest the abutment, and
                    fixed in the proper place for the completion of the fourth arch. As soon as the
                    fourth arch is completed, ' and backed as above, and not before, the centering
                    may be moved from the second arch from the abutment, and fixed in the proper
                    situation for completing the fifth arch; and so on with the rest, the centering
                    never being removed from the two last arches which have been turned, until a
                    third, or the one in advance of these two, has been finished. The centering used
                    should be subject to the approval of the engineer.</p>
                <p>The string course, plinth, parapet walls, and coping, should not be put on, until
                    the whole of the centres have been withdrawn; and in no case should the
                    centering be struck without orders from the engineer. If the foundations require
                    cofferdams, the contractor should be bound to find them at his own expense.
                    Great care should be taken that the viaduct is properly placed, so that, in the
                    case of a railway, the outside line of rails, when laid in their uniform and
                    proper position, shall be equidistant from, and parallel with the faces of the
                    parapet walls; and in case the line in that particular part where the viaduct
                    is, should be curved, this will require the most vigilant attention; also, that
                    before the string course is laid on, every part of the brickwork is properly
                    level, so that the eye, in running along the string course, shall not be able to
                    detect any deviation from the given line. We have known more than one case in
                    which a noble and handsome structure has been entirely defaced, to a
                    professional eye, through the inattention or the incapacity of overlookers who
                    have been entrusted with this important part of the work.</p>
                <p>After the expense of an embankment equals that of a viaduct, there will almost
                    always be a gain in building the latter, if an increased height is required;
                    because the addition to the piers and abutments for this extra height, will cost
                    much less than the additional earthwork at the base of the embankment. Let us
                    take a case in point. In 250 yards of railway, forty-five feet high, there are
                    required three bridges. A viaduct for this 250 yards, with fifty feet arches,
                    would cost L.17,000; each bridge would cost L.1400, and the remaining embankment
                    sloping 2:1, would cost L.6150, at ls. per yard; total, L.10,650. Hence the
                    viaduct is much the dearest method. If the height was seventy-five feet, the
                    bridges may be taken at L.2000 each, and the remaining embankment at L.15,250;
                    total, L.21,250, besides the extra land; while the viaduct, having only 216
                    cubic yards of brickwork, at L.1 for each yard additional height, after full
                    allowance for extending the wing walls, &amp;c., would only cost L.19,000. We
                    may conclude, therefore, that viaducts are cheapest only at very great heights.
                    Much of course depends on the length of lead, whether building stone can be got
                    from an adjacent cutting, &amp;c. The cost may however be lessened, by a
                    judicious use of wood and iron. Several wooden viaducts have lately been
                    constructed for railways; and in America they are largely used. A novel plan has
                    been adopted in that country by Mr Town. (See Stephenson’s Civil Engineering of
                    North America.)</p>
                <p>In the preceding articles in this work, the subject of arches has been so fully
                    discussed, that nothing remains except to give a guide to practical men, how to
                    construct the arch of equilibrium, and to shew the variation which it undergoes
                    under different dimensions. Supposing, then, the roadway on the viaduct to be
                    horizontal, (fig. 1, Plate CCCCC.) let KI = <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> AQ = A, CI
                    = <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> DK = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and KQ =: C, then <hi

                    />the whole formula is very easy. In the following table, if the number under
                    <hi rend="italic">xh</hi> is multiplied by any half space having the given
                    values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. It gives points
                    in the curve or values of <hi rend="italic">g;</hi> and if more points are
                    wanted, the column log. is the logarithm of the denominator in the formula;
                    hence the numerator only will require computing.</p>

                    of increasing the road to five feet, and retaining the same height of archway,
                    eighteen feet. Fig. 5 is with <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = 9, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>These arches of equilibrium are more adapted for brick than stone, owing to the
                    difficulty of making the arch-stones in the latter radiate properly. In elliptic
                    arches, however, this is not always done: they are made to radiate to one
                    centre, sometimes from ignorance, but oftener because, when properly done, each
                    arch-stone requires a mould for one side; in the curve of equilibrium it will
                    generally be best to assume a centre to the nearest regular figure; otherwise

                <p>The centre of gravity may be found near enough, by drawing equidistant lines
                    parallel to KH, (fig. l,) taking the centre of gravity of each part, and tracing
                    a curve through the points’ lines parallel to KQ, which treated similarly, will
                    give another curve, and when this] cuts, the first is the centre of gravity. The
                    area may be found by a corresponding process.</p>
