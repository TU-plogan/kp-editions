                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    lively and elegant, though not a very profound or accurate historian, was born
                    at the castle of Benetot in Normandy, on the 25th of November 1655. He was the
                    second son of a gentleman allied to several distinguished families, but
                    possessed of little or no fortune. He was educated in the College of the Jesuits
                    at Rouen; and having made choice of the ecclesiastical profession, he secretly
                    withdrew from this seminary, and, after an interval of ten months, his family
                    ascertained that he had betaken himself to the convent of the Capuchins, at
                    Argentan. He was not however to be diverted from his design; and having made his
                    profession, he assumed the name of Brother Zachary. But the austerities of this
                    order were so prejudicial to his health, that he was induced to exchange it for
                    one of milder rules. Having obtained a brief from the pope, he entered the abbey
                    of the Praemon-stratenses at Valsery in 1677. He became secretary to Colbert,
                    general of the order, who nominated him prior of Joyerwal. The canon law
                    prohibits a person who has quitted one order, from obtaining any office or
                    benefice in another; and although he had procured a dispensation in due form, he
                    yet encountered so much opposition, that he was induced to exchange his priory
                    for a cure, depending on the order, at Croissy-la-Garenne, near Marly. Here, at
                    the age of thirty-four, he produced his earliest work, “Histoire des Révolutions
                    de Portugal.” Paris, 1689, 12mo. He afterwards obtained another cure in his
                    native district of Caux; and this he exchanged for a third, in the immediate
                    vicinity of Rouen. His last benefice was amply endowed, and rendered him very
                    easy in his circumstances. He continued his historical labours with new ardour,
                    and produced various other works. His next work bears the title of “Histoire des
                    Révolutions de Suede.” 1696, 2 tom. 12mo. In 1710, he published his “Traité de
                    la Mouvance de Bretagne.” A more elaborate work is his “Histoire des Révolutions
                    arrivés dans le Gouvernment de la République Romaine.” 1719, 3 tom. 12mo. The
                    grand-master of Malta had appointed him historiographer of the order, with the
                    privilege of wearing its cross. In order to evince himself worthy of the honour
                    which had thus been conferred upon him, he produced a copious work, entitled
                    “Histoire des Chevaliers Hospitaliers de S. Jean de Jerusalem, appeliéz, depuis
                    les Chevaliers de Rhodes, et anjourd’hui les Chevaliers de Malte.” 1726, 4 tom.
                    4to. Other honours had likewise been bestowed upon him. He became an associate
                    of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres. He was appointed
                    “Secrétaire-interprète,” and afterwards “Secrétaire des commandements,” to the
                    duchess of Orleans. He had apartments in the royal palace, and received a
                    considerable salary. But these honours and emoluments could not secure the
                    enjoyment of good health, and the latter years of his life were passed in much
                    bodily infirmity. He died on the 15th of June 1735, in the eightieth year of his
                    age. Some of his dissertations are to be found among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi> of the Academy. A posthumous publication of Vertot appeared under
                    the title of “Origine de la Grandeur de la Cour de Rome; et de la Nomination aux
                    Evechés et aux Abbaies.” Lausanne, 1745, 12mo. On the constitution of the Roman
                    senate, he bad been consulted by Lord Stanhope; and in 1758 his answer was
                    published by Hooke, who added his own observations.</p>
