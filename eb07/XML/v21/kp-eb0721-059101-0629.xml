                <p><label type="entry">VENEZUELA</label>, one of the provinces which composed the
                    republic of Colombia, but which has recently been erected into an independent
                    republic, is situated between 2° and 12° north lat. and 60° and 73° west long.
                    It is bounded on the north by the Caribbean sea, on the east by British Guiana,
                    on the west by New Granada, and on the south by Brazil. This country was named
                    Venezuela by the Spaniards, from the towns of the Indians, built on the small
                    islands in the lake Maracaibo, having a resemblance to Venice.</p>
                <p>The mountains of Venezuela, which form a part of the great branch extending from
                    the west to the gulph of Paria, divide the lands of the coast from the plains of
                    the valley of the Orinoco. It is on these rivers that there is such a diversity
                    of climate, that a traveller may observe the fruits of the tropics luxuriating
                    at a short distance from those of Europe. The surface of the ground is rent in
                    every direction by the force of subterraneous convulsions. To the south of this
                    chain, the llanos, or plains, which stretch to the Orinoco, are inhabited solely
                    by herds of cattle tended by mulattoes. The climate of Venezuela is modified
                    according to the situation of its districts. On the coast and in the plains a
                    scorching heat prevails, accompanied in the latter with deluges of rain. In the
                    mountain valleys the air is in general pure and mild, and in some of the more
                    elevated parts even cold.</p>
                <p>The soil of Venezuela is fertile, and yields in abundance all the products of the
                    West Indies, besides many which those islands do not possess. Its chief
                    commercial article is cocoa, which is inferior to none in the Americas. The
                    other objects of cultivation are vanilla, maize, indigo, cotton, sugar, tobacco,
                    and coffee. Here also wild cochineal, dyewoods, medicinal drugs, gums, and
                    resins, find that climate which is most favourable to their growth. The immense
                    plains in the interior feed multitudes of cattle, horses, and mules; and in the
                    valleys and mountains sheep and deer are numerous. All kinds of game are found
                    in this country; and the rivers abound with fish.</p>
                <p>The forests produce every species of timber fit for the purposes of the joiner or
                    the shipwright. Cedar is used for their door-posts, window-frames, tables,
                    &amp;c.; black, red, and yellow ebony are common; mahogany, brasiletto, and all
                    sorts of ornamental woods, are to be found in the greatest abundance and of the
                    finest quality. The immense forests which overspread the chain of mountains
                    remain unexplored.</p>
                <p>For about a century after this country was subdued by the Spaniards, their
                    attention was almost wholly directed towards its mineral productions, and the
                    pearl fishery on its coasts. But being disappointed in their expectations of
                    immense riches from these sources, they at last began to cultivate the soil.
                    They first planted cocoa trees; and so large were the profits from this source,
                    that cocoa alone occupied their fields till a very late period. About the year
                    1774, indigo began to be cultivated; and immense plains, hitherto desert, were
                    soon covered with this plant, which was speedily followed by cotton, sugar,
                    tobacco, coffee, &amp;c. But notwithstanding the aptitude of the soil, and the
                    genial nature of the climate, agriculture still languishes in these fine
                    regions, partly from want of enterprise and industry, and partly from too great
                    a confidence in the prolific nature of the soil.</p>
                <p>On the plains of Venezuela the rainy season commences in April and continues till
                    November. The rains fall oftener in the morning than in the evening, and on an
                    average occupy three hours of each day. During this period, the plains nearest
                    the rivers are converted into lakes of immense extent.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Venezuela are more numerous than in any other part of Spanish
                    America. Every valley has its stream; and though many of them are not of
                    sufficient size to be navigable, yet all afford ample supplies of water to
                    irrigate the plantations on their banks. The principal of those which run from
                    the mountains of Caraccas and Coro into the Caribbean sea, are the Guiges,
                    Tocuyo, Aroa, Ya-racuy, and the Tuy. The Guiges falls into that sea sixteen
                    leagues west of the city of Coro. The Tocuyo discharges its waters twenty-five
                    leagues east of the Gauges, or Gaigues: its source is fifteen leagues south of
                    the town of Curora, at the distance of nearly one hundred miles from the ocean;
                    and it is navigable as far as the village of Banagua, at the distance of forty
                    leagues from its mouth, its banks furnishing abundance of timber of the largest
                    size, and fit for every kind of building. The Aroa rises in the mountains west
                    of the town of St. Felipe, and enters the ocean at Burburata bay. The Yaracuy
                    enters the Caribbean sea near the latter. The Tuy discharges itself into the sea
                    thirty leagues east of La Guayra; it rises in the mountains of St. Pedro, ten
                    leagues from the capital, and being joined by the Guayra, becomes navigable, and
                    serves to transport the produce of the cultivated plains or valleys of Aragoa,
                    Tacata, Cua, Sabana, Ocumare, Santa Lucia, and Santa Teresa, through which it
                    passes, and which particularly abound in cocoa of the best quality. The
                    following are the more important rivers which rise on the southern side of the
                    chain, and flow to the Orinoco: the Guarico which receives some of the branches
                    of the Apure, and then following a course parallel to that river, enters the
                    Orinoco by the Rio Mancapra, which flows through the plains of Calaboso; the
                    Portuguesa. which is formed by the union of the two rivers Pao and Barquisimeto,
                    flows through the greater part of Venezuela, and joins the Apure forty miles
                    north-west of its mouth. For an account of the Orinoco, see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Besides Caraccas, the capital of Venezuela, (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Caraccas),</hi> the principal towns are La Guayra, the port of Caraccas, one of
                    the hottest places in the world; Caro, the principal town of the province of
                    that name, with a population of about 10,000; Porto Cavello, thirty leagues
                    north-east of Caraccas, with a population of 9000; Guanara, ninety-three leagues
                    south-west of Caraccas, with a population of above 12,000; Barquisimeto, 120
                    miles west-south-west of Caraccas, with a population of more than 11,000;
                    Tocuyo, twenty leagues north of Truxillo, with above 10,000 inhabitants; San

                <p>In the year 1831, by one of those revolutions which have followed each other in
                    too rapid succession in Spanish America, the extensive country, then called
                    Colombia, was dissevered into three independent republics under the names of
                    Venezuela, New Granada, and Equator. The last of these has already been
                    described under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Quito;</hi> it only remains
                    that we shortly notice the republic of New Granada. It extends from the equator
                    to 12° north lat., and from 68° to 83° west long.; having Venezuela on the east,
                    Brazil and Equator on the south, the Pacific ocean on the west, and the
                    Caribbean sea on the north.</p>
                <p>The cordillera of the Andes crosses the country from north to south, and
                    insensibly decreases in elevation towards the province of Panama. Between 2° 30'
                    and 5° 15' of north lat., the main chain separates into three parallel ridges.
                    The eastern, some of whose summits are covered with snow, divides the great
                    river Magdalena from the plains of the Meta. The central ridge separates the
                    Magdalena from the Rio Cauca: this is the most lofty of the three, and rises
                    into the region of eternal snow. The western ridge separates the Rio Cauca from
                    the province of Choco: it scarcely attains an elevation of 4500 feet, and is
                    nearly lost in the province of Panama. For a more particular description, see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Andes.</hi></p>
                <p>The rivers are very numerous. The chief of these is the Rio Grande de la
                    Magdalena, a majestic navigable river, of which, however, little is known. It is
                    said to rise about thirty miles east of Popayan, near the sources of the Cauca,
                    in 8° south lat., and after a northerly course of immense length the two rivers
                    unite, after having flowed in nearly a parallel line on the opposite side of the
                    same chain of mountains. Its chief tributaries are the Suarez, the Gallinazo or
                    Sogamozo, the Rio Negro, and the Bogota or Funza. The Meta is a noble river,
                    which rises in the mountain ridge opposite to Bogota, and flowing eastward joins
                    the Orinoco thirty leagues below the cataracts of Atures. Its banks are
                    inhabited chiefly by Indians. The Apure is also a large river, which rises in
                    one of the ridges which diverge from the eastern branch of the Andes, and joins
                    the Orinoco twelve leagues below Santiago. The river Atrato flows into the gulph
                    of Darien, and by it much of the internal produce is exported. But the whole
                    country abounds with rivers and streams to an extent which it would be tedious
                    to enumerate. Every valley has its rivers, large or small, and, if not
                    navigable, at least sufficient to fertilise the ground.</p>
                <p>The principal cities have been already described. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bogota, Santa Marta, Carthagena</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pavama, Porto Bello,
                    Veragua, Ροpαyαν, Μομpοχ, Ilonda, Tunja,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pasto,</hi> which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1834.</p>
                <p>The vegetable productions of the country are nearly the same as those of
                    Venezuela. The soil is exceedingly fertile: the fruits are produced in great
                    luxuriance, and the trees attain an immense bulk.</p>
                <p>Its vast forests are infested by numerous tribes of wild animals. Among these the
                    jaguar or tiger, and the American leopard, are very destructive to the cattle.
                    Wild boars, foxes, armadilloes, squirrels, deer, rabbits, and monkeys are
                    abundant, and are eaten by the Indians and Negroes.</p>
                <p>The feathered tribes are numerous and beautiful. Among these the toncan with its
                    large bill, the gallinazo vulture, which clears the country of dead carcases,
                    and the macaw, with its beautiful plumage and disagreeable voice, are the most
                    singular.</p>
                <p>Providence has dealt out his gifts to this quarter with a lavish hand; but to
                    compensate for this preference over more sterile lands and less genial climates,
                    he has mingled with them evils of the most serious kind,—noxious animals,
                    oppressive heat, furious thunder storms and earthquakes. The insects and
                    reptiles are as numerous as the birds and beasts. Among the insects may be
                    mentioned the centipede, the scorpion, the spider, the pique or jigger of the
                    West Indies; among the reptiles, the rattlesnake, the dart, and the still more
                    venomous coral snake. While the feet of the pedestrian are insecure from the
                    attacks of these creatures, his face is exposed to the venom of the musquitoes.
                    The bed may be surrounded with gauze curtains to protect the sleeper, but it is
                    of no avail, for another and almost imperceptible enemy finds access through the
                    threads: these are called mantas blancas, from their resembling white cloaks
                    while flying in clouds in the air. In some places bats are so numerous that they
                    cover the street in an evening in clouds, and infest the houses.</p>
                <p>The hills and rivers are supposed to have formerly supplied considerable
                    quantities of gold. The gold washing of most consequence are those of the
                    Novita, Zitara, and the river Andegada, in the province of Choco. All the ground
                    between this river and the San Augustin is auriferous. 10,800 marks of gold is
                    the utmost annual produce of the washings of Choco. Here a piece of gold was
                    once found by a negro which weighed twenty-five pounds. Platina is also found in
                    this and the neighbouring province of Antioquia. This valuable metal is
                    discovered in grains in the alluvious grounds between the second and sixth
                    degrees of north latitude. the ravine of Oro, between the villages of Novita and
                    Tado, yields the greatest quantity.</p>
                <p>New Granada is divided into twenty provinces, and 110 cantons. The total
                    population, as taken in the first quarter of 1835, was 1,686,038.</p>
                <p>On the 31st of August 1835 there were three universities, nineteen colleges, and
                    seven public schools in the republic, attended by 2307 pupils; of Lancasterian
                    schools there were 125, attended by 6741 boys, and five attended by 220 girls;
                    of schools upon the old system, 419, attended by 11,557 boys, and 141 attended
                    by 1605 girls; thus proving that female education must be very much neglected,
                    for while 20,605 young men and boys are attending the schools and colleges, only
                    1825 girls are receiving instruction in the schools.</p>
