                <p><label type="entry">VAUCLUSE</label>, a department in the south-east division of
                    France. It has been formed out of the ancient province of Avignon, of the county
                    of Venassin, of the principality of Orange, and of a portion of Upper Provence.
                    It extends in north latitude from 43° 41' to 44° 26', and in east longitude from
                    4° 34' to 5° 38'. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Drome, on
                    the east by that of the Lower Alps, on the south by the mouths of the Rhone, on
                    the west by that of the Gard, and on a small part of the north-west by the
                    Ardeche. Its extent is 1357 square miles. It comprehends four arrondisements,
                    divided into twenty-two cantons, and those subdivided into 148 communes. In 1836
                    the population amounted to 246,071 persons, chiefly adhering to the Catholic
                    church; but there are about 4000 Protestants, who have their own consistory to
                    regulate their religious affairs. The inhabitants are of dark complexion, with
                    penetrating eyes, spirited countenances, and are gay and lively in their
                    appearance and manners. The face of the country in the whole of the eastern
                    division is mountainous, and in the west is an extensive plain, which may be
                    considered as a prolongation of the valley of the Rhone. the mountains in the
                    eastern part may be viewed as a part of the Alps, or of spurs projected from
                    that range. The highest point of these elevations is 6300 feet; but the main
                    chain of the mountains can be scarcely estimated <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=603" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0603-0565"
                    />higher than from 2400 to 3000 feet. These mountains are all calcareous, and
                    for the most part sterile; but the valleys between them have a soil, partly of
                    sand or of clay, covered with vegetable mould, which, when cultivated, is highly
                    productive. The best soil is in the vicinity of the river Durance and of the
                    Rhone, both of which streams deposit a rich muddy compost in their passage. The
                    district between Carpentras and Avignon is almost covered with a mixture of
                    pebbles.</p>
                <p>The chief river is the Rhone, which enters the department from the Gard, and in
                    it receives the waters of the Louzon, the Aigues, the Meyne, the Lorgues, and
                    the Durance. The Durance, which flows from the Lower Alps, receives the waters
                    of the Jabron and of the Cavallon before it joins the Rhone. The Rhone is the
                    only stream that is navigable; but there are many small artificial canals,
                    which, though chiefly designed for the purpose of irrigation, are made available
                    for the transport of heavy goods.</p>
                <p>The climate is mild and healthy, but subject to great changes. The trees in some
                    seasons begin to blossom in February, but are often checked by severe cold and
                    showers. The husbandry is in an imperfect state; green crops and even clover are
                    not known, though lucerne is cultivated in some parts. The chief grains are
                    wheat, barley, rye, buck wheat, and maize. The whole growth of these is annually
                    65,000 quarters, which is not sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.
                    The chief product for sale is wine. The olive trees yield some oil, which, with
                    dried fruits and saffron, forms the chief object with which are exchanged the
                    few foreign luxuries that are consumed. Silk worms are kept in some districts.
                    The spinning and weaving of silk is the chief occupation of the inhabitants; and
                    the weaving is said to employ 2600 looms. These goods form a part of the
                    exports, to which may be added madder, which is raised and prepared for the
                    dyers. Some springs of saline water furnish culinary salt. This department
                    returns two members to the representative chamber. The capital is the city of
                    Avignon, with a population, in 1836, amounting to 31,786.</p>
