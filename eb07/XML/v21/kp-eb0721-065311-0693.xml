                <p><label type="entry">VIRGIL</label>. Of the personal history of Publius Vir-gilius
                    Maro, the greatest of Latin poets, little is known with certainty. The principal
                    authority on which his biography rests, is a life usually attributed to Tiberius
                    Claudius Donatus, a grammarian who flourished in the fifth century of the
                    Christian era. Its authenticity, however, is very questionable; and, at all
                    events. It is so much disfigured by interpolations, that it is difficult to
                    extract from it such facts as may be implicitly relied on. To this suspicious
                    document we have to add a few scanty allusions by the poet’s contemporaries, and
                    the scattered remarks of ancient scholiasts and grammarians.</p>
                <p>By all accounts, the parentage of Virgil is represented as exceedingly humble.
                    Donatus informs us, that, according to some authorities, his father was
                    originally a potter, but according to others, and those the more numerous, the
                    hired servant of a travelling merchant, to whom he recommended himself by his
                    faithful services, and who gave him his daughter Maia in marriage. By his
                    father-in-law he was entrusted with the charge of a small farm in the vicinity
                    of Mantua, which he ultimately seems to have inherited, and which probably
                    constituted the poet’s patrimony. Whatever may have been the original condition
                    of his father, it is gratifying to find this testimony to his moral worth, and
                    to be assured that he was capable of appreciating, and possessed the means, as
                    well as the desire, of cultivating the rising genius of his illustrious
                    offspring. In this respect, Virgil was equally fortunate with Horace, whose
                    father, although possessed but of moderate fortune, placed him under the ablest
                    masters at Rome, along with the sons of knights and senators.</p>
                <p>Virgil was born at Andes, now called Pietola, a village about three miles distant
                    from Mantua, in the year of Rome <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=694" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0694-0654"
                    />684, <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>. 70, during the first consulship of Pompey
                    and Crassus. He was thus seven years older than Augustus, and five years older
                    than Horace. He commenced his studies at Cremona, where he remained till he
                    assumed the <hi rend="italic">toga virilis.</hi> This he did on entering his
                    sixteenth year, on the very day, according to some accounts, on which Lucretius
                    died; thus transmitting, without interruption, and with increasing splendour,
                    the intellectual inheritance of Roman genius.</p>
                <p>Virgil now proceeded to Milan, and from thence, after a short stay, to Naples.
                    Here he devoted himself to study with intense application, and laid the
                    foundation of that varied learning, for which he was no less remarkable than for
                    poetical genius. To the language and literature of Greece he applied himself
                    with peculiar ardour; and, in this department, enjoyed the instructions of
                    Parthenius Nicenus, an author of some reputation. But literature alone, however
                    varied and attractive, could not satisfy the inquisitive and capacious mind of
                    Virgil. He strove also to penetrate the depths of philosophy and science; and
                    medicine and mathematics continued to be favourite subjects of pursuit with him
                    through life. Along with his friend Varius, he studied the system of Epicurus,
                    under Syro, a distinguished teacher of that sect, and the intimate friend of
                    Cicero. Traces of this early discipline are perceptible in his works; although
                    by some he is represented as an academic, and as preferring the sentiments of
                    Plato to those of all other philosophers. To some tradition of his addiction to
                    science, to the revelations contained in the sixth book of the Aeneid, and to
                    the magic spells described in the eighth Eclogue, Virgil probably owes his
                    reputation as a wizard, the character in which he principally figures during the
                    middle ages.</p>
                <p>Donatus carries Virgil from Naples to Rome, and there makes him the subject of
                    several fabulous stories, which it would be idle to repeat. The probability is
                    that he did not visit Rome at this time, but having finished his studies at
                    Naples, returned directly to his paternal abode; where he continued to reside
                    till his fame as a poet had begun to attract public notice.</p>
                <p>Much uncertainty prevails respecting the early productions of his muse. That the
                    Eclogues were not the first offspring of his genius, we have sufficient
                    testimony; but the genuineness of the minor poems, which usually pass under his
                    name, may well be questioned. The most probable conclusion is, that they are
                    either entirely spurious, or so much disfigured by interpolators as to leave few
                    traces of their original form. Donatus enumerates the following as youthful
                    productions of Virgil: <hi rend="italic">Catalecton, Moretum, Priapeia,
                    Epigrammata, Diroe, culex,</hi> and, while he admits that doubts existed
                    respecting its authorship, <hi rend="italic">Aetna.</hi> He is also said to have
                    undertaken a poetical work on the early wars of Rome, but to have been deterred
                    from the prosecution of his design, by the rugged and inharmonious structure of
                    the ancient Italian names. To this attempt the poet probably alludes in the
                    sixth Eclogue, where he represents himself as having prematurely undertaken a
                    work beyond his strength. But whatever may have been the early essays of Virgil,
                    there can be no doubt that he continued sedulously to cultivate those talents
                    with which he was so richly endowed; and to peruse with intense admiration and
                    delight those masterpieces of Grecian genius, which it was his great ambition to
                    rival and excel. Nor was he inattentive to the literature of his own country;
                    which however presented a comparatively limited field for the poetical student.
                    Yet the works of Ennius, Plautus, Terence, Catullus, and above all, Lucretius,
                    contained a rich poetical mine, from which much precious ore might be extracted,
                    and to which. It is manifest, he did not scruple freely to resort. Into the
                    genius, structure, and capabilities of his native tongue, he appears to have
                    penetrated more deeply than any other writer; and his diction became the
                    standard to which succeeding poets yielded an' implicit, perhaps a slavish
                    obedience. What Cicero effected for prose, Virgil effected for poetry. Few
                    literary phenomena, perhaps, are more remarkable, than the mastery over the
                    Latin language, which even his earliest productions display. In the works of
                    preceding writers may be found many detached passages scarcely to be surpassed;
                    but in uniformly-sustained beauty and propriety of diction, the Mantuan bard
                    leaves all his predecessors, as well as successors, at an immeasurable
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Virgil is usually represented as having undertaken the composition of his
                    Eclogues at the suggestion of C. Asinius Pollio, a nobleman who was not more
                    distinguished as a commander, than as a cultivator and patron of letters. On the
                    formation of the second triumvirate, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> u. 711, Pollio
                    was entrusted by Antony, whose interests he had espoused, with the command of
                    Gallia Transpadana, in which district the patrimony of Virgil lay. The rising
                    talents of the youthful poet early attracted his notice, and he continued to
                    extend to him his patronage and protection as long as he remained in the command
                    of the province. The services thus generously and seasonably rendered to genius,
                    were amply rewarded; and the name of Pollio will for ever continue associated
                    with some of the poet’s noblest strains.</p>
                <p>The date and order of composition of the Eclogues have been matter of dispute
                    among critics. By some they are supposed to have been written in the order in
                    which they now stand in the printed editions, and. It is believed, in all the
                    manuscripts of Virgil’s works; by others, the second, third, fifth, and sixth
                    are thought to have preceded the first. The determination of the question is of
                    little importance, and our present limits forbid discussion. The subject of the
                    first Eclogue sufficiently indicates the date of its composition. After the
                    battle of Philippi, <hi rend="smallcaps">a u</hi>. 712, Augustus, in fulfilment
                    of a promise which had been previously given to the army, made a large division
                    of lands among the veteran soldiers. Cremona having espoused the cause of
                    Brutus, was among the first to suffer on the present occasion. Its territory was
                    assigned to the soldiers; but not proving of sufficient extent, the deficiency
                    was supplied from the neighbouring district of Mantua. Virgil was thus involved
                    in the general calamity, and driven with violence from his humble patrimony.
                    About this time, however, he appears to have renewed his acquaintance and
                    friendship with Alphenus Varus, who had been his fellow-student at Naples, and
                    who now discharged some important public function in the poet’s district. Under
                    his protection. It is supposed, Virgil repaired to Rome, and by personal
                    application obtained from Augustus the restoration of his farm. To record his
                    gratitude for this signal favour, he composed the first Eclogue, which, in the
                    person of Meliboeus, presents a vivid picture of the distress and misery by
                    which he was surrounded; while in that of Tityrus, he eulogises in glowing
                    strains, and honours as a god, the youth to whom he owed his own more fortunate
                    lot. It appears, however, that he experienced no slight difficulty in recovering
                    his farm, notwithstanding the order of Augustus; and that, on one occasion, when
                    pursued by the tribune Arrius, who had taken forcible possession of it, he saved
                    his life by swimming across the Mincius. To these fresh disasters he is supposed
                    to allude in the ninth Eclogue. Besides Augustus, the persons chiefly celebrated
                    in the Eclogues are Pollio, Varus, and Gallus, who had been the poet’s earliest
                    patrons, and who ever after continued his most esteemed and beloved friends.</p>
                <p>The Eclogues, in the composition of which he is said to have spent three years,
                    were received by his countrymen with unbounded applause. They were universally
                    read and admired, and such was their popularity, that they were publicly recited
                    in the theatre at Rome. Their novelty, for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=695" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0695-0655"
                    />pastoral poetry now appeared for the first time in a Roman dress; the pictures
                    which they presented of rural felicity, and of simple and innocent pleasures, so
                    strongly contrasted with the scenes of violence and bloodshed which had so long
                    deluged Italy; the descriptions of nature so exquisitely blended with human
                    feelings and human sympathies; the allusions to recent and passing events; the
                    polished simplicity, beauty, and harmony of the verse; all contributed to
                    enhance their merit in the eyes of his contemporaries, and to establish them in
                    popular favour.</p>
                <p>But, however great their merit in other respects, the Eclogues of Virgil can lay
                    little claim to the praise of originality. They are, for the most part,
                    imitations, and occasionally little more than translations of Theocritus. Roman
                    literature was indeed essentially imitative; and its greatest masters rarely
                    ventured to give unfettered scope to the impulses of their native powers. Seldom
                    venturing to depart from their Grecian models, they were content to follow
                    closely in their footsteps, and deemed it sufficient to clothe in the language
                    of Rome those ideas and descriptions which were furnished by their intellectual
                    masters. Yet Virgil, while retaining the substance of Doric song, succeeded in
                    impressing on his Italian transcript not a little of his own calm and meditative
                    nature, and in awakening the popular sympathies of his countrymen in a manner
                    which at once stamped him as the national poet of Rome. Not the least difficulty
                    which he had to encounter in introducing this new species of composition, was
                    the apparently intractable and inflexible nature of the language which he had to
                    employ, little fitted, apparently, for the description of pastoral and rural
                    scenes. But the powers of the poet triumphed, in a great measure, even over this
                    difficulty; and although unable to rival the matchless melody of the Doric reed,
                    he imparted to his native tongue a delicacy, softness, and variety, of which
                    till then it had been considered unsusceptible. In estimating the immediate
                    reception of the Eclogues, we must not altogether overlook the skill and
                    dexterity with which the poet paid court to his early patrons, whose voice was
                    perhaps no less potential in the literary than in the political world. Their
                    publication must, at all events, be considered an important era in the literary
                    history of Rome, as exhibiting the first-fruits of that genius which was
                    destined to stamp its indelible impress on the literature of future ages.</p>
                <p>About the thirty-third year of his age Virgil removed to Rome. Here he
                    experienced the bounty, as well as friendship, of Maecenas and Augustus, and
                    appears to have been placed by their liberality in circumstances which enabled
                    him ever after to devote his undivided energies to his favourite pursuits. It is
                    pleasing to find the most cordial relation subsisting, even at this early
                    period, between such men as Virgil and Horace. Both candidates for popular
                    favour, in circumstances which too frequently produce rivalry, if not hostility,
                    these illustrious poets appear to have been united in the closest ties of
                    friendship. Virgil is said to have intoduced Horace to the notice of Maecenas;
                    and the deep feeling of respect and admiration with which Horace regarded
                    Virgil, is manifested in several parts of his works. The sixth Satire of the
                    first book exhibits a pleasing picture of the intimate terms on which they lived
                    with their common patron Maecenas, and with some of their poetical
                    contemporaries. During his residence at Rome, Virgil inhabited a house on the
                    Esquiline hill, near the gardens of Maecenas. He was treated with universal
                    respect; and on one occasion, when some of his verses were recited in the
                    theatre, the whole audience rose to salute him, with the same respect that they
                    were accustomed to bestow on the emperor. But his modesty shrunk from the public
                    gaze; and amid the splendour and homage of Rome, he longed for scenes more in
                    harmony with his poetical and contemplative genius, and. It may be added, better
                    suited to the delicacy of his constitution. After a brief sojourn in the
                    metropolis, he accordingly retired to Naples, at that time the favourite retreat
                    of literary men; and there, or at a delightful residence in the vicinity of
                    Nola, about ten miles distant, he continued chiefly to reside during the
                    remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>Having thus chosen a congenial place of abode, Virgil, at the suggestion of
                    Maecenas, commenced the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Georgies.</hi> The
                    subject was selected, we are told, with the view of restoring among the Romans a
                    love of those rural pursuits to which they had been peculiarly addicted in early
                    times, but which, amid the desolation and bloodshed of the civil wars, had been
                    entirely abandoned and forgotten. Little is known of the private life of Virgil
                    during the composition of this immortal poem, which occupied the space of seven
                    years. Donatus and others relate, that he was accustomed to dictate a number of
                    verses in the morning, and spend the day in polishing and reducing them to a
                    smaller number. From internal evidence, this appears to be no inaccurate
                    description of his literary habits.</p>
                <p>The Georgics more than realized the highest expectations that had been formed of
                    Virgil’s poetic powers. This work, which is dedicated to Maecenas, is divided
                    into four books, and treats in succession of husbandry, plan ting, cattle, and
                    bees. Our limits forbid any attempt at analysis; nor indeed could words convey
                    any adequate notion of the wonderful union which this masterwork presents of
                    didactic precept, varied and splendid description, touching pathos and
                    sensibility, episodes at once appropriate and striking, historic and mythologie
                    allusion, displaying all the resources of the richest poetical treasury. The
                    sweetness and easy flow of versification by which the Eclogues are
                    distinguished, gave but faint indication of the matchless power, variety, and
                    magnificence of the Georgics. Although the subject of this poem is peculiarly
                    national, yet the same imitative spirit which pervades the whole literature of
                    Rome, exercised its influence here also. As in the Eclogues Theocritus, so here
                    Hesiod formed the chief model for the general structure and conduct of the work.
                    But in this poem Virgil perhaps owes less to his prototypes than in his other
                    productions; and he has diffused over the whole a flood of poetical light
                    peculiarly his own. The poet has indeed exhibited the happiest combination of
                    genius and art, and has succeeded in imparting to didactic themes a life, an
                    interest, and a grandeur, of which, from their nature, they seem scarcely
                    susceptible. Here the Romans found scenes and modes of life in which their
                    fathers had delighted, depicted in colours which could not fail to excite the
                    deepest interest, and rekindle in their breasts the love of pursuits, which,
                    though for a time banished by the rude collisions of civil strife, were
                    associated in their minds with the heroes and patriots of old, with the undying
                    achievements and illustrious characters of ancient times. In estimating the
                    merits of the Georgics, we must not pass without special notice the matchless
                    beauty of the versification. In sustained majesty, in melody that ever satisfies
                    but never cloys the ear, in variety of modulation, in stateliness but freedom of
                    march. It stands unapproached by any other Roman poet, and unsurpassed by Virgil
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Having with such signal success enriched the literature of his country with two
                    species of poetry, of which till then it possessed no example, he resolved to
                    attempt a work of a still higher nature. It is evident that he had long
                    meditated such a work; as we find allusions to it both in the Eclogues and
                    Georgics. He commenced the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a
                    u</hi>. 724, the year in which he completed the Georgics. This great work,
                    undertaken, we are told, at the request of Augustus, occupied him till his
                    death, and even then had not received his finishing touch. As he proceeded with
                    its composition, the greatest interest was excited respecting<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=696" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0696-0656"/>
                    it, and the highest expectations were entertained of its merits, as may be
                    gathered from the prognostication of Propertius, who thus anticipates its future
                    fame:</p>
                <p>Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii,</p>
                <p>Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade.</p>
                <p>In 729, Augustus expressed a strong desire to be favoured with a perusal of the
                    poem, so far as it had been completed; but Virgil excused himself, on the ground
                    that the work was not yet worthy of such an honour. About a year afterwards,
                    however, he was prevailed on to read the sixth book to Augustus, in the presence
                    of his sister Octavia. When the poet reached the beautiful passage in which he
                    alludes so pathetically to the death of her son Marcellus, the adopted child of
                    Augustus, and the universal favourite of Rome, Octavia is said to have swooned
                    away; and, on reviving, to have ordered the poet to be rewarded with ten <hi
                    rend="italic">sestertia</hi> for each line. In conformity with the usual
                    practice among Roman poets, Virgil occasionally recited portions of his verses
                    to his literary friends; not, however, for the sake of display, but in order to
                    be favoured with their critical remarks. His recitation is represented as highly
                    effective, and as distinguished by remarkable sweetness, and propriety of
                    articulation.</p>
                <p>Having completed the Aeneid, he resolved to travel into Greece, that he might, at
                    leisure, correct and polish his great work, and bring it to the greatest
                    possible perfection before giving it to the world. On this occasion, Horace
                    addressed to him the beautiful ode, beginning, “Sic to diva potens Cypri;” in
                    which he expresses in the most affectionate terms, his anxiety for the safe
                    return of his beloved friend. On arriving at Athens, Virgil proceeded to execute
                    the task which he had imposed upon himself; and, besides, composed the splendid
                    introduction to the third book of the Georgics. His original intention, on
                    quitting Italy, was to dedicate three years to the work of revisal, and then,
                    amid the scenes of his native country, to devote the rest of his life to the
                    study of philosophy, in which he had always delighted. Augustus, however, on his
                    return from the East, having reached Athens, Virgil, probably in consequence of
                    the state of his health, resolved to accompany him to Rome. But his days were
                    now numbered. The vessel in which he sailed along with the emperor, touched at
                    Megara, where he was seized with extreme debility; and his distemper increased
                    so much during the remainder of the voyage, that he died a few days after
                    reaching Brundusium. This event took place, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. u.</hi> 735,
                    in the fifty-first year of his age. In compliance with his dying wishes, his
                    bones were conveyed to Naples, where, in literary seclusion, he had spent so
                    many years of his life; and his tomb is still pointed out at a spot about two
                    miles distant from that city. The urn which was supposed to contain his ashes,
                    bore the following inscription, which is said, but without sufficient authority,
                    to have proceeded from the lips of the dying poet:</p>
                <p>Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope; cecini pascua, rura,
                    duces.</p>
                <p>The precise locality of Virgil’s tomb has been made the subject of controversy;
                    but there seems to be no good reason for rejecting the common tradition of the
                    country on this point. He bequeathed the greater part of his wealth to his
                    brother; the rest, to Augustus and Maecenas, and his friends L. Varius and
                    Plotius Tucca.</p>
                <p>Virgil is represented as tall of stature, of a swarthy complexion, negligent in
                    his dress, and somewhat ungraceful in his deportment. The melancholy with which
                    he was tinged probably arose from the delicacy of his constitution, and the ill
                    health under which he laboured. Of the native warmth of his heart, and the
                    sincerity of his friendships it is impossible to doubt, since he was universally
                    beloved as well as admired by his contemporaries; who, amid their mutual
                    jealousies and literary rivalry, seem to have united in doing honour to one, who
                    ever cheerfully recognised the merits of others, and rejoiced in, and, to the
                    utmost of his power, promoted, their success. Of the more private and familiar
                    life of Virgil, nothing is known. Unlike Horace, whose works constitute his best
                    biography, Virgil has few allusions to himself, and none that throw light on his
                    domestic habits. He passes before us with much of the indistinctness and shadowy
                    grandeur in which he envelopes the shades in Elysium.</p>
                <p>When he perceived his end approaching, he is said to have ordered Varius and
                    Plotius Tucca to burn the Aeneid, on which he had expended so many years’
                    labour, and on which his future fame was expected mainly to rest. The reason of
                    this command has been the subject of much discussion. The common opinion is,
                    that not having received his finishing hand, he was unwilling to transmit to
                    posterity and peril his fame on a work, which he had not brought to that degree
                    of perfection which he had contemplated. Some, again, account for the poet’s
                    conduct on the supposition that, on the approach of death, he felt regret at
                    having produced a work which, instead of inspiring sentiments of liberty, was
                    intended to reconcile his countrymen to the chains which had been imposed upon
                    them by a successful but unworthy usurper. Fortunately for the interests of
                    literature, Augustus interposed his authority to save a poem, to the completion
                    of which he had looked forward with intense interest, and from which he
                    anticipated so much glory to himself and the Roman state. It was intrusted to
                    Varius and Tucca for revisal and publication, but with express injunctions that
                    they should make no additions to the words of the poet; and we have reason to
                    believe that they executed their honourable task in a spirit of due reverence
                    for departed genius.</p>
                <p>The Aeneid, as already mentioned, excited the highest expectations among the
                    literary contemporaries of the poet during its composition; and on its
                    publication, was hailed with universal approval. Ovid alludes to it more than
                    once in terms expressive of his conviction that it occupied the first place in
                    Roman literature, and that, in common with the other works of the author. It
                    would last while the eternal city should endure. The sentence thus early
                    pronounced, has been confirmed by the consenting voice of succeeding ages; and,
                    whatever difference of opinion may have existed respecting its comparative
                    merits, the Aeneid has ever been ranked as one of the rare productions of human
                    genius, which are destined to immortality. If considered as the rival of the
                    Iliad, the Aeneid will be presented in a false as well as unfavourable point of
                    view; and it is difficult to conceive that it was composed under any such
                    predominating idea. Neither the age which produced it, nor the genius of the
                    poet, was favourable to such an achievement; but having resolved to compose an
                    epic poem, Virgil no doubt took Homer as his mode), and endeavoured to
                    transplant into the fabric of his work as many of the beauties of the Grecian
                    poet as suited the nature of his subject. We accordingly find that he drew
                    equally on the Iliad and Odyssey, the first six books being on the model of the
                    former, and the remaining six on that of the latter. How far his plan was
                    adopted with a view to avail himself of the whole range of Homeric materials. It
                    is difficult to determine; but it was a bold attempt, if it was ever
                    contemplated, to rival or surpass in a single work, the combined excellencies of
                    his matchless models.</p>
                <p>The chief design of the Aeneid appears to have been, to deduce the origin of the
                    Romans from the Trojans, and by tracing the family of Augustus to Aeneas, to
                    establish his divine title to the sovereignty of Rome. This leading idea
                    pervades the whole texture of the work; and the restraint which was thus
                    necessarily imposed on the poet, must have interfered most unfavourably with the
                    freedom of epic movement. The character of Aeneas is meant to shadow forth that
                    of Augustus; but while he constantly occupies <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=697" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0697-0657"
                    />the fore-ground, he is invested with few attributes calculated to excite
                    admiration, or awaken a vivid interest in his career. He is represented as the
                    mere passive instrument of fate, and there is consequently little about him of
                    heroic daring. The Romans, however, could not fail readily to recognize the
                    intended resemblance; and the halo thrown around the hero of the Aeneid, was
                    calculated to reconcile them to the destined sway of his descendant, which had
                    been mysteriously announced by oracles.</p>
                <p>We cannot enter into the details of the Aeneid, or point out the manner in which
                    the poet has accomplished his main design. As might be expected, he has availed
                    himself of all the native, as well as foreign resources within his reach, while
                    the whole displays that sober and chastised judgement for which he was so
                    remarkable, and which, in his case, was so admirably combined with high poetical
                    genius. The Aeneid has been generally censured for want of variety in the
                    characters. That this charge is well-founded, must to a certain extent be
                    allowed; but the fault is inseparable from the very design and structure of the
                    work. The chief object being the exaltation of Augustus, no formidable
                    competitor could be admitted on the scene. The whole attention is fixed on one
                    central figure, to which all the others are made subordinate. But although the
                    contrasts of character are not glaring, they are frequently not indistinctly
                    marked; and if they are apt to elude the notice of the careless observer, they
                    reveal themselves with sufficient clearness to the more searching and curious
                    eye. But the great merit of the Aeneid lies, not in its leading design and
                    general conduct, but in the beauty of its details; many of which will bear
                    comparison with the happiest inspirations of the father of epic song. It may not
                    be improper to remark, that Virgil, amid the fulsome homage and adulation,
                    which, in common with the other poets of that age, he bestows on Augustus,
                    frequently displays a truly Roman spirit; and, from the manner in which he
                    represents the agents and events of the olden times, appears to sympathise with,
                    and appreciate, the sterner and nobler virtues by which Rome was distinguished,
                    while the genius of freedom yet presided over her destinies.</p>
                <p>In the composition of his works, Virgil drew unsparingly, not only on the poetic
                    treasures of Greece, but on the more limited resources of his native literature.
                    This however he did in conformity with the universal practice of his countrymen;
                    and it may with truth be affirmed, that he borrowed nothing which he did not
                    adorn. His imputed plagiarisms have sometimes been pointed out with a malicious
                    industry; but when properly viewed, with reference to the position and mission
                    of the poet, they will be found to prove at once the soundness of his judgment,
                    and the purity and refinement of his taste.</p>
                <p>The general character of Virgil as a poet may be considered as fixed by the
                    concurring testimony of critics of all ages. That he was deficient in the
                    highest attribute of genius, in the power of creating and bodying forth original
                    conceptions, must be admitted; but, with this limitation, there are few
                    qualities in which he will be found wanting. In soundness of judgment, and
                    correctness of taste; in depth and tenderness of feeling; in chastened fancy and
                    imagination; in vivid and picturesque description; in the power of appreciating
                    and pourtraying the beautiful, whether in nature or art; of depicting passion,
                    and touching the chords of human sympathy; in matchless beauty of diction, and
                    in harmony and splendour of versification, he stands alone among the poets of
                    his own country, and will bear a favourable comparison with those of any other.
                    His works have taken their place among the imperishable offspring of genius,
                    and, while literature lasts, will continue to exercise a powerful influence on
                    the poetical taste of successive generations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">editio pnnceps</hi> of Virgil was printed at Rome, by
                    Sweynheym and Pannartz, <hi rend="italic">sine anno,</hi> most probably 1469. Of
                    the immense number of editions which have succeeded it, we must content
                    ourselves with mentioning the following, as among the most valuable. N. Heinsii,
                    Amst. 1676, 12mo. Ruaei, in usum Delphini, Par. 1675, 4to; often reprinted.

                <p>Of the English translations of Virgil, that of Dryden is the most popular. A

                    >Georgies</hi> by Warton, and of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> by Pitt,
                    appeared in 1753, 4 vols. 8vo. These are held in high repute. The Aeneid has
                    also been translated into English verse by Symmons and Ring; and into Scotish
                    verse by Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld. Of this last work, an excellent
                    edition was published by Ruddiman, Edin. 1710, fol.; but a still more valuable
                    edition, in 3 vols. 4to, is now printing for the Bannatyne Club, under the
                    superintendence of George Dundas, Esq. Of the Georgics, Sotheby’s translation is
                    incomparably the best. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.k</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Virgil,</hi><hi rend="italic">Polydore,</hi> an English
                    historian, born at Urbino in Italy, was sent in the beginning of the sixteenth
                    century by Pope Alexander VI., as sub-collector of the papal tax called <hi
                    rend="italic">Peter-pence</hi> in this kingdom. He had not been long in England
                    before he obtained preferment in the church; for in 1503 he was presented to the
                    rectory of Church-Langton, in the archdeaconry of Leicester. In 1507 he was
                    collated to the prebend of Scamlesby, in the church of Lincoln; and in the same
                    year was made archdeacon of Wells, and prebendary of Hereford. In 1513, he
                    resigned his prebend of Lincoln, and was collated to that of Oxgate in St
                    Paul’s, London. We are told, that on his preferment to the archdeaconry of
                    Wells, he resigned the office of sub-collector to the pope, and determined to
                    spend the remainder of his life in England, the History of which kingdom he
                    began in the year 1505, at the command of Henry VII. That work cost him twelve
                    years’ labour. In 1526, he finished his treatise on Prodigies. Polydore
                    continued in England during the whole reign of Henry VIII., and part of that of
                    Edward VL, whence it is concluded that he was a moderate Papist. In 1550, being
                    now an old man, he requested leave to revisit his native country. He was
                    accordingly dismissed with a present of 300 crowns, together with the privilege
                    of holding his preferments to the end of his life. He died at Urbino in the year
                    1555. As an historian, he is accused by some as a malignant slanderer of the
                    English nation; yet Jovius remarks, that the French and Scotish accuse him of
                    having flattered that nation too much. Besides the above work, he wrote, 1. <hi

                    published by Langley in 1663. It was also translated into French and Spanish. 2.
