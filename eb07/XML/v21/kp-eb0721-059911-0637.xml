                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">VERMIN</label> is a general term, denoting those animals
                    which are either directly or indirectly injurious to mankind, the inferior
                    animals, or the fruits of the earth; as fleas, caterpillars, flies, worms,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As we propose in this article to point out the means of destroying some of those
                    animals, we shall employ the term vermin in a more extended sense, including
                    also under it, mice, rats, moles, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rats and Mice.—</hi> Various methods have been proposed for the
                    destruction of these vermin. The following preparation has been recommended as
                    very effectual. Take of the seeds of stavesacre (<hi rend="italic">delphinium
                    staphisagria),</hi> or of lousewort (<hi rend="italic">pedicularis
                    palustris),</hi> powdered, more or less as the occasion requires, one part; of
                    oatmeal, three parts; mix them well, and make them up into a paste with honey.
                    Lay pieces of this paste in the holes, and on the places where mice and rats
                    frequent; and it will effectually kill or rid the places of those vermin by
                    their eating it.</p>
                <p>The Society for Encouraging Arts proposed a premium of L.50 for a preparation
                    capable of alluring or fascinating rats, so that they might be taken alive. In
                    consequence of this, a great number of new traps, &amp;c <hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi> were invented, and the following methods of alluring the rats to a
                    certain place were divulged. One of the methods which is most easily and
                    efficaciously practised, is the trailing of some pieces of their most favourite
                    food, which should be of the kind that has the strongest scent. such as toasted
                    cheese or boiled red herrings, from the holes or entrances of the closet to
                    their recesses in every part of the house or contiguous building. At the
                    extremities, and at different parts of the course of this trailed track, small
                    quantities of meal, or any other kind of their food, should be laid, to bring
                    the greater number into the tracks, and to encourage them to pursue it to the
                    place where they are intended to be taken. At that place, when time admits of
                    it, a more plentiful repast is laid for them, and the trailing is repeated for
                    two or three nights. Besides this trailing and way-baiting, some of the most
                    expert of the rat-catchers have a shorter, and perhaps more effectual method of
                    bringing them together; which is the calling them, by making such a whistling
                    noise as resembles their own call; and by this means, with the assistance of the
                    way-baits, they bring them out of their holes, and lead them to the repast
                    previously prepared for them at the places designed for taking them. But this is
                    much more difficult to be practised than the art of trailing; for the learning
                    of the exact notes or cries of any kind of beasts or birds, so as to deceive
                    them, is a peculiar talent which is attained only by few.</p>
                <p>In practising either of these methods of trailing or calling, great caution must
                    be used by the operator to suppress and prevent the scent of his feet and body
                    from being perceived; which is done by overpowering that scent by others of a
                    stronger nature. In order to do this, the feet are to be covered with cloths
                    rubbed over with assafoetida, or other strong smelling substances; and even oil
                    of rhodium is sometimes used for this purpose, but sparingly, on account of its
                    high price, though it has a very alluring as well as disgusting effect. If this
                    caution of avoiding the scent of the operator’s feet, near the track, and in the
                    place where the rats are proposed to be collected, be not properly observed. It
                    will very much obstruct the success of the attempt to take them; for they are
                    very shy of coming where the scent of human feet lies very fresh, as it
                    intimates to their sagacious instinct the presence of human creatures, whom they
                    naturally dread. To the above-mentioned means of alluring by trailing,
                    way-baiting, and calling, is added another of very material efficacy, which is
                    the use of oil of rhodium.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=638"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0638-0600"/>
                <p>Like the <hi rend="italic">marum Syriacum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >valerian</hi> in the case of cats, it has a very extraordinary fascinating
                    power on these animals. This oil, as it is extremely dear, is therefore
                    sparingly used. It is exalted in a small quantity in the place, and at the
                    entrance of it, where the rats are intended to be taken, particularly at the
                    time when they are to be last brought together, in order to their destruction:
                    and it is used also by smearing it on the surface of some of the implements used
                    in taking by the method described below. Its effect in removing their caution
                    and dread, by the delight which they appear to have in it, is very
                    extraordinary. It is likewise usual for the operator to disguise his figure as
                    well as scent. This is done by putting on a sort of gown or cloak, of one
                    colour, that hides the natural form, and makes him appear like a post, or some
                    such inanimate thing, which habit must likewise be. scented as above, to
                    overpower the smell of his person; and besides this, he is to avoid all motion
                    till he has secured his point of having the rats in his power.</p>
                <p>When the rats are thus enticed and collected, where time is afforded, and the
                    whole in any house and out-buildings are to be cleared away, they are suffered
                    to regale on what they most like, which is ready prepared for them, and then to
                    go away quietly for two or three nights; by which means those that are not
                    allured the first night, are brought afterwards, either by their fellows, or the
                    effects of the trailing, &amp;c., and will not fail to come duly again, if they
                    are not disturbed or molested. Many of the rat-catchers make shorter work, and
                    content themselves with what can be brought together in one night; but this is
                    never effectual, unless where the building is small and entire, and the rats but
                    few in number.</p>
                <p>The means of taking them when brought together are various. Some entice them into
                    a very large bag, the mouth of which is sufficiently capacious to cover nearly
                    the whole floor of the place where they are collected. This is done by smearing
                    some vessel, placed in the middle of the hag, with oil of rhodium, and laying in
                    the bag baits of food. The bag, which before lay flat on the ground with the
                    mouth spread open, is to be suddenly closed when the rats are all in. Others
                    drive or frighten them, by slight noises or motions, into a bag of a long form,
                    the mouth of which, after all the rats are come in, is drawn up to the opening
                    of the place by which they entered, all other ways of retreat being secured.
                    Others, again, intoxicate or poison them, by mixing with the repast prepared for
                    them, the <hi rend="italic">coculus Indicus,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">nux
                    vomica.</hi> They direct four ounces of <hi rend="italic">coculus Indicus,</hi>
                    with twelve ounces of oatmeal, and two ounces of treacle or honey, made into a
                    moist paste with strong beer; but if the <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi> be
                    used, a much less proportion will serve than is here given of the <hi
                    rend="italic">coculus.</hi> Any similar composition of these drugs, with that
                    kind of food which rats are most fond of, and which has a strong flavour to hide
                    that of the drugs, will equally answer the end. If indeed c <hi rend="italic"
                    >oculus Indicus</hi> be well powdered, and infused in strong beer for some time,
                    at least half the quantity here directed will serve as well as the quantity
                    before mentioned. When the rats appear to be thoroughly intoxicated with the
                    cocu-lus, or sick with the nux vomica, they may be taken with the hand and put
                    into a bag or cage, the door of the place being first shut, lest those which
                    have strength remaining should make their escape.</p>
                <p>In destroying rats, advantage may be taken of that remarkable degree of instinct
                    which they possess of deserting one place, where they find themselves disturbed
                    or harassed, and retiring to new haunts. It is well known, that after one or two
                    rats are poisoned, or taken in traps, or wounded or otherwise injured, and
                    afterwards permitted to escape, the whole colony immediately disappears. The
                    practice, however, of destroying by poison rats that frequent dwelling-houses,
                    should be as much as possible avoided; for they retire to places behind the
                    wainscot, &amp;c. from which, after death, their putrid bodies, emitting a most
                    offensive smell, cannot be removed. But it is far less difficult than is
                    generally imagined to secure the different apartments of a dwelling-house, and
                    even the cellars, from the inroads of rats and mice, and thus to prevent their
                    unwelcome visits, by shutting up the passages through which they enter. Stone
                    and lime, when they can be applied, are effectual; but common plaster, by
                    introducing pieces of broken pottery ware or glass along with it, will also
                    answer the purpose; and even a piece of cork, with a pin or two stuck through it
                    to prevent them from eating it away, is a complete barrier to mice entering
                    through a hole in wood, and may even prevent the entrance of rats. We have seen
                    this method of shutting up the holes, as soon as they were opened by the
                    industry of the enemy, steadily pursued for some time, attended with the fullest
                    success, even in an old house of considerable extent, and finished from top to
                    bottom with wood, some of which was much decayed.</p>
                <p>For the sake of food, rats and mice often frequent gardens, fields, and woods, in
                    the summer season; but, on the approach of winter, they return to their former
                    haunts in the habitations of man; and accordingly it is observed that houses
                    which are free from those vermin during the summcr, swarm with them about the
                    end of autumn. Attention to this circumstance in the habits of these animals,
                    may be the means of securing us from their visits and depredations; for if, at
                    the time alluded to, every hole and cranny through which mouse or rat can enter,
                    be shut up, and carefully kept close and secure, the perseverance of the foe is
                    exhausted and overcome by repeated and constant resistance, and thus he is
                    forced to abandon the unequal contest, and to retire to other haunts where his
                    motions are less interrupted.</p>
                <p>Various other methods have been proposed for the destruction of rats; and
                    although we have thrown out a bint against the use of arsenic for this purpose
                    in dwellinghouses, yet where it can be employed with perfect safety, and without
                    risk of the nuisance alluded to, as in cellars and cuthouses. It is undoubtedly
                    one of the most effectual to which we can have recourse.</p>
                <p>Suffocating these vermin by means of the fumes of sulphur, as on board of ships,
                    in granaries, and other buildings, which can be shut up, is sometimes
                    successfully practised. Rats and other vermin have also been effectually
                    destroyed by burning wood in close apartments, thus producing fixed air or
                    carbonic acid gas, by which they are suffocated.</p>
                <p>Moles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The observations
                    on the structure and habits of the mole, and on the mode of trapping it, have
                    been communicated by Mr. Thomas Yeadell of Preston, for many years practically
                    engaged in the art of mole-catching.</p></note><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The mole
                    is found in all parts of Great Britain. It is seldom or never seen above the
                    surface of the ground, except when forced out of its subterraneous abode by
                    excessive drought and heat, by inundations, or by very hard frost. In size it is
                    a little larger than the dormouse, and smaller than the common rat, measuring
                    from five to six inches in length, exclusive of the tail. The male is
                    considerably larger than the female. The body is completely covered with very
                    fine glossy black hair or fur, softer and finer than silk, or the fur of the
                    beaver, inclining to a brownish hue on the abdomen.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whole families of fine cream-coloured moles
                    have sometimes been taken; and Mr Yeadell once took a whole litter of piebalds,
                    but he never took or saw a perfectly white one.</p></note> Its nose is long, and
                    resembles that of the hog; its eyes are very quick and perceptible when the
                    animal is alive. Instead of external ears, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=639" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0639-0601"/>it
                    has openings protected by the fur, which are admirably fitted for their purpose,
                    as the hearing of few animals is more acute. Its neck is very short, and its
                    body is thick, round, and muscular, terminated by a tail about an inch long. The
                    fore-legs have more the appearance of hands growing out of the body, turned
                    outwards and backwards, like the hands of a man when swimming. These legs are
                    very strong, and are each furnished with five claws. The hind legs are longer
                    and weaker than the fore ones, being only need in progressive motions; whereas
                    the others are constantly employed in digging and boring the ground, or in
                    scraping and throwing back the earth when loosened; for while the mole is
                    excavating. It is always obliged to draw the loosened earth backwards, and to
                    lift or shove it above the surface of the ground in the same way. Its teeth are
                    beautifully white, and consist of forty-four in all, viz. six upper and eight
                    under incisors, two upper and two under canines, and seven molars on each side
                    above, and six on each side below. Its food consists almost entirely of
                    earth-worms and a few insects.</p>
                <p>The male and female go together about the end of March or beginning of April, and
                    most of them produce their young in the beginning of June, a few so early as the
                    last week in May.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr.
                    Yeadell comes to this conclusion from his observation of the state of the female
                    about this time, and from frequently having taken the whole litter of young in
                    the nest, which is easily found, from its being made in the centre of an
                    unusually large hillock. Although the mole is here stated to breed only once
                    a-year. It is the recorded belief of some observers, that two broods are
                    annually produced, one in spring or early in summer, and another in autumn. The
                    more usual and characteristic period, however, we believe to be the spring, and
                    this accords with the practical observations of continental naturalists on the
                    subject.</p></note> The female brings forth her young only once a-year, the
                    number varying from one to nine at a birth, and five or six being the average
                    number. She carries her young about nine weeks, that is, from the last week in
                    March or the first in April, till the last week in May or beginning of June.
                    When the season arrives for the male and female going together, if their
                    domiciles are not connected by old workings, the solitary mole will leave his
                    place of abode in the night, and travel a considerable distance above ground to
                    meet with a companion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This is a circumstance which Mr. Yendell conceives to be proved in various
                    ways; first, by his frequently having found the workings entirely abandoned in
                    particular places in the months of March and April; secondly, by finding
                    unusually large numbers of moles together at this time; and, thirdly, by
                    incidental circumstances, such as taking a mole which had lost his tail, or had
                    been deprived of a bind leg. In 1809 Mr. Yeadell took a mole without a tail, and
                    the following year he took one wanting a bind leg, both of which had been
                    twisted off, in traps of his own, at the distance of a mile or more from the
                    place where they were at last taken. the most frequent cause of the mole
                    changing its ground arises from inundations. When the rivers rise rapidly and
                    cover his workings, be is obliged to abandon his subterraanne abode, and swim
                    for his life, which he can do with the buoyancy of a water-rat.</p></note></p>
                <p>The season for trapping moles in Scotland commences on the 20th of August, and
                    ends on the 31st of May in each year, or occasionally a week or two later if the
                    winter be a severe one.</p>
                <p>About forty years ago, when steps were taken to clear the moles from the estates
                    of his grace Henry duke of Buccleuch in Scotland, a man was appointed to each
                    five thousand or six thousand acres of land, for two or three of the first years
                    of a twenty years’ lease; and so much success attended the plan, that two men
                    were sufficient to keep fifty thousand Scotish acres of land pretty clear of
                    moles during the remainder of the lease. And had it not been that there were
                    several intervening patches of land, where the moles were not trapped at all,
                    and where their propagation was kept up, one man would probably have sufficed
                    for the purpose.</p>
                <p>The most common way of taking moles, is by traps set in their walks or runs; and
                    the best for this purpose are the wooden ones made by the bobbin turners in the
                    neighbourhood of Kendal and elsewhere, and sold at about twopence each. Sixty of
                    these traps, with as much mole-twine as may be bought for eighteenpence, a few
                    sticks, a small bodkin, and a mole-spade, equip the mole-catcher, and will serve
                    him for a year without any additional outlay. With these materials, in good
                    ground, where the moles have not before been disturbed, he will capture three
                    hundred dozens the first season. Before commencing operations, the traps should
                    be steeped in water, and covered in the ground for a day or two, to remove any
                    peculiar smell which may belong to them.</p>
                <p>In the subterraneous runs of the mole, as among the streets of towns and
                    villages, there are certain walks more frequented than others, and hence
                    entitled to the name of thoroughfares.</p>
                <p>The dots in the above diagram represent the mole-hills, and the lines the walks
                    or streets communicating between them, which serve the double purpose of a
                    dwelling and a trap for worms, upon which the mole feeds. It is probable that
                    all these streets, or at all events a large proportion of them, are traversed
                    every twenty-four hours, more especially when food is scarce. It is also obvious
                    that certain parts of these walks must be more frequently passed than
                    others.</p>
                <p>A may be supposed to be a hedge near which the mole will spend much of its time
                    in wet, cold, or stormy weather; B and D are two ridges adjoining to the hedge,
                    where it is much engaged in fine weather; and C the furrow between those ridges.
                    Let fig. 1 represent the walk conducting from the hedge to the first ridge, and
                    fig. 2 a continuation of the same walk between the first and second ridges.
                    Figs. 3 and 4 are mainwalks on the ridges. Nos. 1 and 2 are the walks that will
                    be most used, and therefore are the places where the mole-catcher would place
                    his traps. Nos. 3 and 4 are the next best, in consequence of there being only a
                    single road or passage in each place, and not, as to the right and left of them,
                    a variety of byeways. In many cases the inexperienced may be unable to determine
                    which is a main run, in consequence of the ground being apparently all worked up
                    together. In such a case he should endeavour to find a walk in a hedge bottom,
                    or in crossing the ditch to the hedge, or where the mole goes to water, or in
                    the crossing of a gapstead or gateway, or in a footpath, or furrow, or
                    sheepwalk, or along the side of a drain. In such places as these, the ground is
                    generally pretty solid, and it may be assumed as a general rule, that the mole
                    never likes to make a great number of walks where the ground is hard, or where
                    it is frequently trodden on. When the mole-catcher has surveyed the ground, and
                    made up his mind where to place his trap, as at Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, he may
                    strike his spade into the ground in a right line, between the hillocks, and if
                    he finds the ground hollow, he has discovered the walk, and he may there make a
                    hole to set his trap in. Care must be taken not to make this hole too large, and
                    it ought to be about a quarter of an inch lower than the bottom of the walk, so
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=640"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0640-0602"/>that the mole may have a gentle descent into it.
                    The earth ought also to be well filled in upon all sides, so as to exclude the
                    light, and at the same time not to interrupt the mole in its passage; for upon
                    discovering any interruption, it will be apt to make a new road by the side of
                    it, and after having its suspicion excited. It will be very difficult to take it
                    afterwards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sometimes,
                    when Mr. Yeadell has met with a mole which hud been rendered cunning from the
                    string of a trap having broken, or from its having been caught by the tail or by
                    a hind leg, which it bad twisted off, and escaped, he has successfully resorted
                    to the various stratagems. The first of these is to form a cake of softish earth
                    about half an inch thick, to be plastered over both ends of the trap, so as
                    effectually to interrupt the passage. The mole, upon reaching this obstacle,
                    immediately sets to work to remove it. and no sooner has it dug its way through
                    the earth, and against the trigger, than the trap strikes, and it is taken. When
                    this stratagem failed, he was accustomed to set a dead mole upright upon its
                    hinder part, with its head standing up into the centre of the trap, so as to
                    touch the trigger; and whether from the combative propensity of the mole, or
                    from its desire to relieve a companion. It rashes at the dead mole, displaces
                    the trigger, and is taken. The last stratagem be never found to fail. In all
                    cases, but more especially in those of a difficult nature, care ought to be
                    taken to have the trap and strings in perfect order, using a strong stick for a
                    spring, so that the animal shall be firmly secured.</p></note></p>
                <p>The destruction occasioned by the mole is by no means generally understood. It
                    might be worthy of the consideration of proprietors whether a great system of
                    co-operation might not successfully be formed for its extermination. At all
                    events, the number of this animal might be very much diminished, if noblemen,
                    gentlemen, and farmers would employ some one of their servants in the practice
                    of an art so easily acquired, and so highly useful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Insects.</hi> —Many insects, in the different states of
                    existence through which they pass, are exceedingly troublesome and destructive.
                    Sometimes they spread their devastations in the state of <hi rend="italic"
                    >larva</hi> or <hi rend="italic">grub,</hi> and sometimes in that of perfect
                    insect.</p>
                <p>Of the coleopterous insects, the grub of the cock-chafer, which is a brownish or
                    chesnut-coloured beetle, commits the greatest ravages. This beetle appears
                    during great part of the summer, the most plentiful in May or June, and hence is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Mag bug.</hi> It flies only in the evening, and
                    lodges during the day under the leaves of trees, which it devours, and is
                    sometimes in such numbers, as to defoliate whole woods. The beetle deposits its
                    eggs in the earth, and from these are hatched white or bluish grubs, that feed
                    on the roots of grass, corn, and other vegetables, during the whole summer. In
                    the winter they lie deep in the earth; but in the spring, as vegetation
                    advances, they rise to the surface, and renew their work of destruction. In this
                    state they continue for four, five, or six years, before they change to the
                    chrysalis state, in which they remain till the month of May, when the perfect
                    insect appears. As these insects require so many years to assume the perfect
                    form, they only appear occasionally in sufficient numbers to be extensively
                    destructive to the crops of grain, or vegetables in general. Their numbers,
                    however, have often produced great alarm, and even excited the attention of
                    governments to offer rewards for an effectual method of destroying them.</p>
                <p>In the spring season, if the weather prove warm, when the land is ploughed up,
                    these grubs are generally so near the surface as to be turned up with the
                    plough; and being thus exposed, they are picked up and devoured by various
                    birds, which. It is suggested, should not be disturbed or driven away in this
                    salutary labour. When these grubs infest meadow land. It has been proposed to
                    drown them in their holes by overflowing it; but it is supposed that this plan
                    would not be successful, even where it is practicable, unless there is a bed of
                    clay immediately under the soil, to retain the water for a sufficient length of
                    time. A more efficacious way is recommended to prevent the increase of the
                    grubs, by destroying the flies in May or June, before they have deposited their
                    eggs. This may be done by shaking and beating the trees and hedges in the middle
                    of the day; and, as this is a work which may be performed by children. It is a
                    less difficult task than would at first sight be imagined. Domestic fowls are
                    remarkably fond of these beetles, so that a double object is thus gained, the
                    destruction of the beetles and the procuring of food for the poultry.</p>
                <p>Some species of the dermestes, and also of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >ptinus,</hi> are exceedingly destructive in the cabinets of naturalists, and
                    also to furniture. Various methods have been recommended to stop their ravages.
                    We believe the most effectual is spirit of turpentine, when it can be properly
                    applied. A solution of corrosive sublimate is sometimes employed, but it should
                    be recollected that it seldom fails in time to produce some chemical change on
                    animal and vegetable matter. Objects of natural history, as birds, animals,
                    &amp;c., are sometimes exposed to the moderate heat of an oven, or before a
                    fire, for several hours; but this method will also be attended with injurious
                    effects, unless practised with great care. Insects which infest furniture have
                    been destroyed by the application of oil, and allowing it to remain for a day or
                    two, before the furniture is rubbed up. Japanned or varnished furniture may be
                    secured from the effects of these insccts, by re-coating it, when they are in
                    the larva state, by which they are deprived of air. Railing, and other works out
                    of doors, which are exposed to the weather, are sometimes eaten with insects,
                    and particularly by some of the larvae of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >curculio.</hi> The wood thus attacked may be prevented from farther ravages, by
                    a fresh coat of paint.</p>
                <p>The earwig is a destructive insect in the flower, kitchen, and fruit garden. To
                    prevent their depredations. It has been recommended to take them with the hand,
                    when they come out during the night in search of food. They maybe taken also by
                    rolling up a piece of paper, and hanging it up on the plants which they infest;
                    for in these places they take shelter through the day. Another method of
                    destroying them has been mentioned, and that is to watch them towards morning
                    with the view of discovering the haunt to which they resort during the day. This
                    may perhaps be a melon frame, dunghill, or heap of rubbish; and the removing of
                    it will destroy the greater number of those troublesome insects.</p>
                <p>The small insect which commits such depredations among turnips, by eating the
                    seedling leaves as soon as they appear, as frequently to destroy whole crops, is
                    supposed to be a small black polished beetle, belonging to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Altica.</hi> It does not seem to be well ascertained whether this
                    small beetle, which is better known by the name of turnip-fly, commits its
                    ravages in the larva or in the beetle state. It is said to prefer the leaves of
                    the common radish to those of the turnip; and it is therefore recommended to sow
                    radishes along with the turnips, to prevent the destruction of the latter.</p>
                <p>Of the insects belonging to the order hemiptera, there are some which are
                    exceedingly destructive. The cockroach, a native of the warmer parts of America
                    and the West Indies, is a very troublesome, and a very voracious insect. It has
                    been introduced into this country, and particularly into the sea-port towns, in
                    consequence of commercial intercourse. It comes out to feed in the nighttime,
                    and eats of almost every thing that comes in its way. Cockroaches are easily
                    taken by the following method. Cover the outside of a deep glass or bason with
                    paper; introduce some bits of bread or sugar into the bason or glass, and set it
                    in a place frequented by the cockroaches. They creep up by means of the paper on
                    the outside, and drop <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=641" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0641-0603"
                    />into the vessel; but in consequence of its smooth polished surface, they
                    cannot effect their escape. In the same way crickets and beetles may be taken
                    and destroyed. It is quite unnecessary to speak of the means of destroying the
                    myriads of locusts which not unfrequently infest eastern countries, and
                    particularly Egypt and Syria; for no means are likely to be devised, which
                    promise to resist the effects of such an host of foes, by whose ravages every
                    green thing is consumed; but the insect itself becomes, among the poorer
                    inhabitants of those countries, a partial substitute for the fruits of the earth
                    which it has destroyed. The insects are taken, and reduced to powder, and
                    converted into a kind of meal. *</p>
                <p>The common or the bed-bug is a very troublesome and a very common inmate in the
                    crowded houses of large towns. Its usual haunts are the crevices of wood, and
                    particularly those pieces of furniture which are usually kept in the warmest
                    corners of the apartment. Cleanliness will perhaps be found the best
                    preservative against the introduction and increase of these insects; but
                    sometimes even the greatest care and attention are ineffectual in keeping houses
                    entirely free from them. When it can be conveniently done, they are completely
                    destroyed by immersing the furniture in boiling water, or by baking it in an
                    oven; and by filling up the crevices or holes which were their haunts, with
                    glaziers’ putty, their return and increase will thus be prevented. But a very
                    effectual method of destroying bugs, is to wash the places which they frequent
                    with spirit of turpentine, and then to fill up the holes as already mentioned.
                    It is a curious circumstance in the history of those insects, that some persons
                    entirely escape from their attacks, while to others they are exceedingly
                    troublesome and distressing. It is said that lavender-water, sprinkled over the
                    bed-clothes, often prevents their approach.</p>
                <p>The small moth which, in the caterpillar state, commits ravages on woollen
                    cloths, furs, and other animal substances, that remain for any length of time in
                    dark undisturbed places, may be destroyed with the greatest certainty and
                    facility, by exposing the substances on which they are suspected to make their
                    depredations, to the vapour of spirit of turpentine, or brushing them with a
                    brush dipped into the same fluid. This should he done about the months of
                    September or October; but their effects may be prevented by placing the cloths,
                    furs, &amp;c., which are likely to become their residence, in an airy situation,
                    about the months of July and August.</p>
                <p>The different kinds of lice are very numerous. Every animal has its peculiar
                    species, and even mankind are not free from this pest. It is often the
                    consequence of indolence and nastiness; and it is observed that the lice which
                    infest any animal increase prodigiously when that animal becomes languid and
                    sickly. We believe that the application of spirits of turpentine, already so
                    often recommended, would also be effectual in this case; but mercurial
                    preparations afford a certain remedy against these insects. For this purpose a
                    very small quantity of what is called mercurial ointment may be employed. At the
                    same time it ought to be recollected, that cleanliness is the best
                    preservative.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps more difficult for mankind to secure themselves and their
                    habitations from the visits of the common flea. Cleanliness may however do much
                    even in effecting this; and, in particular. It appears to us that it would be
                    extremely useful, frequently to rub up with a piece of cloth the more
                    inaccessible parts of furniture or apartments, or perhaps it would answer better
                    to employ a small hard brush. By the less accessible places, we mean the corners
                    and crevices of rooms and furniture where dust is apt to collect, and especially
                    the canvass part of a bed. We are persuaded that spirits of turpentine might
                    also be found useful for the destruction of these very troublesome insects.</p>
                <p>The Scotish myrtle (<hi rend="italic">myrica gale,</hi> Lin.) a plant very common
                    in low and moist moorish places in this country, is said to be an excellent
                    remedy, in consequence of its powerful aromatic odour, against the attacks of
                    these animals. For this purpose, the plant is strewed about the apartment or bed
                    which is infested with fleas.</p>
