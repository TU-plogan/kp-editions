                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">QUANTITY</label>, as explained by the great English
                    lexicorapher, is that property of any thing which may be increased or
                    diminished. This interpretation of the word is certainly just, and for the
                    purposes of common conversation it is sufficiently determinate; but the man of
                    science may expect to find in a work like ours a definition of the thing
                    signified. This, however, cannot be given. A logical definition consists of the
                    <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> under which the thing defined is ranked, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> difference; but quantity is ranked under no
                    genus.</p>
                <p>In that school where such definitions were most valued, it was considered as one
                    of the ten categories, or general conceptions, under which all the objects of
                    human apprehension were mustered, like soldiers in an army. On this account,
                    even Aristotle himself, who delighted in definitions, and was not easily
                    deterred from a favourite pursuit, could not, consistently with his own rules,
                    attempt to define quantity. He characterises it, however, in several parts of
                    his works, and particularly in the 15th chapter of the fourth book of his
                    Metaphysics: “Things are the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> of which the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">substance</hi> is one; <hi rend="italic">similar,</hi> of which
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">quality</hi> is one; <hi rend="italic">equal,</hi> of
                    which the <hi rend="smallcaps">quantity</hi> is one.” Again, he tells us,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">‘
                    Prnd.</hi> p. 34, edit-Sylb.</p></note> that the chief characteristic of
                    quantity is, that it may be denominated equal and unequal.</p>
                <p>That any man can become wiser by reading such descriptions as these, none but an
                    idolater of Aristotle will suppose. There is, indeed, no periphrasis by which we
                    can explain what is meant by quantity to those who have not previously formed
                    such a notion. All that can be done by making the attempt is only to settle
                    language, by stating exactly the cases in which we use this word in the greatest
                    conformity to general custom; for there is a laxness or carelessness of
                    expression in the language of most men, and our notions are frequently
                    communicated by speech in a way by no means precise; so that it is often a great
                    chance that the notions excited in the mind of the hearer are not exact
                    counterparts of those in the mind of the speaker.</p>
                <p>The understandings of men differ in nothing more remarkably than in their power
                    of abstraction, and of rapidly forming conceptions so general and simple as not
                    to be clogged with distinguishing circumstances, which may be different in
                    different minds whilst uttering and hearing the same words: and it is of great
                    consequence to a man of scientific habits, either to cultivate, if possible,
                    this talent, or to supersede its use by studiously forming to himself notions of
                    the most important universals in his own course of contemplation, by careful
                    abstraction of everything extraneous. His language by this means becomes doubly
                    instructive by its extreme precision; and he will even judge with greater
                    certainty of notions intended to be communicated by the more slovenly language
                    of another person.</p>
                <p>We cannot say that there is much ambiguity in the general use of the term
                    quantity. But here, as in all other cases, a love of refinement, of novelty, and
                    frequently of vanity, and the wish of appearing ingenious and original, have
                    made men take advantage of even the small latitude with which the careless use
                    of the word will furnish them, in order to ' .amuse themselves and the public by
                    giving the appearance of science to empty sounds.</p>
                <p>Mathematics is undoubtedly employed in discovering and stating many relations of
                    quantity; and it is in this category alone that any thing is contemplated by the
                    mathematician, whether in geometry, arithmetic, or algebra. Hence mathematics
                    have been called the science of quantity. The simplicity of the object of the
                    mathematician’s contemplation, and the unparalleled distinctiveness with which
                    he can perceive its modifications, have enabled him to erect a body of science,
                    eminent not only for its certainty, but also for the great length to which he
                    can carry his reasonings without danger of error; whilst the intimate connection
                    which this science has with the arts of life, and the important services which
                    it has performed, have procured for it a most respectable place in the circle of
                    the sciences. Ingenious men have availed themselves of this pre-eminence of
                    mathematics, and have endeavoured to procure respect for their disquisitions on
                    other subjects, by presenting them to the public as branches of mathematical
                    science, and therefore susceptible of that accuracy and certainty which form its
                    peculiar boast. Our moral affections, our sensations, our intellectual powers,
                    are all susceptible of augmentation and diminution, are conceivable as greater
                    and less when stated together, and are familiarly spoken of as admitting degrees
                    of comparison. We are perfectly well understood when we say that one pain, heat,
                    grief, kindness, is greater than another; and as this is the distinguishing
                    characteristic of quantity, and as quantity is the subject of mathematical
                    discussion, we suppose that these subjects maybe treated mathematically.
                    Accordingly, Dr Francis Hutchinson has said, amongst many things of the same
                    kind, that the greatness of a-favour is in the direct compound ratio of the
                    service performed and the dignity of the performer, and in the inverse ratio of
                    the merit and rank of the receiver; that the value of a character is in the
                    compound ratio of the talents and virtue of the possessor; and he has delivered
                    a number of formal propositions on 'the most interesting questions in morals,
                    couched <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> in this mathematical language, and even
                    expressed by algebraic formulae. But this is merely play on terms, and conveys
                    no instruction. We under stand the words; they contain no absurdity; and, in as
                    far as they have a sense, we believe the propositions to be true. But they give
                    no greater precision to our sentiments than the more usual expressions would do.
                    If we attend closely to the meaning of any one of such propositions, we shall
                    find that it only expresses some vague and indistinct notions of degrees of
                    those emotions, sentiments, or qualities, which would be just as well conceived
                    by means of the expressions of ordinary language; and that it is only by a sort
                    of analogy or resemblance that this mathematical language conveys any notions
                    whatever of the subjects.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542463" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2463-0776"/>
                <p>The object of contemplation to the mathematician is not whatever is susceptible
                    of greater and less, but what is measurable; and geometry is not the science of
                    magnitude, in its most abstracted and general acceptation, but of magnitude
                    which can be measured. It is, indeed, the Science of Measure, and whatever is
                    treated in the way of mensuration is treated mathematically. Now, in the
                    discourse of ordinary life and of ordinary men, many things are called
                    quantities which we cannot or do not measure. This is the case in the instances
                    already given of the affections of the mind, pleasure, pain, beauty, wisdom,
                    honour, and the like. We do not say that they are incapable of measure; but we
                    have not yet been able to measure them, nor do we think of measuring them when
                    we speak rationally and usefully about them. We therefore do not consider them
                    mathe- ‘matically; nor can we introduce mathematical precision into our
                    discussions of these subjects until we can, and ac-∙ tually do, measure them.
                    Persons who are precise in their expression will even avoid such phrases on
                    these subjects as suppose, or strictly express, such measurement. We should be
                    much embarrassed how to answer the question, How much pain does the toothach
                    give you just now; and how much is it easier since yesterday? Yet the answer, if
                    we had a measure of pain, would be as easy as to the question, How many guineas
                    did you win at cards? or how much land have you bought? Nay, although we say
                    familiarly, “I know well how much such a misfortune would affect you,” and are
                    understood when we say it; it would be awkward language to say, “I know well the
                    quantity of your grief.” It is in vain, therefore, to expect mathematical
                    precision in our discourse or conceptions of quantities in the most abstracted
                    sense. Such precision is confined to quantity which may be and is measured.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To talk intelligibly of the
                    quantity of a pain, we should have some standard by which to measure it; some
                    known degree of it so well ascertained, that all men, when talking of it, should
                    mean the same thing. And we should be able to compare other degrees of pain with
                    this, so as to perceive distinctly, not only whether they exceed or fall short
                    of it, but also how much, or in what proportion; whether by an half, or a fifth,
                    or a tenth.</p></note> It is only trifling with the imagination when we employ
                    mathematical language upon subjects which have not this property. It will
                    therefore be of some service in science to discriminate quantities in this view;
                    to point out what are susceptible of measure, and what are not.</p>
                <p>What is measuring? It is one of these two things: It is either finding out some
                    known magnitude of the thing measured, which we can demonstrate to be equal to
                    it; or it is finding a known magnitude of it, which being taken so many times,
                    shall be equal to it. The geometer measures the contents of a parabolic space
                    when he exhibits a parallelogram of known dimensions, and demonstrates that this
                    parallelogram is equal to the parabolic space. In like manner, he measures the
                    solid contents of an infinitely extended hyperbolic spindle, when he exhibits a
                    cone of known dimensions, and demonstrates that three of these cones are equal
                    to the spindle.</p>
                <p>In this process it will be found that he actually subdivides the quantity to be
                    measured into parts of which it consists, and states these parts as actually
                    making up the quantity, specifying each, and assigning its boundaries. He goes
                    on with it, piece by piece, demonstrating the respective equalities as he goes
                    along, till he has exhausted the figure, or considered all its parts. When he
                    measures by means of a submultiple, as when he shows the surface of a sphere to
                    be equal to four of its great circles, he stops, after having demonstrated the
                    equality of one of these circles to one part of the surface; and then he
                    demonstrates that there are other three parts, each of which is precisely equal
                    to the one he has minutely considered. In this part of the process he expressly
                    assigns the whole surface into its distinct portions, of which he demonstrates
                    the equality.</p>
                <p>But there is another kind of geometrical measurement, which proceeds on a very
                    different principle. The geometer conceives a certain individual portion of his
                    figure, whether line, angle, surface, or solid, as known in respect to its
                    dimensions. He conceives this to be lifted from its place, and again laid down
                    on the adjoining part of the figure, and that it is equal to the part which it
                    now covers; and therefore that this part, together with the first, is double of
                    the first. He lifts it again, and lays it down on the next adjoining part, and
                    affirms that this, added to the two former, make up a quantity triple of the
                    first. He goes on in this way, making similar inferences, till he can
                    demonstrate that he has in this manner covered the whole figure by twenty
                    applications, and that his moveable figure will cover no more; and he affirms
                    that the figure is twenty times the part employed.</p>
                <p>This mode is precisely similar to the manner of practical measurement in common
                    life. We apply a foot-rule successively to two lines, and find that thirty
                    applications exhaust the one, whilst it requires thirty-five to exhaust the
                    other. We say, therefore, that the one line is thirty and the other thirty·five
                    feet long; and that these two lines are to each other in the ratio of thirty to
                    thirty-five. Having measured two shorter lines by a similar application of a
                    stick an inch in length, thirty times to the one and thirty-five to the other,
                    we say that the ratio of the two first lines is the same with that of the two
                    last. Euclid has taken this method of demonstrating the fourth proposition of
                    the first book of his celebrated Elements.</p>
                <p>But all this process is a fiction of the mind, and it is the fiction of an
                    impossibility: It is even inconceivcable, that is, we cannot in imagination make
                    this application of one figure to another; and we presume to say, that if the
                    elements of geometry cannot be demonstrated in some other way, the science has
                    not that title to pure, abstract, and infallible knowledge which is usually
                    allowed it. We cannot suppose one of the triangles lifted and laid on the other,
                    without supposing it something different from a triangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">abstracto.</hi> The individuality of such a triangle
                    consists solely in its being in the precise place where it is, and in occupying
                    that portion of space. If we could distinctly conceive otherwise, we should
                    perceive that, when we have lifted the triangle from its place, and applied it
                    to the other, it is gone from its former place, and that there is no longer a
                    triangle there. This is inconceivable, and space has always been acknowledged to
                    be immoveable. There is, therefore, some logical defect in Euclid’s
                    demonstration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We do not
                    think so. The demonstration of this and of several other propositions, which
                    form the basis of all the subsequent reasonings of Euclid, rests upon, and, in
                    fact, is nothing more than an appeal to observation, though of the simplest
                    kind; and hence there is no radical or essential distinction between
                    mathematical evidence, and that which we have in the physical sciences, the only
                    difference being that the former proceeds on observations so simple as almost to
                    escape our notice.</p></note> We apprehend that he is labouring to demonstrate,
                    or rather illustrate, a simple apprehension. This indeed is the utmost that can
                    be done in any demonstration; but the mode by which he guides the mind to the
                    apprehension of the truth of his fourth proposition is not consistent either
                    with pure mathematics or with the laws of corporeal nature. The real process, as
                    laid down by him, seems to be this. We suppose something different from the
                    abstract triangle; something that, in conjunction with other properties, has the
                    property of being triangular, with certain dimensions of two of its sides and
                    the included angle. It has avowedly another property, not essential to, and not
                    contained in, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542476" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2476-0777"
                    />the abstract notion of a triangle, namely, mobility. We also suppose it
                    permanent in shape and dimensions, or that although, during its motion, it does
                    not occupy the same space, it continues, and so do all its parts, to occupy an
                    equal Space. In short, our conception is very mixed, and does not perceptibly
                    differ from our conception of a triangular piece of matter, where the triangle
                    is not the subject, but an adjunct, a quality. And when we suppose the
                    application made, we are not, in fact, supposing two abstract triangles to
                    coincide. This we cannot do with anything like distinctness; for our distinct
                    conception now is, not that of two triangles coinciding, but of one triangle
                    being now exactly occupied by that moveable thing which formerly occupied the
                    other. In short, it is a vulgar measurement, restricted by suppositions which
                    are inadmissible in all actual measurements in the present universe, in which no
                    moveable material thing is known to be permanent, either in shape or
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>This is an undeniable consequence of the principle of universal gravitation, and
                    the compressibility of every kind of tangible matter with which we are
                    acquainted. Remove the brass rule but one inch from its place; its gravitation
                    to the earth and to the rest of the universe is immediately changed, and its
                    dimensions change of consequence. A change of temperature will produce a similar
                    effect; and this is attended to and considered in all nice mensurations. We do
                    the best we can to assure ourselves that our rule always occupies a sensibly
                    equal space; and we must be contented with chances of error which we can neither
                    perceive nor remove.</p>
                <p>Were this a proper place, we might take notice of some other logical defects in
                    the reasoning of this celebrated proposition. But they are beside our present
                    purpose of explaining the different modes of mathematical measurement, with the
                    view of discovering that circumstance in which they all agree, and which, if the
                    only one, must therefore be the characteristic of mensuration.</p>
                <p>We think that the only circumstance in which all modes of mensuration agree, or
                    the only notion that is found in them all, is, that the quantity is conceived as
                    consisting of parts, distinguishable from each other, and separated by
                    assignable boundaries; so that they are at once conceived separately and
                    jointly. We venture to assert that no quantity is directly measured which we
                    cannot conceive in this way, and that such quantities only are the immediate
                    objects of mathematical contemplation, and should be distinguished by a generic
                    name. Let them be called mathematical quantities. Extension, duration, number,
                    and proportion, have this characteristic, and they are the only quantities which
                    have it. Any person will be convinced of the first assertion by attending to his
                    own thoughts when contemplating these notions. He will find that he conceives
                    every one of them as made up of its own parts, which are distinguishable from
                    each other, and have assignable boundaries, and that it is only in consequence
                    of involving this conception that they can be added to or subtracted from each
                    other; that they can be multiplied, divided, and conceived, in any proportion to
                    each other.</p>
                <p>He may perhaps find considerable difficulty in acquiring perfectly distinct
                    notions of the men sur ability, and the accuracy of the modes of mensuration. He
                    will find that the way in which he measures duration is very similar to that in
                    which he measures space or extension. He does not know, or does not attend to,
                    anything which hinders the brass foot-rule in his hand from continuing to occupy
                    equal spaces during his use of it in measuring the distance of two bodies. In
                    like manner, he selects an event which nature or art can .repeat continually,
                    and in which the circumstances which contribute to its accomplishment are
                    invariably the same, or their variations and their effects are insensible. He
                    concludes that it will always occupy an equal portion of time for its
                    accomplishment, or always last an equal time. Then, observing that, during the
                    event whose duration he wishes to measure, this standard event is accomplished
                    twenty-nine and a half times, and that it is repeated 365½ times during the
                    accomplishment of another event, he affirms that the durations of these are in
                    the ratio of twenty-nine and a half to 365½. It is thus, and with the same
                    logical defect as in the measuring a line by means of a brass rod, that the
                    astronomer measures the celestial revolutions by means of the rotation of the
                    earth round its axis, or by the vibrations of a pendulum.</p>
                <p>For most of the preceding observations we have been indebted to Dr Reid, who
                    published a dissertation on this subject in the forty-fifth volume of the
                    Philosophical Transactions, which we recommend to our philosophical readers as a
                    performance eminent for precision and acuteness. If we presume to differ from
                    him in any trivial circumstance, it is with that deference and respect which all
                    must consider as due to his talents and his fame.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid justly observes, that as nothing has proportion which has not either
                    extension, duration, or number, so the characters of mathematical quantity may
                    be restricted to these three. He calls them <hi rend="italic">proper</hi>
                    quantities, and all others he calls <hi rend="italic">improper.</hi> We believe
                    that, in the utmost precision of the English language, this denomination is very
                    apposite, and that the word <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi> derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">quantum,</hi> always supposes measurement. But the word is
                    frequently used in cases where its original sense is not kept in view, and we
                    use other words as synonymous with it, when all mensuration, whether possible or
                    not, is out of our thoughts. According to practice, therefore, the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">norma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">loquendi,</hi> there seems to be no impropriety in giving this
                    name, in our language at least, to whatever can be conceived as great or as
                    little. There is no impropriety in saying that the pain occasioned by the stone
                    is greater than that of the toothach; and when we search for the category to
                    which the assertion may be referred, we cannot find any other than quantity. We
                    may be allowed therefore to say, with almost all our scientific countrymen, that
                    everything is conceivable in respect of quantity which we can think or speak of
                    as greater and less; and that this notion is the characteristic of quantity as a
                    genus, whilst measιιrableness is the characteristic of mathematical quantity as
                    a species..</p>
                <p>But do we not measure many quantities, and consider them mathematically, which
                    have not this characteristic of being made up of their own distinguishable
                    parts? What else is the employment of the mechanician, when speaking of
                    velocities, forces, attractions, repulsions, magnetical influence, chemical
                    affinity, and the like? Are not these mathematical sciences? And if the
                    precision and certainty of mathematics arise from the nature of their specific
                    object, are not all the claims of the mechanician and physical astronomer
                    ill-founded pretensions? These questions require and deserve a serious
                    answer.</p>
                <p>It is most certain that we consider the notions which are expressed by these
                    terms, velocity, force, density, and the like, as susceptible of measure, and we
                    consider them mathematically. Some of these terms are nothing but names for
                    relations of measurable quantity, and only require a little reflection to show
                    themselves such. <hi rend="italic">Velocity</hi> is one of these. It is only a
                    name expressing a relation between the space described by a moving body and the
                    time which elapses during its description. Certain moderate rates of motion are
                    familiar to us. But what greatly exceeds this, such as the flight of a bird when
                    compared with our walking, excites our attention, and this excess gets a name. A
                    motion not so rapid as we arc familiar with, or as we wish, also gets a name,
                    because in this the excess or defect may interest us. We wish for the flight of
                    the hawk; we chide the tardy pace of our messenger; but it is scientific
                    curiosity which first considers this relation as a separate object of
                    contemplation, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542489" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2489-0778"
                    />and the philosopher must have a name for it. He has not formed a new one, but
                    he makes use of a word of common language, the natural meaning of which is the
                    combination of a great space with a short time. The philosopher having once
                    appropriated it, in his scientific vocabulary, to this very general use, it
                    loses with him its true signification. Tardiness would have done just as well,
                    though its true meaning is diametrically opposite; and there is no greater
                    impropriety in saying the slowness of a cannon-bullet than in saying the
                    velocity of the hour-hand of a watch. Velocity is a quality or affection of
                    motion, the notion of which includes the notions of space and duration, two
                    mathematical quantities, and no other. It does not therefore express a
                    mathematical quantity itself, but a relation, a combination of two mathematical
                    quantities of different kinds; and as it is measurable in the quantities so
                    combined, its measure must be an unit of its own kind, that is, an unit of space
                    as combined with an unit of time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Density</hi> is another word of the same kind, expressing a
                    combination of space with number. ’ <hi rend="italic">Densae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arbores</hi> mean trees standing at a small distance from each
                    other; and the word is used in the same sense when we say that quicksilver is
                    denser than water. The expression always suggests to the reflecting mind the
                    notions of particles and their distances. We are indeed so habituated to
                    complicated views of things, that we can see remote connections with astonishing
                    rapidity; and a very few circumstances are sufficient for leading forward the
                    mind in a train of investigation. Common discourse is a most wonderful instance
                    of this. In this way we say, that we found by actually weighing them that
                    inflammable air had not the sixth part of the density of common air. Supposing
                    all matter to consist of equal atoms equally heavy, and knowing that the weight
                    of a bladder of air is the sum of the weights of all the atoms, and also knowing
                    that the vicinity of the atoms is in a certain proportion of the number
                    contained in a given bulk, we affirm that common air is more than six times
                    denser than inflammable air; but this rapid decision is entirely the effect of
                    habit, which renders us familiar with certain groups of conceptions, and we
                    instantaneously distinguish them from others, and thus think and discourse
                    rationally. The Latin language employs the word <hi rend="italic">frequens</hi>
                    to express both the combination of space and number, and that of time and
                    number.</p>
                <p>There are perhaps a few more words which express combinations of mathematical
                    quantities of different kinds; and the corresponding ideas or notions are
                    therefore the proper and immediate subjects of mathematical discussion. But
                    there are many words which are expressive of things, or at least of notions, to
                    which this way of considering them will not apply. All those affections or
                    qualities of external bodies, by which they are conceived to act on each other,
                    are of this kind; impulsive force, weight, centripetal and centrifugal force,
                    magnctical, electrical, chemical attractions and repulsions, in short, all that
                    we consider as the immediate causes of natural phenomena. These we familiarly
                    measure, and consider mathematically.</p>
                <p>What was said on this subject in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics</hi>
                    will give us clear conceptions of this process of the mind. These forces or
                    causes are not immediate objects of contemplation, and are known only by and in
                    the phenomena which we consider as their effects. The phenomenon is not only the
                    indication of the agency of any cause, and the characteristic of its kind, but
                    the measure of its degree. The necessary circumstances in this train of human
                    thought are, 1st, The notion of the force as something susceptible of
                    augmentation and diminution; and, 2d, The notion of an inseparable connection of
                    the force with the effect produced, and of every degree of the one with a
                    corresponding degree of the other. From these is formed the notion that the
                    phenomenon or effect is the proper measure of the force or cause. All this is
                    strictly logical.</p>
                <p>But when we are considering these subjects mathematically, the immediate objects
                    of our contemplation are not the forces which we are thus treating. It is not
                    their relations which we perceive, and which we combine with such complication
                    of circumstances and certainty of inference as are known in all other sciences.
                    By no means; they are the phenomena only, which are subjects of purely
                    mathematical discussion. They are motions which involve only the notions of
                    space and time; and when we have finished an accurate mathematical
                    investigation, and make our affirmation concerning the forces, we are certain of
                    its truth, because we suppose the forces to have the proportions and relations,
                    and no other, which we observe in the phenomena. Thus, after having
                    demonstrated, by the geometrical comparison of the lines and angles and surfaces
                    of an ellipse, that the momentary deflection of the moon from the tangent of her
                    orbit is the 3600th part of the simultaneous deflection of a stone from the
                    tangent of its parabolic path, Newton affirms, that the force by which a
                    particle of the moon is retained in her orbit is the 3600th part of the weight
                    of a particle of the stone; and having further shown, from fact and observation,
                    that these momentary deflections are inversely as the squares of the distances
                    from the centre of the earth, he affirms that all this is produced by a force
                    which varies its intensity in this manner.</p>
                <p>Now all this investigation proceeds upon the two suppositions mentioned above,
                    and the measures of the forces are in fact the measures of the phenomena. The
                    whole of physical astronomy, and indeed the whole of mechanical philosophy,
                    might be taught and understood, without ever introducing the word force, or the
                    notion which it is supposed to express; for our mathematical reasonings are
                    really about the phenomena, which are subjects purely mathematical.</p>
                <p>The precision, therefore, which we presume to affirm must attend these
                    investigations, arises entirely from the measurable nature of the quantities
                    that are the real objects of our contemplation, and the suitableness and
                    propriety of the measures which we adopt in our comparisons.</p>
                <p>Since, then, the phenomena are the immediate subjects of our discussion, and the
                    operating powers are only infe&gt;- rences from the phenomena considered as
                    effects, the quantity ascribed to them must also be an inference from the
                    quantity of the effect, or of some circumstance in the effect. The measure,
                    therefore, of the cause, or natural power or force, cannot be one of its own
                    parts; for the whole and the part are equally unperceived by us. Our measure,
                    accordingly, must be a measure of some interesting part, or of the only
                    interesting part of the phenomenon. It is therefore in a manner arbitrary, and
                    depends chiefly on the interest we take in the phenomenon. It must, however, be
                    settled with precision, so that all men in using it may mean the same thing. It
                    must be settled, therefore, by the description of that part or circumstance of
                    the phenomenon which is characteristic of the natural power. This description is
                    the definition of the measure.</p>
                <p>Thus Newton assumes as the measure of his centripetal force, the momentary
                    deviation from uniform rectilineal motion. Others, and sometimes Newton himself,
                    assume the momentary change of velocity, which again is measured by twice this
                    deviation. These measures, being thus selected, are always proper in a
                    mathematical sense, and, if strictly adhered to, can never lead us into any
                    paralogism. They may, however, be physically wrong. There may not be that
                    indissoluble connection between the phenomenon and the supposed cause. But this
                    is no mathematical error, nor does it invalidate any of our mathematical
                    inferences. It only makes them useless for explaining the phenomenon by the
                    principle which we adopted; but it prepares a modification of the phenomenon for
                    some more fortunate application of physical principles.</p>
                <p>All that can be desired in the definitions or descriptions <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193542502" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2502-0779"/>of these measures is, that
                    they may not deviate from the ordinary use of the terms, because this would
                    always create confusion and occasion mistakes. Dr Reid has given an example of
                    an impropriety of this kind, which has been the subject of much debate amongst
                    the writers on natural philosophy; we mean the measure of the force inherent in
                    a body in motion.</p>
                <p>Descartes, and all the writers of his time, assumed the velocity produced in a
                    body as the measure of the force which produces it; and observing that a body,
                    in consequence of its being in motion, produces changes in the state or motion
                    of other bodies, and that these changes are in the proportion of the velocity of
                    the changing body, they asserted that there is in a moving body a <hi
                    rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> an
                    <hi rend="italic">inherent force,</hi> and that this is proportional to its
                    velocity; saying that its force is twice or thrice as great, when it moves twice
                    or thrice as fast at one time as at another. But Leibnitz observed, that a body
                    which moves twice as fast rises four times as high, against the uniform action
                    of gravity; that it penetrates four times as deep into a piece of uniform clay;
                    that it bends four times as many springs, or a spring four times as strong, to
                    the same degree; and produces a great many effects which are four times greater
                    than those produced by a body which has but half the initial velocity. If the
                    velocity be triple, quadruple, &amp;c. the effects are nine times, sixteen
                    times, &amp;c. greater; and, in short, are proportional, not to the velocity,
                    but to its square. This observation had been made before by Dr Hooke, who
                    enumerated a prodigious variety of important cases in which this proportion of
                    effect is observed. Leibnitz, therefore, affirmed that the force inherent in a
                    moving body is proportional to the square of the velocity.</p>
                <p>It is evident that a body, moving with the same velocity, has the same inherent
                    force, whether this be employed to move another body, to bend springs, to rise
                    in opposition to gravity, or to penetrate a mass of soft matter. Therefore these
                    measures, which are so widely different, whilst each is agreeable to a numerous
                    class of facts, are not measures of this something inherent in the moving body
                    which we call its force, but are the measures of its exertions when modified
                    according to the circumstances of the case; or, to speak still more cautiously
                    and securely, they are the measures of certain classes of phenomena consequent
                    upon the jaction of a moving body. It is in vain, therefore, to attempt to
                    support either of them by a demonstration. The measure itself is nothing but a
                    definition. The Cartesian calls that a double force which produces a double
                    velocity in the body upon which it acts. The Leibnitzian calls that a quadruple
                    force which makes a quadruple penetration. The reasonings of both in the
                    demonstration of a proposition in dynamics may be the same, as also the result,
                    though expressed in different numbers.</p>
                <p>But the two measures are far from being equally proper; for the Leibnitzian
                    measure obliges us to do continual violence to the ordinary use of words. When
                    two bodies moving in opposite directions meet, strike each other, and stop, all
                    men will say that their forces are equal, because they have the best test of
                    equality which we can devise. Or when two bodies in motion strike the parts of a
                    machine, such as the opposite arms of a lever, and are thus brought completely
                    to rest, we and all men will pronounce their mutual energies by the intervention
                    of the machine to be equal. Now, in all these cases, it is well known that a
                    perfect equality is found in the products of the quantities of matter and
                    velocity. Thus a ball of two pounds, moving with the velocity of four feet in a
                    second, will stop a ball of eight pounds moving with the velocity of one foot
                    per second. But the followers of Leibnitz say that the force of the first ball
                    is four times that of the second.</p>
                <p>All parties are agreed in calling gravity an uniform or invariable accelerating
                    force; and the definition which they give of such a force is, that it always
                    produces the same acceleration, that is, equal accelerations in equal times, and
                    therefore produces augmentations of velocity proportional to the times in which
                    they are produced. The only effect ascribed to this force, and consequently the
                    only thing which indicates, characterises, and measures it, is the augmentation
                    of velocity. What is this velocity, considered not merely as a mathematical
                    term, but as a phenomenon, or as an event produced by the operation of a natural
                    cause? It cannot be conceived any other way than as a determination to move on
                    for ever at a certain rate, if nothing shall change it. We cannot conceive this
                    very clearly. We feel ourselves forced to animate, as it were, the body, and
                    give it not only a will and intention to move in this manner, but a real
                    exertion of some faculty in consequence of this determination of mind. We are
                    conscious of such a train of operations in ourselves; and the last step of this
                    train is the exertion or energy of some natural faculty, which we, in the utmost
                    propriety of language, call force. By such analogical conception, we suppose a
                    something, an energy, inherent in the moving body; and its only office is the
                    production and continuation of this motion, as in our own case. Scientific
                    curiosity was amongst our latest wants, and language was formed long before its
                    appearance. As we formed analogical conceptions, we contented ourselves with the
                    words already familiar to us, and to this something we gave the name <hi
                    rend="italic">force,</hi> which expressed that energy in ourselves which bears
                    some resemblance, in office at least, to the determination of a body to move on
                    at a certain rate. This sort of allegory pervades the whole of our conceptions
                    of natural operations, and we can hardly think or speak of any operation without
                    a language, which supposes the animation of matter. And in the present case
                    there are so many points of resemblance between the effects of our exertions and
                    the operations of nature, that the language is most expressive, and has the
                    strongest appearance of propriety. By exerting our force we not only move and
                    keep in motion, but we move other bodies. In like manner, a ball not only moves,
                    but puts other bodies in motion, or penetrates them. This is the origin of that
                    conception which so forcibly intrudes itself into our thoughts, that there is
                    inherent in a moving body a force by which it produces changes in other bodies.
                    No such thing appears in the same body if it be not in motion. We therefore
                    conclude that it is the production of the moving force, whatever that has been.
                    If so, it must be conceived as proportional to its producing cause. Now this
                    force, thus produced or exerted in the moving body, is only another way of
                    conceiving that determination which we call velocity, when it is conceived as a
                    natural event. We can form no other notion of it. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita,</hi> the determination to move at a certain
                    rate, and the velocity, are one and th¢ same thing, considered in different
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Therefore the <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita corpori
                    moventi,</hi> the determination to move at a certain rate, and the velocity,
                    should have one and the same measure, or any one of them may be taken as the
                    measure of the other. The velocity being an object of perception, is therefore a
                    proper measure of the inherent force; and the propriety is more evidenf by the
                    perfect agreement of this use of the words with common language. For we conceive
                    and express the action of gravity as uniform, when we think and say that its
                    effects are proportional to the times of its action. Now afl agree that the
                    velocity produced by gravity is proportional to the time of its action. And thus
                    the measure of force, in reference to its producing cause, perfectly agrees with
                    its measure, independent of this consideration. But this agreement is totally
                    lost in the Leibnitzian doctrine; for the body which has fallen four times as
                    far, and has sustained the action of gravity twice as long, is said to have four
                    times the force.</p>
                <p>The quaintness and the continued paradox of expression <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193542515" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2515-0780"/>which this measure of
                    inherent force leads us into, would have quickly exploded it, had it not been
                    that its chief abettors were leagued in a keen and acrimonious warfare with the
                    British mathematicians who supported the claim of Sir Isaac Newton to the
                    invention of fluxions. They rejoiced to find in the elegant writings of Huygens
                    a physical principle of great extent, such as this, which could be set in
                    comparison with some of the wonderful discoveries in Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia.</hi> The fact, that in the mutual action of bodies on each other the
                    product of the masses and the squares of the velocities remain always the same,
                    which • they call the <hi rend="italic">conservatio virium vivarum,</hi> is of
                    almost uni- ' versal extent; and the knowledge of it enabled them to give ready
                    and elegant solutions of the most abstruse and intricate problems, by which they
                    acquired a great and deserved celebrity. Dr Robert Hooke, whose observation
                    hardly anything escaped, was the first who remarked,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>AIicτοgraρl.iα, us restiiuth∙a, &amp;c. in
                    his Posthumous Works.</p></note> long before Huygens, that in all the cases of
                    the gradual production and extinction of motion, the sensible phenomenon ^is
                    proportional to the square of the produced or extinguished velocity.</p>
                <p>John Bernoulli brought all these facts together, and systematized them according
                    to the principle advanced by Huygens in his treatise on the centre of
                    oscillation. He and Daniel Bernoulli gave most beautiful specimens of the
                    prodigious use of this principle for the solution of difficult physical
                    problems, in their dissertations on the motion and impulse of fluids, and on the
                    communication of motion. It was, however, very early objected to them, that in
                    the collision of bodies perfectly hard there was no such <hi rend="italic"
                    >conservatio virium vivarum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that in this case
                    the forces must be acknowledged to be proportional to the velocities. The
                    objections were unanswerable. But John Bernoulli evaded their force, by
                    affirming that there were not and could not be bodies perfectly hard. This was
                    the origin of another celebrated doctrine, on which Leibnitz greatly plumed
                    himself; namely, the law of continuity, that nothing is observed to change
                    abruptly, or <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum.</hi> But no one
                    will pre- ^tend to say that a perfectly hard body is an inconceivable thing; on
                    the contrary, all will allow that softness and compressibility are adjunct
                    ideas, and not in the least necessary to the conception of a particle of matter,
                    nay totally incompatible with our notion of an ultimate atom.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton never could be provoked to engage in this dispute. He always
                    considered it as a wilful abuse of words, and unworthy of his attention. He
                    guarded against all possibility of cavil, by giving the most precise and
                    perspicuous definitions of those measures of forces, and of all other quantities
                    which be had occasion to consider, and by carefully adhering to them. And in one
                    proposition of about twenty lines, namely, the thirty-ninth of the first book of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> he explained every phenomenon adduced in
                    support of the Leibnitzian doctrine, showing them to be the immediate
                    consequences of the action of a force measured by the velocity which it produces
                    or extinguishes. There it appears that the heights to which bodies will rise in
                    opposition to the uniform action of gravity are as the squares of the initial
                    velocities; so are the depths to which they will penetrate uniformly resisting
                    matter, and so is the number of equal springs which they will bend to the same
                    degree. We have had frequent occasion to mention this proposition as the most
                    extensively useful of all Newton’s discoveries. It is that which gives the
                    immediate application of mechanical principles to the explanation of natural
                    phenomena. It is incessantly employed in every problem by the very persons who
                    hold by the other measure of forces, although such conduct is virtually giving
                    up that measure. They all adopt, in every investigation, the two theorems <hi
                    rend="italic">f t = V,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f s — w</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> both of which suppose an accelerating force <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    proportional to the velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> which it produces by its
                    uniform action during the time <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> and the thèo-</p>
                <p>Tem <hi rend="italic">f s-d</hi> ’ is the thirty-ninth of the first book of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and is the <hi rend="italic">conservatio
                    virium vivarum.</hi></p>
                <p>This famous dispute, the only one in the circle of mathematical science, has led
                    us somewhat aside. But we have little more to remark with respect to measurable
                    quantity. We cannot say what varieties of quantity are susceptible of strict
                    measure, or that it is impossible to give accurate measures of everything
                    susceptible of augmentation and diminution. We affirm, however, with confidence,
                    that pain, pleasure, joy, and the like, are not made up of their own parts,
                    which can be contemplated separately; but they may chance to be associated by
                    nature with something that is measurable, and we may one day be able to assign
                    their degrees with as much precision as we now ascertain the degrees of warmth
                    by the expansion of the fluid in the thermometer. There is one sense in which
                    they may all be measured, viz. numerically, as Newton measures density, <hi
                    rend="italic">vis matrix,</hi> and so forth. We can conceive the pain of each of
                    a dozen of men to be the same. Then it is evident that the pain of eight of
                    these men is to that of the remaining four as two to one; but from such
                    mensuration we do not foresee that any benefit is likely to arise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Quantity,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> is an
                    affection of a syllabic, by which its measure, or the time it occupies in
                    pronunciation, is ascertained; or that which determines the syllable to be long
                    or short.</p>
                <p>Quantity is also the object of prosody, and distinguishes verse from prose;
                    whilst the economy and arrangement of quantities, that is, the distribution of

                <p>Quantities are usually distinguished amongst grammarians by the characters of

                    syllables which are at one time taken for short, and at another time for long
                    ones.</p>
