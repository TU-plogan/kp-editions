                    the three republics of South America which formerly constituted Colombia.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the year 1831, the
                    republic then called Colombia separated into three independent states, the names
                    of which are NeAv Granada, Venezuela, and the Equator or Quito. The limits of
                    each state have not been accurately settled, but an arrangement as to the amount
                    of the national debt which was to fall to the share of each was completed at
                    Bogota on the 23d of December 1834.</p></note> Its territory chiefly comprehends
                    the ancient Spanish viceroyalty of Quito, extending from 2° of north to 6° of
                    south latitude, and from 76° 30' to 80° 40' of west longitude. Its limits,
                    however, in the direction of Brazil have not been definitely fixed, so that it
                    may extend to the east considerably beyond 76° 30'. On the south it borders upon
                    Peru and Brazil; the latter country forms its eastern boundary; on the north its
                    limits arc Nexv Granada; and the whole of its territory on the west is washed by
                    the Pacific Ocean. Quito is intersected by both chains of the Andes, and
                    consequently presents great diversity of surface and of climate. These parallel
                    mountain ranges, by uniting at Loxa, at Asuay, at Chisinche, and at Los Pastos,
                    constitute what have been called mountain knots; and again opening up, they form
                    the table-lands of Cuenca, Hambato, and Quito. The circles of snow-covered
                    mountains by which they are surrounded have a feAv passes opening to the west
                    coast, or to the low plains on the east; but they are so rugged and wild as to
                    be scarcely practicable. These elevated valleys, although immediately under the
                    equator, yet, on account of their great height, enjoy a climate in the highest
                    degree mild, and a temperature which seldom varies. They are extremely fruitful,
                    and would be the most charming places in the world, were it not for the
                    destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which are not unfrequently
                    experienced. There are in Quito sixteen volcanoes, which, although they
                    discharge no lava, often throw up immense quantities of ashes, Avater, sludge,
                    and fragments of rocks, along with columns of smokc and flame; and these
                    eruptions are always accompanied by undulations of the earth. From the line to
                    1° 41' of south latitude, stretching from-north to south in the eastern portion
                    of the valley of Quito, are Cato-cache, 15,402 feet; Cayambe Urcu, 18,330 feet;
                    Antisana, 17,958 feet; Sinchulahua, 15,420 feet; and Cotopaxi, 17,712 feet above
                    the level of the sea. In the west of the same valley are situated Pinchincha,
                    15,036 feet; Corazon, 14,820 feet; and Yliniza, 16,302 feet in height. In the
                    second group, under 1° of south latitude, lying in a direction from north to
                    south, are the volcanoes of Carguirazo, 14,700 feet, and Chimborazo, 20,158
                    feet, above the level of the Pacific. The latter mountain is usually covered
                    with snow and ice, 4800 feet below the summit. In the vicinity of these, and
                    about 16,000 feet in height, are the volcanoes of Tunguragua, Capac Urcu, and
                    Sangai. But the most formidable of them all is Cotopaxi, the rocks thrown up by
                    which Avould of themselves form a mountain chain of no inconsiderable size. Its
                    eruptions have been numerous and destructive. In the year 1738 it projected
                    upAvards a column of fire nearly three thousand feet in height. In 1744 the
                    subterranean sounds which it gave forth were heard at a distance of six hundred
                    miles. One of the most frightful earthquakes which ever took place in this
                    region, unhappily too celebrated for such visitations, was that of 1797, in
                    which a tract of country one hundred and thirty miles in length by one hundred
                    miles in breadth moved in undulatory billows like a stormy sea; many towns and
                    villages Avere overthrown, and forty thousand human beings perished in a
                    moment.</p>
                <p>The mountain chain of the Andes throws out a number of lateral ridges to the
                    east, the country gradually subsiding into a vast plain extending along both
                    sides of the Marañon, covered with majestic forests, and watered by innumerable
                    streams. A number of rivers descend the Avestcm declivities of the Andes, and
                    flow into the Pacific Ocean; others join the large streams of Cauca and
                    Magdalena on the north; and the most important class consists of those that are
                    tributaries of the Rio Negro and Marañon, which last river forms the boundary of
                    the republic on the south. A portion of the territory of Quito on the east and
                    northeast is watered by the Orinoco. Into this river fall the Atabapo and
                    Guaviare, which at the same time form the line of separation between
                    Cundinamarca and this republic. The Putumayo, Napo, Tigre, Pastaza, Marona, and
                    Rio St Jago, Avhich are large streams, besides many others of inferior note, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193542736" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2736-0797"/> all of which flow
                    from the north-west to the south-east, fall into the Amazons, and irrigate the
                    flat eastern territory of Quito. The Andes of Quito also contain lakes of no
                    inconsiderable dimensions, amongst which may be mentioned those of San Pablo and
                    Cuieocha. In the level land on the east, many of the streams form lagunes during
                    part of their course.</p>
                <p>Many of the ravines, quebradas, and valleys of Quito have a very warm atmosphere;
                    indeed, in some parts the heat is so oppressive as to render them uninhabitable.
                    Other valleys which are more elevated are remarkably healthy, extremely
                    productive, and delightful as places of residence. The valley of Quito is
                    allowed to be the finest table-land in all America. It is enclosed, as we have
                    said, between the two parallel ranges of the loftiest Andes, having an average
                    breadth of thirty miles, but extending longitudinally much farther. In soil and
                    climate it possesses every advantage. The climate is remarkably equable and
                    agreeable; the indication of winter being the fall of rain, and the absence of
                    rain marking the summer. The temperature is so benign that vegetation never
                    ceases, the country all around the city of Quito exhibiting the beauty of
                    perpetual spring. Hence it has been called <hi rend="italic">sismpre verde</hi>
                    Quito, and also <hi rend="italic">eterna primavera,</hi> both which epithets it
                    may be said to deserve; for its native trees are all evergreens, and the fields
                    on the slopes of the mountains never lose their verdure. The European sees with
                    astonishment the plough and the sickle at once in equal activity; the green
                    blade of grain and the yellow ear waving in the same breeze; one flower
                    drooping, and its companion just beginning to “dedicate its beauty to the sun.”
                    In short, here the seasons of spring, summer, and autumn all go on at once, and
                    the tints and varied beauties peculiar to each blend together in the same
                    landscape. Mr Stevenson draws a glowing picture of these delightful valleys.
                    They are, he says, “principally under cultivation, and bless the husbandman with
                    a continued succession of crops; for the uninterrupted sameness of the climate
                    in any spot is such as to preclude the plant as well as the fruit from being
                    damaged by sudden changes in the temperature of the atmosphere, changes which
                    are in other countries so detrimental to the health of the vegetable world. The
                    fertility of some of these valleys exceeds all credibility, and the veracity of
                    the description would be doubted, did not the knowledge of their localities, and
                    the universal descriptions of the equability and benignity of these climates,
                    insure the probability. One of these, called Pomasqui, is about five leagues
                    from Quito, where sugar-cane arrives at a state of maturity in three years, and
                    where many of the intertropical fruits attain the greatest perfection. This
                    luxury is enhanced by the proximity of other situations possessing all the
                    variety of climates known in the world. In the course of three hours a person
                    may experience the rigidity of the poles, the oppressive heat of the equator,
                    and all the intermediate temperatures.”</p>
                <p>An enumeration of all the different vegetable productions of this remarkable
                    region is rendered unnecessary by the general view here given. It is sufficient
                    to state, that grain, pulse, fruits, esculents, and horticultural vegetables arc
                    produced in the greatest abundance, and of an excellent quality, as well as all
                    kinds of buteher∙ meat and poultry. The breeding of cattle and sheep, especially
                    the latter, is extensively carried on in the high valleys. Excellent timber,
                    fitted for ship or house building, and for every purpose of the cabinet-maker,
                    abounds in many districts of the country. The soil is for the most part so
                    productive of everything which usually occupies the attention of the husbandman
                    and farmer, that butter, cheese, wax, mules, oxen, Peruvian bark, eacao, cotton,
                    tobacco, grain, and other staples, form important exports. Sugar, wine, coffee,
                    molasses, rum, and other spirits, are also amongst the products.</p>
                <p>Gold and silver are comprised in the metallic riches of the mountain territory.
                    Some manufactures are carried on in different places.</p>
                <p>According to the new constitution, this republic consists of the following
                    provinces, viz. Quito, Chimborazo, Imbabnra, Guayaquil, Monabi, Cuença, Loja del
                    Arehipelago, and Ga-lopagos or Turtle Island.</p>
                <p>Quito, the capital of the republic, is one of the finest and largest cities in
                    the New World. It was founded iñ the year 1534, by Sebastian Benalcasar, with
                    the dedicatory title of San Francisco, and in 1541 was created a city by Charles
                    V. It stands in a ravine, at an elevation of more than 9000 feet above the level
                    of the sea, in longitude 78° 45' 17" west from Greenwich, and in latitude 0° 13'
                    17" south. The mountain of Pinehincha lies on its west side, and on the east
                    there is a range of hills called Chimbaealle. To the south is the plain of
                    Turupampa or⅛Turubamba, and to the north the plain of Anaquito, generally called
                    Egido. The streets, which run north and south, stand on a pretty level plain,
                    and are broad, handsome, and well paved; but those which cross them and climb
                    the skirts of Pinehincha, descending on the east side of the city towards the
                    small river of Ma-changara, are erooked and irregular. Quito has two
                    universities, and it has always enjoyed celebrity for the great number of
                    students by whom they are attended. There are a number of other seminaries of
                    education in this city; indeed it is considered as comparatively a sort of
                    American Athens. It is the seat of the congress, the president, and the highest
                    offices of state, and enjoys a very extensive trade in cotton, silk, leather,
                    gold, and silver. The commerce of Quito may be conveniently divided into two
                    kinds, that of home and that of foreign manufactures. The former consists of
                    cotton and woollen cloths, baizes, sugars, flannels, pouches, and other minor
                    articles. The stock of foreign goods is composed of all kinds of European
                    manufactures, including those of iron, steel, and some other raw materials. The
                    articles most in demand are English broad cloths, kerseymeres, coloured broad
                    flannels, calicoes, &amp;c.; all kinds of hardware and cutlery, and foreign silk
                    velvets, satins, as well as English ribbons and silks. The population amounts to
                    about seventy-five thousand souls, and has been divided into three classes of
                    nearly equal numbers; the whites, mestizos, and Indians. Here there are very few
                    negroes, or descendants of that race, the Indians being generally engaged in
                    domestic service.</p>
                <p>Some remarkable monuments of the former sway of the Ineas are found scattered at
                    intervals in these delightfill valleys. The ruins near Cayambe may be pronounced
                    superb. Those of the palace of Calio present one of the most perfect examples of
                    the ancient architecture of the Peruvians, which throughout the vast extent of
                    the empire ' are marked by the most striking similarity. It forms a square, each
                    side of which is one hundred feet in length. Four gates and eight interior
                    apartments may be distinctly traced. The gates resemble those of the Egyptian
                    temples; and the niches, of which there are eighteen in each division, are
                    distributed in a very symmetrical manner. The remains o f spacious porphyry
                    palaces are found, also at Autun, Canar, and some other plaecs. The ruins of
                    fortified places, called pneuras, still exist, and some of them are of
                    considerable extent.</p>
                <p>The province of Chimborazo, so called from the majestic mountain which overlooks
                    its valleys, is distinguished for its breed of mules. Barley, potatoes, and
                    maize are cultivated by the Indians in various parts, and some sugarcane in the
                    bottoms of the ravines. Riobamba, the capital of the province, was completely
                    destroyed by the earthquake of 1797; and, with very few exceptions, the whole
                    population, amounting to about twenty thousand, were buried under the ruins, or
                    engulphed in the earth. Some idea of the terrible nature of the convulsion in
                    this quarter ’may <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542749"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2749-0798"/>be gathered from the fact, that part of the ruins
                    situated on the acclivities on each side of the valley where the new town now
                    stands are pointed out as having once formed portions of one edifice, although
                    now separated from each other a league and a half. The new town is built upon a
                    sandy plain, much below the level of the surrounding elevated plains called <hi
                    rend="italic">paranios.</hi> Its climate is very agreeable, and adapted for
                    producing all kinds of European fruits. Sheep-farming is extensively carried on,
                    about four thousand quintals of sheep’s wool being produced annually, and
                    manufactured into different kinds of cloth. At Tescan, in the neighbourhood,
                    there is a large sulphur-work; and here are seen part of those remains of hewn
                    stones which run along the mountains almost to Cuzco, at a height of 13,800 feet
                    above the level of the sea. This is called the road of the Incas, and, no doubt,
                    was the means of communication between the two capitals in the regal days of the
                    “Children of the Sun.” Riobamba contains a population of 15,000; Ambato or
                    Hambato, situated between Cotopaxi and Carguirazo, in a very fine region,
                    contains 3000 inhabitants, who trade extensively in cochineal. This place also
                    suffered severely in 1797. The other places in this province are, Alausi,
                    situated in an elevated valley of the same name; Guano, which has a considerable
                    trade with Popayan; Guarando, a dépôt for the trade between Quito and Guayaquil;
                    and Pallactanga, where there are rich gold and silver mines.</p>
                <p>The province of Imbabura contains many fine and fruitful valleys, in which there
                    are extensive plantations of sugar-cane, from which the best sugar in the
                    republic is manufactured. The wheat grown in this district is likewise of the
                    finest quality. The capital, called Ibarra, is situated eighteen leagues to the
                    northward of Quito. It is exceedingly well built, having fine streets and a
                    spacious market-place; and it contains 12,000 inhabitants, who are employed to
                    some extent in the weaving of cotton and woollens, and the manufacture of
                    stockings and ponchos. To the south-west of Ibarra is the town of Otavalo,
                    containing 20,000 inhabitants. Large quantities of cattle are bred in the
                    neighbourhood, and cotton and woollens are manufactured here in the same manner
                    as at Ibarra. Esmeraldas is situated near the mouth of a river of the same name,
                    and is one of the few ports of the republic. The surrounding country is
                    extremely fruitful; the sugar-cane grows to above ten feet in height, and the
                    yam root sometimes weighs twenty pounds. Tacames is likewise a haven on the
                    Pacific Ocean. But the great port of Quito is Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>The remaining provinces may be briefly described. Loxa affords the finest
                    cinchona, and was long supposed to be the only spot which produced in perfection
                    that precious medicament. The town of Loxa is well built, and contains some fine
                    churches, several well-organized seminaries of education, and a population of
                    10,000. The capital of Cuença, called St Anna de Cuença, is the seat of a
                    bishop, and possesses a university, several schools and fine churches, with
                    20,000 inhabitants. The other towns in this quarter worthy of being mentioned
                    are Azogues, where there are quicksilver mines; Zaruma, celebrated for its gold,
                    silver, and lead mines; Beza, once populous, but now decayed to a mere village;
                    and some other places, once of note, but now deserted wastes. The Gallopagos or
                    Turtle Islands, stretching from 3° of south to 2° of north latitude, are
                    celebrated for an uncommon species of land-tùrtle which they produce, weighing
                    from fifty to three hundred pounds. The largest island is called Albemarle, and
                    may be about sixty miles in length. It contains a good harbour. The whole group
                    is said to be of volcanic origin.</p>
                <p>The value of the trade of this republic will be seen from the following
                    statement. In the year 1835 there entered inwards at the port of Guayaquil 123
                    vessels, of 21,430 tons burden in all, and with cargoes valued at L.221,680. The
                    same number cleared outwards, and the value of their cargoes was L.210,429. The
                    imports consist chiefly of British manufactures, flour, wine, and other
                    necessaries; the exports, of cocoa, timber, and the other products of the
                    country. The number of inhabitants is estimated at 550,000, including 300,000
                    Indians who dwell in the mountains; but some American accounts fix the
                    population at only 481,966. With regard to the income and expenditure, little
                    correct information is to be obtained. The former has been reckoned at 800,000
                    piastres, and the latter at about as much; but by the most recent intelligence
                    the minister of finance estimates the outlay as low as 171,086 piastres. By the
                    treaty regarding the national debt, already mentioned, the share which fell to
                    Quito was 21½ per cent., or L.l,464,795 sterling.</p>
                <p>On the first of May 1835, the congress of the nation, consisting of forty-five
                    members, agreed to draw up a plan of a constitution for the country; but it does
                    not appear that they have yet (1839) agreed about the details, <hi

                    certain small rent payable by the tenants of manors, in token of subjection, and
                    by which the tenant goes quiet and free. In ancient records it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">τvhite rent,</hi> because paid in silver money, to distinguish it
                    from corn-rent, or rent in kind.</p>
