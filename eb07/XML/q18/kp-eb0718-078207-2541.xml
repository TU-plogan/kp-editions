                <p><label type="entry">QUEBEC</label>, the capital of Lower Canada, is situated upon
                    the north-eastern extremity of a promontory called Cape Diamond, three hundred
                    and fifty feet above the water level, on the left bank of the river St Lawrence.
                    The rocky ridge upon which the city stands is formed by the St Lawrence and the
                    St Charles, the former river flowing to the southward of Quebec, and the latter
                    to the northward, and the junction taking place in front of the town, where they
                    expand into a considerable basin forming the harbour of Quebec. The distance
                    from the one river to the other, across the ridge, is rather more than a mile.
                    It is divided into two parts, Upper and Lower Quebec. The latter is built at the
                    base of the promontory, nearly on a level with high-water mark. The
                    communication from this to the upper town is by a long, narrow, winding, and
                    extremely steep street, which terminates close to the city walls, at an
                    elevation of two hundred feet above the river. Here Upper Quebec commences,
                    extending its limits considerably to the westward along the slope of the ridge,
                    and up the promontory towards the cape, within fifty or sixty yards of its
                    summit, which is crowned by the citadel. This part of the town contains the
                    government buildings, the residence of the governor, the military, and the most
                    opulent of the inhabitants, with the best and handsomest streets, and the most
                    agreeable mansions. The lower town is much more crowded and mean in appearance,
                    and is very filthy and inconvenient. The streets are narrow, the foot-pavement
                    being barely sufficient for a single passenger; the houses have a gloomy and
                    monotonous aspect, and many of them are said to be built of wood, although there
                    exists a statute forbidding the use of this material in the construction of the
                    main part of buildings, as a security against the dreadful conflagrations which
                    have so often desolated the cities of the west. The warehouses are built of
                    stone; and this ill-favoured portion of Quebec is the chief seat of the commerce
                    and traffic by which the city is enriched. Amongst the public buildings may be
                    mentioned the castle of St Louis, a huge vice-regal chateau, supported by piers,
                    and overhanging the precipice; the Hotel Dieu, the Protestant and Catholic
                    cathedrals, and a numbcr of other religious edifices; the exchange, bank,
                    court-house, hospitals,barracks, gaol, and others. There is a French seminary or
                    college, containing usually about two hundred pupils, and other establishments
                    connected with education. In the district of Quebec there are five public or
                    free schools, in the district of Montreal twenty-four, and in the district of
                    Three Rivers six public schools, under the superintendence of the Board of Royal
                    Institution for the Advancement of Learning, incorporated by the provincial act
                    41st Geo. III. cap. 17. To this board the legislature makes an annual grant.
                    Each teacher is bound to instruct one third of the number of pupils
                    gratuitously, and in no case to charge more than three shillings and fourpence
                    per month. The visitors may vary the rate according to the number of children in
                    each family who attend school, and the circumstances of the parents. There are
                    also two grammar-schools, one at Quebec and another at Montreal, supported by an
                    annual grant of L.200 each from the Jesuit Estates Fund, with L.90 and L.50
                    respectively for house-rent. These are also under the superintendence of the
                    Royal Institution. The system of instruction is that of the public grammar
                    schools of England. Twenty-six free scholars are admitted into each of them. The
                    rate of tuition for others is L.12 per annum. There are also upwards of a
                    thousand schools established under the provincial act 9 Geo. IV. cap. 46,
                    attended by about 45,600 scholars of both sexes. L.20 are allowed to each
                    teacher having at least twenty children under his care. These schools are under
                    the direction of trustees annually elected by the inhabitants. No particular
                    system of tuition is followed, but the Lancasterian is pursued in a few of them.
                    There are also several Roman Catholic colleges in the province, and a number of
                    private seminaries for the higher branches of education. Besides these, there
                    were in Lower Canada, in 1835, 1170 elementary schools, attended by 21,014 boys
                    and 16,654 girls, of whom 12,495 were taught gratis, and 25,173 were paid for.
                    The houses were mostly roofed with shingles, but many of those of a better sort,
                    and the public buildings and great warehouses, are covered with tin or iron
                    plates. There are several distilleries, breweries, tobacco, soap, candle, and
                    other manufactories. Excellent ships are built here, and every variety of
                    tradesmen may be found in the upper or lower town. Many of the shops, or stores
                    as they are called in America, are elegantly fitted up, and well supplied with
                    every commodity in demand. There are suburbs attached to each town.</p>
                <p>One of the leading features of Quebec is its fortifications, it being the
                    strongest place in America. “As a fortress,” says Mr Montgomery Martin, “Quebec
                    may now be ranked in the first class, the citadel, on the highest point of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193542554" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2554-0783"/> Cape Diamond,
                    together with a formidable combination of strongly constructed works, extending
                    over an area of forty acres. Small batteries, connected by ramparts, are
                    continued from the edge of the precipice to the gateway leading to the lower
                    town, which is defended by cannon of a large calibre, and the approach to it up
                    Mountain Street (which connects the upper and lower town) enfiladed and flanked
                    by many large guns. A line of defence connects with the grand battery a redoubt
                    of great strength, armed with twenty-four pounders, entirely commanding the
                    basin and passage of the river. Other lines add to the impregnability of Quebec
                    if properly defended, the possession of which may be said to give the mastery of
                    Upper as well as of Lower Canada.” To the west, and in front of the citadel, are
                    the celebrated plains of Abraham, where was achieved the victory which wrested
                    Canada from France, and annexed it to the British empire. An obelisk marks the
                    field where Wolf and Montcalm fought and perished. The basin or harbour of
                    Quebec is very beautiful, safe, and spacious, being sufficient to contain a
                    hundred sail of the line. The river St Lawrence is twelve miles broad above the
                    city, but is here contracted to one mile in breadth. The commerce of Quebec is
                    considerable, indeed nine tenths of the trade of Canada is carried on from this
                    city. The imports consist of British manufactures, wine, rum, and other spirits,
                    sugar, coffee, tea, salt, and tobacco. The exports, the produce of the Canadas,
                    arc ships’ masts, spars, timber, various kinds of prepared wood, pot and pearl
                    ash, fish, oil, seal-skins, pork, beef, butter, lard, live-stock, hides,
                    castoreum, capillaire, natural curiosities, wheat, Indian corn, and the like, as
                    also furs; and there is likewise a re-exportation of British fabrics, West India
                    produce, and teas. The imports into Lower Canada, during the year 1835, amounted
                    to L.l,496,376, and the exports to L.896,847, of which L.7750 was for fish,
                    L.30,590 for corn, and L.620,182 for wood. The amount of the paper currency in
                    1835 was L.268,88l, of which L.52,535 was in notes of the Quebec bank, and
                    L.216,346 in notes of the Montreal bank. The following table shows the amount of
                    shipping in 1835.</p>

                <p>Emigration to Quebec was for many years carried on to a great extent; the number
                    of arrivals in the year 1832 being 51,746. The recent disturbances in Canada,
                    and the opening up of a new field for emigration in Australasia, have combined
                    to check the influx of Europeans, so that in the year 1836 they had diminished
                    to 27,728, in 1837 to 22,500, and in 1838 to only 4992. The seasons of Quebec
                    may be briefly noticed. Winter sets in towards the close of November, and for
                    several weeks heavy falls of snow, hail, and sleet, follow each other in rapid
                    succession. The snow falls very deep, and it is often a difficult matter to keep
                    even a narrow pathway open. Towards the end of December the weather clears, and
                    the solid sheet of snow which covers the surrounding country becomes enlivened
                    by multitudes of citizens, who now sally forth with horse, sledge, and carriole,
                    and drive along the smooth, and shining plain. In March the weather gets mild,
                    and even hot, and in April the ice of the St Lawrence breaks with a mighty
                    crash. May and June are generally wet; but July and August arc marked by intense
                    heat and the plague of insects. September is the most agreeable month; but, in
                    October, winter returns “to rule the inverted year.” Quebec was settled by the
                    French in the year 1608; taken by the English, first in 1629, and afterwards in
                    1759; and finally ceded to us by the treaty of Paris in 1766. In 1776 an
                    unsuccessful attack was made upon it by the Americans under General Montgomery,
                    who fell, together with about 7000 men. The population ' of Quebec in 1825
                    amounted to 20,396, and in 1831 to 25,916. Long. 70. 72. W. from Greenwich, Lat.

                <p>Since the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Canada</hi> in this work made its
                    appearance, a revolution has broken out in that part of the British empire, and
                    proved of so serious a nature as to cause a considerable loss of life both in
                    the field and upon the scaffold. It is not our purpose to enter into minute
                    details regarding either the origin of the revolt or the course of events. A
                    brief statement of the leading facts is all that can be given here. Since this
                    colony was annexed to the British crown, two parties have existed in it, the
                    French, the original settlers, or their descendants; and the British, or their
                    descendants, who were the subjugators of the province. The two races have never
                    amalgamated, but, on the contrary, their animosity to each other has been
                    aggravated by recent circumstances to such a degree, that it is constantly in
                    danger of breaking out in acts of open hostility. Although the British race are
                    possessed of the greatest wealth, intelligence, and enterprise, the French
                    Canadians have always been by far the most numerous class, and, on the ground of
                    their numerical superiority, they aspire to have the leading sway in the affairs
                    of the province. But, as the government of Canada is constituted, this has been
                    found impossible; for although they may preponderate in the lower house or house
                    of assembly, they are checked by the legislative council, the members of which
                    are not popularly elected, but chosen by the governor in the name of the
                    sovereign of Great Bri tain. It] is alleged by the house of assembly that abuse
                    of power has resulted from this mode of election; that extreme partiality to the
                    British, and neglect of the French, has been shown, not only in the formation of
                    the legislative council itself, but in the distribution of government]
                    appointments. Amongst the grievances of which they complained were, the tenures
                    act, the want of control over the public revenue of the province, and others,
                    which were embodied in a document transmitted to the imperial government in
                    1832-33. This memorial consisted of ninety-two resolutions, and was drawn up by
                    the leading men of the house of assembly. The substance of them was as follows:
                    Is/, That the legislative council should be elective; <hi rend="italic"
                    >2dly</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> that the executive council should
                    be converted into a ministry, responsible to the assembly; 3√∕y, that the
                    tenures act and land company’s act should be repealed; 4M⅞∕, that the crown
                    revenues should be surrendered unconditionally; <hi rend="italic">bthly,</hi>
                    that the management of the waste lands should be given up to them. And they
                    further declared, that they would pay no arrears, nor vote any civil list, until
                    these demands should be complied with. The arrears spoken of were the salaries
                    of public functionaries, which for several years had remained unpaid, being
                    stopped by the members of assembly. The delegates from Canada met with a patient
                    hearing from the committee appointed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542567"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2567-0784"/>to investigate the subject; but the British
                    government refused to accede to the propositions, and a series of resolutions
                    were carried in parliament, the substance of which is as follows: 1s&lt;, That
                    whilst no change could be made in the mode of electing the legislative council,
                    it was expedient to adopt measures for securing to it a higher degree of public
                    confidence; 2&lt;7Z, y, that whilst it was expedient to improve the composition
                    of the executive council, it was unadvisable to render it responsible to the
                    assembly; 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> that the title of the land company was to
                    remain inviolate; <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> “that as soon as the legislative
                    shall make provisions by law for discharging lands from feudal dues and
                    services, and for removing any doubts as to the incidents of the tenure of land,
                    in free and common soccage, it is expedient to repeal the Canada tenures act,
                    and the Canada trade act, so far as the latter relates to the tenures of land in
                    this province, saving, nevertheless, to all persons the rights vested in them
                    under or in virtue of those acts ;”· <hi rend="italic">r&gt;tMy,</hi> that
                    provision should be made for paying arrears due; and, lastly, “that it is
                    expedient that the legislatures of Lower and Upper Canada respectively be
                    authorized to make provision for the joint regulation and adjustment of
                    questions respecting their trade and commerce, and of other questions wherein
                    they have a common interest.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Nothing has given rise to greater discontent and
                    heart-burnings than the provision made for the support of the church by means of
                    portions of land set apart for this purpose. The grants of land, as a reward for
                    public services, have likewise been considered as very injurious. This cannot be
                    better explained than in the words of Lord Durham, in his Report on the affairs
                    of British North America.</p><p>“The system of clergy reserves was established
                    by the act of 1791, commonly called the Constitutional Act, which directed that,
                    in respect of all grants made by the crown, a quantity equal to one seventh of
                    the land so granted should be reserved for the clergy. A quantity equal to one
                    seventh of all grants would be one eighth of each township, or of all the public
                    land. Instead of this proportion, the practice has been, ever since the act
                    passed, and in the clearest violation of its provisions, to εet apart for the
                    clergy in Upper Canada a seventh of all the land, which is a quantity equal to a
                    sixth of the land granted. There have been appropriated for this purpose 300,000
                    acres, which, legally, it is manifest, belong to the public. And of the amount
                    for which clergy reserves have been sold in that province, namely, L.317,000 (of
                    which about L.100,000 have been already received and invested in the English
                    funds), the sum of about L.45,000 should belong to the public.</p><p>“In Lower
                    Canada the same violation of the law has taken place, with this difference, that
                    upon every sale of crown and clergy reserves, a fresh reserve for the clergy has
                    been made, equal to a fifth of such reserves. The result has been the
                    appropriation for the clergy of 673,567 acres, instead of 446,000, being an
                    excess of 227,559 acres, or half as much again as they ought to have received.
                    The Lower Canada fund already produced by sales amounts to L.50,000, of which,
                    therefore, a third, or about L.16,000, belong to the public. If, without any
                    reform of this abuse, the whole of the unsold clergy reserves in both provinces
                    should fetch the average price at which such lands have hitherto sold, the
                    public would be wronged to the amount of about L.280,000; and the reform of this
                    abuse will produce a certain and almost immediate gain to the public of
                    L.60,000. In referring, for further explanation of this subject, to a paper in
                    the appendix, which has been drawn up by Mr Hanson, a member of the commission
                    of inquiry which I appointed for all the colonies, I am desirous of stating my
                    own conviction that the clergy have had no part in this great misappropriation
                    of the public property, but that it has arisen entirely from heedless
                    misconception, or some other error, of the civil government of both
                    provinces.</p><p>“The great objection to reserves for the clergy is, that those
                    for whom the land is set apart never have attempted, and never could
                    successfully attempt, to cultivate or settle the property, and that, by that
                    special appropriation, so much land is withheld from set- .tiers, and kept in a
                    state of waste, to the serious injury of all settlers in its neighbourhood. But
                    it would be a great mistake to suppose that this is the only practice by which
                    such injury has been, and still is, inflicted on actual settlers. In the two
                    Canadas especially, the practice of rewarding, or attempting to reward, public
                    services by grants of public land, has produced, and is still producing, a
                    degree, of injury to actual settlers which it is difficult to conceive without
                    having witnessed it. The very principle of such grants is bad, inasmuch as,
                    under any circumstances, they must lead to an amount of appropriation beyond the
                    wants of the community, and greatly beyond the proprietor’s means of cultivation
                    and settlement. In both the Canadas, not only has this principle been pursued
                    with reckless profusion, but the local executive governments have managed, by
                    violating or evading the instructions which they received from the secretary of
                    state, to add incalculably to the mischiefs that would have arisen at all
                    events.</p><p>“In Upper Canada, 3,200,000 acres have been granted to ‘ U. E.
                    Loyalists,’ being refugees from the United States, who settled in the province
                    before 1767, and their children; 730,000 acres to militiamen, 450,000 acres to
                    discharged soldiers and sailors, 255,000 acres to magistrates and barristers,
                    136,000 acres to executive councillors and their families, 50,000 acres to five
                    legislative councillors and their families, 36,900 acres to clergymen as private
                    property, 264,000 acres to persons contracting to make surveys, 92,526 acres to
                    officers of the army and navy, 500,000 acres for the endowment of schools,
                    48,520 acres to Colonel Talbot, 12,000 acres to the heirs of General Brock, and
                    12,000 acres to Doctor Mountain, a former bishop of Quebec; making altogether,
                    with the clergy reserves, nearly half of all the surveyed land in the province.
                    In Lower Canada, exclusively of grants to refugee loyalists, as to the amount of
                    which the crown lands’ department could furnish me with no information, 450,000
                    acres have been granted to militiamen, to executive councillors 72,000 acres, to
                    Governor Milne about 48,000 acres, to Mr Cushing and another upwards of 100,000
                    acres (as a reward for giving information in a case of high treason), to

                <p>On the 18th of August 1837, an extraordinary session of the parliament of Lower
                    Canada was called together by Lord Gosford, the governor-in-chief; but the
                    assembly again refused all supplies, and continued to decline exercising any
                    legislative functions. Confusion and disorganization now began to spread
                    throughout the whole social as well as political system of Canada. On the 23d of
                    October, a meeting of delegates, named by the different parishes in five
                    counties, was held at St Charles, in Lower Canada. The persons assembled were
                    addressed by Papineau, speaker of the house of assembly, and other individuals,
                    and a series of resolutions were passed expressing dissatisfaction with the
                    manner in which Canada was governed. That same day a meeting of the friends of
                    the constitution was held at Montreal, and resolutions were passed in favour of
                    supporting the government, and condemnatory of the revolutionary movements.
                    Disaffection now assumed the shape of insurrection, and anarchy was immediately
                    followed by bloodshed. The insurrection was suppressed without much difficulty
                    ∙, but the country still remains in a very unsettled condition. <hi
