                <p><label type="entry">QUEEN’S <hi rend="smallcaps">County</hi></label>, an inland
                    county in the province of Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the
                    King’s County, on the east by those of Kildare and Carlow, on the south by those
                    of Carlow and Kilkenny, and on the west by Tipperary and the King’s County. It
                    extends over a surface of 396,810 acres, of which 335,838 are cultivated, and
                    60,972 are uncultivated mountain and bog.</p>
                <p>No notice of the inhabitants of this part of Ireland is to be found in Ptolemy’s
                    account of the island; but Whitakcr supposes it to have been peopled, together
                    with all the other interior parts, by the Scots. It was afterwards known by the
                    names of Ossory and Leix; the former consisting of the north-western districts,
                    the latter of the remainder of the county, and the Barrow constituting the
                    boundary between them. Ossory, of which the Macgillypatricks or Fitzpatricks
                    were the toparchs, ranked as a subordinate kingdom at the landing of the
                    English, and for some time afterwards. Leix was made a county palatine, which
                    fell into the possession of Roger Mortimer through the female line, and
                    afterwards was seized on by the O'Mores, who retained possession of it, and
                    proved persevering and troublesome enemies to the English government, until the
                    reign of Philip and Mary, when the territory was made shire-ground, under the
                    name of the Queen’s County, in honour of the sovereign; and the place chosen for
                    the county town was named Maryborough, for the same reason. This county, when
                    brought under British Jaw, was gradually peopled by English settlers. During the
                    subsequent reigns several of these families have become extinct in the male
                    line, and others were expelled or extinguished by the confiscations arising out
                    of the civil wars in 1641 and 1689, whilst the descendants of others, the
                    principal of whom are the Veseys, Cootes, Parnells, Dawsons, and Burrowes, still
                    retain the whole or some portion of their ancestral possessions. It is now
                    divided into the baronies of Ballyadams, Cullinagh, Maryborough East,
                    Maryborough West, Partnehinch, Slievemarigue or Slieve-margy, Stradbally,
                    Tinnehinch, and Upper Ossory. These are subdivided into thirty-eight parishes,
                    and six parts of parishes the remaining parts of which are in the adjoining
                    counties. According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of the country, the
                    county contains fifty-one parishes, of which twenty-seven arc in the diocese of
                    Leighlin, fifteen in that of Ossory, seven in Kildare, and one each inKillaloc
                    and Dublin.</p>
                <p>The general face of the country is level, but it rises into heights of
                    considerable elevation in the Slieve-Bloom Mountains, which, taking a direction
                    nearly north and south along the western verge of the county, rise to a
                    considerable height, their most elevated point being 1689 feet above the level
                    of the sea, and with an acclivity so abrupt that the only practicable road
                    across them is through the pass of Glandine. In the southern extremity the
                    Slievemarigue Hills, of considerably inferior elevation, separate the county
                    from that of Kilkenny. But the general surface of the country is not, strictly
                    speaking, level; the monotony of a perfect plain is relieved by a range of low
                    hills, which traverse it in a direction from north to south, and the most
                    remarkable of which are the Rock of Dunamase and the Dun of Clopoke; as also by
                    eskars, a singular species of low hills, or rather slight elevations of the
                    surface, formed of rounded pebbles, apparently forced together by the operation
                    of contending currents of water. The most remarkable of these is the Ridge of
                    Marvborough, which, entering<pb break="no" facs="nls:193542593"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2593-0786"/> from the King’s County, proceeds for a
                    considerable distance by Maryborough, and, after having been deranged and
                    broken, resumes again the form of a continuous ridge, branching out in the
                    southern part of the county in two divisions. The Slieve-Bloom Mountains give
                    rise to some of the great rivers of Ireland. The Barrow rises at their northern
                    extremity, and, after passing through the north of the county, forms its
                    north-eastern boundary; then, turning southwards, it forms its boundary to the
                    east, separating it from Kildare and Carlow, and falls into the Suir some miles
                    below New Ross, forming with that river the estuary called Waterford Harbour.
                    The source of the Nore is southward of that of the Barrow, in the same
                    mountains. It passes through the south-western part of the county by Abbeyleix
                    and Ballynakill, enters the county of Kilkenny near Ballyragget, and, after
                    flowing by the city of Kilkenny, joins the Barrow about two miles above New
                    Ross. The portion of the Barrow between its junction with the Nore and Suir is
                    generally called the Ross River. The Suir, which also rises in the Slieve-Bloom
                    Mountains at their southern extremity, does not belong to this county. The
                    smaller rivers are the Ownas, Trihogue, and Blackwater, tributaries of the
                    Barrow; and the Tonnet, Dolore, Old Forge River, Cloncoose, Cromoge, Corbally,
                    Trumry, Colt, and Erkin, tributaries of the Nore. The Barrow is navigable for
                    barges from Athy, where it is connected with the Grand Canal from Dublin to New
                    Ross, and thence to the sea for vessels of 500 tons. The Nore is not navigable
                    until after it has quitted the county. There is no lake except that of Annagh on
                    its northern boundary, which partly belongs to the King’s County, the line of
                    demarcation between the two counties being drawn through the middle of it.</p>

                    periods, some founded on conjectural estimates, others on actual enumeration
                    under legislative authority, is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The return of 1831 gives an average of one inhabitant to every 2∙72 acres, or of
                    one to every 2∙30 cultivated acres. The returns of the Commissioners of Public
                    Instruction in 1834, being made up in dioceses, do not give the population of
                    counties with strict accuracy; yet they afford data sufficient to show the
                    comparative numbers of the three great divisions of the people with respect to
                    their several religious persuasions. If the entire population of the county be
                    estimated at 150,000, the number of Episcopalian Protestants would amount to
                    20,000, of Protestant dissenters to 1000, and of Roman Catholics to 129,000;
                    according to which calculation, the Protestants would be to the Catholics as one
                    to six nearly.</p>
                <p>The county returned eight members to the Irish parliament; two for the county at
                    large, and two each for the boroughs of Portarlington, Maryborough, and
                    Ballynakill. This number was reduced to three by the act of union, by which the
                    boroughs were disfranchised, with the exception of the first named, which still
                    continues to return one member. The number of registered electors for the
                    county, according to the latest return, was 2150, that of the borough of
                    Portarlington 156. The election for the county takes place at Maryborough. The
                    local government consists of a lieutenant, eighteen deputy-lieutenants, all
                    appointed by the crown during pleasure, and ninety magistrates (including the
                    lieutenants) appointed by the lord-chancellor, and holding office during good
                    behaviour. The constabulary force consists of a sub-inspector, eight chief
                    constables, ten héad-constables, thirty-seven constables, and two hundred and
                    seventy-six sub-constables; in all, 332.</p>

                <p>Of the numbers stated in the latter of these returns, 2074 were Episcopalian
                    Protestants, 104 Protestant dissenters, and 9426 Roman Catholics; the religious
                    persuasion of the remaining 305 not having been ascertained. The total number of
                    schools was 275; of which thirty-five, containing 2150 pupils, were maintained
                    by grants of public money; twenty-four, containing 1625 pupils, by the voluntary
                    contributions of societies or individuals; and the remaining 216 schools, which
                    afforded the means of education to 7988 pupils, wholly by the fees of the
                    pupils. The Report of the Commissioners of National Education in 1837 (the
                    latest published), states the number of schools, teachers, and pupils connected
                    with their board as follows: Schools, 18; teachers, 20; boys, 1323; girls, 1045;
                    total of pupils, 2368.</p>
                <p>The level part of the county forms the southern portion of the great floetz
                    limestone field which traverses Ireland across its centre. The peculiar flatness
                    of the interior appears to have caused those accumulations of alluvial matter,
                    composed of clay and limestone gravel, which, in the form of low but steep
                    ridges of hills, occur so frequently throughout the midland districts, and are
                    known by the name of eskars. Some very striking specimens of this formation in
                    the county have already been noticed. That the surface of the country was
                    exposed to the action of rapid currents of water, is evidenced by the deep
                    parallel indentations or furrows frequently observable on the surface of rocks
                    from which the alluvial soil has been removed. It is also probable that the
                    gravel hills were rapidly deposited from water in violent action; an inference
                    which is confirmed by the fact, that they mostly consist of large masses of rock
                    partially rounded, intermixed with small gravel, and even with clay and sand.
                    The sandstone shows itself in the Slieve-Bloom Mountains, which are almost
                    wholly of that formation. The south-eastern extremity forms a small part of the
                    Leinster coal-field, the mineral in it being, like that of Kilkenny, which
                    adjoins it, of the carbonaceous or stone-coal formation, the slaty glantz-coal
                    of Werner, burning dully with little flame, emitting an offensive and
                    unwholesome vapour, and therefore disagreeable for domestic use, but excellent
                    for malting or for the forge, for both which purposes it is in such demand that
                    its high price, were there no other objection to it, prevents it being much used
                    for family purposes even in the neighbourhood. Iron was raised here, and the
                    works were carried on as long as the forests afforded materials for fuel.
                    Potters’ earth is also raised, and applied, in the neighbourhood of
                    Mountmellick, to the manufacture of the coarser kinds of earthen wares.</p>
                <p>The soil varies greatly in different parts. Where it rests on the limestone
                    substratum, it consists mostly of a stiff clay loam, well adapted for the growth
                    of wheat; in other parts it is light and sandy, and produces good crops of oats
                    and barley. The mountain district is wet and boggy even in the higher parts, the
                    clayey sub-soil not admitting free passage for the water, which therefore
                    accumulates on the surface; and it is also much encumbered with rock. The low
                    hills that traverse the middle of the county from north to south are capable of
                    culture mostly to their summits, and, where not deemed suitable for the plough,
                    afford rich pasturage for sheep. The tracts on the sides of the rivers, being
                    annually flooded by the overflowings of the stream during winter, form rich
                    meadow-land. Bogs are frequent in most parts, supplying ample material of fuel
                    for domestic purposes. The county was once so thickly wooded as to be almost<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193542606" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2606-0787"/> impenetrable for
                    the passage of large bodies of men; and thence, as well as from the bogs, which,
                    from a different cause, were also difficult to be crossed by those not well
                    acquainted with their peculiarities, the natives were enabled to hold out long
                    against the attempts of the English settlers. But the old woods have long since
                    been cleared away, the only proof of their former existence being discoverable
                    in the numerous remains of timber-trees lying in the bottom of Lough Annagh. A
                    new growth, however, the offspring, not of the unaided efforts of nature, but of
                    the hand of modern improvement, has in a great measure restored one of its most
                    beautiful and useful features. Large plantations, chiefly around the demesnes of
                    the gentry, vary the prospects, and tend much to relieve the monotony of the
                    level surface. Most parts present the mansions and seats of resident
                    proprietors; comfortable farm-houses are numerous, and much attention has been
                    paid by many landlords to excite amongst their tenantry a laudable emulation in
                    the neatness of their cottages, and in the judicious cultivation of their little
                    farms. The coal district must, however, form an exception to this general
                    description. In it, notwithstanding the superior means of procuring domestic
                    comforts, through the high wages and constant employment afforded by the
                    collieries, the appearance of the peasantry, both in their persons and
                    dwellings, exhibits too frequent instances of the destitution consequent on
                    confirmed habits of reckless improvidence. With the exception of the lands held
                    by wealthy proprietors in their own hands, and those in the mountainous parts,
                    where grazing is the chief object, the farms are not large, seldom more than
                    from ten to fifteen acres. Wheat is very*extensively grown, its culture being
                    more and more attended to even on those soils which, during the more confined
                    state of agricultural knowledge, were thought to be unfit for it. The lighter
                    soils answer well for barley and oats. Potatoes are everywhere raised, both for
                    family use and for feeding cattle; forming also an essential part of the
                    improved rotation system, which is generally practised. Green-crops,
                    particularly turnips, are not unusual, and the value of every kind of clover
                    seems to be duly appreciated. Much attention is given to the introduction of
                    implements and machines of the best description; the clumsy and inartificial
                    vehicles, ploughs, and harrows, formerly in use, being scarcely to be met with
                    except in districts little capable of being brought into profitable agricultural
                    production. The breed of every kind of cattle has been improved during the last
                    twenty or thirty years, to a degree that scarcely could have been anticipated at
                    the commencement of the period. Dairies are numerous and highly productive.
                    Butter is the produce chiefly attended to; and large quantities of it are
                    prepared for export. Cheese is seldom made. The rich low lands graze black
                    cattle of large size. In a word, the county, with the exception already noticed,
                    appears to be rapidly advancing in improvement throughout every department of
                    rural economy, from the nobleman’s demesne to the humble garden of the cottier
                    tenant.</p>
                <p>From the preceding statement it may easily be inferred that the character of the
                    population is almost exclusively agricultural. The only place in which
                    manufactures have at all succeeded is Mountmellick. Several branches of the
                    woollen, linen, and cotton trade have been undertaken there, but without much
                    success; coarse woollens and cottons for the supply of the surrounding districts
                    being the only kinds fabricated. Tanning is carried on to some extent;
                    flourmills are large and numerous; and there are some extensive distilleries and
                    breweries. The Grand Canal, a branch of which has been carried from Monasterevin
                    to Mountmellick, conveys much of the produce of the county to Dublin, either for
                    sale there or for export. The Barrow serves the same purpose with respect to
                    Waterford. The mail-coach roads from Dublin to Cork and Limerick traverse the
                    county.</p>
                <p>There are many remains of ancient edifices, both ecclesiastical and military.
                    Amongst the most remarkable of the former is that of Aghaboe, once the seat of
                    the bishopric of Ossory; the ruins of Aghmacart, and of several others of lesser
                    note, are still visible. The site of the abbey of Tima-hoe can be ascertained
                    only by the pillar-tower there, which is supposed to have stood in its immediate
                    vicinity. Of the military antiquities the most ancient is a fortress placed upon
                    the summit of a hill in the south-west of the county, and called Bawnachra; it
                    consists of a circular enclosure surrounded by a rampart and fosse. The ancient
                    fortress of Dunamasc, situated on the summit of a precipitous hill rising
                    abruptly from the middle of a large plain, and once the chief residence of the
                    O’Mores, presents a very picturesque appearance. Lea Castle, a few miles
                    distant, on the Barrow, a place of considerable strength, was taken and
                    dismantled by Cromwell. Burros-in-Ossory on the Nore, and Castlecuffe in
                    Tinnehinch, built by the celebrated republican leader Sir Charles Coote, were
                    also places of considerable strength. Amongst the modern mansions, that of the
                    Earl of Portarlington, at Ems, is the most splendid.</p>
                <p>Maryborough, the county town, situated nearly in the centre of the county, on
                    one. of the small feeders of the Barrow, presents few features to arrest
                    attention, beyond those public edifices to which the transaction of county
                    business and the claims of religion give rise. It was a borough entitled to send
                    representatives to parliament; but this, the only important privilege to a small
                    town, having been abolished at the union, the other corporate functions became
                    paralyzed, and are now virtually extinct. The county court-house is a neat
                    building; and the prison, on the radiating plan, lately built at an expense of
                    L.19,000, affords accommodation for 121 prisoners. The state of crime, as far as
                    it is deducible from the number of convictions, is not favourable. In 1837 the
                    convictions were 214, of which five were capital, but commuted into a lesser
                    punishment; eight were for transportation for life, and fifteen for seven years.
                    The district lunatic asylum for the King’s, Queen’s, Westmeath, and Longford
                    counties is fixed here; and it affords accommodation for 156 patients, who are
                    maintained in it at an average expense of L.19 per head. The flour trade is the
                    only manufacture of any extent. The population in 1831 was 3220. That of the
                    other towns having upwards of 1000 inhabitants each was in the same year
                    respectively as follows :— Mountellick, 4577; Portarlington, originally a
                    settlement of French refugees, and till lately of some note as a place of
                    elementary education, 3091; Mountrath, 2593; Graige, which is, strictly
                    speaking, a suburb of Carlow, though in a different county, 1976; Ballynakill,
                    1927; Stradbally, near which is the Dun of Clopoke, an isolated rock, perforated
                    by subterraneous cavities, 1799; Ballycollinbeg, 1381; Rath-downey, 1214; and
                    Abbcyleix, which, though amongst the smallest, is the neatest in external
                    appearance, 1009.</p>
