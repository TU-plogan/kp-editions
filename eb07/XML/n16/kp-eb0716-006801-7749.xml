                    rend="smallcaps">Isle.</hi> This island is situated on the west coast of
                    Sumatra, from which it is separated by a strait sixty miles in breadth, and is
                    fifty miles in length by twenty in average breadth. It is a large and productive
                    island, and is divided into about fifty small districts, under chiefs or rajahs,
                    who live in a state of perpetual hostility, their great object being to make
                    prisoners, that they may sell them for slaves. These violences are encouraged by
                    native traders, who resort to these islands for cargoes of slaves, and who are
                    accused of occasionally surprising and carrying off whole families. The number
                    of slaves exported is estimated at from 600 to 1000. Besides slaves, padi and
                    rice are exported to a considerable amount. The cultivation of these articles is
                    carried on at a distance from the coast, whither the natives retire, to be
                    secure from piratical depredations. They bring down their produce to the
                    harbours, and exchange it for iron, steel, beads, tobacco, and the coarser kinds
                    of Madras and Surat piece-goods. Hogs are reared in great numbers; and several
                    parts of the continent are supplied from thence with yams, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194557762" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7762-0069"/>bears, and poultry. It is
                    well peopled, and its inhabitants are a peculiar and distinct race, not only
                    from those of Sumatra, but from the people on all the islands to the southward.
                    They are of lighter complexions, especially the women, than the Malays; smaller
                    also in their persons, and shorter in their stature, with broad mouths, flat
                    noses, and their ears pierced and distended in an extraordinary manner. They
                    have a singular sort of leprous scurf on their skins, which in some covers the
                    whole body and limbs, whilst in others it resembles rather the ring-worm running
                    in waving lines or concentric curves. The principal food of the common people is
                    rice, and the better classes use pork. The natives are remarkable for their
                    docility and expertness in handicraft work, and are excellent house-carpenters
                    and joiners. They are likewise industrious and frugal, temperate and regular in
                    their habits, but at the same time avaricious, sullen, vindictive, and
                    sanguinary. They are often employed by the Dutch as domestic servants; but they
                    are always esteemed dangerous. In many cases, however, this may be owing to the
                    bad treatment which they receive. Some of the petty rajahs in the island have
                    amassed treasures to a considerable amount, equal to 10,000 or 20,000
                    dollars.</p>
