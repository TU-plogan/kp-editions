                    >Anegada,</hi> the most northern of the cluster of islands known by the name of
                    the Virgin Islands, in the West Indies, and unhappily celebrated for the number
                    of shipwrecks, in many cases accompanied with a heavy loss of life, which it has
                    occasioned. It was first permanently settled by individuals who hoped to reap
                    considerable advantages by collecting the spoil of the vessels wrecked on its
                    inhospitable shores. They found that the loose ground which covered it was
                    capable of bearing provision crops, and even cotton; whilst the rearing of
                    stock, and the sale of the underwood, which was progressively cleared away, and,
                    being very full of gum, had a preference in the market of St Thomas, furnished a
                    further resource. The great object, however, always has been the wreck of
                    vessels; and the indolence of the inhabitants is only thoroughly roused by the
                    cry of “a vessel on the reefs.” The moment this is raised, all becomes activity
                    and bustle. Boats and small craft of every description push off towards the
                    scene of destruction, and both skill and intrepidity are exercised to the
                    uttermost to get first on board. The surface of Anegada is the production of the
                    tribe of <hi rend="italic">lithophytae,</hi> based, it is presumed, on a
                    submarine elevation. The appearance of the island when approached is remarkable.
                    First, single trees show themselves on the horizon; then the most elevated part
                    of the island, called Frank’s Landing, which may be descried eight miles off in
                    clear weather; and, last of all, the lower land. Its greatest length is 10∙07
                    English miles, and its greatest breadth, which is about the middle, 4∙25 English
                    miles; but it afterwards diminishes towards both extremities. The reef by which
                    it is surrounded approaches nearest on the north side of the island, where at
                    one point it unites with the shore. Generally speaking, the distance of the reef
                    from the island is inconsiderable on the northern, west <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194557866" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7866-0077"/>ern, and partly on the
                    southern side. To the eye Anegada appears a dead flat, with only a turpentine or
                    loblolly tree overlooking the underwood. However, the ground rises gradually
                    from north to south, about sixty feet. There is some rather productive soil on
                    the island, and a great number of ponds, which, in long-continued dry weather,
                    produce considerable quantities of salt. There is abundance of fresh water; and
                    the surrounding sea abounds with good fish, as do also the ponds. There are some
                    rare specimens of plants in Anegada. The feathered tribes are very numerous; and
                    there is an abundance of domestic animals. The population of Anegada consists at
                    present of eleven white and twenty-one coloured and black families.</p>
