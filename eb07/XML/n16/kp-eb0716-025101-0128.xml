                <p><label type="entry">NORTHCOTE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished English painter, was born at Plymouth in the year 1746. He evinced
                    a predilection for the arts at a very early period, but received no
                    encouragement from his father, who was an eminent <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560141" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0141-0252"/>watchmaker, and apprenticed
                    him to his own trade. When the period of his indenture had expired, the strong
                    bent of young Northcote’s genius prevailed; and being fortunate enough to obtain
                    a recommendation to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that eminent artist received him as a
                    pupil. Northcote had nearly reached his twenty-fifth year when he arrived in
                    London; and having had comparatively little experience in painting previously to
                    this period, his attainments were greatly inferior to those of other beginners
                    much younger than himself. It was therefore with no great reliance on his
                    talents that Sir Joshua gave him a trial; but diligence and native genius soon
                    made amends for all deficiencies, and, much to the satisfaction of his master,
                    with whom he became a favourite pupil, his improvement was rapid. He was also of
                    an age to be a pleasant companion to Sir Joshua; and from his great natural
                    talents, and extraordinary powers of conversation, he was enabled to avail
                    himself of all the advantages of that polished society which assembled in the
                    house of his master. Northcote remained domesticated for five years, on the most
                    agreeable terms, in Sir Joshua’s family; and in 1776 he reluctantly quitted an
                    abode which had in every way been rendered delightful to him. He commenced
                    portrait painter, in which he would doubtless have attained great eminence; but
                    his powerful intellect was scarcely satisfied with this limited branch of art,
                    and he resolved to prosecute the more independent and pleasing, although much
                    less lucrative, study of historical painting. In furtherance of this object, he,
                    in 1777, repaired to Italy, where he remained three years, devoting his time
                    alternately to the study of the great masters, and to original compositions.
                    During his sojourn on the Continent, he was elected a member of the Imperial
                    Academy at Florence, of the ancient Etruscan Academy at Cortona, and of the
                    Accademia delle Arti at Rome. He was also requested to execute a portrait of
                    himself, to be placed amongst those of distinguished artists which grace the
                    gallery at Florence; and the picture which he presented is at once a faithful
                    resemblance and an exquisite specimen of his professional skill.</p>
                <p>On his return to England, Northcote pursued the study of design with all the
                    ardour of an artist; and it was soon apparent that he had not mistaken his forte
                    or miscalculated his powers. About this period Mr Boydell was engaged in
                    procuring engravings from pictures by the old masters, whose works he had either
                    obtained the use of, or had caused to be copied by skilful hands. His next
                    experiment was to commission native artists of distinction to paint original
                    composition from history and other subjects, and to cause these also to be
                    engraved by Englishmen. Northcote being one of the most promising painters of
                    the British school, was employed by Mr Boydell, and also by other printsellers;
                    and prints from his designs were to be seen, framed and glazed, upon the walls
                    of the higher order of dwellings in every part of the kingdom. One of the most
                    admired, entitled the Village Doctress, had for several years a considerable
                    sale. It was not, however, until the Shakspeare Gallery was opened, that the
                    world was made fully aware of the powers of Northcote. Amongst the many-splendid
                    efforts of British art which were thus collected together, none proved more
                    attractive than his compositions. The scene of the smothering of the young
                    princes in the Tower of London; that of removing their bodies secretly by
                    torch-light for interment at the foot of the stone steps; the subject of Arthur
                    and Hubert; the entrance into London of Richard II. and Bolingbroke, and others
                    from his pencil, are undoubtedly to be reckoned amongst the best specimens of
                    British art at this flourishing period of its history. These productions clearly
                    proved how well he had studied the works of his illustrious master, and imbibed
                    his feelings as a colourist. Northcote had now attained the zenith of his fame;
                    and he received the reward of his abilities by being elected an associate of the
                    Royal Academy on the 6th of November 1786, and a royal academician on the 13th
                    of February 1787.</p>
                <p>From this period Northcote divided his professional labours between historical
                    compositions, fancy subjects, and portraiture. The dramatic style, however,
                    attracted his attention for a time, and he painted a series of moral subjects,
                    illustrative of virtue and vice, in the progress of two young women. This was
                    trenching upon the ground' of Hogarth, and the attempt proved a failure; for
                    although the main points of this graphic drama bore directly upon the subject,
                    the characters were deficient in expression and individuality. In painting,
                    Northcote kept the colouring of Sir Joshua Reynolds steadily in his eye; and&gt;
                    so little change in his style had his contemplation of the great masters in
                    Italy wrought, that no one could discover the least approach to that severity of
                    manner which is peculiar to the Roman and other Italian masters. His pictures
                    are distinguished for their breadth of light and’ shade; and most of his
                    historical works display a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the subject,
                    much study, and considerable force of conception. For a period of above thirty
                    years his productions may be said to have borne a conspicuous part in the
                    exhibitions at Somerset House; and, to the last year of his life, a season
                    seldom elapsed without his presenting one or more efforts of his pencil at the
                    British Institution or the Gallery of the British Artists.</p>
                <p>That Northcote was an enthusiast in his art may be gathered from many anecdotes
                    related of him whilst expatiating upon the merits of the great masters. A
                    favourite pursuit of his was the painting of wild animals; and one day, whilst
                    making a study from nature of a vulture, he laid down his palette, and clasping
                    his hands, exclaimed, “I lately beheld an eagle painted by Titian, and if heaven
                    would give me the power to achieve such a work, I would then be content to
                    die.’' His conversational powers have been extolled by all who had an
                    opportunity of knowing him; but he never allowed the fascinations of society to
                    interfere with his professional avocations. It was his custom for many years to
                    take an early morning walk, on his return from which he breakfasted, and then
                    went to his studio. About eleven in the forenoon, unless he had an engagement
                    with a sitter, his levee commenced. It seldom happened that he remained alone;
                    one visitor succeeding another, and occasionally three or four at a time,
                    holding him in conversation until the hour for dinner. AD the while he was
                    proceeding with whatever picture he had on hand, working and talking at the same
                    time. His conversation was distinguished by sagacity, acuteness, and great
                    extent of information, as may be seen from a volume published by Mr Hazlitt,
                    entitled Conversations with the late James Northcote, R. A. He had, however,
                    much of that cynical spirit too prevalent amongst artists, of depreciating the
                    works and characters of their rivals; but he was benevolent withal, and whatever
                    he might say in disparagement of those who crossed his path, he was ever ready
                    to befriend those who applied to him for assistance or advice. To young artists
                    he was kind and condescending, and always easily accessible. Such traits in the
                    pictures or drawings which they submitted to him as happened to display
                    originality and talent, gave him delight; for he felt a patriotic pride in the
                    arts of his country, and a personal interest in their advancement. In whatever
                    company Northcote might be, he always maintained his opinions, which were often
                    singular, with a manly independence, which secured him general respect. One day
                    a royal duke, whilst attending at a sitting of Master Betty, the young Roscius,
                    whom Northcote, with his usual sagacity, thoroughly despised, used some
                    liberties with the ar <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560154"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0154-0253"/>tist’s gray locks, observing, “You do not devote
                    much time to the toilet, I perceive ?” Northcote instantly replied, “Sir, I
                    never allow any one to take personal liberties with me; you are the first who
                    ever presumed to do so, and I beg your royal highness to recollect that I am in
                    my own house.” He then resumed his painting, and the royal personage, feeling
                    the rebuke, shortly afterwards took his departure. Next day, however, the artist
                    was surprised by a visit from his royal highness, who, in returning something of
                    which he had obtained the loan, handsomely apologised to him for the liberty
                    which had been thoughtlessly taken.</p>
                <p>Northcote was naturally just, temperate, careful, and in the strictest sense of
                    the word a philosopher. The system of life which he early prescribed for himself
                    was founded on wisdom, and maintained with constancy. The frugal manner in which
                    his table was served from principle might lead to the idea that he was
                    parsimonious; but this is rendered nugatory by the facts, that he lent money
                    freely without asking for interest, and sometimes not even for the principal, by
                    which means he frequently lost it; that he was the most patient and
                    long-suffering of creditors, not only feeling a horror at asking for what was
                    justly due him for his works, but often having whole-lengths, halflengths, and
                    bust portraits thrown upon his hands without his ever attempting to enforce
                    payment. His prudence and foresight, however, enabled him to secure an
                    independence for the evening of life, which so often overtakes artists in
                    destitution and misery. The last years of Northcote’s life were spent in
                    preparing for the press a volume of fables and a Life of Titian. He died on the
                    13th of July 1831, and his remains were deposited in the church of St
                    Mary-le-Bone on the 20th of the same month.</p>
                <p>Northcote was an author as well as a painter. His earliest productions were some
                    papers inserted in a periodical work called The Artist. The subjects of these
                    papers were, Originality in Painting, Imitators and Collectors, Disappointed
                    Genius, a Character of John Opie, Letter from a Disappointed Genius, and the
                    Imitation of the Stage in Painting. In the second volume of the same work, the
                    History of the Slighted Beauty, an allegory, was also by him. He further
                    contributed to the fine arts of the English school the biography of Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds, which he afterwards expanded into a quarto volume, entitled Memoirs of
                    Sir Joshua Reynolds, comprising anecdotes of many distinguished persons, his
                    contemporaries, and a brief ana-ysis of his Discourses; to which are added,
                    Varieties on Art, 1813. A supplement to the work appeared in 1815; and an octavo
                    edition, with considerable additions, came aut in 1819. In 1828 he published^ in
                    octavo, One Hun-lred Fables, original and selected, embellished with two aundred
                    and eighty engravings on wood from his own designs. He likewise left materials
                    for a second series, which )y directions given in his will was to be published
                    after the leath of his sister. His last work, which appeared at the dose of the
                    year 1830, in two volumes octavo, is the Life )f Titian, with anecdotes of the
                    distinguished persons of us time; a work containing a vast mass of useful
                    informa- .ion and reflection on the art of painting. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
