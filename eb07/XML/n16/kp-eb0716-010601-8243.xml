                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Holland</hi> has
                    been traced the history of the revolt of the seventeen provinces of the
                    Netherlands against the Spanish monarchy, and the subjugation of the greater
                    part of ten provinces to that power in the year 1578, whilst the remaining seven
                    provinces, under the Prince of Orange, maintained and ultimately secured their
                    independence in a republican form. Whilst this work has been in progress, a
                    change has been effected in the Netherlands, terminating in a division which
                    renders it necessary to introduce here an account of the new kingdom of Belgium;
                    the name which has been assumed by the southern part of what was formerly the
                    kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The decisive battle of Gemblours, on the 31st of January 1578, which terminated
                    in favour of the Spaniards, and in the dispersion of the army of the states,
                    with the loss of all its artillery, baggage, and stores, must be viewed as the
                    event by which the history of the Netherlands is separated from that of the
                    seven united provinces, which were collectively called Holland, after the first
                    of these states. The archduke, better known by the name of Don Juan, having
                    gained this victory, was suddenly arrested by the hand of death whilst following
                    up his success; and his death has generally, but on insufficient evidence, been
                    attributed to the effects of poison. He was immediately succeeded by the Prince
                    Alexander Farnese, the son of the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, in Italy, by
                    Margaret of Austria, a daughter of the Emperor Charles V., who had formerly
                    governed the Low Countries under the authority of Philip king of Spain. On his
                    accession to the command, the provinces were in a most unsettled state. Don Juan
                    had feared to attack the partisans of the Prince of Orange, who held possession
                    of Brussels; but he was successful in seizing upon Tirlemont, Louvain, Bovines,
                    Philippeville, and several other smaller but fortified places. These successes
                    were, however, more than counterbalanced by the loss of Amsterdam, where the
                    inhabitants rose on the Spanish garrison, and, having succeeded in driving out
                    the troops, boldly declared in favour of the Prince of Orange. The great
                    strength of the Spanish party in the ten provinces depended more on their union
                    under one chief, and on the discipline of the few regular troops whom they had
                    been able to collect, than on the number of soldiers or the abundance of
                    pecuniary resources. The people of the Walloon provinces were bigotedly attached
                    to the church of Rome, and were ready to give up their whole civil rights rather
                    than abandon an iota of that faith, or a single religious observance to which
                    they had been accustomed. These constituted the chief reliance of the Spanish
                    monarch; and under obedience to him had remained, or returned, the fortified
                    towns on the frontier towards France, such as Lisle, Valenciennes, Courtray, and
                    several others. In the party opposed to the Spaniards, though there was a
                    greater number of the population, and a far greater power in warlike stores and
                    in pecuniary resources, yet there were such party divisions and contests, and
                    such struggles for power between chiefs, as tended much to weaken the effect of
                    their efforts to drive out the Spaniards, or even to maintain against-them the
                    power which they still held in Brussels, and in the commercial and maritime
                    cities.</p>
                <p>Although the Prince of Orange, by his talents and his virtues, was at the head of
                    the general confederacy, and, after the independence of the seven provinces had
                    been secured, clothed with unqualified authority within them; yet in the
                    transactions of the ten provinces, which were to be the chief theatre of future
                    warfare, faction had raised up powerful rivals, who impeded his wisest plans.
                    Amongst those of his party who still adhered to the Catholic faith, and were
                    anxious to preserve it, without yielding up to Spain the civil privileges they
                    had long enjoyed, was the Duke of Arschot, the head of a powerful family, who
                    strove to awaken the jealousy of the aristocracy of Flanders and Brabant against
                    the power which the seven northern provinces had bestowed on William of Orange.
                    In order to counterbalance that power, they resolved upon sending an invitation
                    to the Archduke Mathias, the brother of the Emperor Rudolf II., a youth under
                    twenty years of age, to accept the office of governor of Flanders. A secret
                    messenger was despatched to Vienna, and communicated with the archduke, who,
                    with the precipitation of youth, ardently accepted the offer; withdrew privately
                    from Vienna without imparting his project to his brother; and with great
                    celerity and secrecy arrived at Maestricht without previously having announced
                    his resolution, which was scarcely expected by the party that had invited him,
                    and quite unexpected by the Prince of Orange and his friends.</p>
                <p>That prince, with his usual coolness and prudence, expressed neither surprise nor
                    dissatisfaction at this unwarrantable intrigue against his authority; but, on
                    the contrary, he became, or appeared to become, anxious for adopting any
                    measures which could do honour to Mathias, and at the same time increase the
                    security of the country. He framed the outline of the plan upon which his office
                    was to be founded and the power granted to him, but so much under the virtual
                    sovereignty of the states general, as to leave little to the thoughtless youth
                    but the empty title by which he had been tempted to make this wild excursion.
                    The Prince of Orange was appointed his lieutenant in the several civil and
                    military departments of the government, and the Duke of Arschot was left, with
                    little power and less influence, to brood over the disappointment of his
                    ambitious scheme. As his power was but of small extent, he soon resigned it with
                    good humour; and the states, who had only adopted him in the hope of thereby
                    obtaining foreign assistance, when they found he was not supported by his
                    brother or by the empire, accepted his resignation, and dismissed hini with an
                    unanimous vote of thanks for his services. After some difficulty, Mathias was
                    allowed by his brother to return to the Austrian dominions, and was promoted to
                    the government of the hereditary provinces, and intrusted with the command of an
                    army in Hungary against the Turks, by which he acquired much reputation, and
                    ultimately succeeded, after much intrigue and dissension, to the imperial
                    throne, which he filled till his death in 1619. His history belongs rather to
                    that of Austria than to that of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The Prince of Orange had been regularly installed in the dignity of chief of the
                    seven united provinces, in which he was confirmed by a treaty entered into by
                    the states of Flanders and Brabant, who, in an assembly at Brussels, had agreed
                    to confer on the then Duke of Alençon, afterwards Duke of Anjou, the brother of
                    the king of France, the dignity of Duke of Brabant, Lothier, Limbourg, and
                    Guelders. At this period the Duke of Parma collected an army in order to take
                    the city of Cambray; but the siege, which he carried on in person, was raised by
                    the opportune arrival of the Duke of Anjou at the head of a large army of French
                    troops. After the retreat of the Spaniards from before Cambray, the Duke of
                    Parma marched to Tournay, a large city, though at that time feebly garrisoned.
                    The inhabitants, mostly Protestants, made a powerful defence, ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558256" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8256-0107"/>cited by the example of the
                    Princess of Epinol, wife of the absent governor. This heroic lady, though
                    wounded in the attack, fought in the breach, sword in hand; and, when it was
                    impossible to continue the resistance, she obtained an honourable capitulation,
                    and marched out at the head of the garrison, with the appearance of a triumph
                    rather than that of a defeat.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Anjou, after the delivery of Cambray, leaving his army on the
                    frontiers of Flanders, repaired to England, in the hope of completing a treaty
                    which had before been commenced for his marriage with Queen Elizabeth. That
                    sovereign allowed him for some time to indulge hopes of succeeding in his suit;
                    and, from political motives, when the offer was finally rejected, showed him
                    every mark of feeling and regret, accompanied with such tokens of high respect
                    as she supposed would lessen the mortification which he felt. His plan evidently
                    was to unite on his own head the crowns of England and of Belgium.</p>
                <p>The duke, escorted by a powerful English fleet, repaired to Antwerp, where he was
                    received by the Prince of Orange with the greatest splendour, and invested with
                    the insignia of the dignities to which he had been invited, but of which he
                    proved himself utterly unworthy. It is related of him, that when the Prince of
                    Orange placed the ducal mantle on his shoulder, Anjou said to him, “Fasten it so
                    well, prince, that they may not be able to take it off again.”</p>
                <p>The king of Spain had about this period issued a paper full of invective, abuse,
                    and falsehoods against the Prince of Orange, who was therein proscribed, and all
                    persons invited “to assail him in his fortune, person, and life, as an enemy to
                    human nature ;” and for the recompense of virtue and the punishment of vice, he
                    promised, to any one who should deliver up William of Nassau, dead or alive, the
                    sum of 25,000 golden ducats, in lands or money, at his choice; to grant a free
                    pardon to such person for all former offences, of whatever kind; and to invest
                    him with letters-patent of nobility. To this infamous paper William replied by
                    that Apology which Voltaire has described as “one of the noblest monuments of
                    history,” in which he delivered a most splendid refutation of every charge
                    against him, and a more terrible recrimination against the guilty tyrant. He
                    thus stood before the whole public of Europe, not as a rebellious subject, butas
                    the accuser of a king, who had disgraced his ancestors and his throne.</p>
                <p>The inauguration of the Duke of Anjou at Antwerp gave occasion to continued
                    festivities, and the opportunity was seized in order to put in practice that
                    which the declaration of King Philip had intimated, and promised to reward.
                    After a dinner on the Duke of Anjou’s birth-day, being the 18th of March, and as
                    William was quitting the dining-room on the way to his private apartment, a
                    young man stepped forward to offer what purported to be a petition. Whilst he
                    read the paper, the treacherous suppliant discharged a pistol at his head; the
                    ball struck him under the left ear, and passed out at the right cheek. As he
                    tottered and fell, the assassin drew forth a poniard to complete his crime by
                    suicide, but he was instantly put to death by the attendant guards.</p>
                <p>Papers found upon the assassin proved him to be a Spaniard, a native of Bilboa,
                    and clerk to a Spanish merchant of Antwerp. They showed that he had received the
                    sacrament and confessed previous to the attempt, and that he was encouraged to
                    the deed by prayers found amongst his papers in the Spanish language, one of
                    them addressed to the angel Gabriel, imploring his intercession with God and the
                    Virgin to aid him in the completion of his object. This young fanatic was shown
                    afterwards to have been instigated to the crime by his master and a Dominican
                    monk, who were tried, and, before their execution, made a full confession of
                    their criminality. It is asserted by D’Ewes, that the Jesuits, some years
                    afterwards, solemnly gathered the remains of the three pretended martyrs, and
                    exhibited them as holy relics for public veneration.</p>
                <p>Severe as was the wound inflicted on the prince, it did not prove fatal; but
                    within three months he had so far recovered as to be able to accompany the Duke
                    of Anjou to Ghent, Bruges, and the other great towns of Flanders, in each of
                    which the same ceremony of inauguration was performed. On each occasion he had
                    taken the prescribed oaths to maintain and preserve to the states-general the
                    several rights and privileges they had inherited from the succession of princes
                    who had for a long period governed the country. The duke soon began to compare
                    the power he possessed with that held by the unlimited monarchs of the rest of
                    Europe. He was found to be intemperate, inconstant, and utterly unprincipled;
                    and the French officers who surrounded him, and alone enjoyed his confidence,
                    had no great difficulty, whilst nourishing his discontent at his limited power,
                    in exciting him to take the most treacherous steps to extend his own authority,
                    and to extinguish the liberties of the people which he had been invited to
                    defend, and had sworn to maintain.</p>
                <p>Amongst these privileges, that of refusing to admit foreign troops to garrison
                    the fortified towns was the one which those towns most zealously exercised.
                    Though the smaller towns had overlooked slight infractions of this privilege,
                    yet the larger ones, especially Antwerp, most sedulously preserved it. Whilst a
                    few of Anjou’s troops were admitted into some places, the main body was either
                    encamped or cantoned in quarters in the villages.</p>
                <p>He had secretly resolved on seizing on the towns, and sent orders to his officers
                    to take possession in his name of Dunkirk, Bruges, Termonde, and some other
                    places, reserving to himself the attempt to be made upon Antwerp. To prepare for
                    the execution of his project, he had ordered his numerous army, composed chiefly
                    of French and Swiss, to approach the city, and form a camp very near to it. On
                    the 17th of January 1583, having risen earlier than usual, under the pretext of
                    going out afterwards to review his army in the camp, he set out at noon,
                    accompanied by his guard of 200 horse; and when he had reached the second
                    drawbridge, one of his officers gave the preconcerted signal for an attack on
                    the Flemish guard, by pretending that he had fallen and,broken his leg. The duke
                    called out to his followers, “Courage, courage; the town is ours.” The guard of
                    Flemings at the gate was soon despatched; and the French troops, which waited
                    without to the number of 3000, rushed in furiously, shouting the war-cry, “Town
                    taken, town taken; kill, kill !” The astonished but intrepid citizens,
                    recovering from their confusion, instantly flew to arms. All differences in
                    religion and politics were forgotten in the common danger to their freedom.
                    Catholics and Protestants, men and women, rushed alike to the conflict. The
                    ancient spirit of Flanders seemed to animate all. Workmen, armed only with the
                    instruments of their various trades, started from their shops, and flung
                    themselves on the enemy. Those who had fire-arms, after expending their bullets,
                    took from their pockets and pouches pieces of money, which they bent between
                    their teeth, and used for charging their arquebuses. The French were driven
                    successively from the streets and ramparts; and the cannons planted on the
                    latter were immediately turned against the reinforcements which attempted to
                    enter the town. The French were beaten everywhere; the Duke of Anjou saved
                    himself by flight, and reached Termonde after the perilous exploit of passing
                    through a large tract of inundated country. His loss in this atrocious
                    enterprise amounted to 1500, whilst that of the citizens did not exceed eighty
                    men. The attempts of the same kind simultaneously made at Dunkirk and at
                    Termonde succeeded, but they failed in all the other places.</p>
                <p>The consternation first, and soon afterwards the indig <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558269" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8269-0108"/>nation, of the whole of
                    Belgium, excited by this act of treachery, is indescribable; but the Prince of
                    Orange alone was cool and collected, and on the Duke of Anjou making abundance
                    of professions of his repentance, of his submission, and of future fidelity and
                    obedience to the states, he was disposed to some kind of reconciliation,
                    especially as his brother the king of France despatched a special envoy to
                    intercede for him. A treaty was then commenced, the tendency of which was to
                    restore to Anjou the command of the troops, with some new security against
                    treachery on his part. He had in the mean time withdrawn to France to escape the
                    general burst of indignation, and there his worthless existence was suddenly
                    terminated, as some thought by poison, which in that day was commonly supposed
                    to be the cause of unexpected death. He had then scarcely attained his
                    twenty-ninth year.</p>
                <p>The conduct of the Prince of Orange in trying to reconcile the states to the
                    re-assumption of command by Anjou, although it could not arise from any selfish
                    views, since he might himself have easily obtained the supreme power, was
                    misunderstood by many of the Belgians, but more especially by the people of
                    Antwerp. Unable to comprehend the greatness of his mind, they openly accused him
                    of having joined with the French for their subjugation, and concealed a body of
                    that detested nation in the citadel. The populace rushed to the place, and
                    having minutely examined it, were convinced of their own folly and the prince’s
                    innocence. He scorned to demand their punishment for such an outrageous calumny,
                    but he was not the less afflicted at it. He took the resolution of quitting
                    Flanders; and he retired into Zealand, where he was better known, and
                    consequently more trusted.</p>
                <p>The cities of Belgium which were free from the domination of Spain were all more
                    or less subject to the most violent political agitations, the bad effects of
                    which were not lightened, but rather increased, by being mixed up with the
                    prevailing religious differences of the times. The evils of this state of public
                    feeling displayed themselves more extensively, and during a longer period, in
                    the city of Ghent, the capital of the province of West Flanders, than in any
                    other part of the Netherlands. The persecutions of the Spaniards had driven the
                    Flemings to a state of frenzy, which destroyed the exercise of reflection.
                    Hatred to Spain begat hatred to that which Spain most cherished, the Catholic
                    religion; and it is not to be wondered that the lower classes in the cities
                    should, from passion rather than from reason, have taken part with those more
                    intelligent persons who had embraced the Protestant religion; and it must be
                    added, that the persons who envied the property of the convents and churches,
                    and who were anxious to seize upon that wealth and convert it to their own use,
                    vastly augmented the adherents of the Protestant party. In Ghent, two men had
                    taken advantage of these circumstances, and thereby gained an unbounded and most
                    noxious ascendency over the public mind. John de Hembise is described by
                    Vandervynkt as a man descended from a junior branch of a good family, educated,
                    fluent and even eloquent, and well informed on every subject relating to his own
                    country; but, on the other hand, a sceptic, destitute of morals, capable of
                    assuming any character either sacred or profane, impatient of all control, and
                    treating with contempt all who were in superior stations. Besides these
                    qualities, his history shows that he was bold, despotic, and imperious in
                    prosperity, but did not exhibit the same courage in adversity. The other,
                    Francis de Kethule, lord of Ryhove, was also of a distinguished family, but of a
                    character similar to Hembisc, only much more violent and imprudent; but those
                    qualities were somewhat checked by his adherence to the Prince of Orange, whose
                    calm wisdom exercised at times some influence on his conduct.</p>
                <p>These two men, with all the qualifications necessary for demagogues, were allied
                    with many of the respectable families of the city, amongst whom they gained some
                    partisans; but their chief adherents were furnished in part by the burghers, and
                    by almost all the mere populace. Though afterwards they differed, at first they
                    acted in concert; and as they most vehemently preached nothing but liberty, they
                    were soon regarded by the populace as the heroes and the liberators of their
                    country. The Duke of Arschot had been appointed governor of the city, with the
                    approbation of the Prince of Orange; and, though opposed by both the demagogues,
                    he was seated in the dignity. He had drawn to him as a council the Bishops
                    ofBruges and Ypres, the high bailiffs of Ghent and Courtray, and the governor of
                    Oudenarde, and other eminent magistrates. Whilst they were assembled in council,
                    the popular leaders collected a force of the lower classes, and, without even
                    allowing him to dress himself, led him away to prison. They then seized the
                    arsenal, armed the population, and soon had under their command a body of 20,000
                    well-armed and resolute men. The constitution of the city was changed, and the
                    public treasury was seized upon, by the new rulers, who assumed the title of
                    consuls; Ryhove being placed in the command of the military, and Hembise at the
                    head of the civil power. The two consuls then nominated eighteen of their own
                    partisans, to whom was intrusted the supreme power of what they denominated the
                    republic. The several guilds were ordered to elect officers, amongst whom the
                    ranks of colonels, captains, and other grades, were distributed; and the more
                    wealthy and respectable inhabitants were excluded from any participation in
                    power. The influence of the other states of Belgium, headed by the Prince of
                    Orange, was ineffectual in checking the violent proceedings of the city, further
                    than in procuring the release of the imprisoned duke. The two heads of the
                    democracy fortified the city, and thus gave employment to the poor, and
                    extracted from the rich the means of paying them. The rich abbeys and other
                    religious houses were plundered, the occupiers turned out destitute, and the
                    buildings converted into barracks for the troops and labourers. Whilst one of
                    the consuls ruled in the city, the other issued forth with detachments of
                    troops, laid waste the surrounding country, and subjected several of the towns
                    in the vicinity to the horrid despotism exercised in the name of liberty. When
                    any persons were known or suspected to be averse to the system of terror, if
                    they were rich they were amerced in very heavy sums, or, if not able to furnish
                    the requisitions, were, without trial, exiled, and in some instances put to
                    death in secret. These calamities were so deeply felt that many of the gentry
                    and burghers became voluntary exiles, and removed to France, to Holland, or to
                    Brabant, so that when thus left only to the demagogues and the democrats, they
                    found they had put in movement a machine which they could neither direct nor
                    stop. When the people became tired of anarchy, and sick of the sufferings they
                    had caused and endured, the Prince of Orange determined to proceed to Ghent.
                    Hembise did all in his power, by his harangues to the populace, to prevent his
                    admission; but with the venality of such assemblages his eloquence now failed.
                    He was seized with a cowardly panic, and attempted to withdraw privately by
                    night. He had entered a boat to descend the river, when one of his partisans
                    recognised him, and exclaimed, “Point de fuite; tu nous as mené dans le
                    bourbier; il faut nous en tirer, ou périr avec nous.” He then made him land from
                    the boat, and followed him to the city, where he remained in private, employed
                    without success in exciting tumults, whilst the prince was in the city.</p>
                <p>William of Orange reached Ghent in August 1579, and in a short time extinguished
                    the spirit of democracy; but <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558282"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8282-0109"/>though he restored the ancient constitution, and
                    re-established some of the ancient magistracy, he could not restore the wealth
                    and the industry that had been destroyed or dissipated under the reign of
                    democratic terror. Hembise retired from the city for four years; and, though it
                    is anticipating the course of our narrative, it may be stated here, that, having
                    again acquired a degree of influence, he made use of it to betray the city into
                    the hands of the Spaniards, his mortal enmity to whom had been the original
                    cause of his popularity. But he failed in his purpose. His designs were detected
                    and exposed; his partisans abandoned him; and he was carried before the criminal
                    tribunal, where, having defended himself very feebly, he was condemned to death.
                    The sentence of decapitation was executed on the 4th of August 1584. His
                    coadjutor Ryhove had before withdrawn from Flanders, and found an asylum in
                    Holland, where, after a long illness, which terminated in fixed insanity, he
                    died.</p>
                <p>The transactions which have been noticed with regard to the Archduke Mathias, the
                    Duke of Anjou, and the demagogues of Ghent, were the principal causes that led
                    to the submission of the ten provinces of the Netherlands to the crown of Spain.
                    Others, however, contributed in a greater or less degree to the same result. The
                    differences between the Catholics and their opponents pervaded every one of the
                    towns; and as the respective parties preponderated in any one place, they had no
                    hesitation in persecuting the others. It was of little avail that the states had
                    issued a law called that of the peace of religion, by which, in places where
                    there were a hundred families and upwards of either faith, they should be
                    allowed the public exercise of their worship; and in the smaller places the
                    majority should have the churches, but the minority might open others. This
                    might have tended to peace, if not to union; but, to the great mortification of
                    the Prince of Orange, the clergy of both parties, by their influence over their
                    followers, rendered the edict inoperative, and seem to have increased rather
                    than abated the animosity. In Holland and in Zealand, however, there was a
                    greater degree of religious tranquillity than in the southern provinces.</p>
                <p>These troubles paved the way to the submission or conquest of the greater part of
                    the ten provinces. This was the more easily effected, because the people,
                    wearied out with their sufferings, had learned that security to their persons
                    and their property was of far greater benefit to them than any of those kinds of
                    liberty which the several adverse parties pretended to bestow on them. The
                    assassination of the Prince of Orange in 1584, though not contrived by the
                    Prince of Parma, but at the court of Madrid, was communicated to that commander
                    before its perpetration, and he prepared the measures to be adopted when the
                    iniquitous design should have been consummated. In the consternation produced by
                    that event, those parts of Belgium which were free from the Spanish dominion
                    sent their representatives to· An twerp, where they were joined by others from
                    the Dutch states. In this assembly it was resolved to offer the sovereignty of
                    the whole to the king of France; and ambassadors were immediately despatched to
                    Paris. The king, Henry III., received them with great distinction; but his
                    affairs were so much embarrassed with his internal disorders that he found
                    himself unable to tender any effectual aid to the Netherlands. On the
                    termination of this embassy, another was despatched to England tomake a similar
                    tender of the sovereignty to Queen Elizabeth. She civilly declined to accept the
                    supreme power thus offered, but agreed to treat them as allies, and to send to
                    their aid an army of 6000 men, and large pecuniary supplies. This was instantly
                    performed; and her favourite, the Earl of Leicester, repaired to Holland, where
                    the towns of Flushing, the Brett, and the fortress of Rammekens, were delivered
                    up to him as securities. As that force only entered Holland, the conduct and the
                    operations of it belong rather to the history of Holland than to that of those
                    parts of the Netherlands which were soon afterwards wholly separated from it,
                    and to which we here direct our attention.</p>
                <p>Whilst these negotiations were in progress, the Prince of Parma on his side was
                    active and acute, and contrived to enter into treaties with some of the leading
                    inhabitants of those cities in Flanders which had hitherto resisted the Spanish
                    dominion. By various measures, applied in various ways, he obtained possession,
                    first of Ypres, and afterwards of Bruges and some other places, by which he was
                    enabled to cut off the supply of stores and provisions from Ghent. He then
                    formed a camp sufficiently near to complete the blockade. Scarcity soon
                    appeared, and was followed by almost absolute famine. Agitations and factions
                    reigned in the city; yet, by flattering reports of succours expected, the
                    orators of the populace were for a time enabled to delay surrendering. But at
                    length a capitulation was agreed to in September 1584. The terms were, that in
                    future the Catholic worship alone should be performed, and no other be
                    tolerated; that all who chose to do so should be allowed two years to dispose of
                    their property and to leave the city; that the clergy should be established in
                    their property as before the troubles, and the city should pay as a contribution
                    the sum of two hundred thousand florins, and allot quarters to the troops. A few
                    of the most violent of the partisans were excepted from the general indemnity.
                    At first the number of exceptions were limited to six, and then reduced to
                    three; but these persons were, after an imprisonment of a few weeks, liberated,
                    and allowed to depart from the city.</p>
                <p>During the operations against Ghent, the Prince of Parma had begun his
                    preparations for the most important of all his military designs, the capture of
                    Antwerp. With this view his army was gradually drawn around it, and a camp
                    formed at Bevern, near the city. As a part of the preparation for this object,
                    it was necessary to menace the large cities of the province of Brabant which
                    still repudiated the Spanish power, such as Brussels and Mechlin, and to seize
                    upon those which were less formidable. Parma took first Vilvorde, and then
                    Willebrocke; and the capture of these places soon caused scarcity to be felt in
                    the cities. Brabant, now so well cultivated and fertile, had suffered most
                    severely during the troubles; and, for some months after the last harvest,
                    whatever could be obtained was conveyed to the city of Antwerp, to provide
                    against the impending siege by the one party, or to furnish the army destined to
                    attack it by the other. Brussels first felt the misery of famine, and the
                    interception of a convoy destined to supply its wants raised the discontent of
                    the inhabitants to such a height, that Temple, an English officer in command of
                    the garrison, and the civil governor, were obliged to send deputies to the camp
                    of the Prince of Parma to treat for the surrender. A capitulation was signed on
                    the 10th of March 1585, the garrison retired, and the inhabitants submitted to
                    Spain. The same causes produced the same effects a few weeks afterwards in the
                    city of Mechlin and the smaller fortified town of Brabant; and thus, Maestricht
                    having been captured five years before, the whole of the ten southern provinces
                    of the Netherlands, except the city of Antwerp, were subjected, after a most
                    vehement struggle of twenty years’ duration, to their former cruel and
                    intolerant sovereign.</p>
                <p>As the siege and capture of Antwerp was in its day considered as the most
                    important military occurrence of the age, the history of its progress merits a
                    detailed notice. The city of Antwerp stands upon the right bank of the river
                    Scheldt. The stream is deep and the tides are rapid, so that the largest vessels
                    could approach its banks.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558295" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8295-0110"/>
                <p>Below the city the river divides into several large branches or arms, and thus
                    forms the islands which compose the province of Zealand, by which there are safe
                    communications by water with the several towns of that province, which was then
                    in the possession of the Dutch. These towns were filled with seamen, and they
                    were in possession of powerful naval armaments, and of arsenals where other
                    vessels could be equipped with facility. They also contained abundance of
                    storehouses filled with all the implements of war, and others provided with
                    necessary articles for subsistence, such as were indispensable in a large city
                    when in a state of siege. The mouth of this river on both sides was commanded by
                    powerful forts in the bands of the friends of the defenders of the city, but
                    which at the commencement of the siege were taken by the assailants. By the
                    possession of Ghent, which the Spaniards had gained soon after the commencement
                    of the siege, and of the other strong places near the upper part of the river,
                    no means of relieving the besieged could be drawn from that quarter; but
                    supplies, which were conveyed by the Scheldt from Friesland, forbade the
                    expectation that by means of famine the city could ever be compelled to
                    surrender. The extent of the works surrounding the city, the strength of the
                    citadel that commanded it, the number of men under arms within it, and
                    especially the tried courage, skill, and inflexibility of the commander, whom
                    Prince Maurice of Orange, the successor of the assassinated prince, bad
                    recommended, rendered inoperative all the efforts on land to reduce the
                    place.</p>
                <p>The commander was Philippe de Marnix, lord of St Aldegonde, and generally known
                    by that name; he was the intimate confidant of William, and one of those who
                    opened the first scene of the opposition to the tyrannical measures of the king
                    of Spain.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Parma soon saw that, in spite of the forts which he had erected on
                    the banks of the river, the vessels from Friesland, laden with provisions, could
                    with little risk, when favoured by the rapid tide and a good breeze, pass to the
                    city and return with very little or no injury. He then conceived and planned the
                    execution of a bridge over the stream, at a bend of the river near to Lillo and
                    Liefenschoeck; and thus, by shutting up the passage, hoped to reduce the city by
                    famine. At the spot selected, the breadth of the stream is 2400 feet, or about
                    half a mile. The execution of this work was intrusted to a celebrated Italian
                    engineer named Barroccio, who had been sent by King Philip for the purpose, as
                    soon as the project of the duke had been communicated to him; a man well
                    calculated to carry into effect the great project which Parma had originally
                    formed in his own mind, without intimation from any of the general officers,
                    many of whom opposed his views, as being impracticable. The first steps were the
                    erecting of two strong forts on the opposite sides of the river, and then
                    throwing forward two piers from each side, which were to correspond in the
                    middle when half the waterway was closed. The piers were formed of stakes driven
                    firmly into the bed of the river, and rested on hard sand below the mud; and
                    they were cemented with masses of earth and stones, and, when at a proper
                    height, were covered with planks, and defended by parapets, on which cannon were
                    mounted.</p>
                <p>The vacancy between the termination of the two piers was filled up by a bridge of
                    boats fastened together by chains, and secured by anchors. They were thus moored
                    so as to yield to the rising and falling of the tide, and were armed with a
                    great number of cannon. For the construction of this work, almost all the labour
                    of the country was put in requisition. Carpenters, shipwrights, smiths, and even
                    masons, were all compelled to work at this erection; whilst great numbers of
                    other men were employed in cutting down the trees in the neighbouring district
                    of Waaslande to furnish materials. Heavy contributions were extorted from every
                    part under the Spanish authority; and thus, as neither money nor labour was
                    spared, a few months were sufficient to complete the bridge, which was twelve
                    feet in breadth, so that eight men could march abreast, and were under the
                    protection of wooden bulwarks, which were musket-proof.</p>
                <p>But the work was not suffered to proceed without some interruptions. The
                    Antwerpers burned some and captured others of the boats on which the bridge was
                    to be erected, and many vessels succeeded in forcing their passage through the
                    unfinished bridge, and conveyed cargoes of provisions to the besieged. Some of
                    these, however, being captured, orders were issued in Zealand that no single
                    ship should attempt to force a passage, but should wait till a fleet had been
                    collected, to proceed in concert. By way of creating a diversion in favour of
                    the besieged, an attempt was made by the Frieslanders under Prince Hohenlohe to
                    seize the city of Bois-le-Duc, then garrisoned by Spaniards; but though at first
                    successful, the ultimate issue was a repulse, with considerable loss of life to
                    the Frieslanders.</p>
                <p>The approach of winter caused the Spaniards some apprehension for the fate of
                    their yet unfinished work, and for a time totally suspended it; and when the
                    frost broke up, some fears were entertained that the great masses of ice brought
                    down from the upper part of the river might carry away the works by their
                    weight; but fortunately the larger bodies of ice grounded near the piles, and
                    melting there, caused little or no damage. When the ice had thus been removed,
                    the work was completed, and the entrance closed. Other contrivances were adopted
                    to impede the passage of ships, especially some rafts, composed of thirty
                    vessels loaded with ballast, and armed with sharp iron points to entangle
                    vessels attempting to ascend.</p>
                <p>This prodigious work, which required six months to complete, so securely barred
                    the entrance of provisions and stores from Zealand, that the destruction of it
                    required the most sedulous exertions of the besieged; and efforts were
                    immediately commenced to effect that object. An Italian by birth, but who had
                    been long established in Antwerp, named Giambelli, had intrusted to him the
                    construction of the engines to destroy the bridge, and to open a passage for a
                    fleet loaded with provisions which had been prepared in Zealand.</p>
                <p>The consternation excited in Antwerp at the prospect of the completion of the
                    bridge was so great, that when known it was considered as the operation of the
                    Evil Spirit; but that view soon gave way to a firm resolution to counteract this
                    work of the demons. Giambelli, being skilful as a fire-worker as well as an
                    engineer, determined, by means of explosion and mining, to destroy the bridge.
                    To effect his purpose, he required three of the largest ships lying at Antwerp
                    to be used as mines, and sixty smaller and flat-bottomed vessels to be converted
                    into fire-ships; but motives of economy had such weight with the inhabitants,
                    that be was compelled to contract the plan of his operations. He could only
                    prevail on the council to give him two ships, and those of small size, and
                    thirty-two flat-bottomed barges. The mining-ships had a magazine built of
                    masonry three feet in height, the same in breadth, and sixty feet in length, to
                    be filled with gunpowder. It was covered with a roof formed of mill and other
                    hard stones, six feet in thickness, that by its weight the explosion should take
                    effect in a sideway direction. These mines were charged with between six and
                    seven thousand pounds of the finest gunpowder, and between it and the roof was
                    laid a vast quantity of stones, iron bars, and all such other pieces of iron as
                    could be most easily got together. Through a hole in the mine, a due quantity of
                    match to ignite it was introduced. The whole was on the outside so finished as
                    to have the appearance of only a <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558308"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8308-0111"/>common fire-ship. The interior of the mining-ships
                    were furnished with mechanical clock-work, by which, when the hand reached a
                    certain point, it would move a spring connected with a musket-lock, by which the
                    match would kindle, and the explosion would be produced. The flat-bottomed
                    vessels were filled with combustibles to act as fire-ships, as the destruction
                    of the bridge was to depend on the mines; but thtese were thought necessary to
                    hide the main design of destroying the bridge by the floating volcanoes, and to
                    attract the attention of the enemy’s artillery whilst the volcanoes were getting
                    to their proper station. This formidable fleet, on the 4th of April, at the
                    close of the day, departed from Antwerp, at the moment of the first reflux of
                    the tide. First proceeded a small fireboat, then the thirty-two fire-ships, in
                    four tiers of eight each, fastened together with chains. The two floatingmines
                    closed the squadron. The direction of the vessels was intrusted to a number of
                    boats, well manned with rowers, by which means the whole was brought into and
                    kept in the middle of the stream.</p>
                <p>The report of some great intended effort of the besieged had been spread in the
                    Spanish army, and proper measures of watchfulness were adopted, by strengthening
                    the guards on the forts, on the banks of the river, and on the bridge, so that,
                    at the first appearance of the squadrdn, each corps was at its proper post,
                    waiting tranquilly the approach of the enemy. The outposts on the river first
                    observed the fire-boat in flames, and then the others appeared with their
                    burning fires, hiding the mining vessels in their rear. Every man was quickly in
                    motion. The whole bridge, from one end to the other, was crowded with troops, as
                    well as the forts at each end of it, and the batteries on both shores; and each
                    gunner stood with his linstock ready to discharge the cannon. The Duke of Parma
                    was himself present giving his orders, and observing the astonishing spectacle.
                    Not only the combustibles in the vessels, but the vessels themselves, appeared
                    to be in flames. The stream was illuminated, and the bank blazed with the
                    reflection. The squadron had approached to within two thousand feet of the
                    bridge, when the preparation of the mines was completed, and the boats that had
                    towed them cut off and removed to a distance to wait the expected explosion. The
                    squadron, thus too early left to the sole direction of the tide, was drifted in
                    different directions. Some of the fire-ships got on shoals, and there burned out
                    without doing any mischief; the smallest of the two mines got on shore, sprung a
                    leak, and sunk; others of the fire-ships became entangled in the floating
                    vessels, and burnt themselves out. All danger seemed to the Spaniards to be
                    over, and they enjoyed their jests at the expense of those who had expended so
                    much time, labour, and money, so ineffectually. In a few minutes, however, the
                    largest of the mining-ships descended the stream, and fell on the bridge on the
                    Flemish side, near to where the pier terminated in the fort. The duke was
                    standing near it, and, urged by a young officer who had been an engineer, and
                    knew the skilΓ of Giambelli, to retire from the spot on which he stood, he
                    refused to do so, when the young man seized him by the cloak and pulled him
                    away. At that moment the great magazine exploded. The report and the shock were
                    tremendous. Even the bottom of the river was turned up by its force, and rushed
                    with impetuosity over the banks. A concussion of the earth, resembling an
                    earthquake, was felt over a circle of ten miles. The contents of the floating
                    volcano, mingled with the ruins of the bridge, with shot, weapons, and the
                    bodies of soldiers and sailors, were blown to an invisible height in the air,
                    and in their fall were scattered over so vast an extent, that scarcely any
                    particle of what they had been was distinguishable. The Duke of Parma with his
                    staff'·officers were thrown down senseless, and himself severely wounded by one
                    of the beams, which was forced between his head and his shoulders. The Marquis
                    of R∙ichebourg, with two other superior officers, Roubais and Billi, near him,
                    were killed, and more than 800 soldiers perished. The casualties were produced,
                    some by the flood, others by flames; and the fragments of their bodies were
                    scattered far and wide.</p>
                <p>When the duke had recovered from his fainting, he immediately gave directions to
                    repair in some degree the damage which his works had sustained. In the night
                    when the explosion took place, and the following day, expectation was alive, in
                    both the opposing forces, for the appearance of the Zealand fleet, to the
                    progress of which the remains of the bridge would have been no obstacle. By some
                    want of combination, that fleet was detained, and the prince inspired those
                    under his command with so much energy, that, directing their united powers to
                    one object, they were enabled, by sinking boats and vessels in the open places,
                    by driving piles, and by fastening chains, to oppose such powerful impediments
                    as prevented the Zealanders from attempting to force the passage up to
                    Antwerp.</p>
                <p>The besieged, although thus disappointed, did not give way to despair. Giambelli
                    prepared another floating mine, to which was given the presumptuous name of the
                    End of the War; but this machine grounded in descending the stream, and was
                    destroyed without producing any effect on the enemy. There was one resource left
                    to the besieged, which was recommended by the example of the siege of Leyden,
                    where it had been attended with success. It was that of inundating the whole
                    country between Lillo and Stabroch, including the Spanish camp at Bevern. In
                    order to accomplish this, it was necessary to cut through the dike or bank which
                    defended it against the irruption of the Eastern Scheldt. The whole plain
                    intended to be covered with water was traversed by a high and wide counter-dike,
                    called the Dike of Couvestien; and the Duke of Parma, knowing its importance,
                    had early taken possession of it, and had protected it by several strong forts.
                    The garrison, aided by the Zealanders, made two spirited attacks on this series
                    of works, in the latter of which the blood of both parties was most profusely
                    shed. Each fought with the most desperate valour; but finally the confederates
                    were repulsed, leaving three thousand dead upon the dike, or at its base, and
                    the Spaniards lost more than eight hundred men. The unsuccessful issue of these
                    several efforts had its effect on the population of Antwerp. The scarcity of
                    provisions already felt, and the prospect of the famine which evidently
                    impended, made some clamorous and most anxious for peace. This disposition led
                    to negotiations for surrender, and the commander Aldegonde himself repaired to
                    the camp of Parma to open a treaty; but the duke would not listen to the terms
                    proposed, which required an amnesty for all past transactions, and permission to
                    the Protestants to be allowed to follow their own religious opinions. Other
                    negotiations followed, and, whilst they were depending, the surrender of Mechlin
                    to the Spaniards cut off' the little hope of a supply of provisions which had
                    hitherto existed. The clamours of the inhabitants became so loud, that the
                    council and the commander were compelled to yield: they proceeded in a body to
                    the Spanish camp, and there, after a close siege of fourteen months’ duration, a
                    capitulation was signed on the 17th of August 1585. The terms of it were, that
                    the city should submit itself to the king of Spain in his character of Duke of
                    Brabant; that all past events should be forgotten; that the Catholic religion
                    alone should be exercised, and that those of other persuasions be allowed four
                    years to dispose of their property and withdraw; that the churches should be
                    rebuilt at the expense of the citizens, who were also to present to the Spanish
                    army 400,000 ducats (about L.38,000), and, as longas Holland continued in a
                    state of hostility with Spain <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558321" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8321-0112"/>to maintain a garrison of
                    2000 men. Aldegonde, the commander, was also, by the terms of the treaty,
                    prohibited from bearing arms against Spain for one year.</p>
                <p>The capture of Antwerp was one of those important events the consequences of
                    which became of less weight as time advanced; but these consequences were
                    ultimately more in favour of the vanquished than of the triumphant party. Both
                    parties had been weakened by the long contests which had been carried on; and
                    both had nearly exhausted their powers in the struggle, which left them in such
                    a state that a great degree of inactivity prevailed. Spain had acquired in the
                    ten provinces a full authority, which no exertions on their part could shake
                    off. The united provinces had also secured their independence and
                    self-government, and, from the nature of their country, and the adaptation
                    thereto of their naval power, were enabled to bid defiance to any attempts made
                    to subjugate them to the power of Spain.</p>
                <p>At this period the warlike operations between what may be called Hôlland and
                    Belgium had been suspended, because in the latter country no resources were left
                    to the government, and no aid was sent by King Philip, who was hindered from
                    doing so by his treasures being required to secure the acquisition he had lately
                    made of the kingdom of Portugal, and by the expenditure he applied to the
                    equipment of that force destined for the conquest of England which had been
                    pompously styled the invincible armada.</p>
                <p>Some contemporary authors have assigned another cause of Philip’s withholding
                    supplies to the Netherlands, namely, a jealousy of the Duke of Parma, which led
                    that suspicious monarch to apprehend that, seeing Belgium to he of far greater
                    value than his dominions in Italy, feeling his own great popularity, and
                    observing the general hatred of the Spaniards, he might be induced to assume for
                    himself the sovereignty.</p>
                <p>The capture of Antwerp, though celebrated with most extraordinary demonstrations
                    of joy in all parts of the ten provinces, was to them only the consummation of
                    that misery and depression under which they had so long suffered. That city had
                    been the focal point to which the commerce which enriched the country had been
                    attracted. In the hands of the Spaniards, it was closed from the sea by the
                    Dutch being in possession of the mouth of the river on both sides. The disputes
                    about religion, which had distracted the two opposing parties, were quieted by
                    the absence of the Protestant portion of the merchants and manufacturers, who
                    carried with them what could be obtained for their fixed capital, and directed
                    their fluctuating and scattered funds to be transmitted to the places to which
                    they had removed. Amsterdam rose, with a rapidity hitherto unknown, to be a vast
                    commercial place; the other towns in Holland shared in the advantage; and much
                    of it was imported into London, Hamburg, and other foreign cities.</p>
                <p>According to Schiller, the reconciled provinces in the interior exhibited the
                    most deplorable spectacle. The inhabitants of the great towns had in a great
                    measure fallen victims to the united calamities of war, pestilence, and famine.
                    Large villages, which once contained· from two to three thousand inhabitants,
                    were absolutely abandoned to the wolves, who had become so numerous and fierce
                    that they attacked not merely decrepit persons and children, but strong and
                    full-grown men; the dogs, driven about by hunger, had become as ferocious as
                    other beasts of prey, and joined in large packs in hunting down cattle and men;
                    neither fields, nor woods, nor roads were to be distinguished by any visible
                    boundaries; all was an entangled mass of trees, weeds, and grass; so that many
                    who returned to take possession of their property could not find out the places
                    where their dwellings and fields had been. The prices of the necessaries of life
                    were so high, that persons of rank were compelled to dispose of whatever they
                    had to buy bread, and were often so reduced as to have recourse to open beggary
                    in the streets; whilst the poorer classes could only sustain life by food of the
                    worst and most unhealthy description. Few marriages were contracted, few
                    children born, and of these a great proportion were early carried off by
                    death.</p>
                <p>Although more properly belonging to an account of Holland, we cannot omit to
                    remark the great contrast between that country and Belgium at this particular
                    conjuncture. There the pecuniary contributions were extorted to a greater
                    extent, and with equal severity. There, by the increase of their shipping, no
                    scarcity nor any great enhancement of the prices of corn had been felt, as their
                    supply was copiously obtained from the shores of the Baltic; and the extension
                    of the fisheries supplied them amply with that kind of food, whilst within the
                    dikes the rich meadows yielded abundance of butter, cheese, and pork, with some
                    other kinds of meal. The heavy contributions for defence, as well as the means
                    of subsistence, were almost exclusively met by the rapid increase of a
                    profitable commerce. Their vessels sailed freely to the British kingdoms, to the
                    Baltic ports, to Italy, and even to the harbours of their enemy, King Philip,
                    both in Spain and in Portugal. The trade between the last-mentioned countries
                    and their settlements in Asia and America was rather in the hands of foreigners
                    than of natives, the Spanish houses of commerce scarcely giving more than their
                    names to the transactions. The Hollanders partook largely of this trade; their
                    manufactures and their cured herrings were much sought after, and gave them an
                    enormous profit; and though the trade was pronounced contraband by the Spanish
                    king, it could not be prevented; for, in spite of his ordonnances, it was so
                    profitable to both parties, that Dutch ships under Hamburg or Lubeck colours
                    were to be seen in all the ports of the Peninsula. By these and by other means
                    the linens of Holland were to be seen in all the shops of Mexico Brazil, and
                    Peru, the payment for which, besides the tropical productions, brought gold and
                    silver, coined or uncoined.</p>
                <p>The religious dissensions of the period here referred to gave rise to that
                    formation of national character which has since distinguished the two countries.
                    The Belgians, in their severe sufferings, attributed them all to the part which
                    the Protestants had taken in the first opposition to their Spanish king. This
                    begat hatred to the reformed religion, and as their priests did not fail to
                    impress that feeling, it was naturaI that augmented suffering should give it a
                    more intense bitterness. It is not therefore wonderful that the hatred of the
                    Belgians should have naturally grown, as it manifestly has done, to a degree of
                    bigotry in religious matters, which could not be much lessened by the attempt
                    made two centuries later to form the two parts into one kingdom under a
                    Protestant prince. The Hollanders, on the other hand, gradually became as
                    rigidly attached to the religion which they had embraced. It was naturally
                    associated in their minds with all the privations which they had at first
                    endured, with the victories they had afterwards gained, with the independence
                    they had accomplished, and with the flourishing state of the commerce they had
                    acquired. The emigrants, too, who joined them from Antwerp, Ghent, Brussels, and
                    the other places which had capitulated under the condition that the Protestants
                    should have time and permission to remove with their property, felt themselves
                    to be suffering banishment for their religion, and as martyrs became more
                    zealous in their adherence to the cause for which they had suffered. The Dutch
                    did not, like the Belgians, proscribe the adherents of the opposite religion,
                    but granted them permission to indulge in their own faith and ceremonies. This
                    was, however, more owing to the indifference of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558334" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8334-0113"/>princes of the house of
                    Orange on these subjects, and their views of the political and commercial
                    benefits of toleration, than to the absence of bigotry amongst the Dutch people
                    and their clergy. Very soon after their independence was universally
                    acknowledged, the states showed quite as much bigotry towards the professors of
                    the Protestant religion who differed on incomprehensible subjects with each
                    other, as had ever been exhibited by any Catholics in behalf of the rites,
                    ceremonies, and dogmas of their more magnificent church.</p>
                <p>Besides the difference of character between the people of these two portions of
                    the Netherlands, there was a great dissimilarity in their manners and domestic
                    habits, which may be the more properly noticed here, because its operation has
                    been continually active during the attempt made in the present day to
                    consolidate into one body politic the two nations, and because the attempt has
                    altogether failed.</p>
                <p>The southern or the ten provinces had grown up to be a great commercial,
                    manufacturing, and agricultural community. Each of these branches, acting upon
                    the other, had created that general prosperity which naturally leads to the
                    indulgence of hospitality, of jovial intercourse, and the enjoyment of luxuries
                    of various kinds, according to the relative state of the parties composing the
                    community. The fat burghers of Ghent and of Bruges, and the farmers of Flanders
                    with their ornamented strong horses, and their bedizened spouses, with their
                    ear-rings of silver or gold, were sometimes objects of ridicule and sometimes of
                    envy to the other people of Europe. Though not very ready to pay taxes to their
                    princes, they were always prepared to spend with cheerfulness on their own
                    gratifications, and in hospitality to their friends. Even the peasantry were
                    merry and cheerful in their village dances and their rural festivals, which some
                    of the best artists have painted, and made visible to subsequent ages by their
                    ιιn-perishing works. In short, if the people of Flanders were not profuse, they
                    were not rigidly economical. Some of the profits of the different branches of
                    industry were undoubtedly saved and added to the capital; but a considerable
                    portion was expended in gratifying the tastes for show, conveniencies, a
                    cheering table, and good strong beer. The Northern Netherlands, at the period
                    when the troubles began, were generally in a state of great poverty. Their trade
                    was inconsiderable, and their rural industry chiefly confined to the dairy. The
                    nature of the country recovered from the water, and protected by strong
                    embankments from being again flooded, required all the labour and all the
                    revenue that could be collected. The only way in which the population could
                    subsist was by the practice of the most severe parsimony in their dwellings,
                    their food, and their clothing. When the war commenced, they began to bestir
                    themselves in the fisheries and the foreign trade. The profits of this were slow
                    in arriving, and thus the habit of frugality was strengthened; and, when the
                    profit did arrive, so large a portion was required for the general defence that
                    none could prudently be devoted to purposes of luxury or splendour. Whilst
                    extravagance was wisely forbidden, it is generally thought that hospitality
                    disappeared. The domestic enjoyments were unsocial, and, except the practice of
                    extreme cleanliness, little engaged the attention of the families but the saving
                    of money. This representation of the national character of the Dutch has been
                    generally dwelt upon with more severity than it deserves; but it was necessary
                    in the circumstances, in which a tone was given to manners and morals, which has
                    been more or less strictly adhered to till the present time. The emigrants who
                    came to them from the southern division were at first compelled, by the losses
                    they had suffered, to practise the same parsimony as the former residents. They
                    too, therefore, at first from necessity, and at length from principle or habit,
                    became, equally with the others, habitually parsimonious and economical. It has
                    been deemed proper to notice in this place the growth and difference of national
                    character between the Dutch and the Belgians, because it will tend to throw some
                    light on the most recent transactions which have taken place relative to those
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Although Parma, after the conquest of Antwerp, did all in his power to conciliate
                    the inhabitants, and to relieve the distress to which they were reduced, he
                    could only succeed with the Catholic portion of the population. The Protestants
                    almost all left the country within the period allotted to them. The merchants
                    removed to Amsterdam, and the manufacturers to Haerlem and other towns in
                    Holland; and some of them repaired to England, and to the towns of the Hanseatic
                    League on the Continent. Whatever projects the duke may have formed to relieve
                    the pressure on the people under bis command, they were all soon suspended in
                    order to assist in the grand operation of King Philip to invade and conquer
                    England by his invincible armada. Whilst that aVmament was preparing in Spain,
                    and employing all the treasures of the monarchy, Parma, with no other resources
                    but such as he could draw from the impoverished Flemings, was enabled, by his
                    vigour, to fit out and arm a very powerful flotilla of vessels calculated for
                    the conveyance of troops, and to man them with sailors better adapted for the
                    stormy seas of the north than the Spaniards and Portuguese who manned the ships
                    of the grand armada which had sailed from Lisbon. The Belgian fleet was
                    collected in the Scheldt, and when completed found itself blockaded there by a
                    Dutch naval force under the grand pensioner De Witt, and by the forts
                    constructed at the mouth of the river, which were held by Zealanders. The
                    flotilla was then ordered to ascend the river to Ghent, and from thence to be
                    conveyed, either by old canals deepened for the occasion, or by new canals
                    constructed on purpose, or by land carriage, to the small streams of the Lise,
                    the Moere, and the Yperlee, which run to the ocean near Nieuport. They waited
                    there for the arrival of the armada, whilst the ships of war which were destined
                    to protect them were in the harbour of Dunkirk. The Hollanders, then, by a
                    series of admirable manoeuvres, under Justin de Nassau, so managed, that, with a
                    fleet of ninety sail of temporary armed vessels, they closed up every opening to
                    the sea from the mouth of the Scheldt to Dunkirk. When the Duke of Parma arrived
                    at Dunkirk to embark, he discovered the impediment, and found the exertions he
                    had made all rendered fruitless. The Spanish armada was then in the strait
                    between Dover and Calais; the commander, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, was in
                    difficulties, as the project was that Parma should land an army from his
                    flotilla, and seize upon London, then without defence. Medina Sidonias fleet had
                    been weakened by the various and spirited attacks made on it in the passage up
                    the British Channel, and he had lost some of his ships. Near Calais one large
                    galleon was taken by Sir Francis Drake, and the ship of Admiral D’Ocquendo was
                    burned; and the Spanish fleet, which could obtain no succour from the Flemings,
                    began to feel a scarcity of provisions. It was at anchor near Calais when six
                    fire-ships were equipped by Giambelli, the engineer who had directed the
                    operations at Antwerp, and who was now in the service of Queen Elizabeth. These
                    were kindled, and at two in the morning, with the wind and tide in their favour,
                    despatched towards the Spanish fleet. The Spaniards, who had seen the infernal
                    machines of Giambelli before Antwerp, thought these vessels were of the same
                    description, and spread consternation around them by the cries and shouting,
                    “The fires of Antwerp.” In the terror, many of the ships cut their cables and
                    fled before the wind, to avoid the flames of the fire-ships.</p>
                <p>The result of the Spanish expedition belongs to the history<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558347" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8347-0114"/> of that country or of
                    England; but the efforts of preparation made in the Netherlands pressed with
                    more weight on that country than many of their sacrifices during the war, and
                    the consequences were longer complained of.</p>
                <p>The wars in France between the Catholics and the Protestants engaged the
                    attention of the Duke of Parma, and some of the Flemish troops aided the cause
                    of the former, especially in raising the siege of Rouen. He was about to send a
                    more considerable expedition into that country’, and had proceeded as far as
                    Arras, in the abbey of which city he died, after a short illness, on the 3d of
                    December 1592, in the forty-fifth year of his age. After the termination of the
                    siege of Antwerp, he had sedulously attended to the interests of the dominions
                    retained by Spain. Agriculture was supported, and domestic manufactures were
                    encouraged; the taxes were lightened; and in the seven years that passed between
                    the surrender of Antwerp and the death of Parma, a visible improvement had taken
                    place in the appearance of the country. It had been freed from civil war, and
                    almost secured from invasion; the power of the law was so far restored as to
                    give security to property, and thus promote industry; and, though warlike
                    expeditions were undertaken, the troops only acted as auxiliaries, and were not
                    maintained from the resources of Belgium, but drew their supplies from the
                    countries in which they served.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Parma had been intrusted by King Philip with power to name his
                    successor, and, foreseeing his death, he had appointed the archduke,
                    Pierre-Ernest Count of Mansfeldt, a younger son of the emperor of Germany. The
                    army, which had been before prepared, was led by him into France, and there
                    signalised itself by the assistance which it afforded to the party of the
                    league. He did not return to Belgium till January 1594. During his absence
                    domestic tranquillity prevailed, though in the interval the Dutch, who had
                    chosen Prince Maurice to succeed William of Orange, had captured the towns
                    within the seven united provinces which were held by Spanish garrisons. These
                    were, Deventer, Zutphen, Groll, Breda, Nimwegen, Gertrudenburg, and Steenwyk;
                    and they formed a powerful barrier against any attempts that could be made by
                    the troops of Spain in Belgium.</p>
                <p>The archduke, obtaining no remittances from Spain, made application to the states
                    of Holland for entering into a pacific negotiation with them, and addressed his
                    letter to the states, which, by implication, was an acknowledgment of their
                    sovereignty. Commissioners from both parties met; but about that time the Dutch
                    had discovered some attempts at a plot for the assassination of their
                    stadtholder, Prince Maurice, his brother Prince Henry, the pensioner
                    Oldenbarnevelt, the chancellor Leoninus, and the general Aldegonde. A priest of
                    Namur having been taken disguised as a soldier, had confessed the criminal
                    design, and named his accomplices. The suspicion excited by this discovery was
                    strengthened by’ that of another project to be executed in England by a
                    Portuguese physician against the life of Queen Elizabeth. The Dutch would not
                    trust to Spain. The archduke was assured by them, and in most courteous terms,
                    that they could not trust to any terms which Spain could nullify by changing
                    their governor of the Netherlands; but they were willing to treat, and wished to
                    be at peace with the Catholic provinces. The archduke was mortified at the
                    rejection of his offers, and other vexations arose from the withholding
                    pecuniary supplies by Spain, so that when the army returned from France their
                    arrears could not be paid, and they mutinied and ravaged the province of
                    Hainault. At the same period the news arrived that Henry IV., who had been
                    reconciled to the church of Rome, and was peaceably seated on the throne of
                    France, had just declared war against Spain. These troubles, with others created
                    by his aspiring to the French sceptre, so affected the health of the archduke,
                    that after a short sickness he died at Brussels in February 1595.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded in authority by Count Fuentes, who, as a military man of
                    approved exertion, raised two armies, one to defend the frontier against the
                    Dutch, and another for the purpose of invading France. On the side of Holland
                    little was done, both parties watching each other without coming to any decisive
                    action. On the side of France, whilst the army of that country entered Hainault,
                    the force under Fuentes attacked the fertile episcopal state of Cambray, and
                    after a spirited siege took the capital city. But the vice-regency of Fuentes
                    was of short duration; for in the beginning of the next year the Archduke Albert
                    was appointed governor, and arrived at Brussels, bringing with him the Prince of
                    Orange, the eldest son of William the Silent, who had been carried away when
                    Count of Beuren in 1568, and kept as a prisoner in Spain during the whole period
                    of the glorious achievements of his father.</p>
                <p>This archduke was the fifth son of the Emperor Maximilian II., and nephew of
                    Philip, by whom he had been educated, and whose good opinion he had gained by
                    his prudence and valour whilst acting as viceroy in Portugal. Philip had
                    designed him to be the husband of his daughter Isabella, and intended to create
                    the provinces of the Netherlands into a sovereignty under his command. He was
                    sent, in the character of governor-general, to prepare the inhabitants for this
                    change, by conciliating the Flemings. Albert brought with him large pecuniary
                    supplies, which enabled him to continue the warlike operations against France
                    under the conduct of his predecessor Fuentes. In this he was in some measure
                    successful, as he was enabled to capture Calais, and to avoid a pitched battle
                    with Henry IV. king of France, who commanded his army in person. Whilst engaged
                    in these operations, he attempted to enter into some negotiations with the view
                    to a reconciliation with the Dutch; but the latter would not trust to the
                    sincerity of Spain. Though the Prince of Orange made some efforts, his
                    principles were doubtful; and, from the court and country in which his mind had
                    been formed, they objected to his visiting Holland. Civil communications took
                    place, but no progress towards conciliation was made, and the prince continued
                    to reside in Brussels in a state of inactivity till his death.</p>
                <p>The attempt of the archduke to draw the Dutch into a negotiation by the
                    instrumentality of the Prince of Orange having failed, he was induced to prepare
                    an army of 6000 men for the invasion of Holland; but his general, Varas, was
                    out-manoeuvred by Prince Maurice, who met him at Turnhout on the 24th of January
                    1597, and, with very little loss on his part, obtained a most decisive victory,
                    dispersing the Belgians, and capturing the whole of their artillery, stores, and
                    baggage, with many prisoners. This was the last considerable battle between the
                    armies of the two divisions of the Netherlands. The effect of this discomfiture
                    to Belgium was serious, inasmuch as it disorganized the army and deranged the
                    finances, whilst it increased the strength, and still more the confidence, of
                    their opponents.</p>
                <p>Philip of Spain, who now felt his end approaching, became desirous of putting an
                    end to the war with France, and also of establishing a general peace. At first
                    the negotiation comprehended the states of Holland; but, in May 1598, a peace
                    was concluded which did notextend to them. In a few days after, a public
                    communication was made, that the sovereignty of Burgundy and the Netherlands had
                    been transferred from the crown of Spain to the Archduke Albert and the Infanta
                    Isabella on their being betrothed, a ceremony which was performed by proxy on
                    the part of the Infanta, who was still in Spain; after which he was solemnly
                    inaugurated at Brussels on the 22d of August. He immediately departed for Spain
                    to complete <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558360" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8360-0115"
                    />the marriage, and left the government of his newly-acquired dominions in the
                    hands of his brother, the Cardinal Andrew of Austria, but placed the troops,
                    which amounted to 22,000 men, under the command of Mendoza, a Spaniard. As the
                    archduke travelled slowly, he was nearly six months before he reached Valencia
                    in Spain, where the marriage was consummated, and where soon afterwards he
                    received the intelligence of the death of King Philip, the father of his bride;
                    but it was then nearly six months more before the archduke and archduchess
                    arrived in the city of Brussels.</p>
                <p>In this year Mendoza, on the pretence of invading Holland, led his army into the
                    duchy of Cleves, and some of the neutral states in Westphalia, where the most
                    atrocious cruelties were exercised and the most extensive devastations
                    practised. They were, however, in some degree checked by Prince Maurice with a
                    much inferior force, and prevented from passing the Dutch frontiers. The
                    Germans, roused by their country being invaded, hastily mustered an army of
                    14,000 men, badly disciplined and equipped. Mendoza resolved to abandon his
                    projected invasion of Holland, and encounter the advancing Germans under the
                    Count de Lippe. In an action fought with these Germans, Mendoza was eminently
                    successful; with the loss of a few men, he was enabled to gain a victory, by
                    which his opponents, if not destroyed, were completely dispersed.</p>
                <p>These transactions kindled anew the patriotic spirit of the Hollanders, which
                    from inactivity had begun to languish, and which had also been checked by the
                    heavy taxes imposed on them, and by the demand of Queen Elizabeth for payment of
                    the supplies she had afforded them, accompanied with the orders for the recall
                    of her troops.</p>
                <p>But Prince Maurice knew how to inspire the Dutch with energy, and he obtained
                    some auxiliary troops from other countries. He had some Germans, some Swiss sent
                    by France, and troops both from England and Scotland, then separate kingdoms;
                    and he collected the whole disposable force of the Dutch confederacy, amounting
                    to about 17,000 men, whom he secretly transferred to the island of Walcheren,
                    and having plenty of craft adapted to the purpose, be suddenly shipped them, and
                    ascended the river Scheldt. He passed with the rapid flood-tide the city of
                    Antwerp, and was in hopes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> surprising Ghent, where he
                    had calculated on finding a party disposed to assist him. In this, however, he
                    was disappointed; and taking possession of some forts in the vicinity of that
                    city and of Bruges, he advanced to Nieuport, the siege of which place he
                    immediately commenced.</p>
                <p>The archduke was taken by surprise, and the Spanish forces were in a state of
                    mutiny on account of their pay being in arrear. In this crisis he acted with
                    great decision and celerity, and in a few days was able to collect a force of
                    12,000 men, which assembled at Ghent. Nieuport, which Maurice was besieging, is
                    on the sea-coast, amongst the downs or sand-hills, and in a country affording
                    but scanty supplies. The first movement of the archduke was to cut oft' the
                    retreat of the Hollanders, in which he was favoured by the occupation of Ghent
                    and Bruges. He also determined on raising the siege of Nieuport, and recaptured
                    all the forts which Maurice had taken, except those of Ostend. As he advanced he
                    came in contact with a part of the army of the Dutch, consisting of 3000 men,
                    commanded by Prince Ernest of Nassau, and composed for the most part of Scottish
                    infantry. These were attacked, and, to give time to the main body under Maurice
                    to form, they fought most gallantly; but, after a loss of nearly one third of
                    their number, and being completely separated from the rest of their army, they
                    were defeated, and at length threw themselves into Ostend. The archduke,
                    encouraged by this success, resolved to attack Prince Maurice. Most of his more
                    experienced and cautious officers recommended that the army should remain in
                    their position, where, by famine, they would shortly compel their opponents to
                    surrender. Others, especially the Spanish officers, elated by their recent
                    success, urged an immediate advance. Maurice, who had been surprised by the
                    rapid movements of the enemy, was in a most embarrassing situation. Before him
                    was the garrisoned town of his enemy, and behind him the main army, now more
                    than equal to his own in numbers, as well as in courage and discipline. The sea
                    was open to him, and such was his alarm, that he desired his brother, Prince
                    Frederick Henry, and a young prince of Holstein, with several young English
                    nobles, who were volunteers, to embark on board a vessel; but they all refused,
                    and resolved to face the threatened battle; and, as Maurice could not embark his
                    whole army on an open shore in the face of a superior force, he determined to
                    risk an action in which he had little cause to hope for a victory. It was the
                    resolution of despair rather than of hope. The vessels on the coast were ordered
                    to depart and range themselves before the port of Ostend.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked by the historians of the day, Van-dervynk and Grotius (the
                    latter of whom, then a youth of eighteen, was present), that each of the armies
                    was of such a variety of troops as to make them respectively an epitome of the
                    various nations of Europe. The force of Maurice consisted of Dutch, English,
                    Scotch, Germans, French, and Swiss, under Count Louis of Nassau, Sir Francis
                    Vere, Sir Horace Vere, and other English officers of considerable celebrity. The
                    archduke had under his command Spaniards, Italians, Walloons, Belgians, and
                    Irish, who were led by Mendoza, La Berlotta, and other celebrated officers. The
                    rival generals rode along their respective lines, addressed a few words of
                    encouragement to their men, and the contest commenced.</p>
                <p>On the 2d of July 1600, at three o’clock, the archduke began the attack. His
                    advanced guard, commanded by Mendoza, and composed of the mutineers, who now
                    resolved to atone for their former misconduct, marched across the sand-hills
                    with desperate resolution. They soon came into contact with the English part of
                    the force under Sir Francis Vere, who was desperately wounded in the first
                    shock. The assault was almost irresistible. The English, borne down by numbers,
                    were forced to give way; but the main body pressed on to their support, and Sir
                    Horace Vere stepped forward to supply the place of his brother. Not an inch of
                    ground was gained or lost; the firing ceased, and pikes and swords crossed each
                    other in the regular conflict of man to man. The action now became general along
                    the whole line. The two commanders-in-chief were to be seen at all points.
                    Nothing could exceed their mutual display of skill and courage. At length the
                    Spanish cavalry, broken by the well-directed fire of the patriot artillery, fell
                    back on their infantry and threw it into confusion. At the same instant the
                    archduke was wounded by a lance in the cheek, unhorsed, and forced to quit the
                    field. The report of his death, and the sight of his war-steed galloping alone
                    across the field, spread alarm throughout the royalist ranks. Prince Maurice saw
                    and seized on the critical moment. He who had so patiently maintained his
                    position for three hours of desperate conflict, now discerned the instant for a
                    prompt and general advance. He gave the word, and having led his troops to the
                    charge, the victory was at length decided.</p>
                <p>The defeat of the royalist army was in fact complete. The whole of the artillery,
                    baggage, standards, and ammunition, fell into the hands of the conquerors. Night
                    alone saved those who fled, and the nature of the ground prevented the cavalry
                    from consummating the destruction of the beaten army. Accounts differ as to the
                    actual number of the killed, some stating it at 6000 men, others at <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558373" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8373-0116"/> 3000; but perhaps
                    the latter computation does not include the wounded. For the number of men
                    engaged, it was the most bloody battle that had yet been fought. All agree that
                    more than half of the men engaged on both sides were either killed or
                    desperately wounded. The Hollanders alone made prisoners, and amongst them were
                    many officers of the first rank. Mendoza was one of these; he had been wounded,
                    and the prince had difficulty in saving his life from the German auxiliaries,
                    who were desirous of revenging on him the atrocities committed by his army in
                    the duchy of Cleves and in Westphalia. Amongst the other prisoners of eminence
                    were the admiral of Aragon, the seneschal of Montemilard, and the generals Don
                    Louis de Vellar, Don Idiaquez Monroy, D’Avila, and the aide-de-camps of the
                    archduke. The archduke, furnished with a fresh horse, made his escape from the
                    field, and reached Bruges, where he joined his wife, who had confidently
                    expected him to return victorious, and immediately proceeded to Brussels.
                    Although wounded, and at one time a prisoner, but rescued by his own troops, he
                    uniformly preserved his presence of mind, and throughout gave such directions
                    and orders as evinced the soundest judgment.</p>
                <p>This bloody victory was of little military consequence, but the moral effect on
                    the courage of the conquerors, and in the depression of the defeated, was of the
                    greatest importance. Prince Maurice had escaped from a destruction that appeared
                    almost inevitable. After the battle he resumed the siege of Nieuport; but some
                    reinforcements had been introduced, which rendered its speedy capture
                    impracticable, and, from want of supplies, the attempt was abandoned; and having
                    prepared Ostend for a vigorous defence, he returned to Holland with the remains
                    of his army. He was there received with the most rapturous congratulations by
                    his countrymen; but amongst the more rigid of the republicans some jealousy
                    arose, lest the successful soldier should aspire to be the sovereign of the
                    country. This jealousy was felt by the pensionary Barnevelt, and, when extended,
                    led to those agitations which long endured in the states, and which at a later
                    period led to the death of that invaluable patriot; but these are transactions
                    belonging exclusively to the history of Holland.</p>
                <p>The archduke called together at Brussels the states of the Catholic provinces,
                    who, when assembled, communicated their opinion, that nothing but peace would
                    satisfy the inhabitants, or preserve the country from exhaustion and complete
                    ruin. He could not but sep the reasonableness of the view thus presented to him,
                    and resolved to attempt a treaty. The states of Holland readily embraced the
                    intimations made to them, and at length commissioners from both parties were
                    nominated, and met at Bergen-op-Zoom; but their negotiations were broken off
                    almost as soon as they had commenced. The Spanish deputies demanded that the new
                    republicans should submit themselves to their ancient masters. But this was
                    received by the deputies of Holland as worse than insult, and as a proof of the
                    insincerity of those with whom it had originated, who must have known that such
                    a proposition could never be permitted to become a subject of discussion. The
                    parties soon separated, and during the winter that followed both made
                    preparations for continuing the war.</p>
                <p>Early in the spring, Maurice found himself at the head of an army of 16,000 men,
                    composed chiefly of English and French, who, in this instance, cheerfully united
                    and rivalled each other. He attacked the town of Rheinberg, and took it; but
                    from before Bois-le-Duc he was obliged to retire. The whole attention of both
                    the contending armies was drawn toward Ostend, a place of some though but little
                    importance to either party, when put in comparison with the extraordinary loss
                    of lives which the contest for its possession ultimately occasioned. The
                    archduke, however, resolved on making the conquest of this place, and the Dutch
                    seem to have made it a point of honour not to yield it up. The attack and the
                    defence were carried on with equal skill, courage, and perseverance, and the
                    operations, protracted for more than three years, kept alive the anxiety of all
                    the military men of Europe during that period. Sir Francis Vere commanded in the
                    place at the time of the first investment; but governors, garrisons, and
                    besieging forces, were renewed and replaced with a rapidity which gave one of
                    the most frightful instances of the ravages of war.</p>
                <p>This siege became a school for the young nobility of all Europe, who repaired to
                    the one party or the other to learn the principles and the practice of attack
                    and defence. Every thing that the military skill of that age could devise was
                    resorted to on either side. The slaughter in the various assaults, sorties, and
                    bombardments, was enormous. Squadrons at sea gave a double interest to the land
                    operations. The celebrated brothers, Frederick and Ambrose Spinola, founded
                    their reputation on both elements. Frederick was, however, killed in one of the
                    naval combats with the Dutch galleys, and Ambrose acquired his fame by the
                    ultimate conquest of Ostend. As the Dutch had the superiority at sea, they could
                    throw in renewed succours, whilst the Spaniards having full possession of the
                    surrounding land, could bring to the besiegers whatever stores or recruits were
                    needed. Redoubled attacks and multiplied mines at length reduced the town to a
                    mere mass of ruins, and scarcely left to its undaunted garrison sufficient
                    footing on which to prolong their desperate defence. Ostend at length
                    surrendered on the 22d of September 1604&lt;, after a siege which had commenced
                    in July 1601. The victors marched in over its crumbled walls and shattered
                    batteries. Scarcely a vestige of the place remained beyond those terrible
                    evidences of destruction. The ditches filled up with the rubbish of ramparts,
                    bastions, and redoubts, left no distinct line of separation between the
                    operations of attack and defence. It resembled a vast sepulchre rather than a
                    ruined town, a mountain of earth and rubbish, without a single house in which
                    the wretched remnant of the inhabitants could hide their heads.</p>
                <p>The death of Queen Elizabeth of England happened during this siege, and some time
                    was passed in anxious expectation of what would be the conduct of her successor,
                    who was actuated on the one side by his high opinion of the rights of royalty,
                    and on the other by the policy of his English ministers, and the representations
                    of Henry IV. of France. In this case, though he threatened, he did not withdraw
                    his troops from the Dutch; but he, at the same time, gave liberty to the
                    Spaniards to raise recruits in England for the Belgic states.</p>
                <p>In the year 1605, both the Dutch and the Belgians, the former under Prince
                    Maurice, and the latter under Spinola, took the field. The prince projected the
                    surprise of Antwerp; but the vigilance of Spinola anticipated his intention.
                    Spinola then invaded the province of Overyssel, and took some of the smaller
                    towns. Maurice flew to the relief of the province; and by his tactics obliged
                    Spinola to retire to the Rhine, where he awaited at Roeroord the attack of the
                    Dutch. A battle was there fought, in which the fortune of the day more than once
                    varied. At length Maurice desisted, and the Spaniards had the honour of the
                    victory; but the loss on both sides was nearly equal, and few or no prisoners
                    were taken. In the mean time, the Dutch had gained a naval victory of much
                    importance. A squadron of ships commanded by Hautain, admiral of Zealand,
                    attacked a superior force of Spanish vessels close to Dover, and defeated them
                    with considerable loss. The victory was, however, sullied by an act of great
                    barbarity; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558386" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8386-0117"/>all
                    the soldiers found on board the captured ships were tied two and two, and thrown
                    into the sea. Some few extricated themselves, and by swimming reached the shore;
                    and others were picked up by the English boats, the crews of which witnessed the
                    scene, and hastened to the relief of the sufferers.</p>
                <p>The military forces of the Catholic states had been abundantly supplied with
                    pecuniary resources from the treasures of Spain. But Philip III. who had
                    succeeded to the throne of that kingdom, found difficulties arise respecting the
                    supplies. He wanted that economical arrangement in his finances which had been
                    one of the peculiar features of the late king; he was embarrassed with troubles
                    in Portugal, which showed strong dispositions to throw off the yoke of the
                    Spanish government; and he had been prevented from drawing resources from his
                    dominions in both the Indies, by the interruptions which the Dutch navy had
                    caused in all parts of the world, and by the capture or destruction of some of
                    his ships returning with the treasures of Mexicoand Peru. Discontents had been
                    created in the Catholic Netherlands, excited by suspicion of the design of Spain
                    to place those states again under her immediate government. In one of his public
                    rescripts, Philip had described the people of the Netherlands as <hi
                    rend="italic">his beloved subjects.</hi> This caused great agitation in the
                    states, as they had imagined that the cession of the sovereignty to the archduke
                    had made them an independent kingdom. The debts of the states had also
                    accumulated to a large amount, and there was no prospect of discharging them as
                    long as the war with the Hollanders should continue. Even the general, Spinola,
                    had so encumbered himself with personal obligations to further the public
                    service, that he gave a lead to the feeling generally entertained in favour of
                    peace.</p>
                <p>In this state of affairs, proposals were made by the archduke in May 1607, to
                    enter into negotiations for a peace; and two plenipotentiaries having been
                    despatched from Brussels, repaired to the Hague.</p>
                <p>But public opinion in the Dutch states was much divided on this important
                    question. An instinctive hatred against the Spaniards, and long habits of
                    warfare, led the great mass of the people to consider any overture of peace as
                    some wily artifice aimed at their religion and liberty. War seemed to have
                    opened to them inexhaustible sources of wealth; whilst peace appeared to
                    threaten the extinction of the trade, which was now as much a habit as war
                    appeared to be a want. This reasoning was particularly convincing to Prince
                    Maurice, whose fame, with a large portion of his authority and revenues,
                    depended on the continuance of hostilities. It was also strongly relied on, and
                    supported in Zealand, and in the chief towns, which dreaded the rivalry of
                    Antwerp. Those who bore the burden of the war saw it, however, under a different
                    aspect. They feared that the present state of things would lead to their
                    conquest by the enemy, or to the ruin of their liberty by the growing power of
                    Prince Maurice; and they hoped that peace would consolidate the republic, and
                    cause the reduction of the debt, which already amounted to twenty-six millions
                    of florins. This party was headed by Barnevelt, whose wisdom has been
                    established by the issue.</p>
                <p>The wish of that great man was for a suspension of arms, in order that opposition
                    might subside, and the interests of the contending parties might be calmly
                    discussed; and he managed so as to gain a reluctant acquiescence to his views
                    from the Prince of Orange and his partisans. The united provinces positively
                    refused to admit even the commencement of a negotiation until the archduke made
                    a distinct recognition of their independence, and an ambassador was appointed
                    with instructions to require this important admission. Some delay was occasioned
                    by the demand for this preliminary, and many suspicions were either kindled or
                    kept alive in the united states by the dubious tone of the Belgian authorities.
                    These were, however, at length surmounted, and the independence of the states
                    admitted in explicit terms, upon which a suspension of arms was agreed to for
                    eight months. During this term of suspension the negotiation had nearly been
                    suddenly broken off by the plenipotentiary of the archduke having attempted to
                    bribe Aarsens, the greffier of the states-general. He was a monk, named Neyen, a
                    native of Antwerp, and had several times passed between Brussels and the Hague,
                    and had held private interviews with Maurice and Barnevelt. He took an
                    opportunity to present Aarsens with a diamond of great value, and a bond of the
                    archduke for 50,000 crowns, which was accepted and communicated to Prince
                    Maurice, who, still anxious to prevent peace, hoped the rumour of this attempt
                    would excite distrust, and break off the negotiation. But Barnevelt obtained the
                    diamond and bond, and in the assembly handed them to one Verreiken, who had
                    assisted Neyen, and read him a lecture of true republican severity. Verreiken
                    was overwhelmed with shame, and Neyen was dismissed from the embassy; but, after
                    this delay, the negotiation proceeded, in spite of the opposition of Prince
                    Maurice and his adherents.</p>
                <p>The assembly of ambassadors met at the Hague in January 1608, and though the
                    plenipotentiaries of the archduke and of the Dutch states were the principal
                    negotiators, yet the kings of England, France, and Spain had each their
                    ministers, who interfered in the negotiations, and thereby created various
                    obstacles, and many delays. The main points for discussion, on which depended
                    the decision for peace or for war, were those which concerned religion, and the
                    demand on the part of Spain, that the united provinces should renounce all
                    claims to the navigation of the Indian Seas. Philip required for the Catholics
                    of the united states the free exercise of their religion; but it was opposed by
                    the states-general, and the archduke, seeing the impossibility of carrying that
                    point, sent his confessor Briznella to Spain. This dominican was furnished with
                    the written opinions of several theologians, that the king might conscientiously
                    pass over the article of religion; and he was the more successful with Philip,
                    as his minister, the Duke of Lerma, was resolved to bring about peace at any
                    price. The conferences at the Hague were thus little impeded, though they
                    advanced slowly till the month of August, when it was announced that the king of
                    Spain had abandoned the question concerning religion; but it was with the
                    certainty that his moderation would be recompensed by ample concessions in
                    regard to the India trade, on which he was inexorable. This article became the
                    rock upon which the whole negotiation eventually split. The court of Spain on
                    the one hand, and the states-general on the other, inflexibly maintained their
                    opposing claims. The other ambassadors employed every possible expedient to
                    shake the determination of the Dutch; but the influence of the East India
                    Company, of the islands of Zealand, and of the city of Amsterdam, prevailed over
                    all. Reports of the avowal, on the part of the king of Spain, that he would
                    never renounce his title to the sovereignty of the united provinces, unless they
                    abandoned the Indian navigation, and granted the free exercise of religion,
                    threw the whole diplomatic corps into confusion; and, on the 25th of August, the
                    states-general announced to the Marquis of Spinola, and the other ambassadors,
                    that the congress was dissolved, and all hopes of peace abandoned.</p>
                <p>The ambassadors of England and of France did not, however, altogether despair of
                    succeeding in bringing about tranquillity; and Barnevelt with his great
                    influence joined them in all their efforts. The king of Spain and the archduke
                    wished for a temporary repose, but, being <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558399"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8399-0118"/>strongly disliked by Maurice and his powerful
                    party, they were compelled apparently to give way. A new congress having been
                    agreed upon, was assembled at Antwerp; and the states-general removed from the
                    Hague to Bergen-op-Zoom, to be within reach, and ready to co-operate in the
                    negotiation. It did not appear so easy to make a peace as to effect a temporary
                    truce; and, working in that direction, the two representatives of England and
                    France, with the aid of Barnevelt, in opposition to Maurice, who resigned in
                    disgust all his employments, but afterwards resumed them, succeeded in
                    concluding a truce, which was at length signed by all parties on the 9th of
                    April 1609. By this treaty hostilities were to cease for twelve years. The terms
                    were vague and inconclusive in many parts; but as it was desirable to all
                    parties, it became durable. The united states were declared free and
                    independent. Each party was to retain the places they respectively held at the
                    commencement of the armistice. In terms very obscure, the right to navigate the
                    Indian Seas was granted to the Dutch. The article which respected religion was
                    so expressed as to be differently interpreted; but it practically gave
                    toleration to the Catholics in Holland, with some restrictions. The other
                    articles settled points relative to boundaries, custom-houses, and some other
                    internal matters. The treaty was guaranteed by the kings of France and
                    England.</p>
                <p>This treaty was received in both the divisions of the Netherlands with rapturous
                    acclamation, and the most sincere demonstrations of joy. The northern division,
                    during all the tempestuous visitations it had endured from hostilities, had
                    risen to opulence, power, and weight, in the rank of European nations. Belgium
                    was now permanently fixed under the sovereignty of the house of Austria, but
                    still left in possession of some of those ancient privileges which had been
                    transmitted to the people from the earlier times, when they composed part of the
                    duchy of Burgundy. No sooner was the truce concluded, than Belgium, like the
                    independent states, began to labour assiduously to repair the dreadful ravages
                    caused by the long and bloody war. The success in Belgium was considerable, for
                    the Archduke Albert, and his wife Isabella, joined to much probity of character
                    considerable talents for government, and exercised the greatest possible degree
                    of humanity and benevolence. The whole of their dominions began quickly to
                    recover from the ravages of war. Agriculture and the minor branches of trade
                    resumed some degree of activity; but the manufactures of Flanders, as far as
                    they were of great value and objects of foreign commerce, were destroyed, as
                    well as the capital necessary for their re-establishment. Some encouragement,
                    however, was given to manufactures of the common kind for internal consumption,
                    and the demand for them was increased in proportion as the soil, naturally
                    fertile, became better cultivated, and the proprietors more enriched. As the
                    port of Antwerp, the chief outlet for foreign trade, had been deprived of its
                    shipping by the emigrations to Holland, and its only access to tìie sea was
                    through the Dutch territory, there were few inducements, and fewer means of
                    opening foreign trade at that place.</p>
                <p>The tranquil course of prosperity in Belgium was only once interrupted during the
                    whole twelve years of the peace. It arose from a disputed succession to the
                    sovereignty of the adjoining German duchy of Cleves-Juliers. Two parties claimed
                    the inheritance. The Dutch sided with one, and the Belgians with the other, and
                    both marched armies and seized upon towns; but they never came in contact with
                    each other, and no blood was shed, the prudence of the archduke and the
                    forbearance of the states-general having averted the evil, and removed the alarm
                    created in Belgium, with very little injury to its growing industry.</p>
                <p>The Archduke Albert, who had long been a martyr to the gout, died of that disease
                    on the 21st of July 1621, universally lamented in the ten provinces. Though his
                    education in Spain gave him an air of reserve and of pride, and his sole use of
                    the language of that country was not relished by the Belgians, yet he had
                    displayed both courage and judgment during the war, and was uniformly just,
                    diligent, liberal, and humane. The term of the truce with the states of Holland
                    terminated three months before this event; but it was renewed from time to time
                    for a few months, and was at length tacitly considered by all parties as having
                    become a final settlement.</p>
                <p>The infanta of Spain, wife of the archduke, succeeded him as sole governor of the
                    Netherlands; but, according to the matrimonial compact, and the clauses of the
                    cession of Philip II., the sovereignty returned to his successor on the throne,
                    Philip IV., her nephew. The ten provinces thus became once more a part of the
                    Spanish monarchy. The infanta or archduchess continued in the government as
                    vice-regent till her death, which occurred in 1633. During her government, the
                    religious war in Germany between the Catholics and the Protestants, generally
                    denominated the Thirty Years’ War, raged with fury. Holland was agitated with
                    theological disputes between the Calvinists and Arminians, whilst the Belgians
                    were in repose on those subjects, having embraced with firmness the Catholic
                    system, which was insured by the restoration of the monasteries and churches,
                    and by the animosity created in their minds by the long war against the
                    Protestants of Holland.</p>
                <p>But the death of the infanta gave rise to a conspiracy against the Spanish
                    government in the Netherlands. It is said to have arisen from the arrangement of
                    offices, by which the commander of the army, the Duke of Berg, was mortified.
                    The project of the conspirators was to form these provinces into an independent
                    republic, in alliance with France and the states of Holland. The plot was,
                    however, discovered, and some of the leaders were seized, whilst others fled. As
                    the whole transaction was involved in obscurity, so when ascertained it was soon
                    consigned to oblivion.</p>
                <p>The king of Spain appointed his brother Ferdinand, a cardinal, and archbishop of
                    Toledo, to administer the government of the Netherlands in 1634, and he arrived
                    at Brussels with a force of more than 16,000. At that time a rivalry between the
                    courts of France and Spain led to a treaty, offensive and defensive, between the
                    former and the Dutch, in consequence of which hostilities were begun in 1635. As
                    far as relates to Belgium, however, they were but of short duration. A French
                    army advanced to the then German province of Luxembourg, occupied by the
                    Spaniards, and in a bloody battle near Avein the latter were completely
                    defeated. They then formed a junction with the Dutch under the Prince of Orange,
                    entered Belgium, and captured the cities of Tirlemont and St Trond, and
                    exercised some severities. This roused the Belgians throughout all the ten
                    provinces. The prince-cardinal joined them with all the troops he could collect.
                    The invaders were harassed and repulsed, and, being exhausted by forced marches
                    and by sickness, were compelled to retreat into Holland, and, having embarked at
                    Rotterdam, were conveyed by sea to France.</p>
                <p>The vice-regency of the prince-cardinal was terminated by his death in the year
                    1641. During his government he showed considerable talent and much activity. He
                    frequently made incursions into the frontier provinces of France, ravaged
                    Picardy, and even alarmed Paris; and at the same time carried on a defensive war
                    on the side towards the Hollanders. By these hostilities, the progress of
                    industry amongst the Belgians received a severe check, whilst the demands for
                    supplies vastly diminished the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558412"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8412-0119"/>sources of that prosperity to which the interval
                    of peace had given birth. Spain herself was also much weakened by her warlike
                    unsuccessful operations at sea, and more especially by the revolution of
                    Portugal, in consequence of which that kingdom gained its independence, and
                    placed Don Juan IV. on the throne. From the want of resources on the part of
                    Spain and her Belgian provinces, the war which affected the latter was carried
                    on with but little vigour under the vice-regency of Mello, a Spanish general who
                    had gained much fame by his defeat of the French army under De Guiche at
                    Hannecourt, but lost it at the famous battle of Rocroy, where the French, who
                    conquered, were commanded by the great Condé, and nearly annihilated the Spanish
                    and the Walloon infantry.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these extensive military struggles, which extended throughout the
                    continent of Europe, and whilst England was contending for its king or its
                    parliament, a treaty of peace was in course of negotiation by a congress of
                    plenipotentiaries assembled at Munster and Osnaburg. Several years had already
                    been occupied at these two places in projects and protocols. At that period all
                    Europe wished for peace, except perhaps Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister of
                    France under the regency of the queen-mother Anne of Austria, and Oxenstiern,
                    the prime minister of Sweden in the minority of Queen Christina. The emperor of
                    Germany, the king of Spain, and the Dutch republic, were the first to endeavour
                    to bring about a general peace; and the inferior states in a short time
                    concurred with them. The first step was taken in 1641, when some preliminaries
                    were agreed to and signed at Hamburg; but several years passed before other
                    places for assembling the general congresses could be fixed upon besides Hamburg
                    and Cologne, which had been first intended. Some proposed Worms and Spires as
                    the two most proper cities, from being near to each other; but at length the
                    Swedes contended for Munster and Osnaburg in Westphalia, which was then
                    unanimously approved. The Catholic ambassadors met at the first of these cities,
                    and the Protestant at the other. When the two parties had occasion to confer
                    together, deputies from each met at Lengerich, a small town nearly equidistant
                    from both.</p>
                <p>As the negotiation had been commenced by the mediation of the pope and the
                    republic of Venice, they both sent ambassadors to the congress. These envoys
                    took up their residence at Munster; but Contarini, the envoy for Venice, a man
                    highly reputed for his patience and his prudence, often repaired to Osnaburg,
                    and by his wisdom succeeded in allaying the greatest discords.</p>
                <p>The ambassadors who composed these illustrious assemblies were the
                    representatives of the emperor of Germany, and of the kings of Spain, France,
                    and Sweden, each of the ecclesiastical or secular electors of the empire; the
                    Archduke of Innspruck, the house of Brunswick, that of Mecklenburg, of Holstein,
                    and of Baden; the Duke of Wirtemburg, Amelia Elizabeth of Hanau∙Muntzenburg, the
                    Dowager Landgravine of Hesse-Cassel, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, those of
                    the imperial cities, of the circle of Burgundy, and of the cities of the
                    Hanseatic league. From Italy there appeared an envoy from the reigning Duchess
                    of Savoy, from the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and from “the Marquises of Mantua and
                    Montserrat. To these may be added the plenipotentiaries from the seven united
                    and independent provinces of the Netherlands, who are noticed separately,
                    because they treated onlyand distinctly for a separate peace with Spain.</p>
                <p>The king of Portugal, Juan IV., who had just ascended the throne, but had not yet
                    been acknowledged by Philip of Spain, sent to Westphalia his ambassador in
                    company with the ambassador of France; but the minister of Spain declared, as
                    soon as he arrived, that if he were admitted to the congress, he had orders
                    immediately to retire. The emperor had demanded the admission of the
                    plenipotentiaries of the Duke of Lorraine, and the French opposed it; and thus
                    both the envoys of these powers were excluded. The Duke of Lorraine afterwards
                    settled his differences with France, and was admitted at the final settlement of
                    the treaty. The singularity of this meeting, and the important event with which
                    it concluded, may excuse the notice of the component parts of the two
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>Various delays, from discussions, some of a trifling'nature, some of importance,
                    prevented even the commencement of the negotiations till 1643 or 1644; but from
                    that time they proceeded regularly, and as rapidly as the nature of the various
                    matters to be discussed would admit. The separate negotiation between the king
                    of Spain and the states-general was of the most simple kind, its perplexities
                    having been in a great degree unravelled by what had passed previous to the
                    truce of 1609. It was, therefore, the first completed, and was signed by the
                    plenipotentiaries of the two powers, at Munster, on the 30th of January 1648,
                    and the ratifications were exchanged on the 15th of May following. As this
                    treaty proceeded on the principle of the <hi rend="italic">uti possidetis,</hi>
                    it was favourable to the states-general, as they were in possession of more
                    extensive territories than at the signing of the truce of 1609.</p>
                <p>Though not immediately connected with the history of Belgium, we may here state,
                    that the general treaty of Westphalia, by which peace was established in the
                    whole of Europe, was definitively signed on the 24th of October 1648, to the
                    satisfaction of all the powers except France, which complained of the Dutch
                    having neglected to afford the stipulated support, and of the pope, who made a
                    formal protest against the confiscation of the ecclesiastical property, and
                    against the freedom granted to the Protestant princes to appropriate the
                    revenues of the church to other than Catholic ecclesiastical purposes.</p>
                <p>The peace of Westphalia, important as it was to the whole of the contending
                    powers, proved peculiarly so to the ease and improvement of Belgium, which being
                    now merely an appendage to Spain, had the least apparent connection with the
                    negotiations. During the former truce the archduke and archduchess had laboured
                    to remedy the abuses in the administration of the law which had grown up in the
                    period of the troubles. They had sworn to maintain that compact long endeared to
                    the Belgians by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Joyeuse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Entrée.</hi> It was formerly made to secure the states of Brabant and Limburg,
                    including Antwerp, and to confer privileges upon other of the states; and an
                    oath was taken at the inauguration of the duke, that if he should ever be
                    tempted to infringe any of their privileges, none of the subjects should be
                    bound to yield him obedience. The privileges of those states were so much
                    valued, that it was customary for females to repair to them previous to their
                    confinement, that their children being born within them, might have the benefit
                    of these privileges. They granted several new charters to provinces and towns,
                    and the privileges of the people were placed upon a footing adapted to their
                    wants. After the peace of Westphalia, the sufferings from the recurrence of the
                    war under the prince-cardinal were soon ended, and the joy on account of the
                    peace and at the amount of liberty secured to them had a very beneficial effect.
                    Anarchy gave place to regular government, persons and property were secure, the
                    cry to arms was not heard calling the husbandman from the peaceful labours of
                    the field, and the fertile soil was tilled with renewed industry and increased
                    skill.</p>
                <p>The re-establishment of the religious houses in their estates proved highly
                    beneficial. They were mild landlords, and the peasantry that worked under them
                    were instructed in the best means of culture. In the nunneries also industry was
                    introduced and flourished; and the females in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558425" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8425-0120"/>them were so improved, and
                    acquired such a delicacy of touch in their fingers, that they could spin flax to
                    a degree of fineness unequalled in any other part of the world. This gave them a
                    great value; the nuns’ thread, a kind of second-rate fineness, was sought after
                    everywhere: and by constant practice the art of making very fine thread was
                    carried so far, that some of that from Mechlin was sold in England as high as
                    thirty-five pounds sterling for a pound weight, or acquired a value of more than
                    ten times its weight in silver. Besides the fine thread which was sent to
                    foreign countries, much of it was made into lace at home, both by nuns and by
                    the females in private families in the towns as well as in the villages. The
                    fame of Brussels lace was rivalled by that of Mechlin, and at a humble distance
                    imitated in Valenciennes, then a fort of Flanders, and other towns. The soil
                    was, and still is, admirably adapted for the growth of the finest flax; and the
                    thread spun from it was woven into those delicate cloths which received the name
                    of cambrics from the city where the merchants collected and bleached them, and
                    where the trade still exists, though Cambray has since become one of the cities
                    of France. The fine lawns of which the bishops of all Europe had their
                    roquelaures and sleeves made, were also a product of Belgium; and, in spite of
                    the laws which prohibited their importation in many countries, the diffusion of
                    them could not be anywhere prevented.</p>
                <p>It must be obvious that these branches of industry could not have flourished
                    during the dreadful hostilities which had wasted the country; but the rudiments
                    of the arts were not destroyed, so that they began to spread immediately after
                    the truce of 1609, and with greater celerity after the conclusion of the peace
                    of Westphalia, in 1648. To show the progress which had been made in agriculture,
                    it does not seem unnecessary to notice, that Cromwell, when he obtained the
                    supreme rule in England, sent to Flanders for husbandmen to cultivate his
                    pattern farm at Theobolds, within ten years after the peace of Munster; and
                    having introduced the practice of sowing clover and other grasses in the corn
                    after the Flemish mode, became a great benefactor to the husbandry of his
                    country.</p>
                <p>With the revival of industry, both in agriculture and in manufactures, the fine
                    arts also made their appearance. Painting was cherished, and the Flemings
                    established that school which furnished works of their peculiar style, that
                    rival the best productions of Italian art. The decoration of their religious
                    edifices was the chief object of the artists; but in the representations of
                    country scenery, of rural groups, of peasants, of cattle, and of domestic life,
                    their skill has never been exceeded. Neither architecture, statuary, nor music,
                    seem to have made much progress; and learning appears to have been almost kept
                    out of sight, or to have passed the boundary, and taken up its residence amongst
                    the Dutch, who in that age produced the most eminent scholars in antiquities and
                    classics, as well as the most able cultivators of natural history and of medical
                    science. Their theology was in a great measure confined to the dogmas of the
                    infallible church, and their moral science to the discussions of the schoolmen.
                    Belgium, now fixed as a Spanish province, enjoyed a long course of tranquillity.
                    Whilst England and the Dutch, during the existence of the commonwealth and under
                    Charles II. were carrying on hostilities, and fighting tremendous battles at
                    sea, the provinces of the Netherlands were not in the least affected by the
                    contest. In one instance, indeed, in the year 1672, when the united forces of
                    France and of England were assailing the united states, the king of Spain gave
                    orders to his governor of the Belgian provinces, Montercy, to collect an army of
                    10,000, and march to the relief of the Dutch. But before this force reached the
                    scene of the war, the king of France was compelled, by the movements of a body
                    of troops of Leopold, emperor of Germany, and by some demonstrations of the
                    Elector of Brandenburg, added to some checks he had received from the Prince of
                    Orange, to abandon with great rapidity the conquests he had made; and England,
                    withdrawing from his alliance, concluded a treaty of peace with the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Spain, however, in alliance with the Dutch and the emperor, continued the war
                    with France. That power had an army in Brabant, with which William, prince of
                    Orange, who had recently married the Princess Mary of England, and ultimately
                    ascended the throne along with her, attacked the French under Condé, and in the
                    battle of Sener first displayed his military talents. This battle was fierce and
                    bloody, but indecisive, and was chiefly remarkable as the last action of Condé
                    and the first of William.</p>
                <p>In the following year the Dutch and Belgians made an attempt to take Maestricht,
                    which, though conducted by William, proved unsuccessful. On the other frontier
                    the French were fortunate, and took from Belgium the cities of Valenciennes, St
                    Omer, and Cambray. William hastened to the relief of those places, and having
                    encountered the French near Cassel, met with a most serious defeat. This led to
                    negotiations for peace, and a treaty was concluded between the French and Dutch,
                    at Nimwegen, in 1678, to which Spain also reluctantly acceded in the latter end
                    of the same year.</p>
                <p>The increase of the prosperity of Belgium was little if at all checked by these
                    hostilities. It had been but locally, and for a short period, the seat of war.
                    Besides, that war was carried on with much more humanity than had been displayed
                    in the long civil war; and as the allied troops of Holland and of Germany paid
                    for what they consumed, it is not unlikely that the high prices paid to the
                    Belgians for the produce of their soil proved more beneficial to them than the
                    light additional taxes with which they were charged was detrimental.</p>
                <p>Belgium again enjoyed an interval of tranquillity, which was well employed in
                    domestic improvement. It experienced more alarm than evil by an irruption of the
                    French, which the Spanish army was too weak to oppose; but William of Orange
                    agreed, in the name of the Dutch, to a truce with France for twenty years, to
                    which the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain gladly acceded.</p>
                <p>The accession of William to the throne of England gave rise to a confederacy of
                    several powers against the ambition of Louis XIV.; and, at the congress of
                    Utrecht, in the year 1690, that prince, at the same time uniting in his person
                    the executive power in England and Holland, was named as the chief of the
                    confederation. The war which followed was generally indecisive, as far as
                    relates to Belgium; Mons and Namur were captured by the French, and the fortress
                    of Huy was taken by William. Marshal Vi∣leroy with his army advanced to
                    Brussels, and during three days kept up a furious bombardment, by which the
                    townhouse, fourteen churches, and 4000 dwellings, were reduced to ashes, but
                    with no farther effect. The other events of this war, extensively as they were
                    spread, have only a remote connection with Belgium. It was terminated in 1697,
                    by the peace of Ryswick, where a treaty was framed very little differing from
                    that concluded at Nimwegen nineteen years before. By the treaty Spain gained the
                    restoration of Luxembourg, Charleroy, Mons, Courtray, and all the towns and
                    fortresses taken by the French in the province of Luxembourg, Namur, Brabant,
                    Flanders, and Hainault, except eighty-two towns and villages claimed by
                    them.</p>
                <p>The death of the king of Spain, in 1700, gave rise to a general war, which
                    extended to almost every part of the world. He was a weak prince, without an
                    heir to his dominions, and thought himself empowered to appoint a successor. The
                    leading powers of Europe, and France amongst the rest, had agreed amongst
                    themselves so to settle the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558438"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8438-0121"/>succession as to balance the power, in conformity
                    to the treaties then existing. The dying king, displeased with this distribution
                    of his dominions, by his will bequeathed them to the Duke of Anjou, the grandson
                    of Louis XIV. king of France, whose ambition had by his previous conduct roused
                    the jealousy of almost all the other states. Louis, who during the peace had
                    kept up his armies to their full war establishment, was prepared to maintain, by
                    force of arms, the disposition of the Spanish monarch. This gave rise to the
                    Grand Alliance, usually considered as the master-stroke of policy of King
                    William. About the same time King James died in France and William in England;
                    upon which Louis acknowledged the son of the former as king of England and
                    Scotland. As William had died without issue, Anne ascended the throne. The
                    declaration of Louis operated to unite the parties in England, and to enable the
                    new queen to extract from her subjects extraordinary supplies for carrying on
                    the war.</p>
                <p>The events of this war belong to the history of Europe, and not to that of the
                    Netherlands peculiarly, though the latter country was one of the prominent
                    scenes of its transactions. The parties to this alliance were at first only the
                    emperor of Germany, the sovereign of England, and the states-general of the
                    united provinces; but other princes, both in Italy and in Germany, were
                    subsequently included in it, either as allies or as auxiliaries. The Netherlands
                    was a part of the countries contended for, and to a limited extent, and during
                    limited periods, the theatre of bloody battles and sieges; but as the contending
                    parties wished to occupy and not destroy the provinces, they suffered but
                    little, and the contending armies expended so much money in the country, that
                    the capital left behind was thought to be more beneficial than the injury
                    sustained ιmounted to. The battering down the walls of some of the towns, the
                    blowing up of forts, and even the casual trampling down of the growing crops,
                    inflicted but transient inconvenience; whilst the large sums expended by the
                    numerous troops of English and Dutch, officered by some of the wealthiest and
                    profuse men in Europe, and paying for the productions of the soil rates far
                    beyond the sost to the cultivators, remained in the country, and formed a
                    capital the influence of which was felt long after the operations of war had
                    ceased.</p>
                <p>After various successes in some quarters, followed with reverses in other parts,
                    France became exhausted, and was ready to make peace upon any terms; and the
                    allies, too, were weakened and ready to enter into treaty. But the emperor and
                    Holland wished to reduce Louis still more, when an intrigue in the English
                    female 'cabinet led to a feeling in the government in favour of the pretensions
                    of France, in opposition to the views of the allies. England resolved on peace,
                    and entered into secret negotiations with France. Holland could hope for nothing
                    from that power when thus left alone. The Emperor Leopold died about this time,
                    and was succeeded by his brother Charles, who had been during the war a
                    competitor with the Duke of Anjou for the throne of Spain. That kingdom thus
                    became an object of less personal consequence to him than before. In these
                    circumstances, the negotiations were commenced in January 1712, and terminated
                    definitively by the peace of April 1713, usually denominated, from the place
                    where it was signed, the peace of Utrecht. By this treaty, Spain, with her
                    transmarine dominions, were secured to the Duke of Anjou, Gibraltar and Minorca
                    to England, whilst the ten provinces of Belgium were assigned to the emperor of
                    Germany, and now assumed the name which it long bore of the Austrian
                    Netherlands.</p>
                <p>These provinces were finally delivered up to the emperor in 1716. From causes
                    which the preceding narrative must render very natural, there was considerable
                    discontent amongst the people; and it was only by extreme severity, and almost
                    overwhelming precautions, that a general revolt was prevented. After the first
                    ebullitions of disgust had expended their force, as peace was restored, and
                    prosperity followed, no difficulty seems to have been found in governing the
                    country; and neither revolts nor punishments were spoken of during the fifteen
                    years which passed before the accession of Maria Theresa to the imperial throne.
                    Whatever may have been the early repugnance of the Belgian people to the
                    Austrian dominion, they became gradually reconciled to it; and the benevolent
                    reign of their new duchess converted the Netherland population into faithful and
                    devoted subjects to the house of Austria. Her government was just, mild, and
                    firm; her religious opinions and acts corresponded to their own, and she made no
                    infringements on the <hi rend="italic">Joyeuse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Entree.</hi> The continuance of tranquillity afforded time for industry to
                    develop its power; and agriculture, the chief industry of the country, was
                    constantly improving, and enriching proprietors, cultivators, consumers, and, in
                    short, every one of the classes which composed the nation. The foreign trade,
                    however, which had in ancient times crowded to the cities of Antwerp, Ghent, and
                    Bruges, was not renewed, as the closing of the Scheldt had been one of the
                    conditions of the several treaties with the Hollanders; and Ostend and Nieuport,
                    the other seaports, were of very little use to Belgium.</p>
                <p>The tranquillity of Belgium was interrupted by the war which broke out in 1743.
                    The French, under Marshal Saxe, after he had gained the battle of Fontenoy in
                    May 1744, invaded Belgium, took Brussels and several other towns, and thus
                    placed the whole of the Austrian Netherlands in the power of Louis XV. But the
                    treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 terminated hostilities, and Maria Theresa was
                    again established in her Belgian possessions, as she had enjoyed them before the
                    war. Though reduced to a state of widowhood by the death of her husband Francis
                    I. who had been raised by her to the imperial dignity, she ruled singly her vast
                    possessions, with so much mildness, united to firmness, that her name even to
                    this day is cherished in Belgium, as amongst the dearest recollections of the
                    people. Her good sense and good feeling preserved her from overstepping the
                    bounds of the ancient laws. She had no temptation to abuse her power, nor had
                    her subjects any cause for want of fidelity in their allegiance. Reforms were
                    necessary in many of the local, provincial, and commercial regulations; but in
                    effecting them she violated no principles, wounded no opinion, shocked no
                    prejudice, so that they were affected with but slight murmurs, and no
                    resistance. The rude burghers of Flanders abandoned their hereditary right to an
                    independence of the more exaggerated kind. Faction itself yielded homage to the
                    ascendency of justice, and social civilization made a rapid progress throughout
                    the whole country. During the Seven Years’ War which terminated in 1763, the
                    Belgian dominions of Austria bore their share of the pecuniary burdens and
                    levies of men in the early part of the transactions; but it suffered none of
                    those inflictions which visit a country that is itself the seat of war. After
                    the peace of Paris, the Austrian Belgian states continued to flourish. The
                    government was indeed an absolute monarchy; but the municipal laws still
                    retained a great portion of their popular character, and the political
                    privileges of the people were considerable. This mixture of sovereign power with
                    popular rights, or rather the prerogative of an aristocracy of nobles, clergy,
                    and lawyers, worked well and gave general satisfaction during the whole reign of
                    Maria Theresa. In November 1780 this princess was succeeded by her son Joseph
                    II., whose own mind was somewhat tinctured with that infectious desire of
                    organic changes which the contest between England and her North American
                    colonies had spread throughout Europe.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558451" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8451-0122"/>
                <p>Joseph was inaugurated with the ancient formalities, and both he and the states
                    swore mutually, he to preserve the ancient privileges, and they to yield
                    obedience as long as he maintained them. This compact, already noticed under the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Joyeuse</hi><hi rend="italic">Entree,</hi>
                    included the varying rights of the several states, those of the ecclesiastical
                    bodies, and of the courts of law, and the privileged influence of the nobility.
                    As Joseph examined more minutely into the interior affairs of his dominions, he
                    saw with concern the extensive despotism exercised by the clergy, and in no part
                    so much as in his Belgic provinces. He saw that religious power had overstepped
                    its boundaries, and infringed upon the power of sovereigns; and he honestly felt
                    it his duty to bring it within more beneficial limits. Had he done this by
                    degrees, he might have gradually restored each branch to its due equilibrium;
                    but he was anxious for a speedy reform, and not sufficiently cautious to avoid
                    conflict with prevailing prejudices. He began by breaking the dependence in
                    which the clerical body was united to the pope, and, by his decrees in 1781,
                    soon after his accession, commanded the clergy to grant dispensations for
                    marriage without any reference to the holy see. In the following year decrees
                    were issued, commanding the celebration of marriages between Catholics and
                    Protestants, in defiance of the canonical laws and customs then in force. Of the
                    convents and other religious houses, which were very numerous, some were
                    abolished, and in others the rules of the institutions were altered, if not
                    reformed, by a simple proclamation. At length the episcopal seminaries which
                    were under the direction and control of the prelates were abolished; and two
                    universities were established, one at Louvain, the other at Luxembourg, which,
                    though better adapted for the diffusion of knowledge than the old colleges, were
                    looked upon by the priests, and also by the laity, who were under the influence
                    of the priests, as a dangerous and even heretical innovation, and the more
                    noxious, because they were under the sole jurisdiction of the emperor
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The dispositions of Joseph towards his favourite projects of reform were not
                    restricted to the ecclesiastical bodies, but in a short time assailed the
                    old-established and deeply-cherished administration of law, leaving to it only
                    the ancient principles of the Roman jurisprudence. The electoral colleges of the
                    provincial states were abolished, as well as the courts and councils by which
                    justice was dispensed, and the whole of the signioral and ecclesiastical
                    jurisdictions. By these decrees the lawyers, next to the clergy the most
                    influential body, were either injured or highly offended. Some were apprehensive
                    of losing their professional practice, and others were removed to new
                    situations; for new courts had been erected upon a simple and uniform plan in
                    each of the provinces, with a supreme court at Brussels controlling all the
                    provincial courts. On this account it was deemed necessary to divide the whole
                    territory into nine circles, by which the local powers of the magistracy were
                    disturbed, and in many instances destroyed, without an efficient substitute
                    being established in their stead. The privileges of the several municipal and
                    other corporations were next violated by the appointment of their officers in
                    virtue of the sovereign authority alone. As discontents arose from these
                    proceedings, the states of Flanders and Hainault at length declined to vote the
                    usual subsidies; upon which a decree was issued, stating, that in consequence of
                    this refusal, the emperor held himself absolved from every obligation towards
                    the states, and on that account declaring the abolition of the representation of
                    those states. Without entering into the merits or demerits of the projects of
                    Joseph, it is clear that the chief design of them was to benefit the people, by
                    disseminating amongst them more tolerant feelings in religion, and a better
                    administration of justice, by virtue of the increased power of the executive
                    government, and not by any extension, or even intervention, of popular feeling
                    and co-operation. At the time when these new ordonnances were promulgated, the
                    democratic spirit had arisen in France; and though a similar tendency was not
                    discoverable in Belgium, yet the growing discontent, caused by the introduction
                    of measures of genuine liberality, produced an insensible bias towards
                    republicanism, which had its effect on subsequent events.</p>
                <p>It was not till 1787 that the consequences of the rapid measures of the emperor
                    had raised such a spirit of dissatisfaction as to lead to the apprehension of
                    active opposition. But as the whole body was in a state of excitement, a spark
                    was sufficient to cause an explosion. The syndics or chiefs of the corporation
                    of Brussels, supported by those of Antwerp and Bruges, presented memorials to
                    the governor, Prince Albert of Saxe-Teschen, which in strong terms pointed out
                    the danger of insurrection if the obnoxious decrees were persisted in and acted
                    upon. The governor was alarmed, and suspended the execution of the decrees till
                    the pleasure of the emperor could be known, and held out hopes of prevailing
                    upon him to remedy some other complaints. These assurances diffused joy
                    throughout the states, and the day upon which they were given, the 30th of May
                    1787, was ordered to be hereafter consecrated as an anniversary of rejoicing.
                    All this joy was, however, premature. The resolution of the emperor had to be
                    waited for; and he was with his army carrying on the war with the Turks. On his
                    return, two months afterwards, so far from ratifying the concessions made to his
                    Belgian subjects, he despatched his mandates in an angry tone, declaring that he
                    had never intended to subvert their constitution, but sought only to correct
                    abuses and introduce salutary reforms. He required as a proof of obedience, that
                    the states of each province should send deputies to Vienna, to lay their
                    complaints at the foot of the throne. He professed to retain the sentiments of a
                    father, and knew howto pardon the errors and temerity of his subjects, but
                    threatened them with severe chastisement if they refused the mark of respect
                    that he demanded. He also informed them, that he had called to the capital the
                    governor of the provinces, and the commander of the army, that they might act as
                    mediators between him and his subjects.</p>
                <p>This intelligence filled the provinces with consternation; but it was
                    nevertheless resolved that deputations should proceed to Vienna. Whilst on their
                    road, accounts reached them on all sides of the prodigious force which was on
                    its march to the Netherlands, and of the consent of the several princes between
                    that country and Austria having been given to the passage of troops through
                    their dominions. But these rumours, instead of terrifying the Netherlanders,
                    roused them to resistance. The most prominent leader of the party was
                    Vandernoot, a lawyer of some eminence, who had been the most energetic oratoς in
                    the states.</p>
                <p>When others had been arrested, he made his escape, and found refuge in England.
                    He now repaired to Breda, and there established a kind of committee, who
                    conferred on him the title of agent plenipotentiary of the people of Brabant. He
                    attempted to draw the Prussian, English, and Dutch governments into some
                    negotiations, with a view to favour the cause of the dissatisfied Belgians; but
                    though unsuccessful in these attempts, he succeeded in inflaming the passions of
                    the people to a high degree of religious frenzy, a work in which he was
                    zealously assisted by the powerful exhortations of the ecclesiastical body. The
                    Netherlanders were in all ages a military people, and, when once roused to
                    activity, capable of displaying great energy. Arms were seized by the populace,
                    and a commander offered himself in the person of Van der Mersch, a soldier of
                    fortune, who had risen from the ranks to the command of a regiment during the
                    Seven Years’ War. A formal act <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558464"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8464-0123"/>by an armed body under this commander declared
                    that the Emperor Joseph had forfeited the sovereignty of Brabant; and this was
                    followed by the advance of the forces he had collected in the direction of that
                    province. His conduct was cautious and considerate, and he diligently directed
                    his efforts to introduce order into bodies of men inspired with a degree of
                    fanatical confidence which it was difficult to restrain within the necessary
                    bounds of discipline. The Austrian troops were few in number, and Van der Mersch
                    approached them cautiously. Having by some feints and stratagems induced them to
                    follow him into the narrow streets of the town of Turnhout, situated between
                    Antwerp and Breda, a bloody contest took place, in which the imperialists were
                    finally defeated, with a loss of lives far exceeding that which the army of the
                    insurgents had suffered. He immediately penetrated into the province of West
                    Flanders, where he was received with open arms by the inhabitants, and speedily
                    became master of Ghent, which was taken by assault, and of Bruges, Ypres, and
                    Ostend, which voluntarily surrendered. The imperial government now thought it
                    prudent to withdraw from Brussels; and upon this the states of Brabant and
                    Flanders assembled, on the plan of the ancient constitution in that city. Soon
                    afterwards Vandernoot and his associates arrived from Breda, and having made a
                    triumphal entry with great solemnity and parade, were received with the most
                    joyous acclamations by the enraptured inhabitants. The imperial forces being
                    dispersed, and no fresh succours arriving, the states, in 1790, formed a treaty
                    of union, which comprehended the seven provinces. Hitherto all had been done by
                    the excitement of religious bigotry; but there soon began to appear symptoms of
                    a fanaticism of the very opposite character. Van der Mersch, the successful
                    general, was accused of holding French principles; and Vonck, an advocate of
                    Brussels, was inculpated in the same charge. In the violent squabbles of party
                    it is difficult to ascertain the truth; how far these men had imbibed
                    Jacobinical opinions, or whether they had imbibed themjat all, it is difficult
                    and needless to ascertain. It became, however, the signal of disunion, of which
                    the Catholics availed themselves in order to excite general abhorrence of Van
                    der Mersch, as a monster of impiety and treason. Vandernoot, aided by an
                    ecclesiastic of more talent than himself, named Van Eupen, took the lead in the
                    general assembly of the nation. Religious fury was carried to the greatest
                    excess; and the excited populace, urged on by the clergy, proceeded to the most
                    violent outrages against the opposite party. Vonck and his party fled to save
                    their lives, and their houses were broken into and pillaged by the populace.
                    Scenes of the most revolting nature were exhibited throughout the country. These
                    were encouraged and even participated in by the priests, who, with the sword in
                    one hand and the crucifix in the other, breathed out the most horrid
                    imprecations against those whom they called infidels or heretics.</p>
                <p>During these proceedings the army became totally disorganized and inefficient. An
                    open rupture took place between the commander of the forces and those who had
                    the direction of public affairs. The troops abandoned their general, and adhered
                    to the civil rulers, chiefly on account of their attachment to the Catholic
                    religion. He left the army, accompanied with the curses of the populace, by whom
                    Vandernoot and Van Eupen were almost deified. In Brussels, the people bent the
                    knee when they gazed on the picture of the one, and uncovered their heads when
                    they pronounced the name of the other.</p>
                <p>Whilst the Netherlands were unassailed by open hostilities on the part of their
                    imperial sovereign, and the bigoted party were indulging their narrow-minded
                    measures of policy, the Emperor Joseph, who, with respectable talents and the
                    best intentions, had failed in every thing he undertook, was removed from this
                    life. He died on the 20th of January 1791, accusing his Belgic subjects of
                    having caused his death, and was succeeded in his extensive dominions by his
                    brother Leopold.</p>
                <p>Leopold manifested much sagacity and moderation in the measures which he adopted
                    for the recovery of the revolted provinces; but their internal disunion proved
                    his best ally. The states-general occupied themselves almost exclusively in
                    attempts to re-establish the monkish institutions which Joseph had abolished;
                    and having dismissed their able general on account of heresy, and thereby
                    disorganized the army, they had the temerity to reject with scorn the overtures
                    which the new emperor addressed to them.</p>
                <p>The imperial forces had been collected on the frontier, and the command given to
                    General Bender. These troops with their appointments were sufficient to overcome
                    all opposition that could be offered by a country the government of which was
                    compounded of ignorance, bigotry, and rashness. As the imperialists advanced
                    into the provinces, town after town opened its gates; Vandernoot and his
                    associates saved themselves by a rapid flight, and sunk into obscurity. A short
                    campaign gave the emperor quiet possession of the whole of the provinces; and,
                    on the 10th of November 1791, he concluded a convention with England, Holland,
                    and Russia, by which an amnesty was granted for all past offences, and
                    assurances given to the people that their ancient constitution and privileges
                    would be respected. In conformity to this treaty a succession of edicts were
                    issued, revoking all the offensive ordonnances of his predecessor, re-organizing
                    the provincial councils, and reestablishing the form of government on the same
                    popular footing on which it had existed during the reign of Maria Theresa. These
                    arrangements were only completed a little before the death of Leopold, an event
                    that happened suddenly on the 1st of March 1792. His son Francis II. succeeded
                    to the throne, and under his reign the final separation of the Belgian provinces
                    from the imperial family took place.</p>
                <p>The new emperor, soon after his accession, found himself involved in a war with
                    revolutionary France. His forces, conjointly with those of Prussia, invaded that
                    country, and, after advancing to Champagne, were repulsed with tremendous loss.
                    France then became the assailant of those powers and their allies, and one of
                    her first great efforts was directed against the Belgian provinces <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the house of Austria. The battle which decided their fate
                    was fought at Jemmappes, near Mons, on the 6th of November, and terminated in a
                    decisive victory in favour of the French, commanded by General Dumouriez. The
                    result of this action was to place the whole of Belgium at the mercy of the
                    conquerors. The Austrians were driven out of the country. Dumouriez made his
                    triumphal entry into Brussels on the !3th, and, immediately after the occupation
                    of that city, the whole of Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault,with the other Belgic
                    provinces, were subjected to France. Soon afterwards, several pretended deputies
                    from the Belgian people hastened to Paris, and implored the convention to grant
                    them a share of that liberty and equality which were to confer such inestimable
                    blessings on France. Various decrees were in consequence issued; and, after a
                    variety of procedure, the incorporation of the Austrian.Netherlands with the
                    French republic was in due form decreed, at the commencement of the year 1793,
                    whilst the scaffold was preparing for Louis XVI.</p>
                <p>But, even in the first moments of enthusiastic excitement, few of the Belgians
                    wished for a junction with France; the spirit of nationality was still
                    uppermost, except with those who were mercenary or fanatical. A number of
                    individuals had formed themselves into what they called patriotic associations,
                    in the several towns of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558477"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8477-0124"/>Belgium, and, being drilled into obedience by
                    commissaries despatched from the French convention, sent their emissaries to
                    France to misrepresent the national feeling. There were however in Belgium many
                    men of cool judgment, respectable character, and large property, who saw both
                    injury and danger from the proposed annexation; and they sent
                    counter-deputations to explain the difficulties attending the proposal. Each of
                    the deputies who asked for the conjunction was honoured with the <hi
                    rend="italic">accolade</hi> by the president of the convention, whilst each
                    petition on the other side was received with indifference, and its reasoning
                    unheeded. The peaceable remonstrances were put down by the clamour of the
                    adherents of the French Jacobins. Dumouriez himself even wrote to the
                    convention, that the wishes expressed in Belgium for the junction with France
                    “were forced from the people by strokes of the sabre.” In spite of the efforts
                    to oppose them, however, the decrees for a union were issued, and preparations
                    made for their practical adoption. But they were for a time frustrated by the
                    events of the war. The strong city of Maestricht still held out against the
                    French. It was besieged without success, owing to the want of military skill on
                    the part of Miranda, a Spanish American, who had been transformed into a
                    general. This, with the circumstances arising from Dumouriez quarrelling with
                    the convention, his unavailing attempt to turn the army against them, and his
                    ultimate flight, had greatly demoralized and disorganized the French army; and
                    it was in this state when the campaign opened in March 1794. The Austrians had
                    collected on the frontier towards G er many a large force under the Prince of
                    Saxe-Cobourg, which entered Belgium, and gained the battle of Neerwinden, with
                    many other less considerable contests, owing to which the French were compelled
                    to abandon all their conquests with a rapidity quite equal to that with which
                    they had accomplished them.</p>
                <p>The Belgian provinces were thus once more restored to the house of Austria, and
                    the emperor nominated his brother, the Archduke Charles, as his viceroy. His
                    occupation of that post, however, was but of short duration. The frohtier
                    provinces of Belgium became the seat of bloody contests, in which were opposed
                    to France armies composed of Austrians, Germans, English, and Dutch. Without
                    here entering into details, we may remark, that the question respecting the
                    occupation of Belgium was determined by the battle of Fleurus, fought on the
                    25th of May 1794. After that important victory, the French' became masters of
                    Belgium; and the representatives of the city of Brussels once more repaired to
                    the national convention of France to solicit the incorporation of the two
                    countries. This, however, was not finally pronounced till the 1st of October
                    1795, by which time the rapacity of the French commissioners, and the violent
                    measures enforced, had given a tolerable sample of what might be expected from
                    an arbitrary government concealing its despotic tendencies under the cloak of
                    liberty. The discussion in the French convention on the subject of the
                    annexation of Belgium had occupied two days; and there were not wanting a few
                    members who resolutely opposed the union, and spoke boldly against the injustice
                    of the measure, founding on the repugnance of the Belgians, as well as the
                    dissimilarity in point of religion, manners,, and morals between the two
                    countries. Reasoning, however, was of little avail when opposed to the ambitious
                    spirit which actuated the majority of the convention, who already looked to the
                    period when, by the extension of their limits,the Rhine should form the eastern
                    boundary of the republic. A new system for a division of the Austrian
                    Netherlands and of the bishopric of Liège into nine departments was adopted, and
                    they were declared integral parts of the French republic. This new state of
                    affairs was at length consolidated by the preliminaries of peace signed at
                    Leoben, in Styria, between Napoleon and the Archduke Charles of Austria, and
                    confirmed by the treaty of Campo Formio, signed October 1797.</p>
                <p>From the occupation of Belgium, its history as a nation becomes a blank for
                    nearly twenty years. It formed a part of France, and shared the triumphs and
                    defeats of that country under the republic, the consulate, and the empire. The
                    ancient institutions, in the defence of which the people had revolted against
                    their former governments, were completely swept away; their religion was also
                    stripped of its power, its decorations, and its ministers reduced to almost
                    apostolical poverty. Their monastic and charitable institutions were either
                    abolished, or, by the confiscation of their valuable property, reduced to the
                    most depressed state. The laws, and the courts of justice, which were endeared
                    to them by usage, were made to give place to a new system, administered by
                    incompetent magistrates. They became subject to a system of taxation, which,
                    though equal in its distribution, was heavier than Austria had ever required
                    either in peace or in war. But the worst of the requisitions was that for
                    personal service in the armies of the conqueror, and which was so extended in
                    its demands by the conscription law, as to be deeply felt in every domestic
                    circle. Such were the evils which, if the Belgians durst not openly complain of
                    them, they never ceased to lament; but it must be observed, that the property of
                    individuals was protected by the government; that agriculture could be pursued,
                    and any improvements the cultivators chose to adopt introduced; and that, both
                    in France and in Holland, they had good markets for their produce. From
                    political circumstances, the manufacturers were protected against the rivalry of
                    English woollen, and especially cotton goods, which, as far as the fabrication
                    of them extended, became a beneficial employment of capital. The mines of iron
                    and of coal, chiefly in the province of Hainault, were beneficially worked; and
                    the hardware of Liège and its vicinity afforded occupation to a hardy race, and
                    such wages as enabled them to subsist in a state of moderate comfort.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of Napoleon’s government, he had arranged and established an
                    excellent system of local administration in the whole of his vast dominions; but
                    it was a system, like that of all arbitrary monarchs, which required the
                    vigilant superintendence of the hand that had framed it In the latter part of
                    his reign the whole of his mind was absorbed in the single point of gaining that
                    universal dominion which had become his grand object. Owing to the absence of
                    his vigilant attention, the system had not been so strictly adhered to as it
                    should have been; and throughout the whole of France, but especially in Belgium,
                    the local administration had become confused in its action, and of little
                    benefit to the community. The roads, bridges, canals, and public edifices,
                    except as they were connected with military purposes, had been neglected, and
                    were gone to decay for want of early reparation. The greatest evil that arose
                    from this negligent administration was felt in what relates to the education of
                    the people. In Belgium, as well as in the majority of the departments of France,
                    amongst the inferior classes of society, the youth grew to maturity in a degree
                    of ignorance approaching to brutality. There existed everywhere something that
                    resembled public schools; but they were in a most deplorable state, dirty, dark,
                    and without order; whilst the teaching was limited to tracing a few words or
                    letters, and to reading or reciting a few passages without understanding the
                    sense of them. Useful books were not provided, and the children were frequently
                    observed, from the want of better means, handing from one to the other an old
                    almanac, a torn book of prayers, or the detached pages of some old newspaper.
                    The condition of the instructors was commonly wretched, and the discipline
                    practised was either harsh or indolent, or both.</p>

                <p>In Holland, a most valuable system of local administration had prevailed, which
                    from ancient times had been found highly beneficial. When that country was added
                    to France, the system had not yet given way to the general plan of the empire,
                    and the roads, canals, and dikes, as well as the schools, had been left to the
                    same direction and superintendence as formerly. Under the reign of Louis
                    Bonaparte, they had been cherished and somewhat improved; and the consolidation
                    of Holland with France had hitherto produced none of the evils which affected
                    Belgium. To this circumstance may in some measure be attributed that difference
                    of character between the two people, which will be found displayed in the
                    subsequent events that come under our notice in the progress of this
                    history.</p>
                <p>Except in one important respect, the country now called Belgium, when forming
                    only a few departments of France, may be viewed as rather in a flourishing
                    state. The demand for personal service, however, pressed heavily on it, as well
                    as on all the other portions of that great empire, inasmuch as it robbed the
                    land of the labourers who were required for its cultivation, and left a large
                    portion of the work to be performed by the females, or by the males who had not
                    reached maturity, or had passed the age when the human frame is capable of
                    severe labour.</p>
                <p>The evil of the conscription was, however, counterbalanced by the freedom from
                    actual warfare. The scenes of contest had been removed far from its boundaries,
                    and, during the whole period of the union with France, its fields had been
                    untrodden by armies. Two attempts had been made by England to invade Belgium.
                    The first was the landing of a few troops intended to destroy the means of water
                    communication. They disembarked at Ostend, and, after damaging some of the
                    sluices, were under the necessity of yielding to a superior force. A grand
                    attempt was made in the year 1809 to take Antwerp, and to create a diversion in
                    favour of the allied powers, by operating from Belgium on the communications of
                    Bonaparte’s army, then advancing towards the east of Europe. This, however,
                    though the largest naval and military force that had ever been despatched from
                    English ports, proved a total failure; and it never reached Belgium, its advance
                    having-been retarded, and the design at length frustrated, by the siege of
                    Flushing, and a most dreadful mortality amongst the troops on the island of
                    Walcheren.</p>
                <p>The internal tranquillity of Belgium, whilst vast armies were collected in other
                    parts of Europe, had considerable influence on the great pecuniary interests of
                    that country. Its chief productions are those of the soil and of the first
                    necessity. The consumption of the vast armies had raised the prices in every
                    part of Europe, and none reaped greater benefit from the advance than those who
                    cultivated the fertile fields of Belgium.</p>
                <p>The reverses experienced by the French armies during the invasion of Russia were
                    followed by others of a similar kind in Germany, till the issue of the great
                    battle under the walls of Leipzig, in October 1813, excited a general hope
                    throughout Europe of being delivered from the military tyranny that had long
                    oppressed it. This hope gave animation to the minds of the men of Germany, more
                    especially at first, and was from them rapidly communicated to other countries.
                    Its effect was powerful in Holland; but, if felt, it was scarcely perceptible in
                    Belgium. The difference in feeling between the two divisions of the Netherlands
                    may in part be accounted for from the longer duration of the union of Belgium
                    with France, which had now reached its twentieth year; whereas Holland had been
                    incorporated with that empire but little more than three years when the battle
                    at Leipzig decided the fate of Europe. Belgium, under the character of a portion
                    of France, had enjoyed a degree of prosperity in its agricultural industry;
                    whilst Holland, mainly depending on foreign and colonial commerce, had been
                    brought, not to the verge, but into the very gulf, of ruin. The feeling of
                    nationality had been weakened during twenty years in Belgium, whilst it had been
                    strengthened in Holland by three years of suffering. The mode of action in the
                    two countries at the crisis produced by the victory of Leipzig merits notice
                    here, because upon the contrast between them depended the character of that
                    series of transactions which subsequently occurred.</p>
                <p>The intelligence of the defeat of the French had no sooner reached Holland, than
                    a spirit began to show itself which alarmed General Molitor, who commanded the
                    forces of Napoleon in that country. His head-quarters were in Amsterdam; and
                    fearing an insurrection in that populous city, he resolved not to be surprised
                    in the narrow streets, but, contrary to the opinion of Le Brun, duke of
                    Plaisance, and of Count Celles the prefect, withdrew with his troops to the more
                    defensible city of Utrecht. The whole of the French troops in Holland did not
                    exceed 10,000 men, and a part of these were in garrison in the fortified places.
                    The intolerant tyranny of the French government had made the whole population
                    ripe and eager for revolt. This disposition was taken advantage of by a few
                    able, influential, and patriotic men, the most prominent of whom were Count
                    Gysbert Charles von Hogendorp, eminent as a diplomatist and statesman, and Count
                    Van der Duyn de Maasdam, a man of enterprising genius and judgment On the 21st
                    of November 1813, they made the first movement at the Hague, unsupported by any
                    armed force, excepting a few of the old city guard, and a number of gentlemen
                    with fowling-pieces, and solemnly proclaimed that the people of Holland had
                    returned to their ancient state of independence and freedom. Amsterdam, at all
                    former periods the most powerful city, and the focal point of the ancient union,
                    was the first to renounce its preponderating superiority in the government, and,
                    immediately after the movement of the Hague, proclaimed the Prince of Orange as
                    the sovereign of the country. The decision of Amsterdam was communicated from
                    city to city, and received an universal concurrence, plainly showing the
                    spontaneous wish of the whole Dutch nation.</p>
                <p>A provisional directory was immediately formed, consisting of six persons, who
                    sent Messrs Fageí and Perponcher as envoys to England, to recall the Prince of
                    Orange to his native country, from which he had been long banished by the
                    foreign domination that had ruled it. The allied armies on the frontiers were
                    made acquainted with the events which had transpired; and when some of their
                    forces arrived, they found the insurrection had been so successful that nothing
                    was needed but a short space of time to consolidate the power gained by the
                    arrival of the prince. During the events of the few days, the force under
                    Molitor at Utrecht was kept inactive by the movements of General Bulow and his
                    division of the Prussian army, which had arrived at Munster, and was advancing
                    towards Arnhem.</p>
                <p>The Prince of Orange landed on the 30 th of November, at Schevelling, and his
                    arrival in his native country completed the great work of its enfranchisement,
                    and the establishment of its political and civil freedom. The invitation had
                    been spontaneous, and the government had been offered to him with no
                    restrictions or conditions; but he gave instant proof that he had no desire for
                    arbitrary power, by issuing a proclamation, in which are the following words:
                    “Je me rends à vos voeux; mais je l’accepte uniquement à condition qu’elle soit
                    suivie d’une constitution qui garrantisse vos libertés, et les mette en sûreté
                    contre toute atteinte.”</p>
                <p>On the 6th of December the prince assumed the sole executive authority, and
                    brought to that task all the active industry, penetration, and regularity by
                    which his <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558503" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8503-0126"
                    />whole reign has been distinguished. The fortresses were mostly held by the
                    soldiers of Napoleon. Many bodies of the allied armies were on the frontiers,
                    but none felt more acutely than William that no country can be independent in
                    the presence of foreign armies, whether consisting of friends or foes. He wished
                    that the same hands which had conquered the national freedom should defend and
                    maintain the precious blessing; and that thus the allied powers might be enabled
                    to unite their forces, and march on towards France, where the decisive battle of
                    liberty was to be fought. The first object, therefore, was the formation of an
                    organized army; but this was attended with immense difficulties. The country was
                    completely destitute of arms, ammunition, and every thing necessary for the
                    equipment of an army, so that it was impossible to clothe the new levies; and
                    the severity of that remarkable season prevented the removal of stores from one
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> part to another, and the arrival of the various
                    necessary articles which were provided and despatched from England.
                    Notwithstanding these difficulties, an army of 25,000 was enrolled, armed, and
                    equipped in the space of little more than three months, out of a population of
                    1,800,000 souls, in a country which had been previously drained of active men by
                    the conscription, and some parts of which were still held by the enemy. In the
                    month of March the prince was enabled to announce to the public that a force to
                    that extent was ready, and would soon be united on the frontier under the
                    command of his eldest son, who had distinguished himself whilst serving in Spain
                    under the Duke of Wellington.</p>
                <p>The formation of a constitution proceeded simultaneously with the creation of an
                    army. The first sketch of the constitution had been framed by Count Hogendorp.
                    It was submitted to the consideration of fifteen persons of the most approved
                    integrity and most enlightened judgment; and after their revision it was
                    transmitted to the prince, who accepted it as the fundamental law of the state,
                    as being in harmony with the manners and the habits of the nation, and
                    conformable to the wants and the spirit of the age.</p>
                <p>The scheme, thus far approved, was then printed and distributed over the whole
                    country, previous to the assembling of a meeting of Notables, who were to be
                    selected for that purpose from all the provinces and towns, including persons of
                    all religious persuasions, whether Jews or Christians. Twelve hundred names were
                    selected, of the most proper persons, being householders of various
                    descriptions, but not including those in the service of others, those whohad,
                    within the last six months, been relieved by the public charitable institutions,
                    or those who were insolvent, in prisons, or under the surveillance of the
                    police. The lists were ordered to be exposed during eight days, in each small
                    district in which a justice of peace was established, that each householder
                    might affix his approval or disapproval of the individuals named in them. One
                    half the number, as determined by these votings, were to be excluded, and the
                    remaining 600 were appointed to meet on the 24th of March. After a few hours
                    spent in deliberation, the acceptance of the fundamental daw was decided by a
                    majority of 458 votes against twenty-five. There were 117 absent, many of them
                    kept away by unavoidable circumstances, some by a feeling that they were not
                    sufficiently authorized to give a decision on so important a subject, some from
                    judging that the power of making peace and war was held by the prince alone, and
                    a few from religious scruples. The more rigid Calvinists thought the Protestant
                    religion would suffer by admitting persons of all persuasions to public offices,
                    and some Catholics complained that there was not a sufficient provision made for
                    the maintenance of their clergy and their institutions. If the whole of the
                    absent members had voted, as their opinions were well known, it was calculated
                    that the measure submitted to them would have been accepted by five sixths of
                    the number.</p>
                <p>Mr Chad, secretary of legation from the court of St James’s, who was then
                    officially in Holland, says, “Persons accustomed to the spectacle of the
                    impetuosity and ardour of political discussions in England, would perhaps have
                    been surprised at the calm moderation with which this transaction was
                    accomplished in Holland.” But he adds, that from all the information he could in
                    any way acquire, he never could learn that the government of the prince made the
                    least attempt to control, or even to influence, the public opinion.</p>
                <p>In consequence of thus organizing a form of government, the prince assumed the
                    title of king, and his eldest son that of Prince of Orange. The state which had
                    thus secured its own independence was immediately acknowledged as such by all
                    the governments of Europe; not by the formality of any treaty, which would have
                    weakened rather than strengthened the right, but as an assumed fact, evidenced
                    by the mission of ministers to the court ofking William from the sovereigns of
                    the great powers of the civilised world.</p>
                <p>We turn now to the conduct pursued by the Belgians in this crisis, not with the
                    view of inculpating the people of that country by the contrast, but in order to
                    place before the reader a simple narrative of the occurrences. No effort was
                    made, nor the slightest indication displayed, which could give encouragement to
                    the cause of the allied powers against the common enemies of Europe. It is
                    probable that the Belgians saw, with great though silent satisfaction, the
                    progress of the allied armies. But the Belgian provinces were not, like those of
                    Holland, situated at the extremity of Napoleon’s empire, and thus out of the
                    reach of that immediate chastisement which a premature revolt would surely have
                    brought down on them. It would have been difficult to create a central point
                    round which to rally the scattered elements of insurrection; nor had the
                    Belgians a family or chief upon whom to fix the general hopes of the country, or
                    fitted to secure the confidence of foreign powers. But, worse than all, they had
                    no legitimate and acknowledged nationality that could inspire them. Their past
                    recollection could only present to their minds the prospect of a subservient
                    junction with some other country, such as had always been their fate; and as
                    they had no expectation of being left to their own choice in that junction,
                    there was little to inspire them with the ardour of patriotism.</p>
                <p>No hostilities took place in Belgium, except an attack by bombardment on Antwerp
                    by a united force of English and Prussians, which was productive of no
                    consequences, as the army of the latter was ordered to advance into the
                    territory of France itself.</p>
                <p>The French troops abandoned Belgium as the allies advanced, and in January 1814
                    the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, one of the allied generals, entered Brussels without
                    any opposition. But his troops had merely a military occupation of the country;
                    and the emperor of Austria, then advancing towards Paris, despatched from Dijon
                    Baron Vincent, who had been commissioned <hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi> to
                    act as governor of Belgium.</p>
                <p>From the events in Holland and Belgium our attention must now be turned to Paris,
                    where the allies, after driving away Napoleon and seating Louis XVH1. on the
                    throne, had convened the ministers of the several powers, to restore
                    tranquillity and order in those parts of Europe which had been disorganized by
                    the victories of the French empire.</p>
                <p>This august assembly, in the midst of the congratulations which the extraordinary
                    scenes that had thus collected them produced, did not forget the perils they had
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558516" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8516-0127"/>escaped, not
                    the danger which might still arise behind the glory of their triumphs. Bonaparte
                    was indeed dethroned, and a Bourbon seated on his throne; but the spirit of
                    foreign conquest and universal dominion was not extinct in France, with its
                    millions of men still animated by the desire of domination, and smarting under
                    the severe mortifications which their vanity had recently suffered. The throne
                    that had been restored was still in a tottering state, all the institutions
                    which formerly supported it having been swept away; and, besides, the remains of
                    the defeated armies would soon be joined by thousands of men who, having been
                    made prisoners, would return filled with angry passions, and fully prepared to
                    aid in any combinations which might have for their object the plunder of foreign
                    countries, the subjugation of foreign potentates, and the superiority of the
                    military over the civil authority throughout France itself, as well as over all
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Aware of the dangers lurking behind their success, the allies directed their
                    attention to such measures of security as seemed most advisable, in case a
                    re-action in France should again throw the power of that kingdom into the hands,
                    first, of the populace, and then, as a necessary step, into that of some
                    military leader.</p>
                <p>Belgium had, by the right of conquest, fallen into the power of the allied
                    sovereigns. From its position it had been the battle-field of Europe in former
                    periods; and the possession of that country by France would be of vast
                    importance as an advanced post, from which she might easily proceed to other
                    conquests. The house of Austria, having always found the Belgian provinces a
                    source of trouble and annoyance, was ready to abandon its claims; trusting
                    thereby to secure some advantages nearer the centre of its power. The
                    Netherlands, if united under one power, might be sufficiently strengthened to
                    become a strong barrier against France, and the means of securing the
                    continuance of that general peace which was then so much desired, and indeed
                    wanted. Belgium, and the other territories near it, the bishopric of Liège, and
                    the duchy of Luxembourg, were considered merely as European objects, which were
                    so to be disposed of as would best suit the purposes of the combined powers,
                    particularly that of securing the tranquillity of the great community of
                    nations. It was not, then, from any peculiar favour to Holland, or from any
                    personal regard to King William, though his minister formed one of the assembly,
                    that, in less than two months after the seizure of Paris, it was adopted as a
                    principle by the representatives of all Europe, and promulgated to the world,
                    “that Holland, placed under the sovereignty of the house of Orange, should
                    receive an increase of territory.” This declaration was made on the 30th of May,
                    and at the time received with general approbation, although at a subsequent
                    period it was one of the principal grievances set forth by the Belgians in their
                    declaration of independence. The principle thus announced received its final
                    sanction by a treaty dated the 21st of July, in virtue of which Baron Vincent
                    was to deliver over to King William the provisional power he exercised in
                    Belgium, upon the following conditions, viz. 1. That the two countries should
                    form one state, governed by the constitution already established in Holland, to
                    be modified by common consent: 2. That there should be no alteration in that
                    part which assured to all religious sects an equal admissibility to public
                    offices: 3. That the states should assemble in alternate years in a city of
                    Holland and in one of Belgium: 4 <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi>. That all the
                    inhabitants of both parts should be alike in all commercial matters, without any
                    restriction being imposed on one for the benefit of the other: 5. That the
                    provinces and cities of Belgium should be admitted to the full enjoyment of
                    commerce with the colonies: 6. That all expenses should be in common, and the
                    debts of the two parts should be assumed by the treasury of the kingdom: 7. That
                    the expense of maintaining and strengthening the fortresses should be defrayed
                    from the common treasury: and, 8. That the cost of supporting the dikes should
                    be furnished by the districts more immediately interested in them; but in case
                    of any great disaster, succours were to be supplied by the general government,
                    in the same manner as had formerly been practised in Holland. The king of
                    England, by a separate treaty, on the 13th of August, agreed to give up to the
                    newly-created king of the Netherlands all the conquests made from the Dutch
                    during the war, with the exception of the Cape of Good Hope, and the settlements
                    of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, on the continent of South America.</p>
                <p>By the treaty of the 2lst of July, the government of the Netherlands accepted, on
                    the conditions therein stated, that sovereignty over the Belgian provinces which
                    the allied powers had offered, not from any peculiar feeling of regard to the
                    interests of King William or of Holland, but as a European benefit, “de pourvoir
                    à l’établissement d’un état d’équilibre en Europe, et en vertu de leur droit de
                    conquête sur la Belgique.” The duchy of Luxembourg was not a portion of Belgium,
                    but a part of Germany; and that division was given up to the king of the Low
                    Countries, by the German confederation, of which he was a member, not in his
                    regal capacity, but in consequence of his transferring to Prussia the
                    sovereignties, hereditary in his family, of Nassau-Dittenburg, Siegen, Hademar,
                    and Dietz.</p>
                <p>After the union of the two countries had been settled by treaty, and the whole
                    delivered up to the government of William, it was thought necessary to submit,
                    not the union itself, but the. fundamental law or constitution, to the
                    acceptance of the people. That constitution had already been accepted by an
                    almost unanimous vote in the northern division, but it was deemed necessary to
                    submit it also to the southern division. An assembly of Notables was accordingly
                    convened in Belgium, on the same plan as had before been pursued in Holland. The
                    number of the members of this assembly was 1600, but not more than 1325
                    attended. Upon the vote being taken, there appeared to be 529 in favour of
                    accepting the constitution, and 796 against it; and thus, as far as that
                    assembly was concerned, the acceptance of the proposed constitution was
                    negatived. The government, however, took a different view of the subject,
                    founded upon the assumption, that the union being adopted must be considered as
                    a fact not to be questioned; and that this was a question for the united
                    kingdom, which must be determined by a majority of the whole. For this purpose,
                    the statistical view given of the kingdom was thus represented.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the northern division, or what was before Holland, were
                    2,071,181</p>
                <p>Those of the south part, or Belgium 3,411,082</p>
                <p>In all. 5,482,263</p>
                <p>The votes in favour of the acceptance were stated to be the whole of the northern
                    part 2,071,181</p>
                <p>Two fifths of the southern part, who voted by their 529 delegates 1,364,432</p>
                <p>3,435,613</p>
                <p>The majority of the Belgian representatives, who voted for three fifths of that
                    part, amounted to 2,046,650</p>
                <p>Thus giving in favour of the constitution, or ) <hi rend="subscript"> 1 qqq</hi>
                    fundamental law, a majority of. <hi rend="italic">f</hi> i,á»ö,ybJ</p>
                <p>W e have given an account of this proceeding, because it was subsequently made
                    one of the grievances complained of. The assembly had been chosen fairly, and
                    consequently under clerical influence, which was decidedly op <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558529" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8529-0128"/>posed to the toleration of
                    any other party than the Catholic religion. This was proved by a kind of
                    protest, issued under the title of “Jugement Doctrinal des Eveques du Royaume
                    des Pays-Bas, sur le serment présent par la Nouvelle Constitution.” In an
                    authoritative style it condemns the liberty given to appoint persons of any
                    religious creed to offices of power and trust; and it reprobates the enactment
                    that the Catholic church was to be submissive to the law of the state, that the
                    other religious sects were to be protected in their worship, that the government
                    was to have the power to regulate all the seminaries of the kingdom, and that
                    the liberty of the press was recognised. It concluded with these words: “Mais
                    dès qu’une loi humaine est intrinsèquement mauvaise, et opposée à la loi divine
                    et aux lois de l’église, on ne peut, sous aucun prétexte, s’engager d’y obéir.”
                    This declaration was signed by all the prelates, viz. the Archbishop of Malines,
                    and the Bishops of Ghent and of Tournay, and the vicar-general of the chapter of
                    Liège. It is natural to suppose that such a declaration must have had great
                    influence with people so ignorant and superstitious as the lower classes of the
                    Belgian population are universally allowed to be, and averse as they had ever
                    been to a connection with the Dutch, who were represented to them as a
                    combination of heretics. The nobles are also said to have been more attached to
                    the ancient Austrian government; but the middle classes were supposed to have
                    more sympathy with the French than with the German nation, and to be peculiarly
                    jealous of the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the common sentiment, of which it is always difficult to
                    judge, not the least appearance of discontent was displayed at the promulgation
                    of the constitution, or the public entry made by the king and his family into
                    Brussels. His first efforts there, as they had been in Holland, were directed to
                    the means of defence; and all due exertions were employed for the purpose of
                    raising an effective and numerous army. In this much progress had been made when
                    the intelligence arrived that Bonaparte had escaped from Elba, advanced in a
                    sort of triumphal procession through France, and again assumed the imperial
                    title, and all the power connected with it.</p>
                <p>The alarm and terror created by this event had the effect of, in a great measure,
                    disarming the power of the ecclesiastical fulminations, and uniting all classes
                    with the new government in preparing for the contest which was evidently about
                    to take place on the frontiers of the kingdom. The time spent by Bonaparte in
                    Paris in organizing his recovered army, and in conciliating the several parties
                    in his capital, was most actively employed by the king in strengthening his
                    means of defence; and a great advance had been made in his military affairs,
                    when it became evident that the first inroad of the French would be on the side
                    of Belgium.</p>
                <p>An army composed of Dutchmen and Belgians, but chiefly officered by the former,
                    was collected and led towards the frontiers by the Prince of Orange. When the
                    French entered Belgium, these troops formed the advance of the allied army. It
                    encountered the French at Quatre-Bras, and, aided by the British, resisted
                    during the whole day (the 16th of June) the attacks of the left division of the
                    French army, commanded by Marshal Ney. The loss of lives on both sides was
                    great; but that action had a powerful influence on the issue of the battle of
                    the 18th, as it gave time to bring up the whole of the allied forces, and place
                    them on the field of Waterloo, where the decisive conflict took place which
                    decided the fate of the French empire, and gave a long peace to Europe. During
                    the whole of that day the troops of the Netherlands sustained the character for
                    courage which past centuries had established. There were probably a few
                    instances of overpowering terror, and some solitary examples of disaffection,
                    arising from past associations with the French; but the great principle of
                    public duty pervaded the Netherlands army, as was proved by the loss which they
                    sustained in the battle. The victory was cemented by the blood of the Prince of
                    Orange, who stood at the head of his troops throughout the whole of that arduous
                    day, encouraging them by his cool and determined conduct. On one occasion he
                    made a desperate charge on the enemy, and advanced so far that he was actually
                    in the midst of the French, and in the greatest danger, when a Belgian battalion
                    rushed forward, repulsed the enemy, and, after a desperate struggle, disengaged
                    the prince. From the impulse of his gratitude, and his admiration of the bravery
                    displayed, he tore from his breast one of the decorations gained by his conduct
                    in some⅛receding action, and flung it amongst the battalion, calling out, “Take
                    it, my lads; you have all earned it.” This decoration was eagerly grappled for,
                    and tied to the regimental standard amidst loud shouts of “Long live the
                    Prince,” and vows to defend the trophy, in the utterance of which many a brave
                    man received the stroke of death. A short time afterwards, towards the close of
                    the battle, the prince was hit by a musket-ball on the left shoulder. He was
                    carried from the field, and conveyed to Brussels the same evening in a cart,
                    accompanied by two of his aides-de-camp, one of whom, like himself, was badly
                    wounded; displaying to those near him as much indifference to pain as he had
                    previously shown contempt of danger.</p>
                <p>The battle of Waterloo appeared at the moment to have consolidated the
                    establishment of the kingdom of the Netherlands. It seemed to have attached the
                    military part of the Belgians to the prince who had been wounded at their head,
                    and who had led them to that victory which they so mainly ascribed to their own
                    exertions, as almost to forget that the troops of any other nation had
                    contributed to it. Advantage was taken of this feeling to commence the working
                    of the new constitution, which had been accepted, as before noticed, by a
                    majority of the whole kingdom, though rejected by a majority of the Belgian
                    portion. The solemn inauguration was held a few weeks after the battle, and much
                    interest was excited by the appearance of the Prince of Orange, on the occasion,
                    still wearing his wounded arm in a scarf, and with the palid countenance of an
                    invalid.</p>
                <p>The constitution was then declared to have been accepted by the people, and no
                    allusion was made to the irregularity of the decision, as the objections once
                    urged had arisen from repugnance to religious toleration; those who had urged
                    them being sensible that any allusions to the subject would have been unavailing
                    amidst the prevailing military enthusiasm. None was made, but such were
                    certainly nourished, to be brought forward at some moment more favourable for
                    making the desired impression. No murmurs were heard, and Belgium became, or
                    appeared to have become, reconciled to the arrangement which had been made by
                    the allied powers.</p>
                <p>The speedy concentration of the two divisions was a spectacle viewed with
                    astonishment, whilst a thousand channels were opened for the egress of national
                    industry, capital, and enterprise. Every obstacle seemed to have vanished,
                    asperities were softened down or concealed, faction seemed dead or paralysed,
                    and a quiet enjoyment of the present formed the only public manifestation. The
                    people of Belgium appropriated to themselves the glorious victory of which their
                    country had been the theatre. The king, by his love of peace, and by his
                    activity in whatever could improve the institutions and the condition of the
                    country, at first gained a high opinion amongst those Belgians who were able to
                    endure the religious toleration he established; and amongst others his personal
                    virtues, his <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558542" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8542-0129"
                    />domestic habits, and his unwearied industry, as favourable a view was taken of
                    bis character as could be formed of one who had the misfortune to be a heretic.
                    This last party was soothed, if not reconciled, by the exertions which he made
                    to recover and restore to their churches those pictures and other objects of
                    value which had been pillaged by the French and carried to Paris.</p>
                <p>The naval transaction of the following year, when a squadron of Netherlands ships
                    joined the fleet under Lord Exmouth in the attack on Algiers, was another
                    circumstance favourable to the consolidation of the new kingdom; for although
                    the battle was gallantly fought by Dutchmen, yet the Belgians took care, in the
                    exercise of their vanity, not to allude to the Hollanders; and as they had
                    forgotten the English at Waterloo, so they now gladly assumed to themselves the
                    glory of the united victory. The prosperity of Belgium made it the chosen
                    residence of many respectable foreigners, as well as the place of refuge of
                    others of the most opposite descriptions. The king busied himself less in
                    projects to secure popularity, than in efforts to benefit the country; and it
                    may here be proper to notice die institutions which were either established or
                    ameliorated, and the beneficial consequences they produced.</p>
                <p>Under the rule of France, Belgium, like the other parts of the Continent, had
                    suffered severely from the operation of the conscription laws, which had
                    deprived the country of those active labourers who were necessary to cultivate
                    the fields. Although peace could not restore the great numbers who had perished,
                    yet it stopped the farther progress of the evil in the Netherlands, by the
                    establishment of a voluntary enrolment for a small regular army, and of a
                    militia, whose service was required only for one month in the year. The mines
                    felt the benefit of this regulation. The minerals of Belgium consist of coal,
                    iron, and calamine. As soon as the union had been formed, and labourers became
                    less scarce, a great impetus was communicated to this branch of industry; and
                    companies were formed, who were most liberally repaid by the profit of their
                    investments in this branch of industry, which was augmented from year to year as
                    long as Belgium and Holland constituted one kingdom. By the excitement
                    communicated to mining, the provinces of Liège and Hainault, and a part of
                    Namur, were greatly enriched; and a company formed to explore the mines of
                    Luxembourg were amply rewarded in their labours and their profits, till
                    interrupted by internal commotions. The various branches of manufacturing
                    industry received a similar impulse, though at first they were checked by the
                    peace. The continental system of Bonaparte had given a factitious encouragement
                    to some articles of manufacture, which ceased with the return of peace; and,
                    till the formation of the kingdom of the Netherlands, many branches were
                    depressed by the rivalry of foreign goods in the markets to which they had
                    access. But as soon as the junction was completed, a stimulus was given to the
                    manufacturers, by opening to their goods the markets of the East and West
                    Indies, and those of all countries with which the Hollanders had traded. The
                    iron manufactures of Liège advanced rapidly in prosperity; the woollen
                    manufactures of Verviers felt most powerfully a similar impulsion; and many
                    large establishments were formed at Ghent and other places, where cotton goods
                    were fabricated which rivalled those of England, and so far surpassed those of
                    France, that much of the goods were sold by the contraband trade in that
                    kingdom. The opening of the Scheldt was the necessary effect of the formation of
                    the united kingdom. Merchants from various countries formed establishments with
                    large capitals at Antwerp; its docks became crowded with ships from all
                    countries; its warehouses were loaded with colonial and other produce; and it
                    advanced rapidly to a rivalry with Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, in the
                    transit trade to the interior of Germany. The king directed his best efforts to
                    the state of the roads, the greater part of which had suffered dilapidation,
                    whilst the cross roads, so important in a country chiefly agricultural, were in
                    many places scarcely passable. The management of the former was under the
                    general government, whilst that of the latter was superintended by the local
                    authorities; but in the first few years of the union the whole were repaired and
                    placed in the most excellent state. The interests of internal navigation were
                    sedulously watched over by the king. The old canals were repaired, the shallow
                    parts of the rivers were deepened, and new and important water communications
                    were formed. The chief of these, the Canal Guillaume, which extends from
                    Maestricht to Bois-le-Duc, was an expensive but highly beneficial work; whilst
                    that of Antoing in Hainault, that of Charleroy in the province of Namur, and
                    that of Ternuse in Flanders, have been found in a very high degree beneficial.
                    Though no longer of any importance to Belgium, it may not be quite out of place
                    to remark, that the spirit of improvement which spread throughout the whole
                    kingdom was to be seen in Holland in the Grand Canal of North Holland, which
                    opens to Amsterdam a way for ships of the largest size to the ocean by way of
                    the Helder, without incurring the risks arising from the shoals of the Zuyder
                    Zee.</p>
                <p>Some other plans of this kind had been decided on, when the disturbances broke
                    out which ended in this disjunction of Belgium from Holland. One of these was to
                    make the river Sambre navigable; the other was to form a canal from the Meuse to
                    the Moselle, by means of which the prosperity of the duchy of Luxembourg would
                    have been greatly advanced.</p>
                <p>The state of education, from the schools for primary instruction up to the
                    universities, was in a wretched state when the king ascended the throne. In
                    Holland it had ever been an object of the greatest consideration; and it had
                    received from .Louis Bonaparte, during his short reign, a degree of perfection
                    which fitted it for reception in Belgium. Normal schools for the instruction of
                    teachers were early founded; and as soon as any were found qualified, they were
                    fixed with moderate stipends in the rural districts where they could be most
                    beneficially placed. To such an extent was this plan of organizing primary
                    schools carried during the first ten years of the reign of William, that their
                    number in 1826 was 3329, in which the pupils were taught reading, writing,
                    arithmetic, and the system of weights and measures. The numbers of pupils in the
                    several schools of Belgium were 156,075 boys and 116,761 girls; in Luxembourg
                    the numbers were 19,925 boys and 14,819 girls.</p>
                <p>The schools for higher instruction were improved, and the number of students in
                    them yearly increased. In ten years they had risen from 3400 to 7048. These were
                    in general the institutions in which the youth were prepared for the
                    universities. The king founded a new university at Liège, in addition to the two
                    previously existing at Lon-vain and at Ghent. Great care was taken to procure
                    the most able men in every branch of science; and as the country was rather
                    deficient in such as possessed eminent qualifications, it was found necessary to
                    repair to foreign lands for help. Several were invited from Germany, and others
                    from France and Italy. No one establishment for education in Europe could boast
                    of more distinguished names than those of the individuals who filled some of the
                    professors’ chairs, both in Liège and Ghent.</p>
                <p>Whilst in the united kingdom the surface appeared smooth, and the vessel of the
                    state seemed to be making a rapid progress, an under-current was perceived to be
                    making its way in a direction not favourable to permanent tranquillity. At first
                    William gained the highest applause from his Belgian subjects. The whole kingdom
                    exhibited a show of bustling activity, if not of prosperity. Amongst the re <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558555" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8555-0130"/> fugees from other
                    countries, the king and people were spoken of as models of public and domestic
                    happiness; the diplomatists joined in the flattery, and prided themselves on the
                    skill with which they had accomplished the tranquillity of Europe, by founding
                    the kingdom of the Netherlands; and all united in the assertion that the king
                    was much too good for his Belgian subjects.</p>
                <p>For several years this favourable or flattering state of affairs continued,
                    though thoughtful people soon discerned, from events unnoticed by superficial
                    observers, the prognostics of future disunion. At the earliest meeting of the
                    representative house, the different languages spoken by the members caused some
                    difficulties; a Belgian in the discussions speaking in French, and a Hollander
                    replying in Dutch. Too many of the questions brought forward might be of a local
                    nature; and in these, as the whole of the Hollanders voted on one side, and the
                    whole of the Belgians on the other, the decision was often dependent on the
                    accidental absence of an individual on the one side or the other. The equality
                    of numbers between the Dutch and Belgians made it difficult to come to a
                    settlement on such subjects as affected the interests of the two countries in a
                    different or opposite way. This was first exhibited on the subject of a free
                    trade in corn. The Dutch provinces had never produced sufficient corn for their
                    consumption, but a free trade in it had always furnished them with a sufficient
                    supply. The Belgian provinces grew more corn than they consumed. As in the other
                    parts of Europe during the last years of the war, the prices of corn had risen
                    to an enormous rate, and the Belgian proprietors of land had increased their
                    rents in due proportion. With the return of tranquillity the prices of grain and
                    the rents of land were much reduced; and the Belgian members of the assembly
                    desired to impose restrictions on the importation of grain. This was naturally
                    opposed by the Dutch members, whose interest was engaged in favour of low
                    prices, both as regarded the subsistence of the inhabitants, and the trade of
                    the distilleries. The question was finally decided in favour of the freedom of
                    the trade; but the contest gave rise to the formation of two parties, so equally
                    balanced as to make the decision of many legislative questions dependent on
                    accident.</p>
                <p>As the royal authority had been established in Holland the greater part of a year
                    before the union with Belgium, it had been organized without reference to that
                    event. Holland had been a shorter period under French power; and during the
                    prevalence of that influence when King Louis filled the throne, its government
                    had been carried on upon the principle of nationality; the fittest men filled
                    the offices in the different departments, and many of them remained unchanged
                    when Holland became a French department. It was natural that King William should
                    continue such men in their offices, and that in selecting officers for the new
                    branches which were to be created, a preference should be given to natives, of
                    whom there were numbers whose education, habits, and patriotism had well fitted
                    them for the public service. At the union of Belgium and Holland the whole
                    administration was in the hands of French functionaries, who speedily
                    disappeared. Few men in Belgium had been brought up in such a way as to form
                    them for official duties, and those who had sufficient information and capacity
                    had been nominated to employments in the distant provinces of France. Under
                    these circumstances, the greater number of officers was necessarily appointed
                    from the northern division of the kingdom. Another cause of many offices in
                    Belgium being filled by Dutchmen was, that some of those Belgians to whom offers
                    were made declined to serve, on account of the influence of the priests, which
                    prevented them from taking the oath to a constitution, one of the first
                    stipulations of which was an equal freedom to all religions.</p>
                <p>A complaint was brought forward, that in the appointment of officers in the army
                    an undue preference had been shown in favour of the natives of Holland; and as
                    Mr Northomb, an opponent of the house of Orange, in his work entitled <hi

                    statistical point of view, this matter is entitled to examination. According to
                    his statement, in 1830 the officers of the army of the kingdom of the
                    Netherlands is thus shown:</p>

                <p>This great disproportion is in some measure lessened, from the circumstance that
                    many of the officers were Germans, some were Swiss, and some were natives of
                    other countries. With this allowance, the exact number of which is
                    unascertained, the contrast between the whole and the Belgians is very striking.
                    Baron de Keverburg, a partisan of King William, gives a different account,
                    making the whole number of Belgians in the army to be 536 instead of 278. In his
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">Du Royaume</hi><hi rend="italic">des Pays
                    Bas,</hi> he asserts of his catalogue that it is “d’aprês des renseignemens
                    puisés à des sources authentiques ;” but, even on this showing, the more
                    numerous population supplied but one fourth of the officers. This is accounted
                    for, if not justified, by the baron, on various grounds.</p>
                <p>When Louis Bonaparte became king of Holland, he sedulously attended to the
                    formation of his army; and when he abandoned the throne the armed force was so
                    well trained, equipped, and officered, that, on the annexation of Holland to
                    France in 1810, it formed a military body equal to any other of the empire in
                    its adaptation to the purposes of war. When that army was transferred to France,
                    the different grades of officers retained their Dutch rank, and their former
                    course of promotion. But when the people of Holland rose against France, and
                    raised William to the throne, the Dutch resigned their posts in the French
                    service, and repaired to their own country, where they were gladly received, and
                    reinstated in the rank which they had attained during their service in France.
                    It will be seen by the list of Mr Northomb that all the generals were Dutchmen;
                    but that rank had been acquired in the French service, where, by their military
                    talents, they had gained high reputation, and had been honoured and trusted by
                    the French emperor. The names of the Dutch officers thus appointed generals by
                    William are well known. Tindal had been raised by Bonaparte to the rank of
                    general, and commanded a regiment of his body guard. Jansens had been
                    distinguished as governor of Batavia, and in the army of the French emperor on
                    the Ardennes frontier. Daendels was one of those Dutchmen who had been always
                    placed in posts of the greatest danger, and had displayed the highest skill and
                    valour. Dumonceau, though a Belgian by birth, had by his long service in the
                    northern provinces become a Dutchman, and was highly esteemed in the French
                    army. Chasse, an old officer of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558568"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8568-0131"/>Holland when he was transferred to the French
                    service, became known by the familiar title of <hi rend="italic">Général
                    Baïonnette,</hi> and afterwards distinguished himself by his gallant defence of
                    the citadel of Antwerp.</p>
                <p>When men like these returned to their liberated country, and at a moment when
                    their services were wanted, there were no rivals to compete with them in
                    Holland, and they were necessarily placed at the head of their profession. Those
                    of the successive ranks who also returned, as almost the whole did, were
                    retained in those ranks in the army, formed first in Holland, and afterwards
                    strengthened by the addition of Belgians. The Belgian officers serving in the
                    French army had not been kept apart, but mixed up with the Frenchmen. They had
                    formed a part of the general conscription; few had raised themselves to the rank
                    of officers; and of these only three had attained the grade of colonel, no one
                    having risen higher. Being thus insulated, they had nourished little or no
                    national feeling; some few tardily returned to their native country after the
                    occupation of Paris; but many of them remained in the service, and fought
                    against their country at Waterloo.</p>
                <p>The king, in the hasty organization of an army, naturally availed himself of the
                    materials within his reach, and adapted them to the emergency. When after the
                    battle of Waterloo peace was established, it would have been highly unjust to
                    the brave men who had assisted there not to have confirmed them in their ranks,
                    or to have placed others over them merely because they were born in Belgium. But
                    for these, and even for such as had fought against their country, and repaired
                    to it after the victory, the provision made was the best that could be effected
                    at the time; and they were subsequently placed in new corps, retaining their
                    former rank and seniority.</p>
                <p>The utmost economy was practised respecting the army; and from the number of good
                    officers in the highest classes, and their seniority, there was no prospect of
                    rapid promotion. Thus the gentry of Belgium had but little inducement to enter
                    the military service, so that, without attributing to the king any great
                    partiality, the facts here stated sufficiently account for the greater number of
                    officers belonging to one division of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The other charge of partiality on the part of the king, which ultimately became
                    one of the grievances, was, that, in the legislative body, the number of
                    deputies was as great from the northern as from the southern division of the
                    kingdom, although the number of inhabitants in the latter was so much greater.
                    The foundation of this settlement of the relative numbers was based upon the
                    principle of giving legislative power according to the rate of revenue to be
                    extracted from each division, rather than according to the number of the
                    population. The proportion of revenue raised in Holland was nearly equal to that
                    raised in Belgium; indeed it was shown, at a subsequent period, to be as fifteen
                    to sixteen. The rate of revenue per head in Holland was sixteen florins, and in
                    Belgium ten florins. Whether the rate of revenue or the number of inhabitants be
                    the proper scale for regulating the proportion of legislators, is not a subject
                    to be discussed in this place.</p>
                <p>In the distribution of the higher civil offices of the government, complaints
                    were urged and magnified into weighty grievances by the Belgians. On this
                    subject the statements of Baron de Keverburg, when confirmed by the official
                    part of <hi rend="italic">EAlmanack Royal,</hi> are as follow:</p>
                <p>The cabinet consisted of six members. It was formed before the union of the two
                    countries, and was composed wholly of Hollanders; but after the junction of
                    Belgium, two of the members withdrew, and two Belgians were admitted in their
                    stead. The first chamber of the states-general, similar to our House of Peers,
                    but nominated by the king for life, contained fifty-six members, of whom thirty
                    were Belgians, and twenty-six Hollanders. The <hi rend="italic">Conseil
                    d’Etat,</hi> or privy council, was composed of twelve Dutch and eleven Belgian
                    members. The Prince of Orange and his brother Prince Frederick presided over the
                    two divisions into which it was formed; one for the direction of the army, the
                    other for that of the naval force. The <hi rend="italic">Chambre des
                    Comptes,</hi> or treasury, consisted of sixteen persons, taken equally from the
                    two divisions of the kingdom. The judicial authority of the provinces and
                    communes was in general intrusted to persons chosen in the division in which
                    they were to execute their duties. There were a few exceptions to this rule, for
                    two Dutchmen exercised these functions in Belgium; but two also, natives of
                    Belgium, filled the same offices in Holland. Thus far there was an equality; but
                    in North Brabant the judicial office was filled by a Belgian, which gave a
                    trifling superiority to the southern division.</p>
                <p>It may fairly be presumed, that in the appointment of officers in the several
                    civil departments, the king had been mainly influenced by his view of the
                    capacity of the persons selected to discharge the nebessary duties; for at a
                    subsequent period, when the most scrutinizing activity was exercised to discover
                    grounds of complaint, no accusations were made of any other fault in the
                    appointments than that which related to the portion of the kingdom to which the
                    functionaries belonged. The king himself was active and regular; and being in a
                    great degree his own prime minister, he must have been peculiarly anxious that
                    the persons under him should be adapted to their several stations, and certainly
                    under no government was more industry exercised or more regularity
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>Many of the important institutions of the country had, by the constitution, been
                    left to the will of the king as to their local establishment. The seat of the
                    states-general had been fixed by that law to be alternately in Belgium and in
                    Holland, but not the place for the king’s residence or the council of state; yet
                    these also, though with some personal and political inconvenience, were made
                    changeable, business being transacted six months of each year at Brussels and
                    six months at the Hague. But the supreme court of justice, the court of appeal
                    from all the inferior tribunals of the kingdom, was permanently fixed at the
                    Hague, to the great disadvantage of the more numerous suitors in the southern
                    part of the kingdom. This formed a material, and apparently a just cause of
                    complaint; and nothing has been stated by the Dutch which has disproved the
                    inconvenience, though attempts have been made to represent the practical injury
                    arising from it as very trifling and insignificant. Several other establishments
                    were also made permanent in Holland, such as the state archives, the diplomatic
                    offices, the council of the nobles, the coinage of money, the military and naval
                    boards, the academies for the instruction of naval, artillery, and engineering
                    officers, and the principal naval and military arsenals. This arrangement was
                    justified upon public grounds by the partisans of the king. The kingdom, they
                    affirmed, had been established as an European object, and to form a barrier for
                    the defence of all the powers against the ambition of France. In any display of
                    that ambition, Belgium would, as heretofore, become the first theatre of war,
                    and, in spite of the range of fortresses about to be erected, might be occupied
                    by an invading army. If the means of carrying on the war fell into the enemy’s
                    power, the effect might be fatal; but by having the establishments farther from
                    the frontiers, and where they could be guarded by natural defences, the war
                    might be kept up effectively behind the rivers and canals of Holland, so as to
                    render the advance of the enemy a dangerous or a ruinous step.</p>
                <p>There are in Belgium a variety of languages spoken, and the attempt of King
                    William to introduce one uniform tongue created much discontent, and was by a
                    great and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558581" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8581-0132"
                    />influential part of the inhabitants considered as a serious grievance. The far
                    greater portion of both the northern and southern inhabitants are of German
                    origin, and their vernacular language is chiefly composed of Teutonic words. It
                    is divided into several idioms, namely, the Dutch, the Flemish, and the Brabant.
                    These three are so nearly similar, that those who use them understand each other
                    better than the English and Scotch peasantry do. The Dutch language has been
                    more polished than either of the others, having been the tongue of some of the
                    most learned men that Europe has produced. It contains books of art, science,
                    literature, law, theology, and history of the greatest merit, and which have
                    been the means of spreading knowledge of all kinds to a great extent. The care
                    bestowed on education has produced a greater number of readers and writers than
                    are to be found in any other country of the same limited population. The Flemish
                    and Brabant dialects have been little cultivated; few books have been written in
                    it, except those of devotion, the lives of saints of the Catholic church,
                    almanacs, and spelling-books. The numbers who read them are very small in
                    comparison of the whole population, but with the rural inhabitants this dialect
                    is the general medium of intercourse.</p>
                <p>During the French dominion great pains were taken to extend the use of their
                    language, and with much success as far as regarded those who had enjoyed the
                    advantage of even the commonest education. This has extended the use of that
                    language amongst those above the lowest classes; and it is said that even in
                    Holland there are more persons acquainted with the French tongue than in those
                    parts of Belgium where the other dialects of Teutonic origin are used. The
                    Walloon language, a corrupted dialect of the French, is commonly used in the
                    provinces of Hainault, Liège, and Namur; and the German language is most
                    prevalent in Luxembourg.</p>
                <p>Baron de Keverburg, assuming the population of 1829, gives the statistics of
                    languages as follows.</p>
                <p>The divisions in which the German is used, and their population :—</p>
                <p>In Holland 2,329,974</p>
                <p>In Belgium, the provinces of Antwerp, Lim-</p>
                <p>bourg, and the two Flanders 1,971,056</p>
                <p>The largest part of Brabant 380,177</p>

                <p>4,832,524</p>
                <p>The divisions in which the French and Walloon are used, with their population
                    :—</p>
                <p>The provinces of Hainault, Liège, and Namur... 1,124,595 The arrondissement of
                    Nivelles, in the province of South Brabant 126,733</p>
                <p>One half of Luxembourg 151,317</p>
                <p>1,402,645</p>
                <p>In this view the Dutch language is used by two fifths of the population, the
                    other languages of German origin by two fifths, and the French and Walloon by
                    one fifth. From the most remote periods all public affairs in Belgium were
                    transacted in one or other of the Teutonic idioms. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Joyeuse</hi><hi rend="italic">Entree,</hi> the Magna Charta of the country, was
                    originally drawn up in the Teutonic dialect, and was only translated into French
                    at a recent period, when the princes, no longer residing in the provinces, began
                    to give a decided preference to that language; but all the proceedings of the
                    states of Brabant were conducted in it till the conquest of the country by
                    France. From that moment all public deeds were written in French, and the
                    subdued people supported with pain the loss of their native tongue; but they
                    dared not utter a complaint. This attachment of the Belgians to their native
                    language was shown to have been little weakened by their subjugation to France;
                    for when the allies had freed them from that yoke, and Baron Vincent was
                    appointed governor <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi> by the house of Austria, a
                    petition was presented to him by the ancient representatives of the city of
                    Brussels, who resumed their former titles under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syndics des neuf nations, et</hi><hi rend="italic">des cent qua-rante-trois
                    doyens,</hi> complaining of the compulsory use of the French tongue. The
                    petitions were favourably received, and an arrêt issued on the 18th of July,
                    authorizing the use of the Flemish language, not, indeed, in all public
                    writings, but in all notarial writings.</p>
                <p>When this provisional government ceased by the accession of King William to the
                    throne of the Netherlands, he proposed to redress what was then deemed one of
                    the grievances of the country, by a decree of the 1st October 1814, which stated
                    as a fact, “that, in consequence of the union with France, the national
                    languages of the provinces had been almost suppressed, to give place to the
                    French tongue ;” and then added, “that if it was necessary on one side still to
                    tolerate the use of the latter language in some parts where the Flemish is not
                    used, it is but just, on the other side, that the Flemish, which is the natural
                    language of the country, should be re-established in all the parts in which it
                    is used and understood.” The king was certainly desirous of restoring the
                    national language, and of restraining the use of the French; and for a time,
                    whilst it was gratifying to the great body of the people, it occasioned very
                    little complaint upon the part of those who alone spoke or understood French.
                    Gradual enactments were made to induce practitioners to study the national
                    languages; and three years were allowed to acquire them, at the end of which
                    time those who did not understand them were to be removed to other stations,
                    where they could practise their official duties in the tongue they were most
                    familiar with. At the expiration of the prescribed time, 1st of January 1823, a
                    decree fixed the following arrangement on the subject of languages :—1. The use
                    of the French language shall be preserved in the Walloon provinces of Liège,
                    Hainault, and Namur. 2. The use of the Dutch language shall continue to be
                    maintained in Holland. 3. The use of the Flemish language, in its several
                    idioms, shall be re-established in the Flemish provinces. 4. The German language
                    shall be used in the German part of the grand duchy of Luxembourg. In short, it
                    was provided that the official language in each of the provinces should be that
                    which was used and understood by the mass of the people who inhabited them.</p>
                <p>The profession of the law in Belgium forms a body which, next to the clergy, is
                    the most formidable body of any. They had been trained by the study of French
                    eloquence, and the young advocates, when called upon to plead in the language of
                    the country, were often mortified by the ridicule of the audience. They did not
                    wish to incur the displeasure of the Belgians by degrading their language, and
                    therefore directed their attacks on the Dutch language, which, for that purpose,
                    they confounded with the Flemish. In these attacks they were joined by the
                    writers of many pamphlets, and also those of the public journals. The attacks
                    were very violent. From those on the Dutch language they passed on to attacks on
                    their literature, on their manners, and their morals. The Dutch writers,
                    irritated by these attacks, replied and defended themselves; and thus arose,
                    from mere literary disputes, a powerful and enduring animosity between the two
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The subject of religion was one which, above all others, served to produce
                    discontent. A set of writers who neither had, nor pretended to have, any
                    religious principles, encouraged the government at first in measures of
                    toleration, according to the fundamental law, and were, or affected to be,
                    vehement against the Jesuits, who opposed it. William was no bigot in religion,
                    but it was his desire to raise the character of the Catholic clergy, by
                    imparting <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558594" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8594-0133"/>to
                    them a more extensive and better education than had previously been necessary
                    before entering on their office. With this view he framed regulations which
                    offended the clergy and the ignorant party who submitted to them, and who were
                    at length joined by those who distinguished themselves as liberals, as soon as
                    they saw that some advantages could be drawn from that union to forward their
                    own republican views.</p>
                <p>The Catholic clergy in Belgium had submitted to the regulation of their affairs
                    which French subjugation had imposed. The vicar of the diocese of Ghent has
                    indeed been unwilling to allow this; but Baron de Keverburg, himself a Catholic,
                    and under the French regime governor of West Flanders, asserts most positively
                    that the imperial institutions were observed in Belgium as elsewhere; that the
                    catechism of the empire was taught to almost every one; and that the four
                    articles of the clergy of France formed a part of the religious instruction in
                    all the Belgian departments. As soon as the kingdom was established, they
                    brought forward claims to power which they dared not even to whisper under
                    Napoleon, and even carried those claims to an extent beyond what they had been
                    urged for the last three or four centuries, and beyond what are acknowledged in
                    the Catholic kingdoms of Europe.</p>
                <p>The vicar-general of Ghent had required, as essential to the establishment of the
                    kingdom of the Netherlands, “le rétablissement de tous les articles des anciens
                    pactes inauguraux, constitutions, chartes, <hi rend="italic">et cetera,</hi> en
                    ce que concerne, non sculement le libre exercise de religion Catholique, mais
                    aussi les droits, privilèges, exemptions, et prérogatives des éveques, prélats,
                    des maisons-dieu, et des autres institutions religieuses quelconques.” A single
                    exception was indeed admitted to this exercise of power. The church would
                    indulge the monarch so far as “accorder au prince et à sa cour des
                    chapelles,bien entendu sculement dans l’enceinte des palais royaux.” Thus these
                    old powers, which the French had destroyed twenty years before, were to be
                    restored; and then the prelates would allow, but only to the king and his
                    family, the toleration of his own worship in secret. According to the principle
                    of the prelates, the chief and sole duty of the temporal power was, in its
                    relation to the Catholic church and its'clergy, limited to “protéger la religion
                    et ses ministres, à faire exécuter les lois de l’église, à faire punir les actes
                    extérieurs nuisibles à la société religieuse.”</p>
                <p>This extraordinary claim of the church to a power independent of, and in fact
                    governing the state, would not, on its own account, have deserved the notice
                    here taken of it. It was at least quieted by the prudent conduct of the king,
                    who suffered the Count Mean, one of the prelates, upon his nomination to a seat
                    in the council of state, to swear to the tolerating constitution under a
                    protest, that if the pope should declare the oath to be contrary to the rights
                    of the church, it should thereby cease to be binding. The king, whilst he
                    adhered to the constitutional principle of tolerating other sects, extended his
                    liberality to the Catholic clergy, by increasing the stipends of the inferior
                    orders; by making provision for those who, from age or infirmity, were incapable
                    of performing theirduty; and by contributing liberally to the erection or
                    repairs of churches where the communal funds were inadequate to the purpose. The
                    opposition of the clergy was for a time dormant; but it was again roused, when,
                    at a subsequent period, the leaders of the church formed a junction with the
                    leaders of the French party, and thus placed the lower classes, who could not
                    read their effusions, but were under the influence of the priests who spoke to
                    them in Flemish, in a state of hostile excitement towards the government. The
                    hostility of the clergy was much aggravated by the attempts made to improve the
                    education of the priests. The king had determined that no priest should be
                    inducted who had not passed two years in the study of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >literae</hi><hi rend="italic">humaniores</hi> before his ordination, and
                    appropriated a college at Louvain for that purpose, to which was given the
                    unfortunate name of the <hi rend="italic">philosophical</hi> college, a name
                    with good Catholics almost equivalent to infidel or heretic. The prelates, to
                    counteract this, established seminaries connected with the cathedrals, in which
                    the pupils were instructed in their humanities. These contravened the design of
                    the king, and were forcibly shut up. It was an objection to the philosophical
                    college that the professors of history were not priests, but laymen, and some
                    Protestants. This may not seem a solid ground of declining to attend lectures on
                    history; but it was so with the Catholics; for, as their doctrines rest quite as
                    much on tradition as on the Holy Scriptures, it was of vast importance that
                    history should be taught by those alone who were orthodox in their opinions. In
                    truth, the critical spirit of some of the German professors would make sad work
                    with many parts of the traditions held sacred by the Catholic church. The
                    prelates, in the discussions on this subject, indulged in language of a violent
                    kind, and were prosecuted. A law enacted by Napoleon was made the instrument of
                    condemning one or two of them to banishment, and excited no small degree of
                    hatred amongst their adherents, who, if not the most enlightened, were the most
                    numerous, portion of the inhabitants. These mortifications were increased by
                    circumstances of inferior importance. Some of the religious festivals were
                    curtailed, certainly with no views inimical to religion, but to benefit the
                    morals of the people, by lessening the number of days that were devoted to
                    idleness and drunkenness. The architecture of the national schools was similar
                    to that of the reformed places of worship, and the youth of the country were
                    forbidden to be educated out of the kingdom. These trifles were magnified into
                    matters of plain evidence of a regular system to proselytise the whole of the
                    Netherlands. Whilst these controversies respecting religion and education were
                    carried on, the conduct of the king was applauded and encouraged by the active
                    party of the liberals, who represented them as proper steps to secure the people
                    from the insidious attempts made by the Jesuits to blind and cajole them. There
                    was no evidence of any plan of the kind on the part of the Jesuits, and it was
                    only affectation in the liberals to insinuate it. It served their turn for the
                    time, but was soon forgotten, when it appeared advantageous for their party
                    purposes to join with the most bigoted of the Catholics against the government
                    of the house of Orange.</p>
                <p>Another subject was at times brought forward, and must be added to the causes of
                    the internal disunion between the two parts of the kingdom. The number of
                    members of the representative body had been fixed at the time of the union, and
                    made equal for Holland and for Belgium. The subject was then investigated with
                    the greatest deliberation, and all parties were content. It had been suggested
                    that Belgium brought, to form the kingdom, a more numerous population than
                    Holland, and therefore ought to have a greater proportion of members in the
                    assembly. But, upon the other hand, it was shown that the colonies which Holland
                    brought to the common stock contained, in Asia, Africa, and America, as many
                    persons as rendered them equal in number, and, in regard to common advantage,
                    much superior to Belgium; and, besides this, it was urged, that the Dutch
                    contributed to the common cause a powerful fleet and an army, with the stores
                    belonging to both services. This point was, however, settled with perfect
                    cordiality, and remained at rest during several years. But at length it was
                    thought necessary to extend to Belgium the Dutch system of taxation on the
                    grinding of com. This was severely felt, and gave rise to renewed agitation as
                    to the inequality of representation in reference to the numbers of inhabitants.
                    It became a more prominent <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558607"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8607-0134"/>object, because the tax was imposed only by a
                    majority of two votes, all the Hollanders voting for the measure, and all the
                    Belgians but two against it.</p>
                <p>During the whole of the period from 1815 to 1829 the popularity of the monarch
                    was very variable. After the uttering of some loud complaints, as alleged
                    grievances arose, they seemed to die away and be forgotten; and, till some new
                    cause supervened, the king was as much respected as his best friends could wish.
                    At no time, indeed, was his personal character assailed; and the general feeling
                    in Belgium was, that he always meant well, but gave too ready an acquiescence to
                    what they tauntingly called the schemes of their <hi rend="italic">Dutch
                    cousins.</hi></p>
                <p>The king, attacked by two parties, by the priests and their bigoted followers on
                    one side, and by the republicans on the other, avowed his intention to act with
                    indifference to all parties in the pursuit of what he deemed for the general
                    advantage. In conformity with this disposition a <hi rend="italic"
                    >concordat</hi> was in 1827 entered into with the pope, by which the right of
                    nomination to the bishoprics was settled. It was provided that each should be
                    selected by the pope out of three individuals to be nominated by the king, and
                    that the education of the priests should be under the control of the prelates;
                    but that in the seminaries professors should be appointed to teach the sciences,
                    as well as what related to ecclesiastical matters. This arrangement was highly
                    satisfactory to the cool and thinking part of the community, but was far from
                    pleasing to the extravagant partisans. The clergy thought that too little had
                    been granted to them, and the liberals that too much power was conferred on
                    their order. Conciliatory as this measure was intended to be, it thus proved
                    nugatory; and several nominations of Belgians to offices before filled by
                    Dutchmen had no better effect.</p>
                <p>Brussels at this time contained a most heterogeneous foreign population,
                    consisting of the intriguing and discontented subjects of almost every country
                    of Europe. There were of Frenchmen, regicide conventionalists, exiled
                    Na-poleonists, and proscribed constitutionalists, besides Italian carbonari,
                    expatriated Poles, Spanish liberals, disgraced Russians, English and Irish
                    radicals, and visionary students from the various parts of Germany. As the
                    greater part of these had but insecure means of subsistence, and for the most
                    part understood the French language, the press groaned with libels, not more
                    against the Belgian than against all other governments, and thus contributed
                    towards the production of a high state of political excitement. The press of the
                    capital also furnished cheap editions of such works as, either from their
                    irreligious, immoral, or democratic tendency, were prohibited in France; and
                    thus became a nuisance to the regular governments of Europe. The great mass of
                    the population could not be inflamed by these fire-brands; few of them could
                    read, and fewer still could read French. They were, however, acted upon by other
                    means. The Flemish preachers, schoolmasters, and confessors, in their several
                    spheres, were ready to join in any movement, and were sure to be supported by
                    the idle, the dissolute, and the indigent, with which the cities and large towns
                    abounded. To bring the whole body of discontent to bear upon the same point, it
                    was found advisable to form the two parties into one; and this was achieved by
                    the liberals affecting a zeal for the Catholic faith, which they had before
                    treated with contempt and ribaldry. The union was thus formed, meetings of the
                    parties were held, the junction was openly announced, and threatenings were
                    promulgated tending to give confidence to the confederacy, as well as to excite
                    apprehension in the king and his ministers.</p>
                <p>This system of agitation was carried to an extent which no government could
                    behold with indifference, however confident in the rectitude of its measures. It
                    was attempted to oppose the calumniating writers by employing others to
                    counteract their influence; but the attempt was far from successful, as in that
                    kind of warfare the assailants have almost always the advantage on their side.
                    The avowed object of the liberal writers was to urge the clerical party to make
                    such extravagant demands of extensive power as they knew, if granted, would be
                    the ruin of the royal authority, and if refused, would increase the agitation
                    they had already created. Although the whole of the Dutch members of the
                    representative assembly, and several of the most respectable of the Belgian
                    members, gave a majority in favour of the royal party, yet many of the latter
                    adopted most inflammatory language, and, as far as the rules of debate allowed,
                    seconded the views of the united party of the liberals and bigots.</p>
                <p>As the union openly flung defiance at the government, it appeared necessary to
                    bring before the courts of law the most notorious of the inflammatory writers;
                    and two were selected as subjects for prosecution before the court of assizes of
                    South Brabant. These individuals are thus described by the Baron de Keverburg.
                    Of the first, Louis de Potter, he says, “Il s’était fait remarquer longtemps
                    avant les troubles de la Belgique par dés écrits qui, aux yeux de l’église,
                    étaient réputés fort impies, et, aux yeux des hommes doués, d’un peu de
                    délicatesse, de très-mauvais gout. Ce que j’ai de dire sur le second est moins
                    honorable encore. Μ. François Tielemans, avant l’époque pre-indiqué, n’était
                    connu que par les bienfaits qu’il avait recus et qu’il continuait de recevoir du
                    roi, et plus tard il le fut par son ingratitude envers son bienfaiteur.”</p>
                <p>These men, with two others, likewise editors of journals, were sent to the
                    tribunal in which Van Maanen filled the office of presiding judge. The
                    prosecution terminated in a sentence of banishment from the kingdom for the
                    period of eight years; a sentence which brought on the judge the execrations of
                    the libellous journals, and elevated the prisoners to the rank of martyrs. The
                    sentence was put in force by sending the culprits to the frontiers, where they
                    were detained, as neither of the neighbouring states would admit them. The
                    revolution of July occurred in Paris whilst they were in this state; and the
                    party which prevailed in that city allowed them to enter France, and they were
                    received in the capital with great applause by the propagandists.</p>
                <p>The popular mind in Brussels was highly agitated by these trials, which did not
                    operate to restrain the indignant language of the journals, nor the distribution
                    of the most vehement placards, many of them in the Flemish tongue, in which the
                    minister Van Maanen, and the editor of a royalist journal entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">National,</hi> were held up to the public indignation, and
                    threatened with vengeance. In this state of the public feeling, the news of the
                    success of the Parisian mob in overturning the throne was received with
                    enthusiasm. Numbers of the young propagandists from Paris reached Brussels.
                    Assuming to themselves the character of heroes of the revolution, and with
                    feelings of disappointment at the tranquil issue at which it had so soon
                    arrived, these young men displayed the three-coloured cockade in the streets and
                    public places; talked loudly in the theatres and coffee-houses; sang the
                    Marseillaise and Parisienne hymns in chorus with impassioned groups; and dwelt
                    with enthusiasm on the glories of the republic and the empire, aσd the future
                    destiniesof their “young France.” Some of the more active of the Belgians
                    repaired to Paris, and are said to have sounded the new government on the
                    subject of the re-union of their country to France, in the event of the
                    dissolution of the monarchy of the Netherlands. These last were, however, mere
                    adventurers, who had little or no power over, or intercourse with, those who
                    were destined to influence the fate of Belgium.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558620" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8620-0135"/>
                <p>The disturbances which followed at first may be easily concluded to have been the
                    result of mere popular excitation, such as is often seen in large cities. The
                    first symptom of outrage was presented by the audience of the theatre, on the
                    25th of August 1830, after the representation of a piece, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muette</hi><hi rend="italic">de Portici,</hi> which abounded with passages well
                    calculated to kindle a flame amongst materials well charged with inflammable
                    particles. When the curtain fell, the excited audience rushed into the street,
                    exclaiming, “To the office of the National.” They ran thither, soon forced in
                    the doors and windows, and began the work of destruction. They then rushed into
                    the dwelling of the editor, which was speedily demolished, though the obnoxious
                    individual, whose life was threatened, made his escape unhurt. The house of Van
                    Maanen was that next assailed. It was plundered, and then set on fire, and the
                    populace stopped the fire-engine from playing till every thing in it was
                    consumed. The police-office was then attacked; the books, furniture, pictures,
                    and plate of the chief magistrate were brought out and burnt in the street; and
                    the hotel of the provincial governor shared the same fate; whilst some private
                    houses and several manufactories were pillaged, and otherwise much damaged.
                    Fury, confusion, or terror were visible in every countenance, before the civil
                    and military powers made any attempts to stop these disorders; and those which
                    were made showed a want either of the courage or the coolness necessary to act
                    with decision. “From this conduct,” says an eye-witness, “before ten o’clock on
                    the morning of the 26th, the guards and posts in the centre of the city had been
                    overcome, or had tranquilly surrendered; and the troops who had been drawn out
                    either retreated to their barracks, or were withdrawn to the upper part of the
                    city, where they piled their arms in front of the king’s palace, and renounced
                    all attempts at suppressing the tumult.”</p>
                <p>By the operations of these two days, the multitude had in fact gained the mastery
                    of the city, and every one in it felt himself exposed to whatever private
                    malice, political fury, or the love of plunder, might induce the populace to
                    inflict This moved a few of the more influential inhabitants to take up arms,
                    and to enrol themselves into a burgher guard, for the protection of their lives
                    and property. Within three days, not less than as many thousand persons, chiefly
                    heads of families, had enrolled themselves in this corps, and, under chiefs of
                    their own selection, paraded the streets; so that, if they did not put a stop to
                    plunder and destruction, they at least contributed in some degree to contract
                    the extent of the mischief. In such circumstances, the actual power within the
                    city devolved on those who obtained the direction of these hastily organized and
                    scarcely armed citizens. They determined on resisting the troops, which were
                    advancing; and the general who commanded them having no precise orders from the
                    king to act, readily agreed to suspend the march, and entered into a kind of
                    treaty of neutrality with the burghers, till they could receive directions from
                    the Hague, where the king and his family had that year their residence. The
                    intelligence of these events in the capital soon spread throughout the
                    provinces, and in all the large towns, excepting Antwerp and Ghent, similar
                    scenes were exhibited, commencing with plunder and outrages by mobs, and
                    settling down into an uneasy but rather more secure state by the institution of
                    burgher guards.</p>
                <p>The intelligence from Brussels was quickly communicated to the Hague, but the
                    royal councils were divided in opinion. The only positive demand in Brussels was
                    the dismission of the minister Van Maanen; and he offered to resign his post.
                    The king is said to have refused accepting his resignation, whilst the Prince of
                    Orange urged the acceptance of it, and the adoption of some other measures of a
                    conciliatory kind. The result of the decision can only be known by the events
                    which followed; and they show that neither the adoption of concessions, nor the
                    positive use of force, was resolved upon, but a course was pursued which, being
                    some undefined medium between the two different paths, ended, as was natural, in
                    converting a mere popular riot into a confirmed revolution. It was determined by
                    the council that the Prince of Orange should proceed to Brussels on a peaceful
                    commission; whilst the command of the army was conferred on his brother, and the
                    troops advanced with alacrity from the various parts of Holland, where they were
                    quartered, and where the most astonishing zeal was displayed in support of the
                    royal authority.</p>
                <p>The prince, however, departed for Brussels, but only furnished with such limited
                    powers as, in the actual circumstances, were utterly ineffective. On his arrival
                    at Vilvorde, near the city, he was waited on by a deputation from the city,
                    composed of some of the most respectable inhabitants, who had been nominated at
                    a public meeting of the householders. After some preliminary discussions, the
                    prince courageously resolved on entering the city with no other suite than a few
                    officers of his staff. His passage through the streets, crowded with the
                    irregular burgher guard, and a ferocious mob, was attended with imminent risk;
                    but at length he reached his own palace, and commenced a conference. Discussions
                    were continued for several days between the prince on one side, and respectable
                    citizens on the other, which were conducted with firmness and in a conciliatory
                    spirit by both parties. The substance was not a rejection of the royal
                    authority, or of the reigning dynasty, on the part of the citizens, but a
                    separation of the administration of Belgium from that of Holland. They all
                    declared that no wish prevailed for any union with France, but only for such a
                    kind of independence for both countries as had been fixed between Sweden and
                    Norway, with which both countries were satisfied and benefited. It was more than
                    intimated to the prince that the wishes of all Belgium would be fulfilled if he
                    were elevated to the throne; but in answer to such suggestions he firmly asked
                    of one of the most influential men both at that and the present time, “What
                    opinion would you entertain of me were I to sacrifice the interests of my father
                    to my own? What confidence could you repose in a man who could cast off his
                    allegiance to his king, and that king his father, merely to gratify his own
                    ambition? I also am a father,” added the prince with deep emotion, “and am bound
                    to show a proper example to my children. Posterity shall not revert to my name,
                    and revile me as that disloyal Nassau who tore the diadem from his father’s brow
                    to place it on his own.”</p>
                <p>At a final meeting held on the 3d of September, when many members of the
                    states-general attended, it was so fully obvious to the prince that nothing but
                    a separate administration of the two countries would restore tranquillity, that
                    he resolved to use his influence with his father to accomplish that object; and
                    he received the fullest assurance from the persons present, that they would
                    unite in the most efficacious measures to assure the dynasty of the house of
                    Orange, and to protect the territory of Belgium against any attempts to subject
                    it to France, or any other foreign power. The prince expressed his determination
                    to use his most powerful arguments with his father to obtain his assent to this
                    proposal; but expressed his apprehension that he should be unable to succeed in
                    his endeavours. The prince then quitted the city, carrying with him the respect
                    of all those with whom he had communicated, for the courage he had displayed,
                    for the knowledge of public affairs which he discovered, for the cool judgment
                    which he exercised, and, above all, for the sense of parental duty which he had
                    manifested. Whilst these transactions were passing in Brussels, the whole
                    country was in a flame; in every town the populace were triumphant, and indulged
                    unre <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558633" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8633-0136"/>strained
                    in plunder, to which, especially in the important city of Liège, was added the
                    conflagration of several valuable manufacturing establishments. The officers of
                    the army, with no definite orders how to act, were paralyzed in some places, in
                    others gave up their arms, and in others engaged to be neutral.</p>
                <p>The king, amidst the general disorder in Belgium, and the most fanatical
                    attachment to the royal cause in Holland, had summoned the states-general from
                    both divisions to assemble at the Hague. The members from Belgium, with some
                    slight hesitation, resolved to repair thither, and the assembly was opened on
                    the 13th of September, by a speech from the king, which was firm and temperate,
                    but by no means definite. The proceedings of this body were dilatory; the
                    Belgium members were treated with indignity and insult by the populace; and the
                    language of some of the Dutch members expressed vengeance rather than
                    conciliation. The accounts received at Brussels from the Hague, and the warlike
                    demonstrations made by the troops, rekindled and accelerated the preparations
                    for defence, and induced some approaches to organization. The burgher guards had
                    become tired of military duty, and being mostly tradesmen living on their
                    business, which had now been ruined, they were anxious for the return of the
                    tranquillity upon which their existence depended. The leaders of the opposition,
                    however, drew fresh recruits of a more determined and more reckless description
                    from the rude population of the Walloon provinces, from the men employed in the
                    coal and iron mines, and from the iron forges and other works which had been
                    destroyed or shut up in and around Liège. These were, in a great measure, old
                    and hardy soldiers, who had served in the ranks of Bonaparte’s army, and fought
                    in Germany, in Russia, or in Spain. Their arrival in the capital spread terror
                    amongst the peaceable inhabitants, and kindled alarms lest they should be again
                    exposed to the outrages which had marked the first days of the explosion. The
                    defenders were thus divided into two parties; but, as usual, the most violent
                    soon prevailed; and the council of the rabble soon dispersed that of the
                    burghers (for both had their separate assemblies), seized the arms of the
                    latter, and added to them others which had been collected in different parts of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>Although the states were still sitting at the Hague, the king’s army was
                    gradually drawn around Brussels. It consisted of 14,000 well appointed troops,
                    under the command of Prince Frederick. But the motions of this powerful body
                    were so dilatory, and its whole operations so unmilitary, that they are
                    difficult to be accounted for, unless on the supposition that the conduct of the
                    king was too conciliatory when force should have been applied, and too hostile
                    when conciliation would have been of most advantage to his cause. On the 20th of
                    September the council resolved to take possession of Brussels, and orders were
                    sent to Prince Frederick to that effect. This resolution was taken at the Hague
                    in consequence of the information of numerous emissaries from Brussels, who
                    represented the inhabitants as eager to receive the troops, and to assist in
                    putting an end to the anarchy and oppression which the mob were exercising. The
                    most respectable names in the city were appended to these representations, which
                    were doubtless sincere, but came from such as were more prepared to enjoy the
                    return of peace and good government than to contribute any share of their
                    personal services to secure these blessings.</p>
                <p>On the 25th, the troops advanced towards the city, and with little opposition
                    occupied the upper portion or court part of it, which is situated on a hill, by
                    which the whole of the rest of the town is commanded. The opponents in the lower
                    part of the city were dispirited and disunited, and most of the more violent
                    leaders had fled. But the commanders of the army seem to have been seized with a
                    panic, or to have dreaded doing too much mischief to the houses and property of
                    the more wealthy inhabitants. In the square, where the troops had been drawn up,
                    they were exposed to a galling fire from an invisible enemy, who, from the roofs
                    of the houses, and from the cellars, picked off the officers and men without
                    being much exposed to any return from the troops. Instead of destroying the
                    houses and buildings which concealed the assailants, the prince had recourse to
                    unavailing negotiations, and, after three days of most harassing service,
                    determined to withdraw his troops. He had the means of stopping all supplies
                    from entering the city, and thus of effecting a surrender by starvation; or, by
                    a bombardment, he might have easily enforced submission. Why neither of these
                    means were adopted cannot be certainly known; but the friends of the royal party
                    attribute it to humanity alone. The loss of lives was not very great on the side
                    of the king’s troops, considering their exposed situation, and the number
                    engaged. It is stated in the returns as 138 killed, and 650 wounded; whilst of
                    the defenders of the city, though far inferior in numbers, the casualties were
                    acknowledged by themselves to be 450 killed, and 1250 wounded. This disparity
                    must be considered as one of the many extraordinary circumstances of the
                    transactions, and renders the result utterly incomprehensible. The incredible
                    intelligence of this repulse was rapidly conveyed to the provinces, with great
                    exaggerations; and disaffection, anarchy, and demoralisation were spread
                    everywhere. The army retreated towards Antwerp, which, in spite of the force
                    near it, soon became involved in confusion. Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, and the other
                    towns in that direction, immediately became a prey to the revolutionary party,
                    and experienced the horrors of anarchy in the destruction of some of their most
                    extensive manufacturing establishments. The universal rejoicing of the Belgians
                    did not prevent some measures from being adopted to restrain outrages. In a few
                    days, some individuals, with the general acquiescence, formed themselves into a
                    provisional government. They were for the most part men of character and
                    property; but amongst them was De Potter, who had returned as soon as the danger
                    was over, and had been placed by the popular feeling at the head of the body.
                    His power was but of short duration, and he soon fell into utter insignificance,
                    if not contempt, as did others of the original leaders of the insurrection. When
                    those of the representatives who had assembled at the Hague returned home, and
                    their conduct was reviewed in a dispassionate manner, the weight of their
                    character gave them an influence which proved favourable to the return of order.
                    Some of them were added to the body forming the provisional government, and they
                    exercised their influence with prudence, firmness, and integrity.</p>
                <p>In the provisional government the state of parties was singular, from the variety
                    of opinions. De Potter, who looked forward to the dignity of president,
                    advocated a republican form of government; Gendebeer, a decided advocate of
                    democracy, preferred a union with France; whilst Van de Weyer wished for an
                    independent government, on a monarchical basis, with the Prince of Orange at the
                    head, if he would consent to withdraw altogether from his Dutch obligations, and
                    become exclusively the sovereign of Belgium. The plan of Van de Weyer was known
                    to be favoured by all the kings of Europe; and even France, at that moment under
                    the pilotage of Lafayette, was averse to the entire exclusion of the Nassau
                    dynasty, and sent an agent to Brussels to forward his views. Gendebeerhad
                    visited Paris, and therefound little or no disposition amongst the leading
                    people to agree to a union with the Belgians, which, they were aware, would
                    involve them in a war with all those powers that had founded the kingdom of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558646" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8646-0137"/>Netherlands in
                    1815, solely as a European object and a barrier against France.</p>
                <p>It soon became evident in Belgium itself that republicanism had made little or no
                    progress. The prevailing opinion was strong in favour of the Catholic religion,
                    with all its ancient powers and observances, but stronger still in favour of a
                    nationality independent of all foreign control. This latter spirit contributed
                    to increase the number of those who had taken up arms; and by such persons the
                    repulse of the Dutch at Brussels was vainly considered as an evidence of the
                    military power of the people. Many of the privates, and a few Belgians of
                    distinction, had been in the army of Prince Frederick; but they soon left his
                    colours, and entered the ranks of their countrymen. The Belgian colours waved on
                    every tower in the country, except those of Antwerp and Maestricht; when the
                    Dutch army, greatly reduced in numbers as regarded subalterns and privates, but
                    with the artillery in complete order, withdrew into their own territory.</p>
                <p>The council of the king at the Hague resolved on the separation of the two
                    governments into different administrations; but it was then too late to produce
                    reconciliation; and an attempt made by the Prince of Orange to procure for
                    himself the supremacy of Belgium had no other effect than to beget contempt in
                    that country, and to draw upon himself the temporary suspicion of double dealing
                    towards his father and his countrymen in Holland.</p>
                <p>The transactions which took place at Antwerp in October had the further effect of
                    rendering the Belgians still more adverse to the Orange dynasty than they had
                    before been. That city was invested by a Belgian force, whilst within,
                    notwithstanding the resistance of the armed burghers, thepopulace became masters
                    of the place; and the citadel was occupied by a garrison of 8000 good troops,
                    commanded by the bravest of the Dutch officers, General Chasse. A truce had been
                    concluded between the adverse parties, and a white flag hoisted from the fort;
                    but the Belgian officers were unable to maintain it, the populace having begun
                    an attack on the citadel, though with no other arms than muskets. This was not
                    returned, but a cannon was brought forward by the populace, and a fire opened on
                    the gates of the citadel, which, as the Belgian officers assert, was without
                    their approbation or knowledge. On this infraction of the truce, Chasse ordered
                    two or three guns to be fired from the bastion facing the arsenal. This being
                    found ineffectual, the white flag was taken down; a signal was made to the
                    fleet, consisting of eight vessels of war, in the Scheldt, close to the town;
                    andacannonadeand bombardment commenced. It was more terrific than injurious, the
                    fire being chiefly directed against the arsenal and the entrepôt, where all the
                    military and naval stores in the former were destroyed; whilst in the latter
                    large quantities of sugar, coffee, hides, cloths, silks, and spices, were burned
                    and buried in the ruins of the storehouses. The firing had continued some hours
                    when a deputation from the city made their way to the citadel, and proposed a
                    suspension of hostilities, which was instantly agreed to, and the firing ceased.
                    Never, perhaps, was exaggeration or misrepresentation carried farther than on
                    this occasion, in the reports printed and circulated through Belgium; and the
                    effect which they produced destroyed the last hope of those who wished well to
                    the Orange dynasty. Since that event, official accounts made out by the Belgian
                    custom-house show, that the whole loss of goods in the stores amounted to
                    1,888,000 florins, or L.157,200; whilst the damage done to private buildings,
                    and the furniture in them, amounted to 679,466 florins, or L.59,450. In this the
                    loss of the public buildings was not included. The number of the killed was only
                    sixty-eight, of whom seventeen were military men, and the others those of the
                    populace who had caused the calamity. The Dutch asserted that the fire was
                    confined almost wholly to the spot where the munitions of war were stored, and
                    that the rest of the city was designedly spared.</p>
                <p>As all hope of conciliation was thus destroyed, the court of the Hague made
                    pressing solicitations to the four powers who by treaty had formed the kingdom
                    of the Netherlands, to fulfil the obligations imposed upon them by the treaty of
                    Viennaof 1815. But it was soon seen by the answer of Lord Aberdeen, the British
                    secretary of state, and by those of the ministers of the other powers in
                    succession, that none of them was disposed to make use of any other than pacific
                    measures. This proceeding gave rise to negotiations between the allied powers,
                    which were chiefly carried on in London, out of which proceeded numerous
                    protocols, which had no decisive influence on the course of events. The public
                    affairs of Europe favoured the independence of Belgium. All the powers were in
                    alarm at the recent events in France, and all feared, not that the scarcely
                    seated king would willingly commence a war of aggression, but that the
                    democratic party might become sufficiently powerful to compel him to associate
                    himself with the Belgians, and to bring that country under the power of France.
                    -The obvious interest of the four great powers was tranquillity, and the
                    securing of the Continent against Flanders becoming the base of military
                    operations towards the centre of Europe. If these could be obtained, it mattered
                    little whether they arose from the junction or the separation of the two
                    portions which had formed the kingdom of the Netherlands. The first meeting of
                    the ministers of the great powers showed that they merely considered themselves
                    as arbitrators between the northern and southern divisions of the
                    newly-dissolved kingdom; and their first measures were addressed to the object
                    of a suspension of hostilities, which was to a limited extent acquiesced in by
                    both parties.</p>
                <p>To settle the internal government now became the first object of the Belgians,
                    who considered their independence as firmly assured. A national congress was
                    accordingly assembled at Brussels, consisting of two hundred deputies, chosen in
                    the several provinces, from all tax-paying persons above twenty-five years of
                    age, without exception as to religion. The qualification for the electors and
                    the elected was the paying of taxes, which varied in the several provinces
                    according to their estimated wealth. Thus, in Luxembourg, the poorest province,
                    the qualification was the payment of taxes annually to the amount of twenty-one
                    shillings and sixpence; but from this the required rate was gradually raised,
                    till, in Flanders, the richest of the provinces, the tax paid required to be six
                    pounds five shillings. The assembly was a fair representation of the people of
                    Belgium; for scarcely any proprietor was excluded from voting, whilst in the
                    larger towns and cities the mere populace, from the qualification being higher,
                    had not the means of introducing their favourites. As soon as the assembly met,
                    the demagogues, who had contributed to the revolution, became insignificant. De
                    Potter, Thielman, and the others who had been martyrs and heroes with the mob,
                    sunk into insignificance.</p>
                <p>The assembly proceeded to business in a regular manner. Three important
                    propositions were presented to the congress. The first was the declaration of
                    independence, which was voted unanimously; the second, proposed on the 22d of
                    November, decided against a republic, and in favour of a constitutional
                    hereditary monarchy, by a majority of 174 against thirteen votes, but it did not
                    fix on the title of the future chief of the state; the third proposition,
                    brought forward on the 23d, was for the perpetual exclusion of the Orange Nassau
                    family. This was debated during two days, and at the close was agreed to by a
                    majority of 161 against twenty-eight. The object of the minority was to delay
                    the proposition till a more cool and distant period, and till it could be known
                    whether the revolution which had taken place would lead to a war against
                    Belgium. Mr Van de Weyer had, however, returned from a mission to London, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558659" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8659-0138"/> and it was
                    commonly believed he had ascertained that the sentiments of Lord Grey and the
                    new ministers were as averse to any warlike interference as those which had been
                    previously expressed by the Duke of Wellington and Lord Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>It seems probable, that at the period in question the governments of England and
                    France were co-operating in endeavours to place the Prince of Orange on the
                    throne of Belgium; even if it could be accomplished in defiance of the positive
                    declaration of the king his father, who did not scruple to assert, “that he
                    would rather see De Potter placed on the throne than the Prince of Orange.” But
                    if such was the desire of the two kingdoms, it was soon discovered to be utterly
                    impracticable, though much time was spent under the impression of its
                    feasibility, and much suspicion excited amongst the Belgians against the
                    sincerity of France.</p>
                <p>Whilst the plenipotentiaries were settling the most equitable plan for separating
                    the two countries, and had given their view with respect to the boundaries of
                    each, they also adjusted what portion of the debt of the Netherlands should be
                    assigned to Belgium, and what to Holland, fixing the former at ½∣ parts, and the
                    latter at ½f parts. These discussions led to others; and it soon became known,
                    that however independent Belgium might become as regarded Holland, it was too
                    dependent on the superior power of the European kingdoms to be permitted the
                    spontaneous nomination of the individual who was to become its sovereign. At
                    that time a large, perhaps a predominant, party in the assembly would have
                    preferred one of the Bonaparte family; but this, it soon appeared, would not be
                    permitted by France. Another party were inclined to select a son of Louis
                    Philip, the king of the French; but intimations had been communicated to that
                    prince, that England would consider an acquiescence in the project as a
                    sufficient cause of war; and he agreed to the exclusion of his son, but so
                    privately that it was only known to a few individuals beyond the diplomatic
                    circles. The partisans of the house of Orange took no open and avowed part in
                    these discussions.</p>
                <p>The inefficiency of this representative assembly to the real purposes of a
                    government was speedily shown in the long and bombastical speeches of the
                    members; in the absolute confusion in every department, whether civil, military,
                    or judicial; and in the mobbing and plundering which prevailed in all' the
                    provinces. The necessity for an executive power was so strongly felt by the more
                    reflecting members of the assembly, that after several days’ preparatory debate,
                    it was resolved, on the 19th of January 1831, to proceed to the election of a
                    chief on the 28th of that month. The election of a sovereign, or rather of a
                    dynasty, was enough to kindle agitation and intrigue; but perhaps less of these
                    than might have been expected was discoverable, from the great number of the
                    candidates whose pretensions were urged. On the day before the election,
                    petitions were presented to the assembly in favour of Lafayette, Fabvier,
                    Chateaubriand, the Prince of Carignan, the Archduke Charles; Surlet de Chokier,
                    Charles Rogier, and Felix de Merode, private Belgians; Prince Otho of Bavaria,
                    John duke of Saxony, a Prince of Salm, the Pope, the Duke of Nemours, second son
                    of Louis Philip, and the Duke of Leuchtenburg· Besides these, the Duke of Lucca,
                    the Duke of Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon, and the Prince of Capua, brother of
                    the king of the Two Sicilies, were suggested. The choice of the last was
                    seriously contemplated by the French, through Talleyrand; but the Belgians
                    showed no predilection for him, although he was not objectionable to any of the
                    four powers. Had the Belgians showed any decided eagerness for Prince Otho of
                    Bavaria, it was known that he would have been recognised by England, France, and
                    Prussia; and that he would then have obtained the hand of the Princess Mary,
                    third daughter of the king of the French. But his age, for he was only fifteen,
                    formed an objection with the Belgians. The popular press, decidedly democratic,
                    was most united in favour of the Duke of Leuchtenburg; but its power had been
                    used till it was exhausted; and, besides, the choice was in better hands than
                    those who are influenced by its inflammatory declamations. It is remarkable,
                    that amongst the long list of candidates the name of Prince Leopold was never
                    once mentioned. It has been suggested that England had not even then abandoned
                    the hope of fixing the Prince of Orange on the throne. This would have been
                    approved of by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and by the nobles and wealthier
                    part of the Belgians, but not by France, as Louis Philip was disposed to fear
                    that the example of enthroning the son of the deposed monarch might hereafter
                    have been taken as a precedent in favour of the Duke of Bordeaux against his son
                    in France.</p>
                <p>At the eve of the election, however, by some strange caprice of circumstances,
                    all the names were withdrawn excepting the two, who, all intelligent persons
                    knew, could not be allowed to rule. It was remarked of them by Northomb, one of
                    the most respectable of the democratic members, that “the Duke of Leuchtenburg
                    was essentially antiFrench, without being European, whilst the Duke of Nemours
                    was so exclusively French as to be directly antiEuropean.” It is singular that
                    both these personages had been declared inadmissible by the conference of the
                    representatives of the great powers. The name of the Archduke Charles of Austria
                    was then brought forward; but he could only be considered as a cloak for the
                    partisans of the Prince of Orange, and for other members, who knew he would not
                    accept the dignity, for the purpose of reducing that absolute majority of the
                    whole voters which was necessary to the choice. The votes were taken by ballot,
                    and the following result appeared when the names were drawn from the urn :—The
                    total number of voters was 191, and consequently the required absolute majority
                    was ninety-six. Nine members being absent, there appeared for the Duke of
                    Nemours eighty-nine, for the Duke of Leuchtenburg sixty-seven, and for the
                    Archduke Charles thirty-five, so that, in fact, there was no election. A new
                    voting then became necessary, and the second scrutiny gave a definite result.
                    Another member had entered, making 192, and consequently the absolute majority
                    required was ninety seven. The state of the voting then appeared to be, for
                    Nemours ninety-seven, for Leuchtenburg seventy-four, and for the archduke
                    twenty-one. This annunciation was received with acclamation by the populace, and
                    with expressions of joy by the partisans of the successful candidate, who well
                    knew his father would not permit him to accept the offered crown. A deputation
                    was despatched to Paris to announce the choice. But the throne was refused, and
                    the deputies returned after paying and receiving some unmeaning compliments.</p>
                <p>The moment was seized by the partisans of the Prince of Orange in order to raise
                    a commotion in his favour. It was a wild project, confined to Ghent, Bruges, and
                    Antwerp, where his adherents were numerous, especially amongst the lower class,
                    who had been thrown out of employment by the cessation of commerce and
                    manufactures. The attack on Ghent was speedily quelled, and the leader fled; but
                    he was seized on his way to France, and on his person were found letters from
                    the Prince of Orange, then in London, encouraging the project. This unsuccessful
                    effort, and the evidence of the prince’s participation in it, proved very
                    injurious to his cause; and even sober men who had favoured him, were disgusted
                    with what appeared’ to them to be an attempt to involve the country in a civil
                    war.</p>
                <p>On the refusal of France, the assembly, still feeling the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558672" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8672-0139"/>want of an executive power,
                    passed an act that the throne was vacant, thereby establishing the monarchical
                    principle, and then proceeded to the election of a regent as a temporary
                    measure. The choice fell upon Baron Surlet de Chokier, a worthy, well-meaning
                    man, of no great abilities, who showed little solicitude for the dignity; and on
                    the 25th of February he was installed with some parade. Plots and conspiracies
                    were forming around him in every direction, and the demon of civil war was
                    urging on the people to mutual destruction. The feeble government of the regent
                    could produce neither obedience nor tranquillity within the country; and it was
                    threatened by the Dutch, who adhered to their king and his purposes with equal
                    union and ardour. It was reported, during the regency, that schemes for the
                    dismemberment of Belgium were contemplated by some of the continental powers.
                    According to this project, two thirds of Flanders, the province of Antwerp, and
                    the northern half of Limburg and Brabant, including Brussels, would have fallen
                    to Holland; the eastern part of Luxembourg, with Liège and other territories
                    upon the left bank of the Meuse and the Moselle, would have been transferred to
                    Prussia; and Namur, Hainault, and the west part of Flanders, would have been
                    ceded to France. If this project was seriously entertained, it received such
                    discouragement from the British government, that it was speedily abandoned.
                    About the same period, that is, about a month after the instalment of the
                    regent, extensive plans were formed for a general rising amongst the Orange
                    party, in connection with some of the chief officers of the army and the most
                    influential leaders of the burgher guards of Brussels. But this came to nothing,
                    having, it is said, been discountenanced by the British minister at Brussels,
                    who saw no other effect that could arise from it but a general European war. It
                    is said that after some discussion respecting Luxembourg, and checking the petty
                    hostilities on the frontier, the British government in April gave up all hope of
                    establishing the Prince of Orange on the Belgic throne. On the 12th of that
                    month a kind of proposition was made by some of the influential members of the
                    assembly, and privately communicated to Sir Edward Cust, one of the equerries of
                    Prince Leopold, with the design of ascertaining whether the prince, if chosen,
                    would accept the crown. Leopold answered in the affirmative, but strictly
                    abstained from giving any authority to make exertions in his favour. He was
                    however convinced, before the election, that a vast majority of the electors
                    would vote in his favour; and that he should have all the aid of the clergy and
                    the high Catholic nobility, with no opposition but from the French and movement
                    party, and the few Orangeists that had seats in the assembly. A deputation of
                    four members repaired to Claremont, and had an interview with the prince. They
                    explained their object, and the conditions upon which they were authorized to
                    offer the crown, and awaited his reply. It manifested a noble, simple, and frank
                    disposition, and concluded thus: “All my ambition is to contribute to the
                    happiness of my fellow-creatures. When yet young, I found myself in so many
                    difficult and singular situations, that I have learned to consider power only
                    with a philosophic eye. I never coveted it but for the sake of doing good,
                    durable good. Had not certain political differences arisen, which appeared to me
                    essentially opposed to the independence of Greece, I should now be in that
                    country; and yet I never attempted to conceal from myself the difficulties of my
                    position. I am aware how desirable it is that Belgium should have a sovereign as
                    soon as possible. The peace of Europe is deeply interested in it.”</p>
                <p>The deputation returned, and many stormy discussions ensued. Attempts were made
                    to defer the election till all differences with Holland were settled; but these
                    were overcome by the votes of 137 to 48. The election took place on the 4th of
                    June, when 152 votes out of 196, four only being absent, determined that Prince
                    Leopold should be proclaimed king of the Belgians, under the express condition,
                    that he “would accept the constitution, and swear to maintain the national
                    independence and territorial integrity.”</p>
                <p>This choice, though not expressly unanimous, was such in reality; for of the
                    minority of forty-three, nineteen voted on the ground that the election was
                    premature, fourteen voted for Baron Surlet de Chokier, solely on account of
                    private friendship, and thus the real opposition to Leopold consisted only of
                    ten. Though the voting was by ballot, yet the vote of every man was known; and
                    all who dared, gave reasons for it, except the ten, who were well known as
                    terrorists.</p>
                <p>Leopold lost no time in repairing to the post to which he was appointed, and,
                    with only one aide-de-camp and a few domestics, landed at Ostend on the 17th of
                    June, and proceeded directly through Ghent to the palace of Lacken, near
                    Brussels. He made his public entry into that city on the 21st, and was received
                    with cordiality by the higher classes, and by the populace with loud
                    acclamations. The king took the oath to the constitution; the regent delivered
                    up his power; and the congress was dissolved, to make way for the election of
                    the members who were to form the two legislative chambers, as prescribed by the
                    fundamental laws.</p>
                <p>The first chamber, or the senate, was to consist of fifty members, chosen for
                    eight years, but one half of them was to be renewed at the end of four years.
                    The qualifications were to be, having attained the age of forty years, and
                    paying direct taxes to the amount of 1000 florins, or L.84 yearly. The second
                    chamber was to consist of 101 members, being at the rate of one for 40,000
                    inhabitants. They were to be of the age of twenty-five years, to pay annual
                    direct taxes to the amount of L.8, and to be paid at the rate of 200 florins, or
                    L.16, each month during the session. They were to be renewed by one half
                    retiring at the end of two years, but they might be again elected.</p>
                <p>After a few formalities, and appointing the ministers to compose the cabinet, on
                    the choice of which much judgment was exercised, the king left the capital to
                    visit Antwerp, Liège, and the other parts of the new kingdom, and was everywhere
                    received with demonstrations of respect and of loyalty. But whilst the
                    proceedings just narrated were passing in Belgium, a storm was gathering on the
                    side of Holland, which had not been anticipated, and to meet which no adequate
                    preparations had been made. The Belgians relied on the armistice which the
                    conference of the ambassadors had established, and the few measures which were
                    taken by them discovered only the confusion and disorder inseparable from all
                    popular movements. In Holland, every thing betokened tranquillity, order, and
                    loyalty. The different orders of the government and the people were more eager
                    for punishing what they denominated the rebellion, than even the king and his
                    family. A powerful army was quickly assembled. It was well disciplined,
                    officered, and appointed, and furnished with an ample train of artillery; and
                    yet all was done with so much secrecy, that till that army was ready to advance
                    beyond the frontiers, no preparation was made to resist it.</p>
                <p>Much dispute has arisen relative to the right of Holland to commence hostilities
                    without due notice of the cessation of the armistice; but, on the other hand,
                    Holland maintained that due notice had been given. The whole turned on the
                    precise sense of the words “ses.moyens militaires,” in a note delivered by the
                    Dutch ministers to the conference of ambassadors. The king was certainly
                    encouraged in the enterprise by the stormy scenes exhibited in the Belgian
                    assembly between the period of Leopold’s election and the time of his arrival.
                    By the noxious influence of the press, such angry passions had been kindled in
                    every <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558685" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8685-0140"/>division
                    of society, as seemed to threaten internal war; but happily a most powerful
                    speech of Mr Lebau in favour of union, and urging the importance of rallying
                    round their new monarch, had the effect of producing feelings of tranquillity;
                    though no language had power to produce order or infuse energy, when the time
                    approached for the exhibition of the one and the exercise of the other.</p>
                <p>The Prince of Orange having assumed the command of the Dutch army at Breda, on
                    the 1st of August, the order to advance was instantly given; and the march of
                    the several divisions commenced the next day. This was a complete surprise to
                    the Belgians, who were unprepared at every point to resist a disposable army of
                    more than 40,000 men. It is not necessary here to describe the position and the
                    movements of the various corps on both sides. It was, however, remarked by
                    military men, that the Prince of Orange advanced more deliberately than the
                    occasion required. Leopold collected his forces, such as they were, near
                    Louvain, in order to cover his capital. In this position the Dutch army, having
                    seized the road which led to Brussels on the 9th of August, advanced to attack
                    him. The Belgian troops could not stand for a moment against their opponents,
                    but instantly fled, throwing away their arms, and escaping in disorder; and a
                    neglect of the Dutch, who thoughtlessly left open a road behind Louvain, alone
                    prevented Leopold and his whole staff from becoming prisoners of war. He,
                    however, made good his retreat to the capital, upon which all hostilities
                    ceased. As soon as the movements of the Dutch were known, Leopold appealed to
                    France for assistance. A French army was cantoned on the frontiers, which, by
                    telegraphic communications, was instantly set in motion; and intelligence of
                    their advance was formally announced to the Prince of Orange by Lord William
                    Russell, coupled with an intimation, from the French marshal Gérard, of the
                    determination of the two powers to enforce the abandonment of all military
                    operations. As the French army rapidly entered the country, the Prince of Orange
                    soon saw the necessity of retreating; and a convention was concluded between him
                    and the French general, in consequence of which he returned to Holland, and the
                    French repassed the frontier; so that by the 1st of September both armies had
                    left the Belgian territory.</p>
                <p>The cowardly disgraceful conduct of the Belgic troops was of great benefit to the
                    new government. It showed the reflecting part of the community the folly of
                    trusting the defence of their country to a host of popular partisans, too ready
                    to destroy or to plunder, but too much inflated by the flattery they bestowed on
                    themselves to become efficient defenders when steadily opposed. All saw the
                    necessity of confiding in their chief, and became convinced that a regular army
                    must be formed, in which the men should be compelled to obey their officers. The
                    formation of an army was therefore determined on; but Belgium could not furnish
                    officers. Most of those appointed had been placed in stations of which they were
                    unworthy, because they had been what was called distinguished patriots, that is,
                    leaders of the revolutionary movements; but those active disorganizers were
                    found worse than useless when energy against an enemy required order,
                    discipline, and obedience. By the interference to protect Belgium against
                    Holland, this farther advantage was gained, that the protecting powers were
                    placed in a position to obtain more weight in the negotiations carried on in the
                    conferences of the ambassadors, and both parties were more disposed to leave the
                    contested points respecting boundaries to their arbitration.</p>
                <p>In forming an army, Leopold was assisted by the French, who, as far as could be
                    done, furnished it with able officers; a want which Belgium could by no means
                    supply from the natives of that country. The partisans of the Orange family, on
                    this occasion, justified the conduct of King William previous to the revolution,
                    in having selected few of his officers from the Belgians. The selection of
                    Frenchmen, they contended, proved that William was right in not trusting to
                    officers taken from that division of his kingdom.</p>
                <p>After the Dutch irruption, Leopold proceeded with coolness and vigour to restore
                    order and gain confidence. He kept on the best of terms with the most important
                    party, the Catholic clergy and the Catholic nobility, and avoided any nearer
                    contact with the French party than politeness and civility required. He knew who
                    were the real friends of monarchical government, and his best supporters. His
                    marriage with a daughter of the king of the French, who was a Catholic, and the
                    contract that the children of the marriage should be educated in the Catholic
                    faith, were powerful means of attaching to his throne all those of his subjects
                    who were under the influence of the clergy. The Belgian army, under the French
                    officers, soon attained considerable advancement in organization and discipline.
                    The undisciplined free troops were disbanded, and the best of the men
                    incorporated in the regiment of chasseurs. Some superior officers were
                    superseded, and many of the subalterns dismissed. A military school was
                    established, and a corps of sappers and miners with a pontoon brigade
                    raised.</p>
                <p>The civil list was arranged with economy and order, and the other branches of the
                    public service reformed, and others newly arranged. The talents and the
                    integrity of Leopold, and his benevolent disposition, made a very favourable
                    impression on all that approached him.</p>
                <p>Whilst affairs were thus proceeding within, the great work of general
                    pacification was attended to by the members of the conference in London. A final
                    decision was come to on the 15th of November, expressed in twenty-four articles.
                    These settled the great point of boundaries, and placed the question of
                    Luxembourg in a way the most favourable, as was thought, for future pacific
                    arrangement; but, above all, it expressed a determination “to oppose, by every
                    means in their power, the renewal of hostilities between the two countries.”
                    This arrangement was ratified by the Belgian and French sovereigns on the 20th
                    and 24th of November, by the British on the 6th of December, by Austria and
                    Prussia on the 18th of April 1832, and by Russia on the 4th of May.</p>
                <p>By these articles, the division of the joint debt was fixed on the scale before
                    arranged, viz. ½½ for Belgium, and ½f for Holland; but as the latter had
                    discharged the whole interest as it became due from the first disturbances, she
                    was to be paid the share of the advances, with interest on them at the rate of
                    five per cent. Another point arose out of the settlement of the limits of the
                    two countries. Holland was to have Maestricht, and was in actual possession of
                    that place and its citadel; but Antwerp, which was allotted to Belgium, and was
                    in possession of the Belgians, was commanded by the citadel, which was
                    garrisoned by a Dutch army under the command of General Chasse, a distinguished
                    officer, who, after the annexation of Holland to France, had served in the army
                    of the Emperor Napoleon. The Belgians had given only a conditional ratification
                    of the articles of the 15th of November, upon the express stipulation that the
                    whole of them, in which the possession of the citadel of Antwerp was certainly
                    included, should be fulfilled. They were precluded by that instrument from
                    exercising hostilities, and therefore claimed from the parties to it the
                    performance of its conditions.</p>
                <p>It was important to the allied powers that the throne which they had established
                    in the person of Leopold should be strengthened in the views of his subjects,
                    who had sometimes manifested dispositions to democracy, and at others strong
                    inclinations for a union with France, neither of which were deemed compatible
                    with the interests of the European commonwealth. But it could not retain respect
                    if the con <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558698" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8698-0141"
                    />ditions framed by the founders were to be impugned by the Dutch holding the
                    citadel of Antwerp, whilst they were still in possession of Maestricht. These
                    considerations had their due effect on the conference, who, on the 1st of
                    October, unanimously resolved that forcible means were necessary. They differed
                    in regard to the means, the northern courts wishing to adopt pecuniary coercion,
                    by deducting from the debt due from Belgium to Holland a sum weekly till the
                    fortress was delivered up; but to this France and England objected, as leading
                    only to future and tedious negotiations, during which Rotterdam and Amsterdam
                    might enjoy those exclusive commercial advantages which Antwerp was entitled to
                    share with them.</p>
                <p>Belgium, being wearied with these entangled negotiations, and having now created
                    an army of more than 100,000, gave notice that, unless their territory was
                    evacuated before the 3d of November, they would use force to compel it. But this
                    would have created a war, which all the powers were anxious to prevent. On the
                    22d of October, a convention was therefore entered into between England and
                    France, which was forthwith communicated to the three other powers, of whose
                    passive adhesion they were assured.</p>
                <p>By this convention it was determined, that if the places assigned by the former
                    resolutions to the respective parties were not given up before the 12th of
                    November, France and England would enforce the delivery of these places. This
                    determination was communicated to both nations. Belgium was ready to give up
                    Venloo, which she held; but Holland positively declined surrendering the citadel
                    of Antwerp. The result was, that a combined fleet of English and French
                    proceeded to blockade the ports of Holland, and detain the merchant-ships,
                    whilst France prepared an army to besiege the citadel, without allowing the
                    Belgians in any way to interfere in the military operation. The siege of Antwerp
                    by the French, as a fine practical exemplification of science, became an object
                    of great interest to the military amateurs of all Europe, who repaired thither
                    as spectators. But this is not the place for recording the history of that
                    warlike spectacle. It was vigorously and skilfully attacked; and the defence,
                    which was altogether passive, exhibited a conspicuous example of fortitude and
                    endurance. The first works of the besiegers were opened on the 30th of November,
                    and on the 24th of December the citadel capitulated, when the garrison marched
                    out, and the French took possession of the battered fortress, which, on the 1st
                    of January, they delivered up to the Belgians. The city of Antwerp was not in
                    the least injured, as the approaches were carried on upon the opposite side. The
                    French army shortly afterwards withdrew from Belgium to its own territory. The
                    Dutch garrison was marched into France as prisoners, on the ground that two
                    forts on the river Scheldt, those of Lillo and Liefenschoeck, were still
                    retained by the Dutch. This led to long and complicated diplomatic negotiations,
                    which were at length adjusted, when the captured garrison returned to their own
                    country. Since that period no hostilities have taken place; but, on the other
                    hand, no treaty has been entered into, and consequently no intercourse between
                    the two countries has been permitted.</p>
                <p>Belgium has at length been acknowledged as an independent power by most of the
                    states of Europe, but only provisionally by some of them. Many of the owners of
                    ships, especially of those of the first class, have withdrawn their concerns
                    from Antwerp and Ostend, and formed establishments in Rotterdam and the other
                    parts of Holland. Of these removals, not a few have been caused by the colonies
                    appertaining exclusively to Holland. But this withdrawal has had less influence
                    on the marine commerce of the Netherlands than might have been expected; for
                    British and American ships have brought to Antwerp colonial produce, on quite as
                    favourable terms as they were before supplied, and in sufficient quantity to
                    enable the Belgians to maintain their commerce with the interior of Germany.</p>
                <p>Attempts are now in progress to bring Antwerp in communication with the Rhine.
                    But, on the part of the Prussian government, these have encountered some
                    obstacles, not from any disinclination to the work, but from doubts as to the
                    particular line to be followed, and some financial circumstances respecting the
                    tolls. If the projects in question be accomplished, the Belgians will be much
                    benefited, and have the power of supplying produce to the south of Germany, and
                    also to Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The manufacturers have suffered much from the separation, especially those of
                    Ghent. But a trade has grown up to a wonderful extent, of smuggling English
                    goods of the finer kind into France, which the numerous douaniers have not been
                    able to prevent along such an extended line of frontier.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, which, after all, is the chief source of Belgian wealth, does not
                    appear to have retrograded in consequence of the struggle of the separation. On
                    the contrary, it appeared to the writer of th⅛ article, in two journeys which he
                    made through the country, that much improvement was visible in the appearance of
                    the farms, and in their appurtenances.</p>
                <p>This kingdom, in the condition in which it now exists, is bounded on the north by
                    the kingdom of Holland; on the east by the Prussian, Westphalian, and Rhenish
                    territories; on the south by France; and on the west by the German Ocean.</p>
                <p>. The civil divisions of the kingdom are as follow.</p>

                <p>As the above statement is taken from the official returns of the Belgian
                    government, the disputed portions of Limburg and Luxembourg are included in that
                    kingdom, although still subjects of discussion. The number of the inhabitants is
                    given according to the census of the year 1830, since which the number must have
                    increased. The tables of the population annually furnished by Smits to Quetelet
                    show an excess of births over deaths of 20,000 persons in each year, and
                    consequently the whole population may now (1837) be taken at 4,200,000. Of the
                    population at the census of 1830, the numbers in the cities were about one
                    fourth of the whole: they amounted to 998,118, whilst the rural inhabitants were
                    3,066,117.</p>

                <p>This account is framed in the hectolitre of France, each hectolitre being
                    somewhat more than two English acres and a quarter.</p>
                <p>From the proportion which the rural inhabitants bear to those in the cities, it
                    may be concluded that agriculture is the chief pursuit of the kingdom. It
                    becomes, therefore, a branch of industry of the most interesting kind.</p>
                <p>The land of Flanders is not naturally fertile; on the contrary, its quality is
                    merely such as to admit of fertilization by a series of operations more or less
                    expensive and laborious. Where cultivation has not been extended, the soil
                    produces nothing but heath and fir. As the property of such lands may be
                    acquired for a very small sum, many individuals have attempted to bring portions
                    of it into cultivation, but have almost uniformly found the expense of doing so
                    to exceed the value of the produce which can be drawn from it. Abbé Mann, to
                    whom we are indebted for some valuable communications on the subject of Flemish
                    agriculture, observes, “What land is cultivated in the Campine of Brabant, is
                    owingto the religious houses founded in it, especially to the two great abbeys
                    of Ton-gerloo and Everbode. Their uninterrupted duration for five or six hundred
                    years, and their indefatigable industry, have conquered the barren harsh sands,
                    and rendered many parts of them highly productive. The method they follow is
                    simple and uniform; they never undertake to cultivate more of this barren soil
                    than they have sufficient manure for; seldom more than five or six bunders
                    (fifteen or eighteen acres) in a year; and when it is brought, by labour and
                    manuring, into a state capable of producing sufficient for a family to live on,
                    it is let out to farmers on easy terms, after having built them comfortable
                    habitations. From the undoubted testimony of the historians of the Low
                    Countries, it appears that the cultivation of the greater part of these rich
                    provinces took its rises from the self-same means, 800 or 1000 years ago, when
                    they were in a manner one continued forest.” Although, from the destruction,
                    dispersion, or diminution of the religious communities by the French Revolution,
                    the process of reclaiming other parts of the heaths has been suspended or
                    rendered languid, yet the excellent agricultural practices, which a long series
                    of years had ingrafted into the minds and habits of the sluggish peasantry, have
                    been adhered to with a tenacity which is obviously distinguishable in all the
                    other customs, as well as in the manners, dress, food, and religion of the
                    people. Besides that general system of economy which is indispensable to the
                    success of all efforts, and which there enters into the minutest details of
                    husbandry, the two great objects which seem to be aimed at in all their
                    operations are the increase of those crops which afford sustenance for cattle,
                    and the careful preservation of every substance which can be converted into
                    manure, and returned again to the land, in order to renew its exhausted
                    fertility.</p>
                <p>The foundation upon which the agriculture of Belgium rests is the cultivation of
                    clover, which seems indigenous, since none of the most ancient records notice
                    its introduction, but speak of it as familiarly as of hay or oats. It is
                    probably from this country that the plant in question has been, though but
                    recently, slowly, and hitherto only partially, introduced amongst the farmers of
                    Germany, France, and Great Britain. The clover in Flanders is sown in every sort
                    of grain, in wheat, rye, and winter barley, in the spring of the year, when the
                    blades of those plants have acquired a growth of three or four inches; and with
                    oats and summer barley at the same time with those seeds. It is also often sown
                    with flax; and, in general, the crops grown between those plants are more
                    luxuriant than when sown with the cerealia. It frequently happens, when sown
                    with flax, that clover yields a heavy crop a few months after it is sown, two
                    still more abundant crops the next year, and sometimes even three; and if, as it
                    occasionally happens, it be suffered to stand another year, it will yield one
                    heavy crop, and afterwards good pasture for cattle, till it is ploughed up to
                    receive the seed of wheat, which usually follows it. The original strength of
                    the plants which yield such abundant nourishment is undoubtedly due to the care
                    taken in pulverizing the soil by frequent ploughings and harrowings, to the
                    careful extirpation of all weeds, and to the copious stores of manure laid on
                    the ground, and its complete amalgamation with the soil; but the successive
                    harvests which the plants yield are attributed, and with apparent probability,
                    to the top-dressings which are bestowed upon them. The top-dressings
                    administered to the young clover consist either of rotten yard-dung, lime,
                    pigeons’ dung, coal, or native turf-ashes, and are laid on as soon as the plants
                    begin to extend themselves over the ground. Sometimes the plants are refreshed
                    with a liquid manure, which will hereafter be noticed. These manures, though
                    administered to the clovers, as far as they can be obtained, are found far
                    inferior in powers of fertility to that substance which is most generally used,
                    and the effects of which form the theme of the praises bestowed by all who have
                    witnessed the Belgian husbandry. The turf-ashes of Holland are sown by the hand
                    on the clovers, in quantities varying from eighteen to twenty bushels to the
                    English acre. This small quantity produces a most surprising, and almost magical
                    effect. Within a few weeks after it is sown, a field where none or but slight
                    straggling plants were to be seen becomes covered with a most abundant herbage.
                    The parts of a field sown with these ashes, at the first mowing, show their
                    efficacy in a most striking manner; the clover being frequently a foot higher on
                    such parts than on those where its sowing has been omitted. These ashes are
                    found superior in efficacy to such as are made from the turf commonly used for
                    fuel in Flanders, insomuch that one third of the quantity is deemed sufficient
                    to afford as great productiveness. We have no analysis of the turf-ashes of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558724" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8724-0143"/> Flanders, by
                    which we can form a comparative estimate of the proportional substances which
                    create so vast a difference between their vegetative faculties and those of the
                    turf-ashes of Holland. The latter have been carefully analyzed by Mr Brande,
                    secretary to the Royal Society of London, who found them to contain,</p>
                <p>Siliceous earth 32 parts.</p>
                <p>Sulphate of lime 12</p>
                <p>Sulphate and muriate of soda 6</p>
                <p>Carbonate of lime 40</p>
                <p>Oxide of iron 3</p>
                <p>93</p>
                <p>Impurities and loss 7</p>
                <p>100</p>
                <p>These ashes are brought from Holland by the canals to Brussels, whence they are
                    conveyed by land-carriage to the different farms where they are applied. Long
                    practice has so convinced the Flemish farmers of their benefit, that a common
                    proverb, in the patois of the country, may be thus translated: “He that buys
                    ashes for his clover pays nothing, but he who does it not pays double.” They are
                    frequently fetched from the canal by persons who have to carry them forty or
                    even fifty miles by land.</p>
                <p>The abundance of the clover produced from the soil of Flanders enables the
                    cultivator to maintain a great number of cattle, principally cows, the dung of
                    which is managed with an attention and care that is highly worthy of imitation,
                    and contributes to maintain in a state of high fertility that soil which yields
                    the most exhausting crops. “The farmers,” says the Abbé Mann, “supply the want
                    of straw in the following manner: The peat or sods which are cut from the heath
                    are placed in the stables and cowstalls as litter for the cattle. The ground
                    under them is dug to a certain depth, so as to admit a considerable quantity of
                    these peat sods, and fresh ones are added as the feet of the cattle tread them
                    down into less compass. These compose so many beds of manure, thoroughly
                    impregnated with the urine and dung <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cattle. This
                    mixture produces a compost of excellent quality for fertilizing ground where
                    corn is to be sown.”</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable practice of the Flemish cultivators is the application of
                    liquid manure. Under the farm buildings, large reservoirs are constructed, into
                    which the draining of the dung, the urine of the cattle, and the contents of the
                    privies, all run. This receptacle is divided by rails, so as to prevent any more
                    solid substances from coming into that part where the pump is placed, by which
                    it is raised from the reservoir into the carts employed to convey it to the
                    fields. The liquid in these receptacles is commonly increased in efficacy by
                    throwing into them, for solution, large quantities of rape-cake. This liquid
                    manure, enriched by oil-cake in proportion to the purse or the spirit of the
                    proprietor, is spread over the land, sometimes by the hand; and by habit the
                    workmen have acquired the tact of distributing it equally and in previously
                    prescribed proportions over a whole field. But it is more commonly conveyed to
                    the fields in large casks on wheels, to the bunghole of which is appended a
                    wooden shoot, narrow at the top, and broad at the lower extremity, which spreads
                    the substance equally. For the flax and rape crops this manure is most liberally
                    used. The quantity of this liquid applied to an acre of flax is commonly about
                    2500 gallons of English beer measure, in which about 1000 rape-cakes of three
                    pounds each have been dissolved.</p>
                <p>No country in Europe provides from its soil so great a quantity of sustenance for
                    its inhabitants, so large a surplus of food for exportation, and such valuable
                    commodities to exchange for articles of foreign growth, as Flanders. Besides
                    wheat, rye, barley, oats, pease, beans, and buck-wheat, madder, rape-seed, hops,
                    tobacco, clover-seed, mustard-seed, flax, hemp, poppy-oil, and some other
                    productions, are raised beneficially, both for home consumption and for
                    exportation. As the inhabitants are in every thing averse to innovation or
                    improvement, the implements of husbandry are in a rude state, and very little
                    variation is made from the examples set by their ancestors some centuries ago.
                    The various machines used in England for abridging animal labour in husbandry
                    are unknown, and the use of human beings is still retained in many operations,
                    for which horses and machinery are adopted by us with great advantage. The same
                    aversion to innovate is seen in the management of the cows, the sheep, and the
                    pigs; the races not having been improved by crossing, as in some other
                    countries. The horses seem to have attracted more attention, and the race
                    commonly seen is excellent for agricultural purposes, as well as for the
                    road.</p>
                <p>The separation of Belgium from Holland must have had some effect upon the
                    agriculture of the former country, by excluding for the present the farmers from
                    one of their best markets for corn; but the influence does not appear on the
                    face of the country, where improvements still seem in progress.</p>
                <p>In the most remote periods, the Netherlands were distinguished by their
                    manufacturing skill and industry; Under the Romans, the inhabitants of Arras and
                    several other Flemish cities were celebrated for the production of woollen
                    cloths. At a later period, under the Emperor Charlemagne, a present of fine
                    linen and of woollen cloth, sent to the caliph of Bagdad, Haroun al Raschid, was
                    deemed to display the most curious specimens of the industry and skill of the
                    western world. In the instructions of that monarch (<hi rend="italic">Capitular,
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">Villis Regum Francorum),</hi> it appears that there
                    existed at Liège, and other cities of the Netherlands, very extensive
                    manufactories, both from flax and wool, in the dyeing of which madder and kermes
                    berries were used, and were forbidden to be adulterated. The ancient condition
                    of the manufactories of the Netherlands is peculiarly interesting, because it is
                    to them that we and the rest of Europe are indebted for the first rudiments of
                    those arts which have since been so widely extended in England, Scotland,
                    France, Germany, and Holland. In the time of Charlemagne, it appears from the
                    same collection, and from the <hi rend="italic">Historia Monasterii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sαlrnu~ ricnsis,</hi> that iron wares, gold and silver work,
                    embroidery, arms, horse furniture, and various other articles, were extensively
                    manufactured. The earliest Flemish fabrics were those of linen; and, as early as
                    the year 960, free marts were established in several of the cities, to which
                    great numbers of merchants from foreign countries periodically resorted. The
                    present state of the linen manufactory is by no means flourishing; but large
                    quantities of the finer kinds, made from flax of their native growth, are
                    supplied by the inhabitants of this kingdom, and are everywhere highly esteemed.
                    The finest yarn and the best bleacheries are at Haarlem; the best linen is woven
                    at Herzogenbasch, Eindoven, and some other places; but some fine linen, spun in
                    Westphalia, is mixed with that of those places, and when bleached in Holland is
                    not distinguishable from it. The curious manufactory of thread lace originated
                    in this country, and still distinguishes it. The best is that of Brussels and
                    Mechlin. In the former city and its vicinity it once gave employment to more
                    than 14,000 persons; and at one period the exports of goods fabricated in
                    Flanders, from the flax of their own growth, amounted to more than L.2,000,000
                    sterling. The woollen manufactories of Flanders were in a flourishing state as
                    early as the year 980, but were most extensive from the twelfth to the sixteenth
                    century. In the city of Louvain, in the year 1317, there were four thousand
                    looms for weaving woollens. Brussels and Antwerp employed an equal <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558737" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8737-0144"/> number. Ghent
                    was, however, the most distinguished city for its fabrics, both of wool and
                    flax, and at that period employed 40,000 looms. When called upon to take arms,
                    the weavers, under the banners of their trade, mustered 16,000 men. Ypres
                    contained 4000 looms. Bruges was the storehouse and central point for the
                    commerce of the half of Europe; but in 1478 the situation was changed for that
                    of Antwerp, which continued to be one of the most flourishing cities of the
                    world till the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the tyranny and
                    fanaticism of Philip II. of Spain inflicted on the Flemish provinces the
                    greatest sufferings.</p>
                <p>A variety of circumstances have operated upon the manufacturing branches of
                    industry in Belgium, and rendered them exceedingly fluctuating. The great extent
                    of the cotton fabrics has diminished the consumption of linen goods, and been
                    extensively felt in Belgium. In consequence of this, much capital was invested
                    in machinery for making cotton goods, especially at Ghent; and the access to the
                    settlements of Holland in the East and West Indies gave a degree of energy to
                    the employment which the separation of the two countries has damped, if not
                    quite destroyed. The home consumption, however, is very great, owing to the
                    density of the population, and the general state of easy, if not affluent
                    circumstances, in which the great economy of the people places them. In Ghent,
                    Brussels, and some other spots, cotton goods are made. Verviers and the towns
                    near it are celebrated for their excellent cloth; and in all the towns and
                    villages, the making of linen and lace is a kind of domestic employment. There
                    are refineries for sugar in Antwerp, Ostend, and Brussels. The produce of the
                    mines of coal and iron in the provinces of Liège, Namur, Hainault, and
                    Luxembourg, have laid the foundation of hardware manufactories to a great extent
                    in the city of Liège, and on the banks of the Meuse. The chief evil which has
                    been produced by the separation from Holland is experienced in the mining
                    provinces. In consequence of this event, the whole of Holland now obtains its
                    supply of the important article of coal from England, and of iron from our
                    country, or from Russia and Sweden.</p>
                <p>Belgium is well situated for foreign trade. The whole of its coasts are indeed
                    rendered dangerous from sand-banks; but the channels between them and the shore
                    are well buoyed and lighted, and there is a vast number of excellent pilots at
                    all the various stations. The three ports are Ostend, Nieuport, and Antwerp. The
                    first two are tideharbours, but the latter is situated upon the Scheldt, and is
                    accessible to the largest class of vessels in any state of the tide. It has also
                    the advantage of capacious docks and storehouses, and is thereby admirably
                    adapted to become a depot for an extensive commerce with the south of Germany,
                    and with Switzerland. As the Dutch possess the shore on both sides of the
                    entrance of the Scheldt, this has proved a discouragement to the trade of
                    Antwerp, though a temporary agreement has been made; and some impediments have
                    been thrown in the way of the intercourse between Belgium and Germany by the
                    financial confederation formed by Prussia. From these circumstances, some of the
                    most considerable houses who were ship-owners have removed their establishments,
                    including their vessels, from Antwerp, to Rotterdam and others of the ports of
                    Holland. The Belgians have, however, been actively awake to the events of the
                    period, and are making efforts to open new and favourable communications between
                    Antwerp and the Rhine. A projected line of railroad has been completed as far as
                    Brussels, a distance of thirty miles, and will be continued till it reaches the
                    Rhine. These roads, in addition to the numerous canals and rivers which
                    facilitate internal intercourse, are considered as likely to be productive of
                    great commercial advantages.</p>
                <p>The religious establishment of Belgium is strictly that of the Roman Catholic
                    church; but its endowments are much curtailed by the long subjection to France.
                    The whole of the inhabitants adhere to that communion, with the exception of
                    12,500 Protestants, mostly foreigners, and 1050 Jews. These are allowed to
                    celebrate publicly their several modes of worship. There are two universities,
                    one at Liège with about 500 students, and another at Ghent with about 400; and
                    several seminaries for clerical education. The system of popular education is in
                    a state of revision; but the schools will probably be placed under the exclusive
                    superintendence of the clergy, as the classical schools have already been.</p>
                <p>The circumstances in which the kingdom is still placed as regards the disputes
                    respecting Luxembourg seem to render a large army necessary. At present the
                    forces on foot consist of 59,000 troops of the line, and a reserve of 58,000;
                    but reductions are in contemplation.</p>
                <p>The sole executive government is vested in the king, and the ministers are
                    responsible. The legislative power is lodged in two houses; the senate
                    consisting at present of forty-two members, and the chamber of representatives
                    consisting of eighty-five, no legislators being as yet sent from Limburg or
                    Luxembourg, on account of the uncertainty which exists as to their ultimate
                    fate.</p>
                <p>Until the adjustment respecting the debt between Belgium and Holland is
                    completed, it is not easy to state the exact condition of the financial affairs.
                    The revenue is on the increase, but not quite adequate to the expenses of each
                    year. The national debt, when compared with the aggregate wealth of the country,
                    is much lighter than in any other state in Europe; and, with the economy that
                    has been adopted in every branch, a solid peace must in a short period produce
                    general prosperity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.)</hi></p>
