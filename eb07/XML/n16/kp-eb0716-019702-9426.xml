                <p><label type="entry">NEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michel</hi></label>, a marshal of
                    the French empire, and one of the distinguished generals produced by the French
                    Revolution, was born at Sarrelouis, on the 17th of January 1769. His father had
                    been a soldier, but, after the Seven Years’ War, had retired to his native
                    village, where he exercised the humble trade of a cooper. Young Ney received his
                    education at a school kept by the monks of St Augustin, under whom he appears to
                    have made considerable progress in his studies; but being fired with military
                    ardour by the recitals of his father, he early enlisted into a regiment of
                    hussars <hi rend="italic">(pégiment du colonel-generaΓ),</hi> where he served
                    for some time, and was a subaltern at the commencement of the Revolution. He
                    then attained the rank of captain, in which capacity he made his first
                    campaigns, acting as aide-de-camp to General de Lamarche, and afterwards as
                    adjutant-general under the orders of Kleber. This latter employment afforded him
                    several opportunities of distinguishing himself; and, in the official reports of
                    the time, honourable mention is made of him at the passage of the Lahn in 1795,
                    and also at the combats of Altenkirchen, Montabaur, and Wurtzburg. On the 8th of
                    August 1796, he took Pfortzheim, and was promoted to the rank of
                    brigadier-general. In the campaign of 1797, he was again successful; but his
                    horse having been killed at the combat of Steimberg, he fell into the hands of
                    the enemy. Hoche, who admired his undaunted courage, earnestly solicited his
                    exchange, and, as soon as he had obtained it, appointed him general of division.
                    It was in this capacity that, in 1798, Ney commanded the cavalry of the army
                    which, under the orders of Schaumbourg, executed the invasion of Switzerland. On
                    this occasion he acted towards the inhabitants with as much generosity as
                    circumstances would permit; and, the following year, he acquired a great
                    reputation under Massena, particularly at the battle of Zurich. In the year 1800
                    he served with the army of Moreau, and greatly distinguished himself both at
                    Moeskirch and at Hohenlinden. After the peace of Luneville, when Bonaparte
                    wished to effect the entire subjugation of Switzerland, Ney was sent into that
                    country with the title of minister plenipotentiary, and there conducted himself
                    in a manner to deserve more and more the favour of his master. In 1804 he
                    obtained the baton of marshal of the empire; and it was in this capacity that,
                    in 1805, he gained, in Suabia, the victory which procured him the title of Duke
                    of Elchingen. After the capitulation of Ulm, being ordered to occupy the Tyrol,
                    he entered Innspruck on the 7th of November, at the head of the sixth corps of
                    the grand army, which he also commanded the following year, in the contest with
                    Prussia. Having contributed essentially to the victory of Jena, he appeared
                    before Magdeburg, and, by a prodigy which still remains inexplicable, he, in
                    less than twenty-four hours, received the capitulation of that redoubtable
                    fortress, defended by a numerous garrison. In the beginning of 1807, he obtained
                    a signal success before Thorn, where the whole Russian army had advanced to
                    attack him, hoping to surprise him in his winter quarters; and, at a later
                    period, he carried the town of Friedland at the battle of that name, which
                    terminated the war in the north of Europe. But the war in which Napoleon found
                    himself involved, if extinguished at one point, was assiduously kept alive at
                    others. Scarcely had he concluded a peace with the Russians at Tilsit, when he
                    hurried away to attack the Spaniards; and Marshal Ney, with his corps d’armée,
                    was transported from the banks of the Niémen to those of the Ebro and the Tagus.
                    The marshal, finding himself obliged to carry on a war of posts and of chicane
                    in Galicia, lost a great number of men in this inglorious service, and with
                    difficulty maintained his ground till the moment when he received orders to
                    unite his corps with that of Massena, who had been sent in order to expel the
                    English from Portugal. But this was found to be impracticable. It was judged
                    that the lines of Torres Vedras could not be attacked with any prospect of
                    success; and when Massena found himself constrained to retire before the Duke of
                    Wellington, Ney commanded his rearguard, and, in that difficult retreat,
                    displayed equal talent and courage. In 1812, he was recalled by Napoleon to
                    assist in the approaching invasion of Russia, for which an army of more than
                    four hundred thousand men had been assembled on the Vistula. At the terrible
                    battle of Mojaisk or Borodino, Ney commanded the centre; and it was on this
                    occasion, amidst the carnage of a conflict unequalled in modern times, that he
                    earned the title of Prince of Moskwa. Nor did he display less valour and
                    firmness in the disastrous retreat from Moscow, in which his corps almost
                    entirely perished. Napoleon, who commonly called him the bravest of the brave,
                    then designated him, in one of the bulletins of the army, as having a soul
                    tempered with steel. In 1813, Ney participated in the indecisive victories of
                    Lutzen and Bautzen; but he had the misfortune to lose the battle of Dennevitz,
                    where he was defeated by Bernadotte and Bulow, with the loss of ten thousand
                    prisoners and eighty pieces of cannon. This event made a deep impression upon
                    his mind. Napoleon testified the most marked displeasure; and Ney, dissembling
                    his chagrin, returned to Paris in a sort of disgrace. Nevertheless, he was again
                    employed in the beautiful but <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559439"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9439-0198"/>unfortunate winter campaign of 1814; and he was at
                    Fontainebleau when Napoleon was compelled to abdicate. Ney contributed
                    materially to bring about this event, and he was one of the first generals who
                    submitted to the Bourbons. Having presented himself before Monsieur on the 12th
                    of April, he said to that prince, “Your royal highness will see with what
                    fidelity we can serve our legitimate king.” He also went to pay his respects to
                    the king at Compiègne, and was there most favourably received. Louis XVIII.
                    himself received his oath as a chevalier of the order of Saint-Louis, confirmed
                    to him all his titles and pensions, and created him a peer of France. Marshal
                    Ney was living at his estate of the Coudreaux when Napoleon, having escaped from
                    the island of Elba, landed on the coast of France in February 1815; and he there
                    received orders from the minister of war to repair to his government of
                    Besançon. He immediately proceeded to Paris, and presenting himself before the
                    king, made great protestations of devotion, and, kissing the hand of Louis,
                    declared to him that he would bring back the disturber of Europe in an iron
                    cage. He then set out for the eastern frontier, assembled some regiments at
                    Besançon, and placing himself at their head, proceeded towards Lyons. At
                    Lons-le-Saulnier, however, he learned that Napoleon had already entered Lyons;
                    and from this time great agitation manifested itself amongst the troops.
                    Nevertheless, the marshal himself still appeared faithful to the king, and even
                    exerted himself to calm the excitement which prevailed amongst the troops; but
                    in the night between the !3th and 14th of March, an emissary sent by General
                    Bertrand brought him proclamations and letters from Napoleon, who made him
                    brilliant promises, and styled him, as formerly, the bravest of the brave. The
                    marshal could not resist the seductions of his old master, and next day he read
                    to the troops his famous proclamation, beginning with these words: “The cause of
                    the Bourbons is for ever lost. It is the Emperor Napoleon, our sovereign, who is
                    alone entitled to reign.” His whole conduct during the hundred days was a
                    consequence of this step. Napoleon sent him as extraordinary commissioner to
                    survey the frontiers of the North, and also appointed him a member of his
                    chamber of peers. In the short but decisive campaign of Waterloo, he displayed
                    none of the military qualities for which he had been distinguished, except
                    courage. At Quatre-Bras he acted with unaccountable hesitation, paralysing a
                    force sufficient to turn the scale on either side, but which, in reality,
                    effected nothing of the least importance. After the defeat of the French army at
                    Mont St Jean, he returned to the capital, and in the chamber of peers gave a
                    most alarming picture of the disaster which had befallen it. When Paris
                    capitulated, Ney, having no hopes of finding favour with the Bourbons, took
                    refuge in Auvergne, where he was arrested in consequence of the ordonnance of
                    the 24th of July, in which he was described as one of the authors of the
                    revolution of the 20th March. Being conducted to Paris, he was confined in the
                    Conciergerie, subjected to several interrogatories, and at length brought before
                    a court-martial, composed of marshals of France and lieutenant-generals, to
                    whose competency he objected. His counsel insisted much upon this point, in
                    which they were ultimately successful; the members of the court being glad to
                    escape from an embarrassing position, by pronouncing their own incompetence to
                    try the prisoner. By an ordonnance of the king, Ney was then brought before the
                    court of the peers, whose competency was not disputed. But his counsel
                    remonstrated warmly against the expressions employed by the ministers, who had
                    declared that it was “in the name of Europe” that they demanded his trial; and
                    the same learned persons appealed with much force and eloquence to the
                    conditions of the capitulation of Paris, which guaranteed to all who were within
                    the walls of the capital that they should neither be disturbed nor sought after
                    on account of their political conduct. All their efforts to save their client
                    were, however, unavailing. After fifteen sittings, Marshal Ney was condemned to
                    death, on the 6th of December 1815, by a majority of 160 to 119; and the
                    following day the sentence was carried into execution. Having received all the
                    consolations of religion from the curate of Saint-Sulpice, he was shot by a
                    platoon of veterans, near the palace of the Luxembourg, where he had been
                    condemned, and displayed in his last moments the same heroic courage which had
                    so often distinguished him in the field of battle. His body was given to his
                    friends, and conveyed to the cemetery of Père la Chaise, where his tomb may now
                    be seen. Marshal Ney and Colonel Labédoyère were the only victims of a
                    revolution where it is evident that neither played the principal part, and that
                    both were led away by the force of circumstances, and the spell which Napoleon
                    exercised over the minds of the officers as well as the common soldiers of the
                    army. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
