                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">An</hi> insular empire, like that of the united kingdom of
                    Great Britain and Ireland, which is so much indebted, and always must be, for
                    that power, prosperity, and renown which she enjoys, to the glorious deeds of
                    her navy, cannot but take a peculiar degree of interest in every thing that
                    concerns it. This vast machine, indeed, has at all times been the pride and
                    boast of Great Britain, the terror of its enemies, and the admiration of the
                    world. It is under the impression of its vast importance that we have been
                    induced to give, under their proper heads, such details of the civil and
                    military branches of the naval departments as may afford, without entering into
                    too minute details, a comprehensive sketch of this great national bulwark, of
                    which it is now proposed to take a general view.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy</hi> is generally intended to express all
                    ships of commerce as well as those of war, the mercantile as well as the
                    military marine; but the observations contained in the present article are meant
                    to relate only to the latter, excepting that, in speaking of the progressive
                    enlargement of ships, and improvements in naval architecture, the remarks may
                    sometimes equally apply to ships of commerce and of war.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">NAVY Composed of MATERIEL and PERS02ĪEL.</hi></p>
                <p>The composition of a navy may be considered under the two distinct heads into
                    which it naturally divides itself, and under which the French generally
                    distinguish an army, the <hi rend="italic">materiel,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">personel</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former embracing every
                    thing that appertains to the ships, their capacity, construction, armament, and
                    equipment; the latter all that concerns the rank, the appointment, the various
                    duties, &amp;c. of the officers, seamen, and marines.</p>
                <p>I. MATERIEL OF THE NAVY.</p>
                <p>It would occupy too large a space to give even a short sketch of the origin and
                    the progress of naval architecture, from a bundle of branches, or the hollow
                    trunk of a tree— the rude raft and the frail canoe—to the more perfect coracle,
                    or the wicker-boats of the ancient Britons, covered with hides. For many
                    centuries after the expulsion of the Romans from, or their abandonment of, the
                    British Islands, very little progress appears to have been made by us in the art
                    of navigation or ship building: the natives would appear, for many centuries
                    afterwards, to have acted merely on the defensive against naval invasions.</p>
                <p>“The whole of our naval history,” say the commissioners for revising the civil
                    affairs of the navy, “may be divided into three periods; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> comprehending all that preceded the reign of Henry VIII.; the <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> ending with the restoration of Charles II.; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">third</hi> coming down from the Restoration to the present
                    day.”</p>
                <p>To what size, and to what extent, the amount of the English ships or vessels were
                    carried, which supported so many contests with the invading Danes in the ninth
                    century, our naval history has not preserved any record. We are told, however,
                    that Alfred increased the size of his galleys, and that some of them were
                    capable of rowing thirty pair of oars. These galleys were chiefly employed in
                    clearing the Channel of the nests of pirates by which it was infested. It is
                    also said, as a proof of his attention to naval matters, that, under his
                    auspices, one Ochter undertook a voyage into the arctic regions, made a survey
                    of the coasts of Lapland and Norway, and brought to Alfred an account of the
                    mode pursued by the inhabitants of those countries to catch whales. It is,
                    moreover, on record, that his two sons, Edward and Athelstan, fought many bloody
                    actions with the Danes, in which several kings and chiefs were slain; and that
                    Edgar had from three to five thousand ships, divided into three fleets,
                    stationed on three several parts of the coast, with which, passing from one
                    fleet or squadron to the other, he circumnavigated the island; that after this
                    he called himself “Monarch of all Albion, and Sovereign over all the adjacent
                    Isles.” Some notion, however, may be formed of the size of the vessels which
                    composed his fleets, from the imposition of a land-tax, which required certain
                    proprietors to furnish a stout galley of three rows of oars, to protect the
                    coast from the Danish pirates. The more effectually to check these marauders,
                    and protect the coasts of the kingdom, William the Conqueror, in 1066,
                    established the Cinque Ports, and gave them certain privileges, on condition of
                    their furnishing fifty-two ships, with twenty-four men in each, for fifteen
                    days, in cases of emergency. We should not, perhaps, be far amiss in dating the
                    period of our naval architecture from the Conquest. “The Normans,” says Sir
                    Walter Raleigh, “grew better shipwrights than either the Danes or Saxons, and
                    made the last conquest of this land; a land which can never be conquered whilst
                    the kings thereof keep the dominion of the seas.” But Raleigh does not describe
                    what the ships were which the Normans taught us to build; nor can it now be
                    known in what kind of vessels William transported his army across the Channel,
                    or what was the description of the hundred large ships and fifty galleys of
                    which the naval armament of Richard I. consisted on his expedition to the Holy
                    Land. We are told, however, that having increased his fleet at Cyprus to two
                    hundred and fifty ships and sixty galleys, he fell in with a ship belonging to
                    the Saracens, of such an extraordinary size that she was defended by 1500 men,
                    all of whom, with the exception of 200, Richard, after taking possession of her,
                    ordered to be thrown overboard and drowned.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the nations of the Mediterranean, particularly the
                    Genoese and Venetians, introduced many improvements as to the capacity and
                    stability of their ships, in consequence of the crusades, and the demands for
                    warlike stores and provisions which such vast and ill-provided armies
                    necessarily created; but these improvements would seem not to have reached, or,
                    at least, to have made but a tardy progress in, Great Britain. King John, it is
                    true, stoutly claimed for England the sovereignty of the sea, and decreed that
                    all ships belonging to foreign nations, the masters of which should refuse to
                    strike to the British flag, should be seized and deemed good and lawful prize.
                    And this monarch is said to have fitted out no less than five hundred sail of
                    ships, under the Earl of Salisbury, in the year 1213, against a fleet of three
                    times that number, prepared by Philip of France for the invasion of England; of
                    which the English took three hundred sail, and drove a hundred on shore, Philip
                    being under the necessity of destroying the remainder, to prevent their falling
                    also into the hands of the English. Of the kinds of ships of which his fleet
                    consisted, some notion may be formed by the account that is related of an action
                    fought in the following reign with the French, who, with “eighty stout ships,”
                    threatened the coast of Kent. This fleet being discovered by Hubert de Burgh,
                    governor of Dover Castle, he put to sea with forty English ships, and having got
                    to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557372" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7372-0039"/>the
                    windward of the enemy, and run down many of the smaller ships, he closed with
                    the rest, and threw on board them a quantity of quicklime, which blinded them so
                    effectually that all their ships were either taken or sunk.</p>
                <p>Whatever the size and the armaments of our ships were, the empire of the sea was
                    bravely maintained by the Edwards and the Henrys in many a gallant and glorious
                    sea-fight with the fleets of France, against which they were generally opposed
                    with inferior numbers. The temper of the times, and the public feeling, were
                    strongly exemplified in the reign of Edward I. by the following circumstance: An
                    English sailor was killed in a Norman port, in consequence of which a war
                    commenced, and the two nations agreed to decide the dispute on a certain day,
                    with the whole of their respective naval forces. The spot of battle was to be
                    the middle of the Channel, marked out by anchoring there an empty ship. The two
                    fleets met on the 14th April 1293; the English obtained the victory, and carried
                    off above two hundred and fifty sail.</p>
                <p>In an action with the French fleet off the harbour of Sluys, Edward III. is said
                    to have slain 30,000 of the enemy, and to have taken two hundred great ships,
                    “in one of which only, there were four hundred dead bodies.” This is no doubt an
                    exaggeration. The same monarch, at the siege of Calais, is stated to have
                    blockaded that port with seven hundred and thirty sail, having on board 14,956
                    mariners; twenty-five only of which were of the royal navy, bearing four hundred
                    and nineteen mariners, or about seventeen men each. In various other sea actions
                    did this great sovereign nobly support the honour of the British flag. But
                    though we then, and ever after, claimed the “dominion of the seas,” that
                    dominion, says Raleigh, “was never absolute until the time of Henry the Eighth.”
                    It was a maxim of this great statesman, that “whosoever commands the sea,
                    commands the trade of the world; whosoever commands the trade, commands the
                    riches of the world, and consequently the world itself.”</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry V., however, was most glorious in maintaining the naval
                    superiority over the fleets of France. From a letter of this sovereign to his
                    lord chancellor, dated 12th August 1417, discovered by the late Mr Lysons among
                    the records in the Tower, and of which the following is a copy, it would appear
                    that there was something like an established royal navy in his reign,
                    independently of the shipping furnished by the Cinque Ports and the merchants,
                    for the king’s own use, on occasion of any particular expedition. The letter
                    appears to have been written nine days after the surrender of the castle of
                    Touque in Normandy, from whence it is dated.</p>

                <p>The remainder, to the masters of which pensions were thus granted, consist of
                    seventeen “niefs, barges, and ballyn-gers,” some with three, and others two
                    mariners only. But history informs us, that about this time Henry embarked an
                    army of 25,000 men at Dover on board of 1500 sail of ships, two of which carried
                    purple sails, embroidered with the arms of England and France; one styled the
                    King’s Chamber, the other his Saloon, as typical of his keeping his court at
                    sea, which he considered as a part of his dominions. Still we are left in the
                    dark as to the real dimensions of his ships, and the nature of their armament;
                    they were probably used only as transports for his army. It would appear,
                    however, from a very curious poem, written in the early part of the reign of
                    King Henry VI. that the navy of his predecessor was considerable, but that, by
                    neglect, it was then reduced to the same state in which it had been during the
                    preceding reigns. The poem here alluded to is entitled “The English Policie,
                    exhorting all England to keep the Sea, and namely the Narrow Sea; showing what
                    profit cometh thereof, and also what worship and salvation to England and to all
                    Englishmen and is printed in the first volume of Hackluyt’s Collection of
                    Voyages. It was evidently written before the year 1438, when the Emperor
                    Sigismond died, as appears by the following passage in the prologue:</p>
                <p>For Sigismond, the great Emperour, <hi rend="italic">Which yet reigneth,</hi>
                    when he was in this land, With King Henry the Fifth, Prince of Honour, Here much
                    glory, as him thought, he found <hi rend="italic">Α mightie land,</hi> which had
                    take in hand To werre with France, and make mortalitie, <hi rend="italic">And
                    ever well kept round about the sea.</hi></p>
                <p>The part of the poem which alludes to the navy of King Henry V. is entitled
                    “Another incident of keeping the Sea, in the time of marvellous werriour and
                    victorious Prince, King Henrie the Fifth, and of his great Shippes.”</p>
                <p>The following are the most remarkable passages:</p>
                <p>And if I should conclude all by the King Henrie the Fift, what was his purposing,
                    Whan at Hampton he made the great <hi rend="italic">dromons,</hi> Which passed

                <p>What hope ye was the Kings great intent of thoo shippes, and what in mind he
                    meant: It was not ellis, but that <hi rend="italic">he cast to bee</hi> Horde
                    round about environ of the see. And if he had to this time lived here, He had
                    been Prince named withouten pere: <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557385"

                    see to move and sterre.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the time when this poem must have been written, it appears from the
                    parliament roll (20th Henry VI. 1442), that an armed naval force, consisting
                    only of eight large ships, with smaller vessels to attend them, was to be
                    collected from the ports of London, Bristol, Dartmouth, Hull, Newcastle,
                    Winchelsea, Plymouth, Falmouth, &amp;c.; and, of course, the royal ships of
                    1417, the names of which are contained in the foregoing schedule, were then
                    either gone to decay or dispersed. We are not to judge of the size of these
                    ships from the few mariners appointed to each. These were merely the
                    ship-keepers, or harbour-duty men, placed on permanent pay, to keep the ships in
                    a condition fit for the sea when wanted.</p>
                <p>It is very probable that, until our merchants engaged in the Mediterranean trade,
                    and that the attention of the government was turned, in the reign of Henry VII.
                    (about 1496), to imitate Portugal in making foreign discovery, under the skilful
                    seaman Sebastian Cabot, very little was added to the capacity or the power of
                    British ships of war. It is said, however, that on the accession of Henry VII.
                    to the throne in 1485, he caused his marine, which had been neglected in the
                    preceding reign, to be put into a condition to protect the coasts against all
                    foreign invasions; and that, in the midst of profound peace, he always kept up a
                    fleet ready to act. In his reign was built a ship called the Great Harry, the
                    first on record that deserved the name of a ship of war, if it was not the first
                    exclusively appropriated to the service of the state. This is the same ship
                    which Camden has miscalled the Henry Grace de Dieu, and which was not built till
                    twenty years afterwards, under the reign of Henry VIII. The Great Harry is
                    stated to have cost L.14,000, and was burned by accident at Woolwich in the year
                    1553.</p>
                <p>We now come to that period of our naval history in which England might be truly
                    said to possess a military marine, and of which some curious details have been
                    left us by that extraordinary man of business Mr Pepys, a commissioner of the
                    navy, and afterwards secretary to Charles II., at a time when the king executed
                    in person the office of lord high admiral, and also to James II. until his
                    abdication. His minutes and miscellanies relative to the navy are contained in a
                    great number of manuscript volumes, which are deposited in the Pepysian Library
                    in Magdalene College, Cambridge. From these papers it appears, that in the
                    thirteenth year of Henry VIII. the following were the names and the tonnage of
                    the royal navy:</p>

                <p>Add to these two row-barges of sixty tons each, making, in the whole, sixteen
                    ships and vessels, measuring 7260 tons.</p>
                <p>The Henry Grace de Dieu is stated in all other accounts, and with more
                    probability, to have been only 1000 tons; the rule for ascertaining the
                    measurement of ships being still vague, and liable to great error, was probably
                    much more so at this early period. This ship was built in 1515, at Erith, in the
                    river Thames, to replace the Regent, of the same tonnage, which was burned in
                    August 1512, in action with the French fleet, when carrying the flag of the lord
                    high admiral. There is a drawing in the Pepysian papers of the Henry Grace de
                    Dieu, from which a print in the Archaeologia has been engraved, and of which a
                    copy has been taken as a frontispiece to Mr Derrick’s Memoirs of the Rise and
                    Progress of the Royal Navy. From these papers it appears that she carried
                    fourteen guns on the lower deck, twelve on the main deck, eighteen on the
                    quarter-deck and poop, eighteen on the lofty forecastle, and ten in her
                    sternports, making altogether seventy-two guns. Her regular establishment of men
                    is said to have consisted of 349 soldiers, 301 mariners, and fifty gunners,
                    making altogether 700 men. Some idea may be formed of the awkwardness in
                    manoeuvring ships built on her construction, or similar to her, when it is
                    stated that, on the appearance of the French fleet at St Helens, the Great
                    Harry, built in the former reign, and the first ship built with two decks, had
                    nearly been sunk; and that the Mary Rose, of 600 tons, with 500 or 600 men on
                    board, was actually sunk at Spithead, occasioned, as Raleigh informs us, “by a
                    little sway in casting the ship about, her ports being within sixteen inches of
                    the water.” On this occasion the fleets cannonaded each other for two hours; and
                    it is remarked as something extraordinary, that not less than three hundred
                    cannon-shot were fired on both sides in the course of this action. From the
                    prints above mentioned, which agree very closely with the curious painting of
                    Henry crossing the Channel in his fleet to meet Francis on the Champ de Drap
                    d’Or, near Calais, and now in the great room where the Society of Antiquaries
                    hold their meetings in Somerset House, it is quite surprising how they could be
                    trusted on the sea at all, their enormous poops and forecastles making them
                    appear loftier and more awkward than the large Chinese junks, to which, indeed,
                    they bear a strong resemblance. It is worth remarking, that, two years ago, the
                    position of the Mary Rose, near Spithead, was pointed out to that extraordinary
                    diver Mr Deane, who went down several times, and brought up some beautiful
                    pieces of brass ordnance, as perfect and as fine specimens as any we have at the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>Henry VIII. may justly be said to have laid the foundation of the British navy.
                    He established the dock-yards at Deptford, Woolwich, and Portsmouth; he
                    appointed certain commissioners to superintend the civil affairs of the navy,
                    and settled the rank and pay of admirals, vice-admirals, and inferior officers;
                    thus creating a national navy, and raising the officers to a separate and
                    distinct profession. The great officers of the navy then were, the vice-admiral
                    of England, the master of the ordnance, the surveyor of the marine causes, the
                    treasurer, comptroller, general surveyor of the victualling, clerk of the ships,
                    and clerk of the stores. Each of these officers had their particular duties, but
                    they met together at their office on Tower Hill once a week, to consult, and
                    make their reports to the lord high admiral. He also established the fraternity
                    of the Trinity House, for the improvement of navigation and the encouragement of
                    commerce; and built the castles of Deal, Walmer, Sandgate, Hurst Castle, &amp;c.
                    for the protection of his fleet and of the coast.</p>
                <p>At the death of Henry VIII. in 1547, the royal navy consisted of about fifty
                    ships and vessels of different sizes, the former from 1000 to 150 tons, and the
                    latter down to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557398" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7398-0041"
                    />twenty tons, making in the whole about 12,000 tons, and manned by about 8000
                    mariners, soldiers, gunners, &amp;c. In the short reign of his son Edward,
                    little alteration seems to have taken place in the state and condition of the
                    royal navy. But the regulations which had been made in the reign of his father,
                    for the civil government of naval affairs, were revised, arranged, and turned
                    into ordinances, which form the basis of all the subsequent instructions given
                    to the commissioners for the management of the civil affairs of the navy. In the
                    reign of Mary the tonnage of the navy was reduced to about 7000 tons; but her
                    lord high admiral nobly maintained the title assumed by England of Sovereign of
                    the Seas, by compelling Philip of Spain to strike his flag that was flying at
                    the main-top-mast head, though on his way to England to marry Queen Mary, by
                    firing a shot at the Spanish admiral. He also demanded that his whole fleet,
                    consisting of 160 sail, should strike their colours and lower their top-sails,
                    as an homage to the English flag, before he would permit his squadron to salute
                    the Spanish monarch.</p>
                <p>The reign of Elizabeth was the proudest period of our naval history, perhaps
                    surpassed by none previously to the Revolution. She not only increased the
                    numerical force of the regular navy, but established many wise regulations for
                    its preservation, and for securing adequate supplies of timber and other naval
                    stores. She placed her naval officers on a more respectable footing, and
                    encouraged foreign trade and geographical discoveries, so that she acquired
                    justly the title of the Restorer of Naval Power, and Sovereign of the Northern
                    Seas. The greatest naval force that had at any previous period been called
                    together was that which was assembled to oppose the Invincible Armada, and
                    which, according to the notes of Mr Secretary Pepys, consisted of 176 ships,
                    with 14,992 men; but these were not all “Shippes Royall,” but were partly
                    composed of the contributions of the Cinque Ports and others. The number
                    actually belonging to the navy is variously stated, but they would appear to
                    have been somewhere about forty sail of ships, manned with about 6000 men. At
                    the end of her reign, however, the navy had greatly increased, the list in 1603
                    consisting of forty-two ships of various descriptions, amounting to 17,000 tons,
                    and manned with 8346 men. Of these, two were of the burden of 1000 tons each,
                    three of 900 tons, and ten from 600 to 800 tons.</p>
                <p>James I. was not inattentive to his navy. He warmly patronised Mr Phineas Pett,
                    the most able and scientific shipwright that this country ever boasted, .and to
                    whom we undoubtedly owe the first essential improvements in the form and
                    construction of ships. The cumbrous top-works were first got rid of under his
                    superintendence. “In my owne time,” says Raleigh, “the shape of our English
                    ships hath been greatly bettered; in extremity we carry our ordnance better than
                    we were wont; we have added crosse pillars in our royall shippes, to strengthen
                    them; we have given longer floors to our shippes than in older times,” &amp;c.
                    The young Prince Henry was so fond of naval affairs, that Phineas Pett was
                    ordered by the lord high admiral to build a vessel at Chatham in 1604, with all
                    possible speed, for the young Prince Henry to disport himself in, above London
                    Bridge; the length of her keel was twenty-eight feet, and her breadth twelve
                    feet. In 1610 Pett laid down the largest ship that had hitherto been built. She
                    was named the Prince Royal; her burden was 1400 tons, her keel 114 feet, and she
                    was armed with sixty-four pieces of great ordnance, “being in all respects,”
                    says Stowe, “the greatest and goodliest ship that was ever built in England.” He
                    adds, “the great workmaster in building this ship was Mr Phineas Pett,
                    gentleman, some time master of arts, of Emanuel College, in Cambridge.”</p>
                <p>This excellent man, as appears from a manuscript account of his life in the
                    British Museum, written by himself, was regarded by the shipwrights of the
                    dock-yards, who had no science themselves, with an eye of jealousy; and a
                    complaint was laid against him before the king, of ignorance in laying off a
                    ship, and of a wasteful expenditure of timber and other matters. The king
                    attended at Woolwich with his court, to inquire in person into the charges
                    brought forward, and, after a painful investigation, pronounced in favour of Mr
                    Pett. One of the charges was, that he had caused the wood to be cut across the
                    grain; but the king observed, that, as it appeared to him, “it was not the wood,
                    but those who had preferred the charges, that were cross-grained.” «.</p>
                <p>The state of the navy at the king’s death is variously given by different
                    writers; but on this subject the memoranda left by Mr Secretary Pepys arc most
                    likely to be correct. From them it appears that, in 1618, certain commissioners
                    were appointed to examine into the state of the navy, and by their report it
                    appears there were then only thirty-nine ships and vessels, whose tonnage
                    amounted to 14,700 tons; but in 1624, on the same authority, the numbers had
                    decreased to thirty-two or thirty-three shipsand vessels, but the tonnage
                    increased to about 19,400 tons. The commissioners had, in fact, recommended many
                    of the small craft to be broken up or sold, and more ships of the higher rates
                    to be kept up.</p>
                <p>The navy was not neglected in the troublesome reign of Charles I. This
                    unfortunate monarch added upwards of twenty sail to the list, generally of the
                    smaller kind; but one of them, built by Pett, was of a description, both as to
                    form and dimensions, far superior to any that had yet been launched. This ship
                    was the celebrated Sovereign of the Seas, which was launched at Woolwich in
                    1637. The length of her keel was 128 feet, the main breadth forty-eight feet,
                    and from stem to stern 232 feet. In the description of this ship by Thomas
                    Heywood, she is said to have “bore five lanthorns, the biggest of which would
                    hold ten persons upright; had three flush-decks, a forecastle, half-deck,
                    quarter-deck, and round-house. Her lower tier had thirty ports for cannon and
                    demi-cannon; middle tier, thirty for culverins and demi-culverins; third tier,
                    twenty-six for other ordnance; forecastle, twelve; and two half-decks, thirteen
                    or fourteen ports more within board, for murthering pieces; besides ten pieces
                    of chace ordnance forward, and ten right aft, and many loop-holes in the cabins
                    for musquet-shot. She had eleven anchors, one of 4400 pounds weight. She was of
                    the burden of 1637 tons.” It appears, however, that she was found, on trial, to
                    be too high for a good serviceable ship in all weathers, and was therefore cut
                    down to a deck less. After this she became an excellent ship, and was in almost
                    all the great actions with the Dutch; she was rebuilt in 1684, when the name was
                    changed to that of Royal Sovereign; and was about to be rebuilt a second time at
                    Chatham in 1696, when she accidentally took fire, and was totally consumed. In
                    this reign the ships of the navy were first classed, or divided into six rates,
                    the first being from 100 to sixty guns, the second from fifty-four to
                    thirty-six, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In 1642 the management of the navy was taken out of the king’s hands, and in 1648
                    Prince Rupert carried away twenty-five ships, none of which ever returned; and
                    such, indeed, was the reduced state of the navy, that at the beginning of
                    Cromwell’s usurped government, he had only fourteen ships of war of two decks,
                    and some of these carried only forty guns; but, under the careful management of
                    very able men, in different commissions which he appointed, such vigorous
                    measures were pursued, that, in five years, though engaged within that time in
                    war with the greatest naval power in Europe, the fleet was increased to 150
                    sail, of which more than a third part had two decks, and many of which were
                    captured from the Dutch, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557411"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7411-0042"/>upwards of 20,000 seamen were employed in the
                    navy. Our military marine was, indeed, raised by Cromwell to* a height which it
                    had never before reached; but from which it soon declined under the short and
                    feeble administration of his son.</p>
                <p>Though Cromwell found the navy divided into six rates or classes, it was under
                    his government that these ratings were defined and established in the manner
                    nearly in which they now are; and it may also be remarked, that, under his
                    government, the first frigate, called the Constant Warwick, was built in
                    England. “She was built,” says Mr Pepys, “in 1649, by Mr Peter Pett (son of
                    Phineas), for a privateer for the Earl of Warwick, and was sold by him to the
                    state. Mr Pett took his model of this ship from a French frigate which he had
                    seen in the Thames.”</p>
                <p>During the first period of our naval history, we know nothing of the nature of
                    the armament of the ships. From the time of Edward III. they might have been
                    armed with cannon, but no mention is made of this being the case. According to
                    Lord Herbert, brass ordnance were first cast in England in the year 1535. They
                    had various names, such as cannon, detni∙cannon, culverins, demi-culverins,
                    sakers, mynions, falcons, falconets, &amp;c. What the calibre of each of these
                    was is not accurately known, but the cannon is supposed to have been about
                    sixty-pounders, the demi-cannon thirty-two, the culverin eighteen, falcon two,
                    mynion four, saker five, &amp;c. Many of these pieces, of different calibres,
                    were mounted on the same deck, which must have occasioned great confusion in
                    action in finding for each its proper shot.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of Charles II. the Duke of York was immediately appointed lord
                    high admiral, and by his advice a committee was named to consider a plan,
                    proposed by himself, for the future regulation of the affairs of the navy, at
                    which the duke himself presided. By the advice and able assistance of Mr Pepys,
                    great progress was speedily made in the reparation and increase of the fleet.
                    The duke remained lord high admiral till 1673, when, in consequence of the test
                    required by parliament, to which he could not submit, he resigned, and that
                    office was in part put in commission, and the rest retained by the king. Prince
                    Rupert was put at the head of this commission, and Mr Pepys appointed secretary
                    to the king in all naval affairs, and of the admiralty; and by his able and
                    judicious management there were in sea-pay, in the year 1679, and in excellent
                    condition, seventy-six ships of the line, all furnished with stores for six
                    months, eight fireships, besides a numerous train of ketches, smacks, yachts,
                    &amp;c. with more than 12,000 seamen; and also thirty new ships building, and a
                    good supply of stores in the dockyards. But this flourishing condition of the
                    navy did not last long. In consequence of the dissipation of the king, and his
                    pecuniary difficulties, he neglected the navy on account of the expenses; the
                    duke was sent abroad, and Mr Pepys to the Tower. A new set of commissioners were
                    appointed, without experience, ability, or industry; and the consequence was, as
                    stated by the commissioners of revision, that “all the wise regulations formed
                    during the administration of the Duke of York were neglected; and such
                    supineness and waste appear to have prevailed, that, at the end of not more than
                    five years, when he was recalled to the office of lord high admiral, only
                    twenty-two ships, none larger than a fourth rate, with two fireships, were at
                    sea; those in harbour were quite unfit for service; even the thirty new ships
                    which he had left building had been suffered to fàll into a state of great
                    decay, and hardly any stores were found to remain in the dock-yards.”</p>
                <p>The first act on the duke’s return was the re-appointment of Mr Pepys as
                    secretary of the admiralty. Finding the present commissioners unequal to the
                    duties required of them, he recommended others. Sir Anthony Deane, the most
                    experienced of the shipbuilders then in England, was joined with the new
                    commissioners. To him, it has been said, we owe the first essential improvement
                    in the form and qualities of ships of the line, having taken the model of the
                    Superbe, a French ship of seventy-four guns, which anchored at Spithead, and
                    from which he built the Harwich in 1664. Others, however, are of opinion that no
                    improvement had at this time been made on the model of the Sovereign of the Seas
                    after she was cut down. The new commissioners undertook, in three years, to
                    complete the repair of the fleet, and furnish the dock-yards with a proper
                    supply of stores, on an estimate of L.400,000 a year, to be issued in weekly
                    payments; and in two years and a half they finished their task, to the
                    satisfaction of the king and the whole nation; the number of ships repaired and
                    under repair being 108 sail of the line, besides a considerable number of
                    vessels of smaller size. The same year the king abdicated the throne, at which
                    time the list of the navy amounted to 173 sail, containing 101,892 tons,
                    carrying 6930 guns, and 42,000 seamen.</p>
                <p>The naval regulations were wisely left unaltered at the Revolution, and the
                    business of the admiralty continued to be carried on chiefly, for some time,
                    under the immediate direction of King William, by Mr Pepys, till the arrival of
                    Admiral Herbert and Captain Russell from the fleet, into whose hands, he says,
                    “he silently let it fall.” Upon the general principles of that system, thus
                    established with his aid by the Duke of York, the civil government of our navy
                    has ever since been carried on.</p>
                <p>In the second year of King William (1690), no less than thirty ships were ordered
                    to be built, of sixty, seventy, and eighty guns each; and in 1697 the king, in
                    his speech to parliament, stated that the naval force of the kingdom was
                    increased to nearly double what he found it at his accession. It was now partly
                    composed of various classes of French ships which had been captured in the
                    course of the war, amounting in number to more than sixty, and in guns to 2300;
                    the losses by storms and captures on our side being about half the tonnage and
                    half the guns we had acquired. At the commencement of this reign, the navy, as
                    we have stated, consisted of 173 ships, measuring 101,892 tons; at his death, it
                    had been extended to 272 ships, measuring 159,020 tons, being an increase of
                    ninety-nine ships and 57,128 tons, or more than one half both in number and in
                    tonnage.</p>
                <p>The accession of Queen Anne was immediately followed by a war with France and
                    Spain, and in the second year of her reign she had the misfortune of losing a
                    vast number of her ships, by one of the most tremendous storms that was ever
                    known; but every energy was used to repair this national calamity. In an address
                    of the House of Lords, in March 1707, it is declared as “a most undoubted maxim,
                    that the honour, security, and wealth of this kingdom does depend upon the
                    protection and encouragement of trade, and the improving and right encouraging
                    its naval strength therefore we do in the most ear nest manner beseech your
                    majesty, that the sea affairs may always be your first and most peculiar care.”
                    In the course of this war were taken or destroyed about fifty ships of war,
                    mounting 3000 cannon; and we lost about half the number. At the death of the
                    queen, in 1714, the list of the navy was reduced in number to 247 ships,
                    measuring 167,219 tons, being an increase in tonnage of 8199 tons.</p>
                <p>George I. left the navy pretty nearly in the same state in which he found it. At
                    his death, in 1727, the list consisted of 233 ships, measuring 170,862 tons,
                    being a decrease in number of fourteen, but an increase in tonnage of 3643
                    tons.</p>
                <p>George II. was engaged in a war with Spain in 1739, in consequence of which the
                    size of our ships of the line <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557424"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7424-0043"/>ordered to be built was considerably increased. In
                    1744, France declared against us; but on the restoration of peace in 1748, it
                    was found that our naval strength had prodigiously increased. Our loss had been
                    little or nothing, whilst we had taken and destroyed, of the French twenty, and
                    of the Spanish fifteen sail of the line, besides smaller vessels. The war with
                    France of 1755 added considerably to the list, so that, at the king’s decease,
                    in 1760, it consisted of 412 ships, measuring 321,104 tons.</p>
                <p>In the short war of 1762, George III. added no less than twenty sail of the line
                    to our navy. At the conclusion of the American war in 1782, the list of the navy
                    was increased to 600 sail; and at the signing of the preliminaries in 1783 it
                    amounted to 617 sail, measuring upwards of 500,000 tons; being an increase of
                    185 ships and 157,000 tons and upwards since the year 1762. At the peace of
                    Amiens the list of the fleet amounted to upwards of 700 sail, of which 144 were
                    of the line. The number taken from the enemy, or destroyed, amounted nearly to
                    600, of which ninety were of the line, including fifty-gun ships, and upwards of
                    two hundred were frigates; and our loss amounted to about sixty, of which six
                    were of the line and twelve frigates.</p>
                <p>The recommencement and long continuance of the revolutionary war, and the
                    glorious successes of our naval actions; the protection required for our
                    extended commerce, of which, in fact, we might be said to enjoy a monopoly, and
                    for the security of our numerous colonies; contributed to raise the British navy
                    to a magnitude to which the accumulated navies of the whole world bore but a
                    small proportion. From 1808 to 1813, there were seldom less than from 100 to 106
                    sail of the line in commission, and from 130 to 160 frigates, and upwards of 200
                    sloops, besides bombs, gun-brigs, cutters, schooners, &amp;c. amounting in the
                    whole to about 500 sail of effective ships and vessels; to which may be added
                    500 more in the ordinary, and as prison, hospital, and receiving ships; making
                    at least 1000 pendants, and measuring from 800,000 to 900,000 tons. The
                    commissioners appointed to inquire into the state and condition of the woods,
                    forests, and land revenues of the crown, state, in their report to parliament,
                    in the year 1792, that, “at the accession of his majesty (Geo. III.) to the
                    throne, the tonnage of the royal navy was 321,104 tons, and at the end of the
                    year 1788 it had risen to no less than 413,467 tons.” In 1808 it had amounted to
                    the enormous extent of 800,000 tons, having nearly doubled itself in twenty
                    years.</p>
                <p>It must not, however, be supposed that the effective navy consisted of more than
                    half this amount of tonnage. Since the conclusion of the war, it would appear
                    that at least one half of the number of ships then in existence have been sold
                    or broken up as unfit for the service; and as, by the list of the navy at the
                    beginning of the year 1821, the number of ships and vessels of every
                    description, in commission, in ordinary, building, repairing, and ordered to be
                    built, has been reduced to 609 sail, we may take the greatest extent of the
                    present tonnage at 500,000 tons; but the greater part, if not the whole, of this
                    tonnage may be considered as efficient, or in a state of progressive
                    efficiency.</p>
                <p>According to the printed list of the 1st January 1821, the 609 sail of ships and
                    vessels appear to be as under:</p>

                <p>In the year 1836 the total number of ships of war, including every description
                    mentioned in the above list, amounted to about 560 sail; of which ninety-five
                    were ships of the line in a state of efficiency for any service, or of being
                    speedily put into a fit state for .sea, and many of them of a very superior
                    class to any employed in the last war.</p>
                <p>The increase in the size of our ships of war was unavoidable; France and Spain
                    had increased theirs, and we were compelled, in order to meet them on fair
                    terms, to increase the dimensions of ours; many of theirs were, besides, added
                    to the list of our navy. The following sketch will show the progressive rate at
                    which ships of the first order, or of 100 guns and upwards, were enlarged in
                    their dimensions. In 1677 the first rates were from 1500 to 1600 tons. In 1720
                    they were increased to 1800 tons. In 1745 we find them advanced to 2000 tons.
                    During the American war they were raised to 2200 tons. In 1795 the Ville de
                    Paris, of 110, measured 2350 tons. In 1804 the Hibernia, of 110 guns, was
                    extended to 2500 tons; and in 1808 the Caledonia, carrying 120 guns, measured
                    2616 tons, and here we stopped; but since then, the Nelson, the Howe, the St
                    Vincent, the Britannia, the Prince Regent, the Royal George, and the Neptune,
                    have been built, or are building, all nearly of the same dimensions, and from
                    the same draught—nine such ships as the whole world besides cannot produce. The
                    French had one ship larger than any of these, called the Commerce de Marseilles.
                    She was taken by us in Toulon, but broke her back in a gale of wind.</p>
                <p>The following are the comparative dimensions of the Caledonia and the Commerce de

                    officers, recommended to his majesty the following scheme for arming and manning

                <p>The rates of ships immediately after the revolution were reduced, the first being
                    turned to second rates, the second rates to third, &amp;c, and the size of each

                    preserve any thing like uniformity in the several classes. So many ships
                    captured from the French, Dutch, and Spaniards, were added to our navy, and so
                    many new ones built after the models of ships taken from these maritime powers,
                    that the various descriptions of ships of which our navy was composed became a

                    1747, the board of admiralty acquainted his majesty, that the French ship
                    Invincible, lately captured, was found to be larger than his majesty’s ships of
                    ninety guns and 750 men; and suggested that this ship, and all other prizes of
                    the like class, and also his majesty’s ships of ninety guns, when reduced to two
                    decks and a half, and seventy-four guns, should be allowed a complement of 700
                    men. And it further appears, that, at the latter end of the reign of George II.

                <p>The scales for measuring the ships were as various as their rates; and the evil
                    was further increased by the varieties which it was found necessary to introduce
                    in the rigging and arming of the ships of war. The masts, yards, rigging, and
                    stores, were of so many and various dimensions, as to be not only highly
                    inconvenient, but extremely expensive. When Lord Nelson was off Cadiz with
                    seventeen or eighteen sail of the line, he had no less than <hi rend="italic"
                    >seven</hi> different classes of seventy-four gun ships, each requiring
                    different sized masts, sails, yards, &amp;c. so that, in the event of one of
                    these being disabled, the others could not supply her with such stores as could
                    be appropriated to her wants.</p>

                <p>Thus stands the rating and manning of the navy at present; but another war, or a
                    new administration of the affairs of the navy, will, in all human probability,
                    make new regulations in these respects. It is, however, of the utmost
                    importance, with a view to convenience and economy, that the size and dimensions
                    of the several rates should be kept as nearly as possible equal, in order that
                    one description of stores may be applicable to every ship of the same rate. To
                    this end, the commissioners of naval revision have recommended, “that the ships
                    of each class or rate should be constructed, in every particular, according to
                    the form of the best ship in the same class in our navy; of the same length,
                    breadth, and depth; the masts of the same dimensions, and placed in the same
                    parts of the ship, with the same form and size of the sails.” A complete
                    classification of masts, yards, and sails, has very recently been
                    established.</p>

                    important as they were, are trifling when compared with those aids and
                    conveniences which have gradually been introduced since her reign, and which a
                    ship of war now enjoys. When Sir Anthony Deane, in 1664, raised the lower ports
                    of a two-decker four and a half feet out of the water, which had before been
                    scarcely three feet, and made a ship of this class to stow six months’
                    provisions instead of three, it was justly considered as a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194557450" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7450-0045"/>most important improvement;
                    not less so, when the breadth of a ship of this class was carried to forty-five
                    feet. “The builders of England,” says Pepys, “before 1673, had not well
                    considered that breadth only will make a stiff ship.” It must be confessed,
                    however, that, as far as the form of a ship’s bottom depends on scientific
                    principles, we have copied our best models from the French, sometimes with
                    capricious variations, which more frequently turned out to be an injurious
                    alteration than an improvement.</p>
                <p>The first essential alteration in the form of our ships of the line was taken
                    from the Superbe, a French ship of seventy-four guns, which anchored at
                    Spithead, on the model of which, as already stated, the Harwich was built by Sir
                    Anthony Deane in 1674; since which time we have constantly been copying from
                    French models, improving or spoiling, as chance might determine. “Where we have
                    built exactly after the form of the best of the French ships that we have
                    taken,” say the commissioners of naval revision, “thus adding our dexterity in
                    building to their knowledge in theory, the ships, it is generally allowed, have
                    proved the best in our navy; but whenever our builders have been so far misled
                    by their little attainments in the science of naval architecture, as to depart
                    from the model before them in any material degree, and attempt improvements, the
                    true principles on which ships ought to be constructed (being imperfectly known
                    to them) have been mistaken or counteracted, and the alterations, according to
                    the information given to us, have, in may cases, done harm.” Whilst, therefore,
                    they add, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">our</hi> rivals in naval
                    power were employing men of the greatest talents and most extensive
                    acquirements, to call in the aid of science for improving the construction of
                    ships, we have contented ourselves with groping on in the dark in quest of such
                    discoveries as chance might bring in our way.”</p>
                <p>Upon these grounds, and by the recommendation of the commissioners, a school for
                    a superior class of shipwright apprentices was established in Portsmouth
                    dockyard. It consisted of twenty-five young men of liberal education, whose
                    mornings were passed in the study of mathematics and mechanics, and in their
                    application to naval architecture; and the remainder of the day under the master
                    shipwright in the mould loft, and in all the various kinds of manual labour
                    connected with ship-building, âs well as in the management and conversion of
                    timber, so as to make them, at the same time, fully acquainted with all the
                    duties in detail of a practical shipwright. After producing more officers than
                    could be provided for, it was deemed expedient to break up the
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>If, however, we have hitherto been inferior to the French in the scientific
                    principles of ship-building, in the constructive part we have left them behind
                    beyond all comparison; and, notwithstanding the narrow prejudices which have
                    been more remarkably adhered to among shipwrights than among almost any other
                    class of artisans, various alterations and improvements have from time to time
                    been introduced into the mechanical part of naval architecture, which have added
                    to the strength, the stability, the comfort, and convenience of our ships of
                    war, and rendered them, in every point of view, superior to those of any other
                    nation. The application of iron where wood was formerly used, and of copper for
                    iron, has added considerably to the durability of ships; and the sheathing of
                    their bottoms with copper, to their celerity; giving them, at the same time, a
                    protection against the worm and those marine insects which were wont to adhere
                    to them; yet it is remarkable how strong the prejudice was against this practice
                    before it obtained a due degree of credit. In the fleet of Sir Edward Hughes in
                    India there was but one coppered ship, and Rodney’s squadron in the West Indies
                    had but four that were coppered in the year 1799; but these were enough so
                    completely to establish their superiority over the others with wooden sheathing,
                    that, in the year 1782, the whole British navy was coppered.</p>
                <p>But the greatest of all improvements in the construction of ships of war, as
                    tending to their strength and durability, is the system of diagonal bracing,
                    introduced a few years ago by Mr (afterwards Sir Robert) Seppings, surveyor of
                    the navy, and now universally adopted in all ships of the line and frigates; a
                    system that may be said to have established a new era in naval architecture. Of
                    all large machines destined to undergo severe shocks, a ship is perhaps the
                    least skilfully and artificially contrived. Her several parts are put together
                    on a principle so much opposed to that which constitutes strength, that if a
                    ship, on the old construction, should be put upon wheels, and drawn over a rough
                    pavement, the action of a day would shake her in pieces; but being destined to
                    move in an element that closes upon her, and presses her equally on all sides,
                    she is prevented from falling in pieces outwards, and her beams and decks
                    preserve her from tumbling inwards. Whoever has observed a ship <hi
                    rend="italic">in frame,</hi> as it is called, on the stocks, that is, with only
                    her timbers erected, must be forcibly reminded of the skeleton of some large
                    quadruped, as of a horse or ox, laid on its back; the keel resembling the
                    back-bone, and the curved timbers the ribs, which is, in fact, the name by which
                    they sometimes go. These ribs, issuing at right angles from the keel, consist,
                    in a seventy-four gun ship, of about 800 different pieces, the space between
                    each rib seldom exceeding five inches. These ribs are covered with a skin or
                    planks of different thicknesses within and without, also at right angles to the
                    ribs, and fixed to them by means of wooden pins or tree-nails. In the inside
                    three or four tiers of beams cross the skeleton from side to side, at right
                    angles to both planks and ribs. These beams support the decks. At right angles
                    to the beams are pieces of wood called carlings, and at right angles to these
                    other pieces called ledges, and upon these the planks of the deck are laid in a
                    direction at right angles to the beams, and parallel to the planking of the
                    sides. From this sketch it will be perceived that all the parts of a ship are
                    either parallel or at right angles to each other. The ribs form a right angle
                    with the keel, the planks inside and out are at right angles to the ribs, the
                    beams at right angles to these, the carlings to the beams, the ledges to the
                    carlings, and the planks of the decks to the ledges, the beams, and the
                    ribs.</p>
                <p>Now, it is well known to every common carpenter, that this disposition of
                    materials is the weakest that can be adopted. Thus, if five pieces of wood be
                    pinned together in the shape of a parallelogram, it will require but little
                    force to move them from the rectangular to the oblique or rhomboidal shape. But
                    place a cross-bar, as in the figure Z, as carpenters are accustomed to do on a
                    common gate, and it is no longer moveable on the points of fastening.</p>
                <p>The strongest proof of a ship’s partaking of this weakness in the old
                    construction, is afforded on her being first launched into the water, when it is
                    invariably found that the two extremities, being less water-borne than the
                    middle, drop, and give to the ship a convex curvature upwards, an effect which,
                    from its resemblance to the shape of a hog’s back, is usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">hogging.</hi> In very weak or old ships this effect may be
                    discovered in all the port-holes of the upper-deck, by their having taken the
                    shape of lozenges, declining different ways from the centre of the ship to each
                    extremity.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557463" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7463-0046"/>
                <p>To obviate this great defect, Seppings tried the experiment of applying to the
                    ribs or timbers of the ship, from one extremity to the other, and from the
                    orlop-deck downwards to the kelson, that well-known principle in carpentry,
                    called <hi rend="italic">trussing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> being, in fact, a
                    series of diagonal braces disposing themselves into triangles, the sides of
                    which give to each other a mutual support and counteraction. These triangles
                    were firmly bolted to the frame; and in order to give a continuity of strength
                    to the whole machine, and leave no possible room for play, he filled the spaces
                    between the frames with old-seasoned timber cut into the shape of wedges; but
                    afterwards with a prepared cement, thus rendering the lower part of the ship or
                    floor one solid, complete mass, possessing the strength and firmness of a rock;
                    but a few years have proved that this cement has injured the timber.</p>
                <p>The same principle of trussing is carried from the gundeck upwards, from whence,
                    between every port, is introduced a diagonal brace, which completely prevents
                    the tendency of ships to stretch, or draw asunder their upper works. The decks,
                    too, are made subservient to the securing more firmly the beams to the sides of
                    the ship, by the planks being laid diagonally in contrary directions, from the
                    midships to the sides, and at an angle of forty-five degrees with the beams, and
                    at right angles with the ledges.</p>
                <p>In frigates and smaller vessels, iron plates, lying at an angle of forty-five
                    degrees with the direction of the trusses, are substituted for the diagonal
                    frame of wood in ships of the line.</p>
                <p>By this mode of construction, the ceiling or internal planking is wholly
                    dispensed with, and a very considerable saving of the finest oak timber thereby
                    effected; and, what is more important, those receptacles of filth and vermin
                    between the timbers, which were before closed up by the planking, are entirely
                    got rid of. This is not the least important part of the improvement, either as
                    it concerns the soundness of the ship or the health of the crew. It is stated
                    that a ship which had been three years in India, on being laid open, exhibited a
                    mass of filth, mixed up with dead rats, mice, cockroaches, and other vermin,
                    which was taken out in cakes, not unlike in appearance the oil-cake with which
                    certain animals are fed; that the stench was abominable, and the timbers with
                    which it was in contact rotten. No such filth can find a lodgment in ships of
                    war as they are now built.</p>
                <p>It has been a subject of discussion amongst ship-builders, whether tree-nails or
                    metallic fastenings are to be preferred. The objection to iron bolts is their
                    rapid corrosion, from the gallic acid of the wood, the sea-water, and perhaps by
                    a combination of both; in consequence of which, the fibres of the wood around
                    them become injured, the bolts wear away, the water oozes through, and the whole
                    fabric is shaken and disarranged. This corrosion of iron fastenings was most
                    remarkable when the practice of sheathing ships with copper became general, and
                    when iron nails were made use of to fix it; for, by the contact of the two
                    metals in the sea-water, a galvanic, action took place, and both were
                    immediately corroded. Mixed metal nails are now used for this purpose; and
                    copper bolts are universally employed below the line of flotation, though it is
                    found that in these also oxidation takes place to a certain degree, and causes
                    partial leaks. Various mixtures of metals have been tried, but all of them are
                    considered as liable to greater objections than pure copper. It would appear,
                    then, that tree-nails, if properly made, well seasoned, and driven tight, are
                    the least objectionable, being seldom found to occasion leaks, or to injure the
                    plank or timbers through which they pass. This species of fastening has at all
                    times been used by all the maritime nations of Europe. The Dutch were in the
                    habit of importing them from Ireland, it being supposed that the oak grown in
                    that country was tougher and stronger than any which could be procured on the
                    Continent, and in all respects best adapted for the purpose. “Under all
                    circumstances,” says Mr Knowles, “it appears that the present method of
                    fastening ships generally with tough, well-seasoned tree-nails, with their ends
                    split, and caulked after being driven, and securing the buts of each plank with
                    copper bolts well clenched, is liable to fewer objections, and more conducive to
                    the durability of the timber, than any other which has been tried or proposed to
                    be established.”</p>
                <p>The rounding the form of the bow in ships of the line is considered by nautical
                    men as of great utility and importance. The plan was first proposed by Seppings
                    in 1807, and has since been generally adopted. The removal of the head railing,
                    and the continuing of the rounded form, give not only great additional strength
                    to the ship, but also much more comfort and convenience to the crew, and
                    security in that part of the ship when in action.</p>
                <p>The scarcity of compass or crooked timber was, for some time, attended with
                    serious injury to those ships of war while on the stocks, into which it was
                    considered necessary to be introduced. The difficulty with which it was
                    procured, the length of time which a ship sometimes remained on the stocks
                    waiting for a few pieces of compass timber, the green wood, when found, being
                    immediately added to the seasoned timber in other parts of the frame, gave to
                    the ship different periods of durability; though, in the long run, the seasoned
                    parts became affected by the green wood with which they were in contact, and a
                    premature decay of the whole fabric was the consequence. Seppings, therefore,
                    proposed a plan in 1806, which, by uniting short timbers according to a method
                    called <hi rend="italic">scarphing,</hi> enabled him to obtain every species of
                    compass-form that could be required from straight timber. Since that period, the
                    whole frame of a ship can be prepared at once, without waiting for particular
                    pieces, and thus every part of it can be made to undergo an equal degree of
                    seasoning.</p>
                <p>By the same ingenious and indefatigable surveyor of the navy, a plan was proposed
                    and adopted in the year 1813, by which ships of the line were built with timber
                    hitherto considered as applicable only to the building of frigates, and that
                    which had been deemed only fit for in-, ferior uses was appropriated to
                    principal purposes. The Talavera was the first ship built on this principle, and
                    the expense of her hull is stated to have been about a thousand pounds less than
                    that of the Black Prince, a ship of similar dimensions built upon the old
                    principle. The method by which the timbers were united was found, on trial of
                    the Talavera with the Black Prince, whilst in frame, to give so much additional
                    strength to the former, that it furnished the groundwork of the present mode of
                    framing the British navy, by the introduction of the same union of materials in
                    the application of the large, as was practised in that of the small timber, and
                    from which both strength and economy have been united.</p>
                <p>The building of the Talavera, and the great strength of her frame, led to the
                    practice of putting together the frames of ships of the line from timbers of
                    reduced lengths, and dispensing altogether with the chocks used for uniting
                    their extremities, or, as they are technically called, their heads and heels.
                    These chocks are of the form of an obtuse wedge, as A, and they are used to
                    unite the two pieces of timber, as B and C, by firmly bolting the piece A to the
                    two timbers B and C.</p>
                <p>It generally happened, however, that, in the operation <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194557476" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7476-0047"/>of thus fixing this chock,
                    its two extremities split, and the surfaces of the chock and timbers not being
                    in perfect contact, the moisture and air were admitted, and occasioned, as they
                    always do, the dry rot to a greater degree in those parts of the ship than in
                    most others; and as there were from four to five hundred of these chocks in a
                    seventy-four gun ship, it will readily be conceived what mischief was done to
                    the whole fabric, if the greatest care was not taken by the workmen to prevent
                    their splitting, and to bring their surfaces immediately into contact. It is
                    obvious, also, that a great deal of timber must have been cut to waste in making
                    these chocks; and, in fact, they consumed timber in each ship, when it was at a
                    high price, to the value of from L.I500 to L.2000, besides a considerable
                    expense in workmanship; and when the ship came to be repaired, not one chock in
                    six was found to be in a fit state to be used again. It is not easy to conceive
                    how this practice of uniting the timbers of a ship’s frame came to be introduced
                    so generally into the British navy, more especially as it is unknown in any
                    other nation; it was probably first done to preserve the length of some
                    particular timbers, one of whose ends might be defective, and the unsound part
                    cut away in the manner we see it, and the sound chock introduced to fill up the
                    vacuity; but it is quite surprising how a practice should have become general
                    which creates a waste of timber, an increase of workmanship, and sows the seeds
                    of premature decay. To obviate these disadvantages, Sir Robert Seppings brought
                    the but-ends of the timbers together thus, and kept them together by means of a
                    round dowal or coak, as C, just as the fellies of a carriage-wheel are fastened
                    together. He justly observes, that the simplicity of the workmanship, the
                    economy in the conversion of timber, and the greater strength and durability,
                    although of considerable moment, are of but trifling importance when compared
                    with the advantage of rendering timber generally more applicable to the frames
                    of ships, which had heretofore been but partially so.</p>
                <p>Another great improvement in the construction of ships of war, introduced by
                    Seppings, is the round stern, which, however unsightly it may at first appear,
                    from being accustomed to view the square stern with its grotesque carved work,
                    is even in appearance more consistent with the termination of the sweeping lines
                    of a ship’s bottom, than the cutting them off abruptly with a square stern. But
                    the additional strength which is thus given to a ship in that part which was
                    hitherto the weakest, is alone sufficient to recommend the adoption of the plan
                    in our ships of war, particularly in those of the larger classes. The advantages
                    gained by circular sterns are thus enumerated by Sir Robert Seppings.</p>
                <p>1. They give additional strength to the whole fabric of a ship.</p>
                <p>2. They afford additional force in point of defence.</p>
                <p>3. They admit of the guns being run out in a similar way to those in the
                    sides.</p>
                <p>4. From the circular form and mode of carrying up the timbers, an additional
                    protection against shot is obtained, if the ship should be raked.</p>
                <p>5. The stern being equally strong as the bow, no serious injury can accrue in the
                    event of the ship being pooped; and the ship may be moored, if so required, by
                    the stern.</p>
                <p>6. A ship will sail better upon a wind, from the removal of the projections of
                    the quarter galleries.</p>
                <p>7. Ships of the line have now a stern-walk, protected by a veranda, and so
                    contrived that the officers can walk all round, can observe the set of the
                    sails, and the fleet in all directions.</p>
                <p>8. The compass-timber heretofore expended for transoms is substituted with
                    straight timber, and worked nearly to a right angle, which affords a
                    considerable saving in the consumption of timber.</p>
                <p>9. The counter being done away by the circular stern, the danger which arose from
                    boats being caught under it is obviated.</p>
                <p>In fact, the circular stern possesses many other advantages not necessary to be
                    enumerated in this place.</p>

                <p>Not only is the new mode of construction highly favourable to the duration of
                    ships, but the ravages of the disease which is known by the name of the dry rot,
                    occasioned principally by the hurry in which ships were built in the course of
                    the late war, and the unseasoned state of the timber made use of (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dry Rot),</hi> led to such measures as tend most effectually to
                    the preservation of the fleet.</p>
                <p>In the first place, various modes were put in practice for assorting and
                    seasoning the timber, and for protecting it from the vicissitudes of the
                    weather. The oak and fir of Canada, which had been introduced to a great extent
                    into our dock-yards during the time the Baltic was shut against this country,
                    are now excluded; these woods having been found not only to possess little
                    durability, but so friendly to the growth of fungi, that they communicated the
                    baneful disease to all other descriptions of timber with which they came in
                    contact. The practice of building ships under cover, introduced into our
                    dock-yards in the course of the war, and carried to an extent so as to have
                    roofed over almost every dock and slip in all the yards, has been destructive to
                    the growth of dry rot. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Dock-yards.</hi></p>
                <p>A ship now placed in ordinary, whether new or newly repaired, is carefully housed
                    over, so that no rain can reach her lower decks; several streaks of planks are
                    removed from her sides and decks to admit a thorough draft of air, which is sent
                    down by wind-sails, and which pervades every part of the ship; and these, with
                    the addition of two small airing-stoves, in which a few cinders are burned,
                    render her perfectly dry and comfortable on all the decks and store-rooms. All
                    the shingle ballast is removed out of the hold, which is thoroughly cleaned and
                    restowed with iron ballast. The former practice of mooring two ships together,
                    by which the two sides next to each other, deprived of the sun and a free
                    circulation of air, were generally found to be decayed, is discontinued. The
                    lower masts are left standing, and their tops housed over; the gun-carriages and
                    several of the stores are left on board; and such, in short, is the state of a
                    ship in ordinary, that she may be fitted in all respects for proceeding to sea
                    in half the usual time. “The ships,” says Mr Knowles, “are frequently pumped to
                    clear them of bilgewater, and cleanliness in every respect is attended to; the
                    lower decks are rubbed with dry stones, commonly called holly-stones, and with
                    sand, the use of water upon them being strictly forbidden.” But that which most
                    of all is likely to insure the preservation of the fleet whilst in a state of
                    ordinary, is the recent regulation, which places the ordinary under the
                    immediate superintendence of a captain at each port, with other commissioned
                    officers under his orders, who take care that the warrant-officers and
                    ship-keepers attend to the proper airing, ventilating, and keeping clean and dry
                    their respective ships.</p>
                <p>A practice has recently been introduced into the dockyards, of steeping oak
                    timber in salt-water for several months, and then stacking it till it becomes
                    perfectly dry, which is said to have entirely put a stop to the progress of dry
                    rot where it had already commenced, and to act as a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194557489" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7489-0048"/>preventive to that disease.
                    Some doubts, however, were entertained on this point, and the practice has been
                    discontinued. The Americans seem to place little confidence in the good effects
                    which are said to have been experienced from the immersion of timber. Rodgers,
                    the commissioner of their navy, states, in an official report addressed to the
                    secretary, that “experiments have been made to arrest the dry rot in ships, by
                    sinking them for months in salt-water, but without success. The texture of the
                    wood was found to be essentially injured by being thus water-soaked, and it
                    became more subject to this disease than before it was sunk. The ships were also
                    injured in their fastenings, and the atmosphere within them was kept in a
                    constant state of humidity, whence, among other ill effects, proceeded injury to
                    provisions and stores, and sickness to the crews.” The truth is, the American
                    timber, with the single exception, perhaps, of the live-oak, is remarkably
                    subject to dry rot, of which, during the late war, we had fatal experience. Mr
                    Rodgers, however, accounts for the condition in which the oak and pine were
                    received in England from Canada, by their immersion in water. “The Canada
                    timber,” he observes, “is brought down the St Lawrence in large rafts, continues
                    months in water, and in that saturated state is landed and exposed to frost;
                    every attempt to season it under cover is unavailing; its pores never close
                    again, and when used as ship-timber, dry rot ensues, which, when once commenced,
                    can never be arrested, but by taking out all the pieces in any degree affected.”
                    The Russians, he says, are so fully aware of the injurious effects of soaking
                    ship-timber in water, that it is brought from great distances down the rivers in
                    crafts instead of rafts. The Russian ships, however, with all this precaution,
                    are not remarkable for durability. The ships built at Antwerp by the French were
                    in a state of rottenness before they were launched; but whether this was owing
                    to the bad quality of the timber of the German forests, or to its being
                    water-soaked in rafting down the Rhine, remains doubtful. But we can have no
                    doubt that porous timber is injured by moisture, though the solid British oak
                    may be improved by the dissolution of its sap juices, to the fermentation of
                    which the disease known by the name of dry rot may perhaps be chiefly owing.
                    “Water,” says Lescalier, a French writer of considerable merit on the subject,
                    “seems to be favourable to the decomposition of the sap of timber when immersed;
                    but it substitutes in its place another kind of moisture not less destructive,
                    of which the timber, though afterwards exposed to the air, will not easily get
                    rid of; besides, it weakens and destroys the grain of the wood.” “The best
                    means,” he adds, “of preserving timber, appears to be that of keeping it in
                    well-constructed and airy sheds, in a vertical position, so that the moisture
                    which remains in the interior of the logs, by running along the fibres of the
                    wood, may be enabled to issue from the lower extremity. Timber thus kept dry,
                    under shelter, will preserve itself for ages.” Mr Knowles, secretary to the
                    committee of surveyors of his majesty’s navy, in his treatise on the Means of
                    Preserving the British Navy, is led to conclude, from a variety of experiments,
                    “that timber is better seasoned when kept for two years and a half under cover,
                    than when placed for six months in water, and then for two years in the air,
                    protected from the rain and sun; that it loses more in seasoning, by having
                    been, during the six months of immersion, alternately wet and dry, than the
                    whole time under water; and that the loss in moisture is greater in all cases in
                    a given time when the but-ends are placed downwards.” And he adds as a general
                    principle, “that no timber should be brought into use in this country until it
                    has been felled at least three years.”</p>
                <p>Next to the system of diagonal braces, the roofing thrown over them whilst
                    building and in ordinary may be considered as the greatest of all improvements
                    for the preservation of the navy. The utility of it is so obvious, that it is
                    quite extraordinary such a practice should not have been earlier adopted; more
                    especially as, at Venice, at Carlscrona, and at Cronstadt, ships of war had long
                    been built, repaired, and protected under covered roofs. It was strongly
                    recommended to the English ship-builders fifty years ago, but without effect;
                    and had it not been for the extraordinary ravages of the dry rot in the
                    unseasoned timber-built ships of the navy, we should still have been without
                    roofs to our docks and slips.</p>
                <p>If the dock-yards were of sufficient capacity, there can be no doubt that the
                    efficient plan to accomplish their durability, would be that of keeping them on
                    the slip, when built, under cover. A large frigate, the Worcester, has remained
                    on the slip and under cover for six or seven years, and there is not a flaw in
                    her of any kind. It was stated by Mr Strange, when examined by the commissioners
                    for land revenue, that in the year 1790 there were twenty-two ships of the line
                    under roofs in the port of Venice, some of which had remained in that situation
                    fifty-nine years. Since, however, it is utterly impracticable to keep our navy
                    on slips, or in dry docks, the next important consideration is, how best to
                    preserve them afloat in a state of ordinary. Various expedients have been at
                    different times resorted to in order to prevent the premature decay of ships
                    laid up in this state during peace. The two great requisites for their
                    preservation are ventilation and cleanliness. To promote the former, wind-sails
                    were in general use, though, if not attended to, so as to oppose the open part
                    to the quarter from whence the wind blows, or if the w cather be calm, they are
                    of little benefit. Pneumatic machines of various kinds, as pumps and bellows,
                    have been applied to force out the foul air, and introduce atmospherical air
                    into the lower parts of a ship’s hold. Heated air from stoves, placed in various
                    parts of the ship, and conducted through tubes, was thought at one time to be
                    efficacious in the preservation of the navy; but experience soon showed that the
                    heat thus circulated was so <hi rend="italic">far</hi> objectionable, as it
                    tended to encourage the growth of fungus where there was any moisture lodged,
                    and in the timber which had not been thoroughly seasoned. Perhaps no better
                    means can be suggested than those we have described to be in practice, namely,
                    to keep them clean, to admit as much dry air as possible, and to exclude all
                    moisture.</p>
                <p>Finally, if we take into consideration the numerous improvements which a war,
                    unparalleled in its duration, has been the means of introducing into the <hi
                    rend="italic">matériel</hi> of the navy, whether it regards the economy of its
                    application, the construction of the ships, and their mode of preservation, we
                    may safely say, that at no former period was this country in possession of such
                    a navy as at present, in respect of the number, size, and good condition of the
                    ships which compose a fleet, superior to those of the whole world besides; and
                    it is gratifying to find, that, with all the enormous consumption of the
                    military and mercantile navy, it does not appear that the naval resources of
                    Great Britain are at all impaired.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval Resources.</hi></p>
                <p>It is of essential importance that the supply of stores for the use of the fleet
                    should not only be adequate to the demand, but that a sufficient stock should be
                    kept on hand to answer any sudden emergency. - This is the^more necessary with
                    regard to those species of stores which are derived from foreign nations.</p>
                <p>The principal articles of consumption required for building and equipping a fleet
                    are, hemp, canvass, pitch, tar, iron, copper, and timber. All these articles
                    might unquestionably be produced in sufficient quantities in the united kingdom
                    and her colonies, if necessity absolutely <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557502"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7502-0049"/>required it. Hemp, for instance, might be grown to
                    any extent in Great Britain and Ireland, were not the land more advantageously
                    employed in raising other articles of consumption, and if it could not be
                    cheaper imported from Russia. In the East Indies, the Sunn hemp (inferior, it is
                    true, to Russia hemp) might be procured to any extent; and other plants, both
                    there and at home, might be substituted for the making of cordage and canvass.
                    For pitch and tar, recourse might be had to the pitch-lake on the island of
                    Trinidad, and the coal-tar, of which an inexhaustible supply may be had at home.
                    The lake is about four miles in circumference, and many feet in depth, of solid
                    pitch; and it is stated that, when mixed with oil or tallow, it is rendered fit
                    for all the purposes to which pitch and tar are usually applied. It has the
                    advantage of securing ships’ bottoms against the attack of the worm, which is
                    very active in the neighbouring Gulf of Para; and it does not corrode iron. The
                    coal-tar of home manufacture, from some prejudice or other, was refused a fair
                    trial till very lately, and it is now deemed not inferior for many purposes to
                    the common tar. For painting or tarring over wood-work of every kind, it is said
                    to stand exposure to the weather even better than the common tar; and it is used
                    for injecting in large quantities between the timbers of ships, as a
                    preservative from the dry rot; its powerful smell having also the good effect of
                    driving rats and other vermin out of the ships on which it is employed,</p>
                <p>In the two important articles of copper and iron, our own resources may be
                    considered as inexhaustible. Formerly it was deemed indispensable that certain
                    articles should be made of Swedish iron, but of late years our own has been
                    manufactured in every respect equally good; and the extensive application of
                    this metal in bridges, barges, dockgates, roofs, rafters, floors, &amp;c. has
                    been equally progressive in most naval purposes. Iron knees, and other modes of
                    binding the beams to the side timbers of ships, are now substituted for those
                    large and crooked pieces of timber which were once deemed absolutely necessary.
                    Our cables, rigging, buoys, and tanks for holding water, are also now of
                    iron.</p>
                <p>But the most important article of demand for the use of the navy is timber,
                    principally oak, concerning the supply of which from our own territories
                    different opinions have been entertained. A deficiency in other articles may
                    readily be supplied. A failure in the importation of hemp, for instance, in any
                    one year, might be remedied the next, by an extended cultivation of that
                    article; but it requires a whole century to repair any defalcation of oak
                    timber, and to render us independent of other nations. Nor has the subject been
                    sufficiently elucidated, so as to form a just opinion, by the several committees
                    of the House of Commons, the evidence produced being almost always loose, and
                    generally contradictory. The committee of 1771, which was directed to inquire
                    into the state of oak timber throughout the kingdom, either from a disagreement
                    of opinion, or defect of evidence, or a wish to avoid giving alarm, prayed the
                    house to discharge that part of its order which required them to report their
                    opinion. The commissioners of woods and forests, however, in their report laid
                    before parliament in 1792, appeared to establish the fact of an alarming
                    scarcity of oak timber in general, but more particularly of large naval timber,
                    both in the royal forests and on private estates. And if such was really the
                    fact in 1792, it will readily be conceived what the state of timber fit for
                    naval purposes must have been at the conclusion of the revolutionary war, when
                    the amount of private shipping had increased from 1,300,000 tons to 2,500,000
                    tons, or nearly doubled; that of the East India Company, in the same period,
                    from 79,900 tons to 115,000 tons; and that of the navy from 400,000 to 800,000
                    tons: to say nothing of the vast consumption of oak timber in all kinds of
                    mill-work and other machinery; in the barrack and ordnance departments; in
                    mines, collieries, and agriculture; in docks and dock-gates; in piers, locks,
                    and sluices; in boats, barges, lighters, bridges, and a great many other
                    purposes to which this timber is applied. From these, and many other causes, the
                    diminution of oak timber was infinitely greater than the commissioners had
                    calculated upon, and yet they recommended that 100,000 acres, belonging to the
                    crown, should be set apart and planted, as necessary for the future supply of
                    the navy. A bill to this effect, relating to the New Forest, passed the Commons,
                    but was thrown out by the Lords.</p>
                <p>On the departments of the surveyor-general of the land revenue and the
                    surveyor-general of the woods and forests being united, the board of
                    commissioners made their first report, which was printed, by order of the House
                    of Commons, in June 1812. In this report, it is stated that, taking the tonnage
                    of the navy in 1806 ät 776,087 tons, it would require, at one and a half load to
                    a ton, 1,164,085 loads to build such a navy; and supposing the average duration
                    of a ship to be fourteen years, the annual quantity of timber required would be
                    83,149 loads, exclusive of repairs, which they calculate would be about 27,000
                    loads, making in the whole about 110,000 loads; of which, however, the
                    commissioners reckon, may be furnished 21,341 loads as the annual average of
                    prizes; and of the remaining 88,659 loads, they think it not unreasonable to
                    calculate on 28,659 from other sources than British oak. “This,” they observe,
                    “leaves 60,000 loads of such oak as the quantity which would be sufficient
                    annually to support, at its present unexampled magnitude, the whole British
                    navy, including ships of war of all sorts, but which may be taken as equivalent
                    together to twenty 74-gun ships, each of which, one with another, contains about
                    2000 tons, or would require, at the rate of a .load and a half to the ton, 3000
                    loads, making just 60,000 loads for twenty such ships.”</p>
                <p>Now it has been supposed that not more than forty oak trees can stand on an acre
                    of ground, so as to grow to a full size, fit for ships of the line, or to
                    contain each a load and a half of timber; 50 acres, therefore, would be required
                    to produce a sufficient quantity of timber to build a 74- gun ship, and 1000
                    acres for twenty such ships; and, as the oak requires at least 100 years to
                    arrive at maturity, 100,000 acres would be required to keep up a successive
                    supply for maintaining a navy of seven or eight hundred thousand tons. The
                    commissioners further observe, that as there are twenty millions of acres of
                    waste lands in the kingdom, a two-hundredth part set aside for planting would at
                    once furnish the whole quantity wanted for the use of the navy.</p>
                <p>This calculation, we suspect, is overrated by about one half. In the first place,
                    it supposes a state' of perpetual war, during which the tonnage of the whole
                    navy is considered as more than double of what it now actually is; and, in the
                    second place, it reckons the average duration of the navy at fourteen years
                    only, which, from the improvements that have taken place in the construction and
                    preservation of ships of war, with the resources of teak ships, built in India,
                    we should not hesitate in assuming at an average of twice that number of years;
                    and if so, the quantity of oak required for the navy will be nothing like that
                    which the commissioners have stated. This, we think, will appear from a
                    statement made (apparently on good authority) in the midst of the war, when the
                    ships of the line built in merchants’ yards were falling to decay after a
                    service of five or six years.</p>
                <p>“Assuming 400,000 tons as the amount of tonnage to be kept in commission, and the
                    average duration of a ship of war at the moderate period of twelve and a half
                    years, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557515" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7515-0050"/>there
                    would be required an annual supply of tonnage, to preserve the navy in its
                    present effective state, of 32,000 tons; and as a load and a half of timber is
                    employed for every ton, the annual demand will be 48,000 loads. The building of
                    a 74-gun ship consumes about 2000 oak trees, or 3000 loads of timber, so that
                    48,000 loads will build eight sail of the line and sixteen frigates. Allowing
                    one fourth part more for casualties, the annual consumption will be about 60,000
                    loads, or 40,000 full-grown trees, of which thirty-five will stand upon an acre
                    of ground. The quantity of timber, therefore, necessary for the construction of
                    a 74-gun ship will occupy fifty-seven acres of land, and the annual demand will
                    be the produce of 1140 acres. Allowing only ninety years for the oak to arrive
                    at perfection, there ought to be now standing 102,600 acres of oak plantations,
                    and an annual felling and planting, in perpetual rotation, of 1140 acres, to
                    meet the consumption of the navy alone. Large as this may seem, it is little
                    more than twenty-one acres for each county in England and Wales; which is not
                    equal to the belt which surrounds the park and pleasure-grounds of many
                    estates.”</p>
                <p>The above calculation proceeds upon the principle that every acre is covered with
                    trees fit for naval purposes, or that it contains thirty-five trees, with a load
                    and a half of timber in each. It may be doubted, however, if, on the average of
                    plantations, we shall find more than one tenth of that number on an acre; and as
                    the same writer endeavours to show that the quantity of oak timber consumed in
                    the navy is only about one tenth part of the whole consumption of the country,
                    instead of 102,600 acres being sufficient for a perpetual supply, there would be
                    required some ten or twelve millions of acres, in plantations similar to those
                    at present existing, to supply the demand for oak timber. Whether such a
                    quantity exists or not, the fact is certain, that, long before the conclusion of
                    the war, a scarcity began to be felt, especially of the larger kind of timber,
                    fit for building ships of the line; and so great was this scarcity, that if Sir
                    Robert Seppings had not contrived the means of substituting straight timber for
                    those of a certain form and dimension, before considered as indispensable, the
                    building of new ships must have entirely ceased.</p>
                <p>If, however, the growth of oak for ship timber was great- .y diminished during
                    the war, so as to threaten an alarming scarcity, there is little doubt that,
                    from the increased attention paid by individuals to their young plantations, and
                    the great extension of those plantations, as well as from the measure of
                    allotting off portions of the royal forests to those who had claims on them, and
                    enclosing the remainder for the use of the public, this country will, in future
                    times, be fully adequate to the production of oak timber equal to the demand for
                    the naval and mercantile marine. It will require, however, large and successive
                    plantations, on account of the slow growth of the oak. But there is another
                    tree, of late years very generally planted on rising grounds, which bids fair to
                    become an object of great national importance, as furnishing the best, and
                    perhaps the only, substitute for oak timber. We mean the larch, which thrives
                    well and grows rapidly in bad soils and exposed situations, the timber of which
                    has been found to be durable, and, from several experiments, not inferior in
                    strength, toughness, and elasticity to oak. So rapid is its growth, that the
                    Duke of Atholl received twelve guineas for a single larch fifty years old; the
                    timber was valued at two shillings a foot. A larch of seventy years’ growth
                    produces timber fit for all naval purposes, and may be considered as equal in
                    size to an oak of double that age. The dimensions of a larch tree cut down at
                    Blair Atholl in 1817, and then seventy-nine years of age, were as follows: viz.
                    stem, eighty-two feet; top, twenty feet; total height, 102 feet; girth at the
                    ground, twelve feet; at nineteen feet, eight feet three inches and a half; and
                    at fifty-seven feet, four feet ten inches; solid contents, 252∙8 cubic feet.
                    Another larch, growing at Dunkeld, measured, in the year 1819, when it was
                    eighty years old, and in full vigour, as follows, viz. height of stem
                    seventy-five feet, top fourteen feet; total height ninety feet: at one foot from
                    the ground, seventeen feet eight inches in girth; at ten feet, ten feet four
                    inches; and at seventy feet, three feet two inches; its contents, 300 cubic
                    feet, or six loads. For all kinds of mill-work, as wheels, axle-trees, &amp;c.
                    the utility of the large larch wood is unquestionable; and the thinnings are
                    excellent for pailing, rails, and hurdles. The value of its application for
                    naval purposes has been put to the test of experiment; two frigates of
                    twenty-eight guns, one built entirely of larch from the Duke of Atholl’s
                    plantations, the other of Riga fir (which is inferior only to oak), having been
                    intended to go through the same service, precisely in the same parts of the
                    world, in order to ascertain their comparative durability.</p>
                <p>In addition to our resources of naval timber at home, we have wisely availed
                    ourselves of those which India affords for building ships of war at Bombay, of
                    teak, a wood far superior in every respect to oak, and many times more durable;
                    not liable to corrode iron or other metallic fastenings, not susceptible of the
                    dry rot, nor subject to the attack of the worm.</p>
                <p>II.—PERSONEL OF THE NAVY.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">personel</hi> of the navy is composed of two different
                    bodies of men, the seamen and the marines, each of whom have their appropriate
                    officers.</p>
                <p>The commissioned officers of the former consist of flagofficers, captains,
                    commanders, and lieutenants. Flag-officers are divided into three ranks, and
                    each rank into three squadrons, distinguished by the colours red, white, and
                    blue; as admiral of the red, white, or blue; vice-admiral of the red, white, or
                    blue; rear-admiral of the red, white, or blue; the admiral wearing* his colour
                    at the main, the vice-admiral at the fore, and the rear-admiral at the
                    mizen-mast head. There is also an admiral of the fleet, who, if in command,
                    would carry the union flag at the main. There are besides superannuated
                    rear-admirals, enjoying the rank and pay of a rear-admiral, but incapable of
                    rising to a higher rank on the list. There is also in the navy the temporary
                    rank of commodore, who is generally an old captain, and is distinguished by
                    wearing a broad pendant. He ranks next to the junior rear-admiral, and above all
                    captains, except where the captain of the fleet shall be a captain, who, in that
                    situation, takes rank next to the junior rear-admiral.</p>
                <p>The commissioned officers of the navy take rank with those of the army as
                    follows.</p>

                <p>And all officers of the same rank command according to the priority of their
                    commissions, or, having commissions of the same date, according to the order in
                    which they stand on the list of the officers of the navy, except in the case of
                    lieutenants of flag-ships, who take precedence according as the flag-officer
                    shall think fit to appoint them.</p>

                    facs="nls:194557528" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7528-0051"/>the non-commissioned officers
                    of the army. They take rank as follows, viz. master, second master, gunner,
                    boatswain, carpenter. There are other warrant-officers of the navy, who, though
                    non-combatants, constitute a part of the establishment of the larger classes of
                    ships of war. These are, the chaplain, surgeon, surgeon’s assistant, purser; to
                    which may be added, as part of the staff of a fleet or squadron, secretary to
                    the admiral or commander-in-chief, and physician to the fleet. In steam-vessels,
                    the engineers rank next after the warrant-officers.</p>
                <p>The petty officers are very numerous, the principal of whom are masters’ mates
                    and midshipmen. Their names or ratings will be seen in the table of the
                    establishment of the ratings and pay in the several classes of ships of war.</p>
                <p>By the king’s order in council, the following regulations are established for the
                    promotion of commissioned officers of the navy. Midshipmen are required to serve
                    six years on board some of his majesty’s ships, two of which years they must
                    have been rated as midshipmen, to render them eligible to the rank and situation
                    of lieutenant.</p>
                <p>No lieutenant can be promoted to the rank of commander until he has been on the
                    list of lieutenants during two years; and no commander to the rank of captain
                    until he has been on the list for one year. Captains become admirals in
                    succession according to their seniority on the list, provided they shall have
                    commanded four years in a rated ship during war, or six years during peace, or
                    five years in war and peace combined.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed to serve as master of one of his majesty’s ships who
                    shall not have served as second master; and no person can be appointed as second
                    master until he has passed such examination as may from time to time be
                    directed.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed gunner or boatswain unless he shall have served one
                    year as a petty officer on board one or more of his majesty’s ships, and produce
                    certificates of his good conduct, and undergo the necessary examination.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed carpenter unless he shall have served an
                    apprenticeship to a shipwright, and been six months a carpenter’s mate on board
                    one or more of his majesty’s ships.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed purser, unless he shall have been rated and discharged
                    the duties of a captain’s clerk for two complete years, one year as captain’s
                    clerk, and been employed in the office of the secretary to a flagofficer for one
                    other year, produce good certificates, and find such security for the honest and
                    faithful discharge of his duty as shall be required.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed chaplain to one of his majesty’s ships until he has
                    received priest’s orders; but he may be appointed to act whilst in deacon’s
                    orders.</p>
                <p>No person can be appointed surgeon to one of his majesty’s ships until, by long
                    and meritorious services, he has discharged the duties of assistant surgeon; and
                    all persons applying for the situation of assistant surgeon must undergo an
                    examination touching their qualifications before the physician general of the
                    navy.</p>
                <p>The royal marines consist of four great divisions; the first stationed at
                    Chatham, the second at Portsmouth, the third at Plymouth, and the fourth at
                    Woolwich. They are composed of seventy-two companies, besides two companies of
                    royal marine artillery, whose head-quarters are at Fort Monckton, Gosport. The
                    first division has twenty-one companies; the second, eighteen companies; the
                    third, twenty companies; and the fourth, thirteen companies. The officers of
                    royal marines take rank with the officers of the line in the army.</p>
                <p>A colonel commandant, who is a general officer in the corps, is resident in
                    London; and to each of the divisions is a colonel commandant, two
                    lieutenant-colonels, and two majors, with a proper number of captains and
                    subaltern officers. Whilst on shore, the marines are subject to the same
                    regulations as the army; but when embarked, they are liable to the naval
                    articles of war.</p>
                <p>Each division has its paymaster, a captain in the corps; a barrackmaster, also a
                    captain; two adjutants, and a quartermaster, who are first lieutenants; and to
                    each division is a surgeon and an assistant surgeon. There is also a retired
                    list of officers, who, in consideration of wounds, infirmities, and long and
                    meritorious services, are permitted to receive their full pay.</p>
                <p>The commissions of officers of every rank in the marine corps are signed by the
                    sovereign; but all commissions of officers of the navy are signed by two or more
                    of the lords commissioners of the admiralty. But the marines, whether ashore or
                    afloat, are, as well as the officers of the navy, under the immediate direction
                    and control of the lords commissioners of the admiralty. All the appointments of
                    commissioned and warrant officers to ships are made exclusively by the lords of
                    the admiralty, or made subject to their confirmation, unless in cases of the
                    death or dismissal of officers by sentence of court-martial on foreign stations,
                    when the admiral commanding has the power to fill up the vacancies. And the
                    duties of each rank are pointed out in a code of instructions emanating from
                    that board, and sanctioned by the sovereign’s order in council.</p>
                <p>The civil powers and duties of the lord high admiral, or lords commissioners of
                    the admiralty, are treated of under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Admiral.</hi> Their military powers are more extensive and important. By their
                    orders all ships are built, repaired, fitted for sea, or laid up in ordinary,
                    broken up, or sold; put in commission or out of commission, armed, stored, and
                    provisioned; and employed on the home or foreign stations. All appointments or
                    removals of commission and warrant officers, with the exception of masters and
                    surgeons, are made by them, and all instructions issued for the guidance of
                    their commanders; all promotion in the several ranks emanates from them; all
                    honours bestowed for brilliant services, and all pensions, gratuities, and
                    superannuations for wounds, infirmities, and long services, are granted on their
                    recommendation. All returns from the fleet are sent to the board of admiralty,
                    and every thing that relates to the discipline and good order of every ship. All
                    orders for the payment of naval monies are issued by the lords commissioners of
                    the admiralty; and the annual estimate of the expenses of the navy is prepared
                    by them, and laid before parliament for its sanction. All new inventions and
                    experiments are tried by their orders before being introduced into the service;
                    all draughts of ships must be approved by them; all repairs, alterations, and
                    improvements in the dock-yards, and all new buildings of every description, must
                    be submitted for their decision before they are undertaken.</p>
                <p>All flag-officers, commanders-in-chief, are considered as responsible for the
                    conduct of the fleet or squadron under their command. They are bound to keep
                    them in perfect condition for service; to exercise them frequently in forming
                    orders of sailing and lines of battle, and in performing all such evolutions as
                    may occur in the presence of an enemy; to direct the commanders of squadrons and
                    divisions to inspect the state of each ship under their command, to see that the
                    established rules for good order, discipline, and cleanliness, are observed, and
                    occasionally to inquire into these and other matters themselves. They are
                    required to correspond with the secretary of the admiralty, and report to him
                    all their proceedings, for the information of the board.</p>
                <p>If a commander-in-chief should be killed in battle, his flag is to be continued
                    flying, and intelligence conveyed, by signal or otherwise, to the next in
                    command, who is immediately to repair on board, leaving his own flag (if a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194557541" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7541-0052"/> flag-officer)
                    flying, and direct the operations of the fleet until the battle be ended, or the
                    enemy out of sight.</p>
                <p>Every flag-officer serving in a fleet, but not commanding it, is required to
                    superintend all the ships of the squadron or division placed under his orders;
                    to see that their crews are properly disciplined; that all orders are punctually
                    attended to; that the stores, provisions, and water, are kept as complete as
                    circumstances will admit; that the seamen and marines are frequently exercised;
                    and that every precaution is taken for preserving the health of their crews; for
                    all which he is responsible to the commander-in-chief. When at sea, he is to
                    take care that every ship in his division preserve her station, in whatever line
                    or order of sailing the fleet may be formed; and in battle he is to observe
                    attentively the conduct of every ship near him, whether of the squadron or
                    division under his immediate command or not; and at the end of the battle he is
                    to report it to the commander-in-chief, in order that commendation or censure
                    may be passed, as the case may appear to merit; and he is empowered to send an
                    officer to supersede any captain who may misbehave in battle, or whose ship is
                    evidently avoiding the engagement. If any flagofficer be killed in battle, his
                    flag is to be kept flying, and signals to be repeated, in the same manner as if
                    he were still alive, until the battle shall be ended; but the death of a
                    flag-officer, or his being rendered incapable of attending to his duty, is to be
                    conveyed as expeditiously as possible to the commander-in-chief.</p>
                <p>The captain of the fleet is a temporary rank, where a commander-in-chief has ten
                    or more ships of the line under his command; it may be compared with that of
                    adjutant-general in the army. He may either be a flag-officer, or one of the
                    senior captains; in the former case, he takes his rank with the flag-officers of
                    the fleet; in the latter, he ranks next to the junior rear-admiral, and is
                    entitled to the pay and compensation of a rear-admiral. All orders of the
                    commander-in-chief are issued through him, and all returns of the fleet are made
                    through him to the commander-in-chief. He is appointed and can be removed from
                    his situation only by the lords commissioners of the admiralty.</p>
                <p>A commodore is a temporary rank, and of two kinds; the one having a captain under
                    him in the same ship, and the other without a captain. The former has the rank,
                    pay, and allowances of a rear-admiral, the latter such additional pay as the
                    lords of the admiralty may direct. They both carry distinguishing pendants.</p>
                <p>When a captain is appointed to command a ship of war, he commissions the ship by
                    hoisting his pendant; and if fresh out of the dock, and from the hands of the
                    dockyard officers, he proceeds immediately to prepare her for sea, by demanding
                    her stores, provisions, guns, and ammunition, from the respective departments,
                    according to her establishment. He enters such men as may volunteer and be fit
                    for the service (in time of peace), or which may be sent to him from some
                    rendezvous for raising men in time of war; and he gives them the several ratings
                    of petty officers, able seamen, ordinary, or landsmen, as their apparent
                    qualifications may entitle them to. If he be appointed to succeed the captain of
                    a ship already in commission, he passes a receipt to the said captain for the
                    ship’s books, papers, and stores, and becomes responsible and accountable for
                    the whole of the remaining stores and provisions; and, to enable him to keep the
                    ship’s accounts, he is allowed a clerk of his own appointing.</p>
                <p>The duty of the captain of a ship, with regard to the several books and accounts,
                    pay-books, entry, musters, discharges, &amp;c. is regulated by various acts of
                    parliament; but the state of the internal discipline, the order, regularity,
                    cleanliness, and the health of the crews, will depend mainly on himself and his
                    officers. In all these respects, the general printed instructions for his
                    guidance are particularly precise and minute. And, for the information of the
                    ship’s company, he is directed to cause the articles of war, and abstracts of
                    all acts of parliament for the encouragement of seamen, and all such orders and
                    regulations for discipline as may be established, to be hung up in some public
                    part of the ship, to which the men may at all times have access. He is also to
                    direct that they be read to the ship’s company, all the officers being present,
                    once at least in every month. He is not authorized to inflict any corporal
                    punishment on any commissioned or warrant officer, but he may place them under
                    arrest, and suspend any officer who shall misbehave, until an opportunity shall
                    offer of trying such officer by a court-martial. He is enjoined to be very
                    careful not to suffer the inferior officers, or men, to be treated with cruelty
                    or oppression by their superiors. He alone is to order punishment to be
                    inflicted, which he is never to do without sufficient cause, nor ever with
                    greater severity than the offence may really deserve, nor until twenty-four
                    hours after the crime has been committed, which must be specified in the warrant
                    ordering the punishment; and all the officers and the whole ship’s company are
                    to be present at every punishment, which must be inserted in the log-book, and
                    an abstract at the end of every quarter made out and sent to the admiralty; a
                    regulation which is said to have been attended with infinite benefit to the
                    strict and just discipline of the naval service.</p>
                <p>The lieutenants take the watch by turns, and are at such times intrusted, in the
                    absence of the captain, with the command of the ship. The one on duty is to
                    inform the captain of all occurrences which take place during his watch, as
                    strange sails that may be in sight, signals from other ships in company, change
                    of wind, &amp;c. He is to see that the ship be properly steered, the log hove,
                    and the course and distance entered on the log-board; and, in short, he is to
                    see that the whole of the duties of the ship are carried on with the same
                    punctuality as if the captain himself were present. In the absence of the
                    captain the senior lieutenant is responsible for every thing done on board.</p>
                <p>The master receives his orders from the captain, or any of the lieutenants. His
                    more immediate duties are those of stowing the ship’s hold, and of attending to
                    her sailing qualities; of receiving and placing the provisions in the ship, so
                    as most conveniently to come at those which may be wanted. He is to take care
                    that the cables are properly coiled in the tiers. The keys of the spirit-room
                    are in his custody, and he is directed to intrust them only to the master’s
                    mates. He has the charge of the store-rooms of the warrant-officers, which he is
                    ordered frequently to visit; in short, the whole of the ship’s provisions,
                    water, fuel, and stores of every description, are under the superintendence of
                    the master; and he is also intrusted, under the command of the captain, with the
                    charge of navigating the ship, bringing her to anchor, ascertaining the latitude
                    and longitude of her place at sea, surveying harbours, and making such nautical
                    remarks and observations as may be useful and interesting to navigation in
                    general.</p>
                <p>The warrant-officers are charged with the duty of receiving on board from the
                    dock-yards, and examining, the various stores of their respective departments,
                    and keeping an account of the expenditure of them.</p>
                <p>The gunner has the charge of the ship’s artillery, and of the powder magazine. He
                    is to see that the locks and carriages are kept in good order, and that the
                    powder is preserved from damp; he is frequently to examine the musquetry and
                    small arms, and to see that they are kept clean and fit for service; and, in
                    preparing for battle, it is his duty to take care that all the quarters are
                    supplied with every thing necessary for the service of the guns, and, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194557554" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7554-0053"/> during the
                    action, that there be no want of ammunition served out. He is frequently to
                    exercise the men at the guns, and to see that they perform this part of their
                    duty with correctness, explaining and enforcing the necessity of their pointing
                    the guns before they fire them, spunging them well, and close-stopping the
                    touch-hole immediately after firing. The armourer and his mates are under the
                    immediate orders of the gunner, in every thing that relates to the great guns
                    and small arms.</p>
                <p>The boatswain is charged with the duty of receiving and examining all the stores
                    belonging to his department, consisting chiefly of the ropes and rigging, the
                    latter of which he is ordered to inspect daily, in order that any part of it,
                    chafed or likely to give way, may be repaired without loss of time. He is always
                    required to be on deck at such times as all hands are employed; he is bound to
                    see that the men, when called, move quickly upon deck, and when there, that they
                    perform their duty with alacrity, and without noise or confusion. The sail-maker
                    and the ropemaker are under his immediate orders; and he is directed to see that
                    both these officers perform their respective duties with diligence and
                    propriety.</p>
                <p>The carpenter, when appointed to a ship, is carefully to inspect the state of the
                    masts and the yards, whether in the dock-yard or on board of the ship, to see
                    that they are perfectly sound and in good order. He is to examine every part of
                    the ship’s hull, magazine, store-rooms, and cabins. He is every day when at sea
                    carefully to examine into the state of the masts and yards, and to report to the
                    officer of the watch if any appear to be sprung, or in any way defective. He is
                    to see that the ports are secure and properly lined, and that the pumps are kept
                    in good order, as also the boats, ladders, and gratings. The caulker is placed
                    under his immediate orders, and he is to see that the former performs his duty
                    in a workmanlike manner, in stopping immediately any leaks that may be
                    discovered in the sides or decks.</p>
                <p>The purser has the charge of all the ship’s provisions, and of the serving them
                    out for the use of the crew. His charge is, therefore, of a most important
                    nature; and, accordingly, he must not only produce good certificates of his
                    conduct whilst serving in the capacity of clerk, but must also find two sureties
                    for the due discharge of his trust, who are required to give bond in a penal
                    sum, according to the rate or class of ship to which he may be appointed. The
                    regulations and instructions for his guidance are minutely detailed in the
                    general printed instructions, with all the various forms established for the
                    keeping of his accounts with the comptroller of victualling, to whom he is
                    immediately responsible. To assist him in the performance of his arduous duties,
                    he is allowed to employ the clerk, who, being engaged by the captain, who is
                    responsible for the strict performance of the duties of all the officers under
                    his orders, is, as it were, a check on the purser in many parts of his duty,
                    regarding the slop-books, muster-books, &amp;c. He has also a steward under his
                    immediate orders.</p>
                <p>The duties of the physician to the fleet, the surgeon of a ship and his
                    assistants, the secretary to the commanderin-chief, and the chaplain, are too
                    obvious to require any specification.</p>
                <p>The midshipmen are considered as the principal petty officers, but have no
                    specific duties assigned to them. In the smaller vessels, some of the senior
                    ones are intrusted with the watch; they attend parties of men senton shore; pass
                    the word of command on board, and see that the orders of their superiors are
                    carried into effect; and, in short, are exercised in all the duties of their
                    profession, so as, after six years’ service, to qualify them to become
                    lieutenants.</p>
                <p>Every ship, according to her class, has a certain num ber of marines serving on
                    board as part of her complement. They are commanded by a captain, or
                    brevet-major, in from first to fourth rates inclusive, with three or two
                    subalterns under them, and an established number of non-commissioned officers;
                    but the party on board fifth rates, and under, is commanded by a subaltern, and
                    in small vessels by a sergeant or corporal.</p>
                <p>All marine-officers, of whatsoever rank, when embarked, are to obey the orders of
                    the captain, or the commanding officer of the watch. The marines arc exercised
                    by their officers in the use of their arms; they arc employed as sentinels, and
                    in all other duties on board of which they are capable, with the exception of
                    going aloft. The officer commanding has the charge of the arms, accoutrements,
                    and drums; and he is to inspect weekly, at least, the state of the clothing of
                    his party. The marines are in every respect treated in the same manner as the
                    rest of the ship’s company.</p>
                <p>The long continuance of the revolutionary war necessarily created a prodigious
                    increase of the commissioned officers of the navy. Their numbers, in the five
                    following years of peace, were,</p>

                <p>The warrant-officers have increased in each class, from the average of about 400
                    in 1793, to 700 in 1821.</p>
                <p>The number of seamen and marines voted in 1792 was 16,000 (but never reduced to
                    that number); in 1822, it was 21,000; and in 1836, 32,000. The greatest number
                    of seamen and marines voted in any one year during the war was 150,000.</p>
                <p>The crew of a ship of war consists of able seamen, ordinary seamen, landsmen,
                    boys, and marines. The landsmen, boys, and marines, are always entered
                    voluntarily, the latter in the same manner as soldiers, by enlisting into the
                    corps, the two former at some rendezvous, or on board particular ships. A supply
                    of boys for the navy is also regularly sent from the Asylum at Greenwich and the
                    Marine Society. Able and ordinary seamen also very commonly volunteer to serve
                    during the war, and always in time of peace; but the high wages given by the
                    merchant ships to seamen in time of war hold out such encouragement as to induce
                    them to give the preference to that service, though, in all other respects,
                    their treatment is far superior on board a king’s ship, having better
                    provisions, and being subject to much less fatigue and exposure to the weather.
                    Indeed, the excellent regulations now rigidly adhered to on board his majesty’s
                    ships, and the attention that is paid to the health and comfort of the crew,
                    have overcome much of that reluctance which formerly was felt to the service of
                    a ship of war.</p>
                <p>The state of health on board of a king’s ship is, generally speaking, not
                    exceeded in the most favoured spot on shore; and that horrible disease, the
                    sea-scurvy, may now be considered as unknown in the British navy, since the
                    universal introduction of lemon juice, or the citric acid, without an ample
                    supply of which no ship is permitted to sail on a foreign voyage. Sir Gilbert
                    Blane, in a sensible little tract on the Health of the Navy, says that he has
                    never seen the scurvy resist the citric acid; and that, in the perusal of
                    several hundreds of surgeons’ journals, he has met with only two cases which
                    seemed to resist it.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557567" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7567-0054"/>
                <p>Yet, though it appears to have been known as a remedy for the scurvy, far
                    superior to all others, two hundred years ago, it seems to have lain dormant and
                    utterly neglected, till Dr Lind, more than a hundred years afterwards, revived
                    and stated clearly the singular powers of this remedy. In 1600, Commodore
                    Lancaster sailed from England, with three other ships, on the 2d of April, and
                    arrived in Saldanha Bay on the 1st of August. The commodore’s crew having each
                    had three table-spoonfuls of lemon juice every morning, arrived there in perfect
                    health; whereas the other ships were so sickly, that they were unmanageable for
                    want of hands. We have all felt the commiseration and horror which the perusal
                    of the narrative of Anson’s Voyage produces. His ship, the Centurion, left
                    England with 400 men, of whom 200 were surviving on his arrival at Juan
                    Fernandez, and of these, eight only were capable of duty, from scurvy. Yet even
                    this horrible catastrophe seems to have failed in rousing the nation to have
                    recourse to a remedy so certain and efficacious. Cook was well supplied with
                    vinegar and other acids, and found the good effects of them; but the first
                    general supply of lemon juice to the navy was established only in the year 1795,
                    in consequence of a trial which had been made of it the preceding year in the
                    Suffolk, of seventy-four guns. This ship left England, and arrived at Madras in
                    September, without touching at any land. With every man’s grog there were daily
                    mixed two thirds of a liquid ounce of lemon juice, and two ounces of sugar. She
                    lost not a man; and though the disease made its appearance in a few, an
                    increased dose of lemon juice immediately removed it. Thus the Suffolk, after a
                    voyage of 162 days, arrived without losing a man, or having a man sick of the
                    scurvy; whereas the Centurion, in 143 days from the last place of her
                    refreshment, lost half of her crew, whilst the other half were so feeble and
                    emaciated as to be utterly helpless.</p>
                <p>Nothing could more strongly point out the efficacy of lemon juice than the
                    following fact. When Lord St Vincent commanded the fleet which blockaded Brest
                    from the 27th of May to the 26th of September 1800, he maintained so close a
                    blockade, that not a single day passed without reconnoitring the entrance of the
                    harbour; yet, although the seamen of his fleet, consisting of at least 16,000
                    men, had no other than the ordinary ship’s provisions, sixteen only, in the
                    course of four months, were sent to the hospital. In 1780 the Channel fleet, as
                    appears from Dr Lind, were so overrun with scurvy and fever as to be unable to
                    keep the sea after a cruise of ten weeks only.</p>
                <p>From the official returns collected by Sir Gilbert Blane, Μ. Dupin, a French
                    author well versed in naval subjects, has drawn out the following table, which
                    exhibits at one view the progressive diminution of sickness, death, and
                    desertion, in the British navy, calculated on 100,000 men.</p>

                <p>Hence it would appear, that the diminution of sickness and of deaths has been in
                    the proportion of four to one nearly between the years 1779 and 1813. The
                    diminution of desertions from the hospital in the same period is not the less
                    remarkable; and it affords, at the same time, the strongest proof of the
                    progressive amelioration of the condition of seamen on board British ships of
                    war. Indeed, whether on board of ship, or in any of those noble institutions,
                    the naval hospitals, which are established at all the principal ports at home,
                    and in the colonies abroad, the attention which is paid to the sick sailor is
                    above all praise. The seamen are sensible of this, and nothing keeps them back
                    from volunteering their services, and giving a preference to a king’s ship over
                    a merchantman, but the temptation of high wages offered by the latter in time of
                    war, and that love of liberty and free scope for roving which are characteristic
                    of seamen.</p>
                <p>The speedy manning of the fleet, on the first breaking out of the war, is one of
                    the most important objects that can devolve on the naval administration, as on
                    it alone must depend the safety of our commerce and our colonies. This has been
                    felt at all times; and, accordingly, a variety of schemes have been brought
                    forward for this purpose, but all of them have failed of success, except the
                    compulsory mode of raising men under the authority of press-warrants, issued by
                    the lords commissioners of the admiralty, by virtue of the king’s order in
                    council, renewed from year to year. There likewise issues, on the breaking out
                    of a war, a proclamation from the king, recalling all British seamen out of the
                    service of foreign princes or states; and the instructions to the commanders of
                    all ships of war direct them to search foreign vessels, and to take British
                    seamen out of them.</p>
                <p>The impressment of seafaring men, however anomalous under a free constitution
                    like that of Great Britain, is defensible on state necessity, until it can be
                    shown that the fleet, on an emergency, is capable of being manned without
                    resorting to that measure. In consequence of some doubts being raised on the
                    legality of the subject in the year 1676, when the affairs of the admiralty were
                    managed immediately under the direction of the king and the great officers of
                    state, a discussion was held on this point, when it was decided by the judges
                    and crown-lawyers, that the king had an indefeasible right to the services of
                    his subjects when the state required them, and that the power of impressing
                    seamen was indispensably inherent in the crown, without which the trade and
                    safety of the nation could not be secured. The first instance of impressing men
                    in Ireland seems to have been in the year 1678, when the lordlieutenant received
                    directions from the privy council to raise a thousand seamen for the fleet. In
                    1690, the lords-justices of Ireland were directed to assist the officers of the
                    navy in impressing men in that kingdom, In 1697, a register was taken of all the
                    seafaring men in Ireland, which amounted to 4424 men, of whom it is noted 2654
                    were Catholics. On several occasions, during Queen Anne’s reign, the
                    lords-justices of Ireland received directions to raise men to serve in the
                    fleet.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, the mode of raising men by impressment was unknown before the union;
                    but in various instances the council of Scotland was directed to raise
                    volunteers for the fleet, each man to have forty shillings as bounty.</p>
                <p>In 1706, an experiment was tried for the speedy manning of the fleet, by virtue
                    of an act of parliament, which required the civil magistrates of all the
                    counties to make diligent search for all seafaring men, and twenty shillings
                    were allowed to the constables for each man taken up; the seamen to have pay
                    from the day of delivery to the naval officers stationed to receive them; and if
                    they deserted after that, they were to be considered as guilty of felony. By the
                    same act, insolvent debtors, fit for the service, and willing to enter it, were
                    released, provided the debt did not exceed L.30; and no seaman in the fleet was
                    to be arrested for any debt not exceeding L.20. The whole proceeding under this
                    act incurred a very heavy expense, and totally failed.</p>
                <p>In the same year, the queen referred to the Prince of Denmark, then lord high
                    admiral, an address from the House of Lords, relating to the three following
                    points :— 1<hi rend="italic">st,</hi> The most effectual means for manning the
                    fleet; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557580"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7580-0055"/>the encouragement and increase of the number of
                    seamen; 3d, the restoring and preserving the discipline of the navy. His royal
                    highness submitted these points to such of the flag-officers and other
                    commanders as could be assembled, who made a report, of which the substance was
                    to the following effect :—Isí, To cause a general register to be kept of all
                    seafaring men in England and Ireland, for which they presented the draft of a
                    bill; 2d, that all marines qualified to act as seamen should be discharged from
                    the army, the officers to have levy money and the men’s clothing returned; 3rf,
                    that not fewer than 20,000 seamen should be kept in employ in time of peace. But
                    they observe, that as to the restoring and preserving the discipline of the
                    navy, no particular instance being laid before them wherein it was defective,
                    they could give no opinion on that head.</p>
                <p>This registry of seafaring men has been tried more than once; but as the men
                    themselves had no interest whatever in the measure, it always failed in
                    producing the desired effect. It is now under trial by act of parliament, with
                    great inducements for men to register and enter the naval service.</p>
                <p>In fact, there are now so many exemptions from the impress, that its severity is
                    greatly abated. The following descriptions of persons are protected by various
                    acts of parliament:</p>
                <p>Masters of merchant ships or vessels.</p>
                <p>First mates of such as are fifty tons or upwards.</p>
                <p>Boatswains and carpenters of such as are of 100 tons or upwards.</p>
                <p>Men belonging to vessels and craft of all kinds in the employment of navy,
                    victualling, ordnance, customs, excise, and post offices.</p>
                <p>Watermen belonging to the insurance offices within the cities of London and
                    Westminster.</p>
                <p>All men of the age of fifty-five years and upwards. All youths not having
                    attained the age of eighteen. All foreigners.</p>
                <p>Apprentices not having used the sea before the date of their indentures, and not
                    more than three years from the said date.</p>
                <p>Landsmen not having served at sea full two years.</p>
                <p>Masters, apprentices, one seaman, and one landsman, of all fishing vessels on the
                    sea coast or on navigable rivers.</p>
                <p>Harpooners, line-managers, and boat-steerers of the Greenland fishery and the
                    southern whale fishery; and all seamen and common mariners who have entered for
                    the said fisheries.</p>
                <p>And no person whatsoever can be impressed, except by an officer who has been
                    intrusted with a press-warrant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">j∙</hi> The discipline of the navy, or the government of his
                    majesty’s ships, vessels, and forces by sea, is regulated by the act of 22 Geo.
                    II., usually known by the name of the articles of war. By this act, the lords
                    commissioners of the admiralty are empowered to order courts-martial for all
                    offences mentioned therein, and committed by any person in and belonging to the
                    fleet and in full pay; and also to delegate the same power to admirals
                    commanding in chief on foreign stations, which power also may devolve on his
                    successor in case of death or recall, provided that no commandcr-in-chief of any
                    fleet or squadron, or detachment thereof, consisting of more than five ships,
                    shall preside at any court-martial in foreign parts, the officer next in command
                    being ordered to preside thereat.</p>
                <p>By this act, no court-martial can consist of more than thirteen or of less than
                    five persons, to be composed of such flag-officers, captains, or commanders,
                    then and there present, as are next in seniority to the officer who presides at
                    the court-martial. And when there are but three officers of the rank of
                    captains, the president is to call in as many commanders under that rank as will
                    make up five in the whole.</p>
                <p>This code of laws for the government of the fleet consists of thirty-six
                    articles, of which nine award the punishment of death, and eleven death or such
                    other punishment as the court-martial shall deem the offence to deserve. Those
                    which incur the former penalty are, the holding illegal correspondence with an
                    enemy; cowardice or neglect of duty in time of action; not pursuing the enemy;
                    desertion to the enemy; making mutinous assemblies; striking a superior officer;
                    burning magazines, vessels, &amp;c. not belonging to an enemy; murder; sodomy.
                    The penalty of death for cowardice, or other neglect of duty, in time of action
                    (art. 12), and of not pursuing the enemy (art. 13), was, by the 19th George III.
                    so far mitigated, as to authorize the court-martial “to pronounce sentence of
                    death, or to inflict such other punishment as the nature and degree of the
                    offence shall be found to deserve.” Under these articles thus mitigated, Admiral
                    Byng would probably not have been condemned to death. The other eleven articles,
                    which leave the punishment to the discretion of the court, are, not preparing
                    for fight, and encouraging the men in time of action; suppression of any letter
                    or message sent from an enemy; spies delivering letters, &amp;c. from an enemy;
                    relieving an enemy; disobedience of orders in time of action; discouraging the
                    men on various pretences; not taking care of and defending ships under convoy;
                    quarrelling with and disobeying a superior officer in the execution of his
                    office; wilfully neglecting the steering of ships; sleeping on watch, and
                    forsaking his station; robbery. The remaining sixteen articles incur the penalty
                    of dismission from the service, or from the ship, degradation of rank, or such
                    other punishment as the court may judge the nature and degree of the offence to
                    deserve.</p>
                <p>Much, however, of the internal discipline of a ship of war depends upon the
                    captain, who, being empowered to punish the men for minor offences, according to
                    the usage of the service, courts-martial on seamen are rarely found necessary to
                    be resorted to in well-regulated ships. The principal circumstance which usually
                    militates against the perfect good order of the crew, is the great allowance of
                    grog served out daily to the men, as established by the king’s order in council,
                    and which frequently leads to drunkenness, and this again to insubordination.
                    Perhaps half the punishments in the navy are for this offence, which it requires
                    the utmost vigilance and precautions on the part of the officers to prevent.</p>
                <p>In other respects the discipline of a well-organized ship of war is perfect; and
                    to this discipline Μ. Dupin, a French writer of great sagacity, mainly ascribes
                    the brilliant successes of the British navy, and to the want of it the ruin of
                    that of France. “We have already cited,” says he, “as a model, the management of
                    the <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> of the English ships. In the preservation of
                    this <hi rend="italic">materiel,</hi> in the stowing it away, in the arrangement
                    of whatever may be necessary either for manoeuvres or for action, the most
                    perfect regularity is observed. At the same time, what becoming austerity is
                    maintained by the commanding officer; what obedience amongst the subalterns;
                    and, in a space so limited, considering the number of men on board, and the
                    multiplicity of movements they have to make in obeying so many different orders,
                    what imposing silence. It is the calmness of strength, the presiding influence
                    of wisdom. In the midst of the most complicated operations, and even in the heat
                    and transport of battle, one hears only the words of command, pronounced and
                    repeated from rank to rank, with a measured tone and perfect <hi rend="italic"
                    >sang</hi><hi rend="italic">froid.</hi> No unseasonable advices, no murmurs, no
                    tumult. The commanders meditate in silence; the word is given, and the men act
                    without either speaking or thinking.”</p>
                <p>This is remarkably so in the day of battle. Every officer and man knows precisely
                    his place, and the duty he has to perform, on that day. By the general printed
                    in-structíons, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557593" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7593-0056"
                    />the captains of his majesty’s ships are required to accustom the men to
                    assemble at their proper quarters, to exercise them at the great guns, to teach
                    them to point, fire, &amp;c. under all circumstances of sea and weather. Indeed,
                    it is well known, that the preservation of the high character of the British
                    navy essentially depends on the proper training of the seamen to the expert
                    management of the guns, so as to be duly prepared in the day of battle; the
                    issue of which so mainly depends on the cool, steady, and regular manner in
                    which the ship’s ordnance is loaded, pointed, and fired. Practice in these
                    respects is much more necessary on board ships than on shore, as it can never
                    happen that the ship is entirely steady, and has most frequently a rolling or
                    pitching motion, for which allowances must be made, and which can only be made
                    with effect by long practice.</p>
                <p>If the management of the great guns of a ship of war is more difficult than the
                    artillery of a fort, so likewise are naval tactics more difficult than those of
                    an army; inasmuch as there is more difficulty and less dependence in placing and
                    directing the movements of an inanimate than an animate machine. The general
                    principles are the same; the object of both being that of bringing the greatest
                    possible force to bear on that point which is likely to produce the greatest
                    possible injury to the enemy. With this view, as well as to keep a fleet
                    together in compact order, so that straggling ships may not be cut off by the
                    enemy, it has been found necessary to preserve a certain order of sailing,
                    whether out of sight of an enemy or in his presence; and such an order as,
                    according to the state of the wind and weather, and the point of bearing of the
                    enemy’s fleet, may most conveniently and expeditiously be changed into such a
                    line of battle as the commander-in-chief may deem it most expedient to adopt in
                    the attack to be made on his opponent.</p>
                <p>In order to do this, it is obvious that every individual captain must be able to
                    know, under all circumstances, what the ship he commands will be able to do, in
                    order to preserve her station in the fleet; for it is with ships as with horses,
                    no two perhaps performing the same evolution with the same tightness of rein, or
                    the same quantity of sail. This shows the absolute necessity of a
                    commander-in-chief frequently exercising his fleet in naval tactics, and to
                    observe how such and such a ship will behave under a certain quantity of
                    canvass, and to assign her station in the line where she may appear calculated
                    to act with the greatest efficiency.</p>
                <p>To facilitate these movements, the admirals commanding squadrons are considered
                    as responsible for the movement of the ships in their respective divisions. They
                    are to see that each captain strictly obeys the general order; and if any one is
                    perceived to neglect his duty, whether belonging to his proper division or not,
                    if in action, he has the power to send immediately another officer to suspend
                    him. And in order that no confusion may arise, if, in time of battle, the
                    admiral commanding in chief, or any of the admirals commanding squadrons, should
                    be killed, his or their flags remain flying till the battle is decided. If the
                    commander-in-chief be killed or severely wounded, a private signal is made to
                    the second in command; or if a junior admiral be killed or wounded, the
                    commander-in-chief is also acquainted by signal.</p>
                <p>This silent method of communicating what is going on • is the perfection of naval
                    tactics; indeed it is very difficult to conceive how our ancestors contrived to
                    manage a fleet without a code of signals. For great and important occasions, the
                    exhibition of a flag or flags, in some particular part of the ship, might be
                    generally understood to imply that the fleet should anchor, or tack, or form the
                    order of sailing in two lines, or the line of battle, or some other great
                    movement. The hoisting of a cask at the yard-arm might be understood to imply a
                    want of water; or a hatchet, of wood; or an empty bag, of bread; and the
                    table-cloth was a very significant invitation to dinner; but they had no means
                    of interchanging freely their wants or intentions, or of conveying detailed
                    intelligence. Even so late as the American war, there was no established code of
                    signals in the navy. An anecdote is told of Admiral Geary, who, in the year
                    1780, commanded the Channel fleet, which clearly proves how little was then
                    known or practised in the way of signals. His captain, Kempenfelt, had laboured
                    long to improve the defective system; and having one day seen the enemy’s fleet,
                    he endeavoured to communicate the intelligence by the new code; but in the hurry
                    of making sail and giving chase, the signals somehow or other were not
                    understood by the rest of the fleet. Geary at last became impatient, and,
                    running up to Kempenfelt, seized him by the hand, and exclaimed with great
                    emphasis, “Now, my dear Kempy, do, for God’s sake, throw your signals overboard,
                    and make the old one, which we all understand,—‘ to bring the enemy to close
                    action.”’</p>
                <p>“If an admiral,” says Dr Beatson in his able Memoirs, “cannot command all the
                    necessary movements of his ships by signal in the day of battle, he is not upon
                    a footing with an enemy who possesses that advantage; and, even with better
                    ships and better men, and more experienced commanders, he may be foiled in his
                    expectations of victory, if not defeated, from his want of the means to direct
                    and to perform the necessary evolutions of his fleet.” “In no fight,” he adds,
                    “was the insufficiency of the present system of naval signals more conspicuous
                    than in this (Keppel’s unfortunate action); and it is to be hoped that if ever a
                    new code be adopted for the use of the royal navy, it may be so clear and
                    comprehensive, that such fatal errors as those which have been pointed out will
                    in future be prevented.” This, we may now say, has been accomplished.</p>
                <p>The idea of <hi rend="italic">numbering</hi> the flags, and of assigning a
                    certain number of corresponding sentences to certain combinations of these
                    numbers, was reduced to something approaching a regular system in the fleet
                    under the command of Lord Howe*; and in the year 1798 a new signal-book was
                    issued from the admiralty, containing about 400 sentences, expressive of certain
                    operations of a fleet, communicated by means of flags to which the numerical
                    characters were applied; and these, as far as they went, answered very well, but
                    did not supersede the necessity of conveying orders by boats on many occasions.
                    The following year Sir Home Popham suggested the idea of making the flags to
                    represent the letters of the alphabet in combination with numbers, which not
                    only added immensely to the means of communication, but also of making use of
                    words by signal. From this time improvements in the modes of communicating by
                    signals and telegraphs were rapidly introduced, particularly in the shape and
                    the colours of the flags, according to a plan of Sir Home Popham, which has
                    rendered signals by flags as nearly perfect as they probably ever will be.</p>
                <p>There is, however, an imperfection in the flags themselves; as in calm weather,
                    when they do not fly out, neither their shape nor colour is visible without the
                    use of stretchers, which are not always easily managed, and never without loss
                    of time. Again, if the wind be parallel to the line of vision, the flag shows
                    only its edge, and neither shape nor colour can be discerned. To remedy these
                    inconveniences, Sir Home Popham proposed a portable wooden semaphore, in
                    imitation of the French telegraph, to be mounted on the quarter-deck or poop of
                    a ship.</p>
                <p>It consists of two posts, each having a moveable arm, which may be placed in four
                    positions that can never be mistaken, being at right angles to each other; and
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557606" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7606-0057"/>number
                    annexed to each position is that which it conveys to the person receiving the
                    message.</p>
                <p>The encouragement afforded by government to every branch of science connected
                    with the navy, and navigation in general, has been carried much farther by
                    England than by any other European nation, and has produced the happiest results
                    for commercial enterprise, by determining with accuracy the precise position of
                    ships, by shortening long voyages, and by the discovery of new lands and
                    unexplored regions. From the commencement of the eighteenth century, when a
                    national reward was first offered to the man of science, or the artist, who
                    should discover a method sufficiently exact to determine the longitude of a
                    ship’s place at sea, to the present time, the improvements in the construction
                    and division of all kinds of instruments for measuring angles, in the
                    calculations of lunar and other tables, and, above all, in the manufacture and
                    adjustments of chronometers, have continued in gradual progression, and may now
                    be considered as having arrived at such a degree of perfection, more especially
                    the chronometers, that the discovery of the longitude can scarcely be said to
                    remain a desideratum. We may form an idea what the progress in the improvement
                    of chronometers has been, when a public reward was offered by parliament in the
                    year 1814, to the first who should determine the longitude at sea <hi
                    rend="italic">within a degree</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in 1820, three
                    chronometers, after remaining in the arctic regions for eighteen months,
                    returned to England without altering their rates more than a few seconds of
                    time.</p>
                <p>: The officers of the royal navy are much more generally versed in the sciences
                    of late years than they were heretofore. In fact, it is now necessary for a
                    young man to be well acquainted with a certain portion of mathematical and
                    astronomical knowledge, to enable him to pass an examination, without which he
                    cannot be qualified for the commission of a lieutenant. The examinations also of
                    the several warrant-officers, and their qualifications for their respective
                    stations, are more strictly attended to than heretofore; and the consequence is,
                    that a much better system of discipline without rigour is established throughout
                    the fleet, and more comfort in every respect to every class of officers and men
                    employed.</p>
                <p>The encouragement given to the navy from its first regular establishment has
                    marked it as a favourite service <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the minds of
                    the public. The sea-pay, the half-pay, and other emoluments, have generally been
                    superior to those enjoyed by the army, but subject to great fluctuations in
                    every reign, and to frequent changes in the same reign. Thus King William, in
                    1693, gave to an admiral L.4 a day, a vice-admiral L.3, and a rear-admiral L.2,
                    which, with the compensation for servants, amounted to more than their present
                    pay; yet their allowances were still further increased in 1700, till a reduction
                    took place in consequence of an address from the Commons. From this time till
                    the year 1806 very little alteration took place, when a small addition was made
                    to the pay of each class.</p>
                <p>The following table will exhibit, at one view, the complete war-establishment of
                    commissioned, warrant, petty, and non-commissioned officers, seamen, and
                    marines, on board every class of his majesty’s ships, with the rate of pay
                    granted to each, and the classes into which they are divided for the
                    distribution of prize-money or seizures; as established by his majesty’s order
                    in council of the 25th November 1816.</p>

                <p>Though the navy, as we have seen, was put upon a regular establishment under the
                    reign of Henry VIII., neither officers nor seamen received any pay or emolument
                    in time of peace, until the reign of Charles H., when, in 1668, certain
                    allowances were made to flag-officers and their captains out of the L.200,000 a
                    year voted for the whole naval service; and in 1674, certain other allowances
                    were granted, by order in council, to captains who had commanded ships of the
                    first and second rate, and to the second captains to flag-officers, on the
                    ground, as assigned in the preamble, that they had undergone the brunt of the
                    war, without sharing in the incident advantages of it, as prizes, convoys, and
                    such like, which the commanders of the smaller classes of ships had enjoyed. But
                    the first regular establishment of half-pay for all flag-officers, captains,
                    first-lieutenants, and masters, was by King William, in the year 1693, provided
                    they had served a year in their respective qualities, or had been in a general
                    engagement with the enemy. A regular established half-pay was further sanctioned
                    by an order in council of Queen Anne in 1700; the conditions of which were, that
                    no officer should enjoy the benefit thereof who had absented himself without
                    permission of the lord high admiral or lords commissioners of the admiralty, or
                    who had been dismissed for any misdemeanour, or by court-martial, or who had not
                    behaved himself to the satisfaction of the lord high admiral, or who should have
                    leisure to go out of his majesty’s dominions, if employed in the merchant
                    service or otherwise, or who enjoyed the benefit of any public employment. Since
                    the above period the rate of half-pay to the several officers of the navy has
                    undergone various modifications. At present it stands thus: <pb break="no"

                <p>In point of half-pay and other pecuniary emoluments, the navy has much the
                    advantage over the army, more particularly in the chance of prize-money, which
                    but seldom falls to the share of the army, except on some conjoint expedition.
                    On the commencement of a war a proclamation is issued by the king, directing
                    that the net produce of all prizes taken by any of his ships of war shall be for
                    the entire benefit and encouragement of the flag-officers, captains, commanders,
                    and other commissioned officers, and of the seamen, marines, and soldiers on
                    board at the time of the capture; and directing also in what manner the
                    distribution shall be made. Many very handsome, and, in some instances, very
                    splendid fortunes, have been made by captures of the enemy’s ships.</p>
                <p>Another great encouragement for young men to enter the naval service arises from
                    the honours bestowed by the sovereign for any brilliant exploit. Thus, in
                    consequence of the skill and bravery which were exhibited in the great and
                    glorious action of the 1st of June 1794, his majesty was graciously pleased to
                    confer on Earl Howe the order of the garter; Admirals Graves and Sir Alexander
                    Hood were made barons of the kingdom of Ireland; and Rear-admirals Bowyer,
                    Gardner, and Pasley, together with Sir Roger Curtis, captain of the Queen
                    Charlotte, were created baronets. Gold medals and chains were also distributed
                    to such admirals, and gold medals to such captains, as were particularized in
                    Lord Howe’s despatches. The first lieutenants of each ship were promoted to the
                    rank of commanders; and pensions of L.1000 per annum were granted to
                    Rear-admirals Bowyer and Pasley, in consideration of the loss of limbs.</p>
                <p>For the action of 14th of February 1797, Lord St Vincent was advanced to the
                    dignity of an earl, and a pension was granted to him of L.3000 a year;
                    Vice-admirals Thompson and Parker were created baronets; Commodore Nelson
                    received the order of the bath, and Captain Calder of the Victory the honour of
                    knighthood; and gold medals were distributed to the admirals and captains.</p>
                <p>For the action of the 11 th of October 1797, Admiral Duncan was created a
                    viscount, with a pension of L.2000 a year; Vice-admiral Onslow was made a
                    baronet; and Captain Fairfax had the honour of knighthood. Gold medals were also
                    distributed to the admirals and captains.</p>
                <p>For the action of the 1st of August 1798, his majesty was pleased to testify his
                    sense of the importance of this brilliant achievement, by raising Sir Horatio
                    Nelson to the dignity of the peerage, by the title of Baron Nelson of the Nile;
                    and by directing medals to be distributed to the captains. The first lieutenant
                    of the Majestic was made a captain, and the first lieutenants of the other ships
                    were <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557697" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7697-0064"/>promoted
                    to the rank of commanders. And for the attack of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen,
                    Lord Nelson was raised to the dignity of a viscount, and the order of the bath
                    was conferred on Admiral Graves.</p>
                <p>For the ever memorable action of Trafalgar, in which Lord Nelson fell in the arms
                    of victory, his majesty was pleased to confer upon his brother the rank of earl,
                    with a pension of L.5000 a year; and the sum of L.120,000 was voted by
                    parliament for the purchase of an estate to be annexed to the title. Admiral
                    Collingwood was raised to the dignity of baron; Lord Northesk was honoured with
                    the order of the bath, and Captain Hardy was created a baronet. The captains
                    received medals; five lieutenants were made captains, and twenty-four,
                    commanders; twenty-two midshipmen were made lieutenants; and the senior captain
                    of marines was made brevet-major.</p>
                <p>By this last act of Lord Nelson’s life was annihilated the only remaining hope of
                    the combined navies of France and Spain, and a blow given to the naval power of
                    the enemies of Great Britain, which they never recovered during the remainder of
                    the war.</p>
                <p>In the secondary victories of Sir John Warren, Sir John Duckworth, Sir Robert
                    Calder, Sir Richard Strachan, Lord Gambier, and Lord Exmouth, and even for
                    brilliant actions of single ships, appropriate distinctions have never been
                    withheld. Exclusive of peerages and baroneteies, the honours bestowed for
                    gallant conduct in the naval service consist of twenty-five grand crosses of the
                    bath, seventy knights commanders, and 130 companions of the bath.</p>
                <p>The provision which is made for officers, in the event •of losing a limb, or
                    being so severely wounded in the service that the prejudice to the habit of body
                    is equal to the loss of a limb, is another encouragement for entering the naval
                    service.</p>

                <p>In addition to these pensions, there has been established a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compassionate Fund,</hi> for the relief of such widows and orphan children as
                    may appear to be proper objects of compassion. The sums annually required are
                    voted by parliament, and at present are limited to L. 14,000 a year.</p>
                <p>Pensions to petty officers and seamen are, granted by the board of admiralty for
                    wounds, infirmities, and length of service; and the sum required for this

                <p>The establishment of Greenwich Hospital embraced much more extensive objects. The
                    first idea of this noble institution, the glory and ornament of the kingdom, has
                    been ascribed, with every appearance of justice, to Mary, the consort of William
                    III. Being desirous that our gallant seamen, worn down by age or infirmities, as
                    well, as suffering from wounds, should not be left destitute, she made a <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> grant, jointly with King William, of the palace of
                    Greenwich, and of certain lands adjoining, to be appropriated to this purpose,
                    in order, as stated in the king’s commission, to “the making some competent
                    provision, that seamen, who, by age, wounds, or other accidents, shall become
                    disabled for further service at sea, and shall not be in a condition to maintain
                    themselves comfortably, may not fall under hardships and miseries, but may be
                    supported at the public charge; and that the children of such disabled seamen,
                    and also the widowsand children of such seamen as shall happen to be slain in
                    sea service, may, in some reasonable manner, be provided for and educated.” In
                    1695, the committee appointed to examine and report on the premises recommended
                    an additional wing to King Charles’s building, which being approved by the king,
                    Sir Christopher Wren undertook to superintend the new erections without any pay
                    or reward. Since that time various additions and improvements have been made to
                    this magnificent pile of building, which was completed very nearly as it now
                    appears, in the year 1778.</p>
                <p>The king granted L.2000 a year towards the carrying on, perfecting, and endowing
                    of this hospital. The great officers of state and wealthy individuals also
                    subscribed liberally to the undertaking. It was at the same time enacted by
                    parliament, that a deduction of sixpence per man per month should be made out of
                    the wages of all mariners for the use of the hospital; and power was given to
                    the lord high admiral to appoint commissioners for receiving the said duty,
                    whose office is situated on Tower Hill. These deductions no longer exist, and
                    the establishment has been broken up. In 1699 his majesty contributed the sum of
                    L.19,500, being fines laid by the House of Lords on certain merchants convicted
                    of smuggling. In 1705 Queen Anne assigned to the use of the hospital the effects
                    of Kid the pirate, amounting to upwards of L.6000. In 1707, Robert Osbaldiston,
                    Esq. devised by will half of his estate, which was valued at L.20,000. In the
                    same year Anthony Bowyer gave the reversion of a considerable estate for the use
                    of the hospital. By several statutes, the forfeited and unclaimed shares of
                    prize-money were given to the hospital, and various grants, from time to time,
                    continued to be made by parliament. But the most substantial grant was that made
                    by the Commons, of the rents and profits of the forfeited estates of the Earl of
                    Derwentwater, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557710" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7710-0065"
                    />amounting at that time to about L.6000 a year, and at present to the gross
                    rental of L.60,000, of which, after payment of all expenses for improvements,
                    repairs,’collections, and incumbrances, the annual receipt may be estimated at
                    from L.30,000 to L.40,000.</p>
                <p>At present the permanent revenues of the hospital consist of the following
                    heads:</p>
                <p>1. The duties arising from the North and South Foreland light-houses.</p>
                <p>2. The rents and profits of the Derwentwater estates, including the lead
                    mines.</p>
                <p>3. Rents of the market of Greenwich, and of certain houses there and in
                    London.</p>
                <p>4. Interest of money invested in the public funds.</p>
                <p>5. Forfeited and unclaimed shares of prize-money.</p>
                <p>6. Fines for various offences.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the funds of the establishment must vary considerably in times
                    of war and peace; being lowest in the latter period, when the demands are
                    heaviest upon it, especially for a certain number of years after the close of a
                    war.</p>
                <p>The rental of the estates belonging to the hospital in the counties of
                    Northumberland, Cumberland, and Durham, rose from L.23,000 in 1805, to L.43,000
                    in 1816. The present gross rental of these estates and the lead mines, as above
                    stated, amounts to about L.60,000, the North and South Foreland lights to
                    L.7000, and the interest of funded property to L.50,000; making, with other
                    contingencies, an annual revenue of about L.150,000, the whole of which is
                    expended on the household establishment, the clothing, maintenance, and
                    allowances to pensioners and other attendants, with repairs, taxes, and
                    contingencies.</p>
                <p>The establishment of this noble institution consists of a governor, who is a
                    flag-officer in the navy, lieutenant-governor, four captains, and eight
                    lieutenants, all resident within the hospital; a treasurer, auditor, paymaster
                    of pensions, secretary, clerk of the check, two chaplains, two physicians, three
                    surgeons, two dispensers, steward, clerk of the works, and several clerks. The
                    number of in-pensioners is about 3000, and the number of nurses 180, all of whom
                    must be the widows of seamen of the navy, and under the age of forty-five years
                    at the time of admission.</p>

                <p>The out-pensions to seamen were first established in the year 1763, by act of 3d
                    Geo. III. ch. 16, in consequence of which 1400 out-pensioners were appointed at
                    L.7 per annum each, after undergoing an examination at the admiralty as to their
                    claims.</p>
                <p>At the close of the long revolutionary war, the applications became so numerous,
                    and the claims of the seamen who had been wounded or worn out in the service so
                    strongly grounded in humanity and justice, that it became necessary to adopt a
                    scale of pensions, and to establish certain rules and regulations, by which
                    seamen of his majesty’s fleet and royal marines should be remunerated for wounds
                    or hurts, debility, and length of service. The following are the
                    regulations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">For Wounds, Hurts, or Debility.</hi></p>
                <p>Every seaman, landman, boy, or royal marine, wounded or hurt in his majesty’s
                    service, is entitled to a pension proportioned to his wounds or hurts, of not
                    less than sixpence a day, and not more than one shilling and sixpence a day.,
                    For sickness or debility, after seven years’ service, and under special
                    circumstances before that period, of not less than fivepence a day, nor more
                    than tenpence, according as he may appear capable of assisting himself. Beyond
                    fourteen, and less than twenty one years’ service, not less than eightpence, nor
                    more than one shilling and threepence. And after twenty-one years’ service, one
                    shilling and sixpence a day. But the rates are altered from time to time.</p>
                <p>All the above-mentioned pensions may be forfeited by misconduct, by desertion,
                    and by sentence of a court-martial; also by neglecting or omitting to attend at
                    such port or place, and at such time, as shall, in time of war, or in prospect
                    of a war, be appointed for the assembling of the pensioners, by the lords
                    commissioners of the admiralty.</p>
                <p>To the noble institution of Greenwich" Hospital is appended an asylum for the
                    maintenance and education of the children of officers and seamen of his
                    majesty’s naval service.</p>
                <p>The Naval Asylum was originally instituted by the Patriotic Fund and private
                    subscriptions, and afterwards established at Greenwich, by warrant under the
                    king’s sign-manual, dated in January 1818, appointing the lords commissioners of
                    the admiralty to be commissioners and governors, who, with twenty-four
                    directors, were to superintend and manage the same. The object was, the
                    maintenance and education of a certain number of orphans and other children of
                    the non-commissioned officers, seamen, and marines of the royal navy. As it was
                    manifest, however, that this establishment, so contiguous to the hospital of
                    Greenwich, could be managed without inconvenience by the commissioners and
                    directors of that hospital, under a more effective and economical system, his
                    majesty was pleased, by his warrant of January 1821, to annul the former
                    warrant, and to vest the superintendence and internal management of the said
                    asylum in the commissioners and governors of Greenwich Hospital.</p>
                <p>The two schools of Greenwich Hospital and the Naval Asylum, and the funds
                    thereof, are now therefore incorporated. The internal management is confided to
                    the board of directors, and one of the captains of the hospital is intrusted
                    with the general superintendence. A chaplain, and proper schoolmasters,
                    schooloustresses, matron, and inferior assistants, male and female, with
                    moderate salaries, reside in the building. The number of children maintained and
                    educated in the institution are,</p>

                <p>To the upper school no boys are admitted but the sons of seamen and marines,
                    slain, drowned, or dead; those of pensioners in the hospital; of seamen
                    disabled, past their labour, or otherwise objects of charity; and of officers in
                    the navy and marines, on the production of a required certificate of poverty.
                    The age of admission is from eleven to twelve, and the continuance in the school
                    three years, at the expiration of which they are bound apprentices to the
                    merchant service. Presentations by the directors in rotation.</p>
                <p>The boys and girls of the lower school are the children of seamen and marines of
                    the naval service, admitted by the board of directors, giving a preference to
                    orphans. The age of admission is from nine to twelve years inclusive; but none
                    is retained beyond the age of fourteen. The boys are sent into the navy, or
                    merchant service, or put apprentices to some trade. The girls, at the age of
                    fourteen, are apprenticed to trades, or sent to service.</p>

                <p>Thus all the classes of officers, seamen, and marines, who have faithfully served
                    in the navy, are provided for by the state; and the children of such as may be
                    in indigent circumstances receive an education at the public expense, suited to
                    their condition in life.</p>
                <p>The total expense of the navy, including every branch of the service, civil and
                    military, for one whole year, about the middle of the last war, may be estimated
                    at about L.18,000,000. In the year 1822, according to the estimates which were
                    laid before parliament, it amounted to about L.5,000,000; and in the year 1837
                    it has been fixed at the sum of L.4,663,000. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.)</hi></p>
