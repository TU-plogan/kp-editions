                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NOAH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Noach</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Noe</hi></label>, the son of Lamech, was born in the year of
                    the world 1056. Amidst the general corruption into which all mankind had at this
                    time fallen, Noah alone was found to be just and perfect in his generation,
                    walking with God. This extraordinary person having therefore found favour in the
                    sight of Heaven, the Almighty, seeing that all flesh had corrupted their ways,
                    told Noah that he was resolved to destroy mankind from the face of the earth by
                    a flood of waters; and not them alone, but all the beasts of the earth, and
                    every creeping thing, as well as the fowls of the air. The Lord therefore
                    directed Noah, as a means of preserving himself and his family (for he had three
                    sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who were all married before the Flood), to build
                    an ark or vessel of a certain form and size fitted to that end, and which might
                    besides accommodate such numbers of animals of all sorts, that were liable to
                    perish in the Flood, as would be sufficient to preserve the several species, and
                    again to replenish the earth.</p>
                <p>In the year of the world 1656, being the six hundredth of his age, Noah, by God’s
                    appointment, entered the ark, together with his wife, his three sons, their
                    wives, and all the animals which God had caused to come to him; and being all
                    entered, and the door <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the ark being shut down from,
                    the outside, the waters of the Deluge began to fall upon the earth, and
                    increased in such a manner that they were fifteen cubits above the tops of the
                    highest mountains, and continued thus upon the earth for 150 days; so that
                    whatever had life upon the earth, or in the air, was destroyed, except such as
                    were with Noah in the ark. But the Lord remembering Noah, sent a wind upon the
                    earth, which caused the waters to subside; so that upon the seventeenth day of
                    the seventh month the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat; and Noah having
                    uncovered the roof of the ark, and observing that the earth was dry, he received
                    orders from the Lord to come out of it, with all the animals that were therein.
                    This he did in the six hundred and first year of his age, on the 27th day of the
                    second month. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deluge.</hi></p>
                <p>Then Noah offered as a burnt sacrifice to the Lord one of all the pure animals
                    that were in the ark; and the Lord accepted his sacrifice, and said to him that
                    he would no more pour out his curse upon the whole earth, nor any more destroy
                    all the animals, as he had now done. He gave Noah power over all the brute
                    creation, and permitted him to eat of them, as well as of the herbs and fruits
                    of the earth; excepting only the blood of animals, the use of which God did not
                    allow him. He bade him increase and multiply, made a covenant with him, and
                    engaged no more to send an universal deluge upon the earth; and as a memorial of
                    his promise, he set his bow in the clouds, to be as a pledge of the covenant
                    which he had made with Noah.</p>
                <p>Noah, being an husbandman, began now to cultivate the vine; and having made wine
                    and drank thereof, he unwarily became intoxicated, and falling asleep in his
                    tent, happened to uncover himself in an indecent posture. Ham, the father of
                    Canaan, having observed him in this condition, made sport with his father, and
                    acquainted his two brothers, who were without, of the exposure of thepatriarch
                    But they, instead of making it a matter of sport, turned away from it, and going
                    backwards, they covered their father’s nakedness, by throwing a mantle over him.
                    Noah awaking, and knowing what Ham had done, said that Canaan the son of Ham
                    should be accursed, that he should be a slave of slaves in respect of his
                    brethren. It is thought he had a mind to spare the person of his son Ham, for
                    fear the curse might light upon the other children of Ham, who had had no part
                    in this action. He cursed Canaan by a spirit of prophecy, because the
                    Canaanites, his descendants, were afterwards to be rooted out by the Israelites.
                    Noah added, Let the Lord, the God of Shem, be blessed, and let Canaan be the
                    servant of Shem. And he was so in effect, in the person of the Canaanites
                    subdued by the Hebrews. Lastly, Noah said, Let God extend the possession of
                    Japheth; let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.
                    This prophecy had its accomplishment, when the Grecians, and afterwards the
                    Romans, being descended from Japheth, made a conquest of Asia, which formed the
                    portion of Shem.'</p>
                <p>But Noah lived yet after the Deluge three hundred and fifty years; and the whole
                    duration of his life having been nine hundred and fifty years, he died in the
                    year of the world 2006. He left three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, of whom
                    mention is made under their several names; and, according to the common opinion,
                    he divided the whole world amongst them, in order that it might be repeopled. To
                    Shem he gave Asia, to Ham Africa, and to Japheth Europe. Some will have it,
                    that, besides these three sons, he had several others. The spurious Berosus
                    assigns him thirty, called Titans, from the name of their mother. It is also
                    pretended that the Teutons or Germans are derived from a son of Noah called
                    Thuiscon. Methodius likewise mentions Jonithus or Jonicus, a pretended son of
                    Noah.</p>
                <p>St Peter calls Noah a preacher of righteousness, because before the Deluge he was
                    incessantly preaching and declaring to men, not only by his discourses, but by
                    his blameless life, and by the building of the ark, in which he was employed six
                    score years, that the wrath of God was ready to descend upon them. But his
                    preaching had no effect, since, when the Deluge came, it found mankind plunged
                    in all their former enormities.</p>
                <p>Several learned men have observed, that the Heathens confounded Saturn,
                    Deucalion, Ogyges, the god Coelus or Uranus, Janus, Proteus, Prometheus, and
                    others, with Noah. The wife of Noah is called Noriah by the Gnostics; and the
                    fable of Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha is manifestly a corruption of the history
                    of Noah.</p>
