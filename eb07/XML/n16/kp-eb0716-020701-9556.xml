                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NICOLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    French moralist and theologian, the nephew of Claude Nicoe, a French poet, and
                    one of the most illustrious writers of the Port-Royal, was born at Chartres in
                    October 1625. His father, John Nicoe, having a perfect knowledge of the ancient
                    languages, instructed him in the elements of grammar, and initiated him so
                    thoroughly in the classics, that at the age of fourteen he had completed his
                    preliminary studies, and read the best works in Greek and in Latin. He then
                    proceeded to Paris, where he commenced a course of philosophy and theology, and
                    at the same time applied to the study of Hebrew; but the weakness of his sight,
                    occasioned by excessive application, obliged him to abandon this pursuit, in
                    which he had already made great progress. Having completed his course of
                    theology, and received the degree of bachelor, he was preparing to take his
                    license, when the troubles which broke out in the university, on the subject of
                    the famous propositions of Jansenius, forced him to defer the accomplishment of
                    this object. Being attached by gratitude and esteem to the inmates of the
                    Port-Royal, he passed several years in that house, occupied in teaching the
                    belles-lettres. But, in 1655, he returned to Paris to labour under the direction
                    of Dr Arnauld, with whom he was united by the ties of the most intimate
                    friendship; and, desiring to live altogether unknown amidst the bustle of the
                    capital, he took the name of Rosny. The advancement of Jansenism appears to have
                    furnished the motive that induced him to undertake a journey which he made into
                    Germany, in the course of the year 1658; and whilst there, he not only
                    translated into Latin the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Provinciales,</hi> in the
                    composition of which he had participated, but published them, accompanied with
                    very virulent notes. He soon returned, however, to join Arnauld; and they
                    retired together to Chatillon, where they applied themselves to the preparation
                    of different writings. Nicoe, although he did not entirely adopt the opinions of
                    the Jansenists, made frequent excursions to Port-Royal, Paris, and the
                    neighbouring provinces, in the interest of that party; but in these he acted
                    with extreme circumspection, not choosing, as he himself observed, to play any
                    part in,civil wars. Being warmly solicited by his friends to enter into holy
                    orders, he at length resolved to demand ordination of the Bishop of Chartres, in
                    whose diocese he resided. But that prelate refused to ordain him, no doubt by
                    reason of his connections with the Port-Royal. He continued undisturbed at Paris
                    until the year 1677, when a <hi rend="italic">Lettre,</hi> which he wrote in the
                    names of the Bishops of St Pons and Arras, on the laxity of the casuists, raised
                    such a storm against him, that he was obliged to withdraw from the capital. For
                    some time he remained concealed in the environs of Chartres and of Beauvais; but
                    the death of the Duchess of Longueville, the most ardent protectress of
                    Jansenism, having decided him to quit France, where he did not consider himself
                    as any longer safe, he left the kingdom, and took refuge successively at
                    Brussels, the Abbey of Orval, and Liège, frequently changing his name and the
                    place of his retreat, and believing himself incessantly exposed to the
                    machinations of his enemies. At length, by the intercession of Μ. de Harlay, the
                    archbishop of Paris, he obtained permission to return secretly to Chartres, and
                    soon afterwards to fix his residence at Paris, where he resumed his ordinary
                    occupations; and it was then that he completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essais</hi><hi rend="italic">de Morale,</hi> a work which is less read than
                    esteemed, and which stamped his reputation as a writer. In the last years of his
                    life he mingled in the dispute about Quietism, and took the part of Bossuet
                    against Fénélon, but with wisdom and moderation. Having for some time been
                    deprived of the use of his hands, he was meditating alone in his cabinet when he
                    was suddenly struck with apoplexy. The tidings soon spread in the capital, and
                    the crowd of persons who hurried to visit the pious cenobite proved the high
                    consideration which he enjoyed. Racine, being reconciled to his master, came in
                    a diligence, bringing a medicine <hi rend="italic">(gouttes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Angleterre)</hi> which for a moment
                    revived him; but the resuscitation was soon succeeded by a relapse, and he died
                    two days afterwards, on the 16th of November 1695, at the age of seventy. He had
                    given orders that he should be interred without any ceremony; but his will, in
                    this particular, was not respected, and his remains were accompanied to the
                    grave by the most distinguished men of the time.</p>
                <p>Nicoe, being of a simple and ingenuous character, evinced during his whole life
                    the timidity of an infant. Nothing was more easy than to embarrass him in
                    discussion; an objection which he had not foreseen entirely disconcerted him.
                    Speaking of Tréville, one of his friends, he said, “Tréville beats me in the
                    chamber; but before he reaches the foot of the stair I confute him.” In the last
                    year of his life he seldom went abroad, being afraid that, in passing along the
                    streets, a tile would fall upon his head. He had also a great dread of
                    travelling, and particularly of aquatic excursions. During a long period he had
                    relegated himself to the faubourg Saint-Marcel; and when asked the reason of
                    this, he replied, “It is because the enemies who menace Paris will probably
                    enter by the gate of Saint Martin, and consequently will be obliged to traverse
                    the whole city before reaching the place where I live.” But, with all this
                    simplicity and timidity, Nicoe had a reach and an accuracy of thought which were
                    altogether admirable. He equalled the best dialecticians, in the order, the
                    method, the sequence, and the depth of his ideas; but as his object in all his
                    works was rather to prove than to please, his style, although remarkable for its
                    purity and clearness, often fatigues by its dryness and monotony. “On quitte ses
                    <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi> sans peine,” says Palissot; “on y revient sans
                    plaisir, parce que les lecteurs ont besoin d’être flattés.” Nicoe attempted
                    panegyric, but soon found that he had no talent for a species of composition
                    which requires invention and warmth of style.</p>
                <p>A list of the works of Nicoe will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi>
                    of Niceron (tome xxix.), at the end of his Life by the Abbé Goujet, and also in
                    the Dictionary of Moreri. The following are the principal, viz. 1. Epigrammatum
                    Delectus ex omnibus tum veteribus tum recentioribus Poëtis, cum Dissertatione de
                    vera Pulchritudine, Paris, 1659, in 12mo; 2. La Perpétuité de la Foi de l’Eglise
                    Catholique, touchant l’Eucharistie, Paris, 1664, in 12mo, called <hi
                    rend="italic">la Petite Perpétuité,</hi> to distinguish it from the great work
                    which bears the same title; 3. Traité de la Foi Humaine, Paris, 1664, in 4to, a
                    work in which Arnauld had some share; 4. Les Imaginaires et les Visionaires, ou
                    Lettres sur l’Hérésie Imaginaire, Liège, 1667, in two vols. 12mo; 5. La
                    Perpétuité de la Foi de l’Eglise Catholique, touchant l’Eucharistie, Paris,
                    1669-1676, in three vols. 4to, a masterpiece of reasoning, which appeared under
                    the name of his friend Arnauld; 6. Essais de Morale, et Instructions
                    Théologiques, Paris, 1671-1672, in twenty-five vols. 12mo; 7. De l’Unité de
                    l’Eglise, ou Réfutation du Nouveau Système de Jurieu, Paris, 1687, in 12mo. The
                    last writings of Nicoe turn upon the system of general grace, which he
                    supported, to the no small displeasure of most of his friends. The consequence
                    was a controversy, which appears to have produced some coldness on both sides.
                    Arnauld, in his Letters (tome vii.), expresses himself with much force on the
                    subject; and Quesnel complained warmly to Nicoe of this species of defection on
                    his part. The various pieces produced in this dispute will be found in a
                    collection of writings on general grace, published by Fouillon in 1715, with a
                    long preface; and a curious analysis of the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Grace</hi><hi rend="italic">Générale</hi> will be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi> of the Dictionary of Richelet.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559569" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9569-0208"/>
                <p>Nicoe had a large share in the <hi rend="italic">Méthodes Grecques et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Latines,</hi> and also in the excellent treatise on Logic, known
                    under the name of the Port-Royal. The life of this able and laborious writer has
                    been written by the Abbé Goujet, who is, however, more of a panegyrist than a
                    biographer; by Besoigne, in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Port-Royal</hi> (tome iv.); and also by Saverien, in his <hi rend="italic"
