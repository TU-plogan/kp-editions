                <p><label type="entry">NORTHUMBERLAND</label>, an extensive county in England,
                    situated on its northern extremity, upon the borders of Scotland, from which it
                    is separated partly by the river Tweed, which, during the latter part of its
                    course, flows between this county and Berwickshire, and partly by a line
                    supposed to be drawn over the mountainous region on the west and north-west,
                    where it meets with Roxburghshire. The other boundaries are the German Ocean on
                    the east, Durham on the south, Cumberland on the west, and on the north two
                    small districts called Norhamshire and Islandshire, which, though belonging by
                    their situation to Northumberland, form a part of the county of Durham, along
                    with another tract called Bedlingtonshire, on the southeast. But in a general
                    description it is unnecessary to attend to these distinctions. The Tweed may,
                    therefore, be considered as the northern boundary of the county, and in this
                    case it will include the towns of Berwick and Norham. Lindisfarne or Holy
                    Island, on the north-east cdast, which in like manner belongs to Durham, is
                    situated about two miles from the mainland, opposite to the mouth of the brook
                    Lindis, and accessible to all kinds of conveyance at low water. Although about
                    nine miles ’ in circuit, it contains, little more than 1000 acres, the half of
                    which is sand-banks. These several portions may extend to something more than
                    100 square miles, or about one twentieth part of the whole. In this view,
                    Northumberland is situated between 54. 51. and 55. 48. north latitude, and
                    between 1. and 2. 27. west longitude from London. Its greatest extent from north
                    tα south is sixty-four miles, and from east to west it varies from about
                    forty-six miles, which is its usual breadth between the river Tyne on the south
                    and the Coquet on the north, till it terminates at the town of Berwick on the
                    north, in a breadth of only five or six miles. According to Mr Rickman’s Report
                    of 1831, the area of the county is 1871 square miles, or 1,197,000 acres; but
                    the actual returns from the parishes give only 1,165,430 acres, a difference
                    which is supposed to arise from the inaccurate measurement of the mountainous
                    and uncultivated part of the western division of the county. Nearly one third of
                    the county is scarcely capable of beneficial cultivation.</p>
                <p>It is divided into six wards, namely, Tindale, Coquetdale, Glendale, Bamborough,
                    Morpeth, and Castle, the first three comprising the western and mountainous
                    district, and the second three the coast lands on the east. These last, though
                    extending over only one fourth of the county, are by far the most wealthy and
                    populous, owing chiefly to the great coal-works in Castle ward, near the town of
                    Newcastle, and along the banks of the Tyne. It contains five deaneries and
                    seventy-three parishes, all of which are in the archdeaconry of Northumberland
                    and diocese of Durham.</p>
                <p>All the western side of this county is mountainous, from the common boundary with
                    Durham on the south, almost to the valley of the Tweed on the north; but this
                    extensive tract, comprising more than a third of the whole area, is not all of
                    the same character; the northern, or Cheviot Hills, extending to about 90,000
                    acres, being mostly all green nearly to their summits, comprehending many narrow
                    but fertile glens, and affording excellent pastures for the breed of sheep to
                    which they have given their name; whilst those to the west and south are, in
                    general, open solitary wastes, covered with heath, and of very little value. On
                    the coast, from the mouth of the Tyne to that of the Tweed, and also on the
                    north, throughout its whole breadth <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0167-0254"/>from Belford to Mindrum, the country is, with few
                    exceptions, level and rich, with a soil which in some places is a strong clay,
                    and in others a dry loam, but almost everywhere very productive, under the
                    enlightened system of cultivation which prevails so generally throughout
                    Northumberland.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of the county are the Tyne, Blyth, Wansbeck, Coquet, Ain,
                    and the Tweed, all of which fall into the sea, carrying with them the tribute of
                    many smaller streams. The Till, which empties itself into the Tweed, is also a
                    considerable rivulet. The Tyne and Tweed are by far the most important, the tide
                    flowing up the former sixteen miles, and up the latter eight or ten miles;
                    whilst the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a small distance from
                    their mouths. Both of these have long been celebrated for their salmon
                    fisheries, which yield great rents, and afford a valuable article of trade with
                    London, to which the fish are sent packed in pounded ice, by which means they
                    are presented in the market in nearly as fresh a state as if they had been newly
                    taken from the water.</p>
                <p>Northumberland has been long distinguished for its subterranean treasures, which
                    are the main source of its wealth and population. Of these, coal, which abounds
                    in most parts of it, is by far the most important. It is of the best quality in
                    the south-eastern quarter, on the banks of the Tyne, whence those vast
                    quantities are exported which supply the great consumption of the metropolis, as
                    well as the coasting and foreign trade. In some years the exportation from the
                    port of Newcastle has amounted to upwards of 600,000 chaldrons of fifty-three
                    cwt. each, and probably, as much more has been sent from Sunderland and consumed
                    in Northumberland and Durham, the same coal-field extending across the Tyne to
                    the latter county. This coal is all of the kind called “caking coal,” which
                    melts and runs together in the fire, and, when of the best quality, leaves very
                    few ashes. Calculations have been made as to the extent of this tract, the
                    quantity of coal which it may contain, and the period when it must be exhausted;
                    but upon this last point there is a great difference of opinion, some estimating
                    that the supplies must cease in three hundred years, some not in less than eight
                    hundred, whilst by others it is held to be almost inexhaustible. Of the coal
                    found in Bamborough, Islandshire, and Glendale ward, the seams are in general
                    thin, and the quality inferior, not caking nor burning to a cinder, but yielding
                    a great quantity of ashes. ⅛ This is used only for home consumption and for
                    burning limestone, a purpose for which it is well adapted; and through all this
                    district coal and lime are generally found together. The south-eastern quarter,
                    which is so rich in coal, is destitute of limestone. Lead ore abounds in the
                    mountains on the south-west, particularly towards the head of that branch of
                    South Tyne called Allendale, where it has long been wrought to a considerable
                    extent. Iron ore is found in many parts; stone marl near Tweedside, shell marl
                    in Glendale ward, and various sorts of sandstone or freestone are obtained in
                    almost every quarter, somé of it affording tolerable slates for roofing, and
                    flags for floors. Excellent grindstones are raised in the sandstone quarries, of
                    which a great many are exported from Camus and Warkworth.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of Northumberland is an object which is only second in interest
                    and importance to its coal works. Almost all those branches of rural economy for
                    one or more of which other districts are celebrated, may here be found combined
                    into one system, and conducted upon the same farms. One finds here the Leicester
                    sheep and the shorthorned cattle of Durham and Yorkshire, both in great
                    perfection; the turnips of Norfolk cultivated upon the drill system of Scotland;
                    the well-dressed fallows of East Lothian and Berwickshire; and that regular
                    alternation of tillage and grazing which is, of all other courses of cropping,
                    the one best adapted to sustain and even to improve the productiveness of the
                    soil. These remarks apply in an especial manner to the northern part of the
                    county, where the farms are in general large, and the occupiers men of education
                    and liberal acquirements. This quarter has been long distinguished as a school
                    of agriculture, to which pupils are sent, some of them gentlemen of fortune,
                    from various parts; a character for which it is eminently indebted, as well as
                    for other distinctions, to the late Messrs Culley, who were amongst the most
                    extensive and successful farmers in the kingdom. The common period of leases, at
                    least in the northern district, is twenty-one years, although many are shorter,
                    and upon a few estates no leases are granted. By the account taken for the
                    purpose of levying the property-tax in the year 1815, it was found that the
                    annual value of the real property amounted to L.1,240,594. It may be worthy of
                    remark here, that at the seat of the Earl of Tankerville, called Chillingham
                    Castle, there still exists in the forest the remains of the herds of wild cattle
                    which are supposed to have formerly abounded in this island, and to have been
                    the origin of our races of cows.</p>
                <p>Northumberland is not eminently a manufacturing county. Some wool-combing is
                    carried on at Hexham, and some thread is spun in the villages; but the chief
                    branches of manufacturing industry are those depending upon the cheapness of
                    iron and coal, and are chiefly carried on within and around the town of
                    Newcastle, to which head in this work the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>The population of the county at the four decennial enumerations has been as
                    follows:—In 1801 it amounted to 157,101, in 1811 to 172,161, in 1821 to 198,965,
                    and in 1831 to 223,000. The burials, including both the registered and
                    unregistered, in the ten years from 1821 to 1831, appear to have been one in
                    fifty-two of the whole number of inhabitants then living. The illegitimate
                    births were one in fifteen of the whole number born.</p>
                <p>The occupations of the people, according to the returns arranged by Mr Rickman,
                    were in 1831 as follows:</p>

                    a vast tract of country in North America, situated between 42. 30. and 49. north
                    latitude, and 87. 30. and 95. 30. west longitude. It is bounded on the north by
                    the British possessions and Lake Superior, on the east by Lake Michigan, on the
                    south by Illinois, and on the west by the Mississippi, and a line drawn from the
                    source of that river to the northern boundary. In length it extends about 500
                    miles, and in breadth about 400 miles. In some of its physical features this
                    territory resembles that of Missouri; but a greater proportion of it is covered
                    with wood. It is, generally speaking, a hilly country, with the exception of
                    extensive levels of prairie land. At the western extremity of Lake Superior are
                    the Cabotian Mountains; and near the mineral district are the Smoky Mountains.
                    The chief rivers, with the exception of the Mississippi (see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mississippi),</hi> are the Ouisconsin, Fox, Chippeway, St
                    Croix, Rum, St Francis, and Savannah of the Mississippi. Grand Portage,
                    Ontonagon, Montreal, Mauvaise, Boisbrule, St Louis, and nearly fifty smaller
                    streams, discharge themselves into Lake Superior. Riviere la Pluie falls into
                    the Lake of the Woods. None of the lake rivers have a course of more than a
                    hundred and fifty miles, and few of them more than fifty miles. The Ouisconsin,
                    the largest tributary of the Mississippi in this territory, rises in the
                    northern interior of the country, and interlocks with the Montreal of Lake
                    Superior. It has a course of between three and four hundred miles, with a
                    shallow and rapid current, which is, however, generally navigable by boats in
                    good states of the water, and is 800 yards wide at its mouth. There is i portage
                    of only half a mile between this and Fox River, lt extends over a level prairie,
                    across which, from river to 'iver, there is a water communication for periogues
                    in high dates of the water. Fox River has a course of 260 miles, flowing through
                    Winnebago Lake, and into the Green Bay of Lake Superior. The country on its
                    banks is very fine, and the climate is salubrious. Another considerable
                    tributary of the Mississippi is the Chippeway, which enters it immediately below
                    Lake Pepin. It is half a mile wide at its mouth, and has communication, by a
                    short portage, with Lake Superior. This is one of the very best regions for
                    hunters. In the upper part of the country, buffaloes, elks, bears, and deer, arc
                    common. Beavers, otters, and muskrats, are taken for their furs. The trappers,
                    and also the Indian tribes, pursue their prey over an immense extent of prairie.
                    The soil is fertile in some parts, and no doubt the enterprise and industry of
                    civilized men will ere long bring a great portion of it under cultivation. White
                    and yellow pine and white birch are common amongst the forest trees. All the
                    water courses, ponds, and marshes, are covered with wild rice, which the
                    inhabitants use as one of their chief articles of food. The elevation of the
                    head waters of the Mississippi is estimated at 1330 feet above the level of the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>This country abounds in minerals, and rich veins of valuable ore have been
                    discovered and wrought to considerable advantage. Great quantities of <hi
                    rend="italic">terre verte</hi> or green earth, lead, iron, and copper, are also
                    found in it. The lead-mine district is situated in the lower part of the
                    country, between Rock River and the Ouisconsin. The chief establishments of the
                    present miners are on Fever River, and the mines are reckoned as rich and
                    productive as any in the world. The following are the quantities produced in
                    each year from 1823 to 1832.</p>

                <p>The great increase in the years 1828 and 1829 reduced the price so low as to
                    render the working of the mines in a great measure unprofitable. For upwards of
                    half a century it has been confidently asserted that great quantities of native
                    copper may be found along the northern shore of Lake Superior. On the Outogon
                    there is a vast abundance of pure copper in detached masses. One of these masses
                    is estimated to weigh 3000 lbs. The common reports, however, of the existence of
                    large veins of copper, have not been confirmed by recent travellers; but there
                    are nevertheless sufficient indications that mines of this metal are to be met
                    with in this territory. Besides lead, iron is found in various places, and in
                    great abundance.</p>
                <p>In the southern portion of this large territory the climate is comparatively
                    mild, and not unlike that of the northern belt of Missouri. At the Falls of St
                    Anthony, on the Mississippi, the summers are temperate, whilst the winters are
                    extremely cold. The sources of the Mississippi are in a region extremely
                    inclement. At St Peters, in 1820, the mean temperature of January was zero, a
                    degree of cold which is never experienced in any part of the United States that
                    has been extensively settled. The summer, however, was temperate, and the
                    atmosphere beautifully serene. Even at Prairie du Chien, although much more
                    temperate, the winters are extremely severe. At the Falls of Packagama&gt; on
                    the Mississippi, about 1200 feet above the level of the sea, water has been
                    known to freeze to a considerable extent in the middle of July. The following
                    table, extracted from the work of an American writer, will convey the best idea
                    of the nature of the climate in different parts of the North-west Territory:</p>

                <p>The North-west Territory is divided, or rather marked off, into four counties,
                    which have been named and partially settled by whites; but there are still a
                    number of Indians in it. Prairie du Chien, Cassville, and Green Bay, are the
                    largest villages; and the whole population has been estimated at 16,000. Green
                    Bay settlement is situated at the outlet of Fox River, and contains 952
                    inhabitants. A few miles up Fox River, in a most romantic position, there is an
                    interesting Episcopal missionary settlement. Prairie du Chien is of importance
                    as a place of outfit from the Lower Mississippi to the upper waters. It is
                    situated near a beautiful prairie, and there are flour-mills in its vicinity.
                    Most of the permanent settlers here are a mixed race <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Indians and whites. Frequent voyages are made from St Louis to Prairie du Chien
                    in keel-boats. The richest copper mines, and the largest masses of pure copper,
                    are said to be found here. One third of the land is capable of being farmed, and
                    about one sixth is well timbered.</p>
                <p>The whole of this vast region has been for some time politically connected with
                    Michigan for the sake of convenience, but it must ultimately constitute a state
                    by itself. Most of the lands are owned by Indians, or by the United States; the
                    latter havingyecently made a purchase from the former <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    a very considerable tract of country. The following description of the Indian
                    territory is from Flint’s Geography: “The tract reserved to the Indians, of
                    500,000 acres, is also a fine body of land, containing very extensive and
                    fertile meadows along the Fox River, with woodlands of good timber, in which
                    there is no underbrush. The writer proceeded thirty-eight miles from Green Bay,
                    up the Fox River, to Winnebago Lake, passing rapids whose whole descent is about
                    100 feet. The river is ninety yards wide, its bed a limestone rock, the banks
                    from fifty to 150 feet high. The water is of course adequate to move any
                    machinery. Doty’s Island, in the outlet of the lake, contains 400 acres heavily
                    timbered. The bank of the lake itself is covered with trees of a height and
                    diameter indicating the nature of the soil, which is a black loam, rich and
                    deep. The Cliff, so called, is a mountain 300 feet above the level of the lake,
                    presenting a picturesque prospect. The main roads leading from Green Bay to
                    Chicago, Ouisconsin, Portage, the Lead Mines, and Galena, will probably pass
                    this point. Beyond this the mountain recedes three or four miles from the shore,
                    forming a valley fifteen miles in length, of as fertile land as can be found in
                    the United States, terminating to the south in a dry prairie called Cass Plains.
                    These plains contain 25,000 acres of rich land, which are already cleared by
                    nature for the plough, and they extend to the Manitoovoc River. Soon after begin
                    the prairies, which run, with scarcely any timber, to the Mississippi. In the
                    whole distance, near 100 miles, passed by the writer, the land seems to be of
                    the kind and aspect just described, namely, rich prairie, with occasional
                    growths of fine timber, equally indicative of fertility. A road from the mouth
                    of Fond du Lac River to Galena would be of great advantage to the mines, and a
                    direct route for one might be followed at a trifling expense. It would
                    facilitate the transportation of property from New York by the canal and the
                    lakes</p>
