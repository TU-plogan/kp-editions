                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NOSTRADAMUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michael</hi></label>, an
                    able physician and a celebrated astrologer, was descended of a noble Provençal
                    family, and born on the 14th of December 1503, at St Remy, in the diocese of
                    Avignon. By his grandfather he was initiated in the study of the mathematics,
                    and he afterwards completed his courses of humanity and philosophy at the
                    college of Avignon. Having repaired to Montpellier, he there applied himself to
                    physic, till being forced away by the plague in 1525, he took his route towards
                    Toulouse, and passed on till he reached Bordeaux. This course occupied him five
                    years, during which he undertook the cure of all such patients as were willing
                    to put themselves under his care. After this he returned to Montpellier, and,
                    having been created doctor of his faculty in 1529, revisited the places where he
                    had before practised physic. At Agen he contracted an acquaintance with Julius
                    Caesar Scaliger, which induced him to make some stay in that town, where he
                    married; but having buried his wife, and two children which she had brought him,
                    he quitted Agen after a residence of about four years. On his return to
                    Provence, he established himself first at Marseilles; but his friends having
                    provided an advantageous match for him at Salon, he, in 1544, transported
                    himself thither. In 1546, Aix being afflicted with the plague, he went thither
                    at the solicitation of the inhabitants, and proved of great service; so that the
                    town gave him a considerable pension for several years after the contagion
                    ceased. Returning afterwards to Salon, he became a recluse, and employed his
                    leisure in applying to his studies. He had for a longtime occasionally followed
                    the trade of a conjurer, and now he began to think himself inspired, nay,
                    miraculously illuminated with a prospect into futurity. As fast as these
                    illuminations had discovered to him any future event, he entered it in writing,
                    in enigmatical prose sentences; but revising them afterwards, he thought the
                    sentences would appear more respectable, and would savour more of a prophetic
                    spirit, if they were expressed in verse. This opinion determined him to throw
                    them all into quatrains, and he afterwards ranged them into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centuries.</hi> When this was done, he hesitated about making them public, till
                    reflecting that the time of many events which he had foretold was very near at
                    hand, he determined to print them. This he did with a dedication addressed to
                    his son Caesar, an infant only some months old, in the form of a letter or
                    preface, dated the 1st of March 1555. This edition, which includes seven <hi
                    rend="italic">Centuries,</hi> was printed by Rigault at Lyons. He prefixed his
                    name in Latin, but gave to his son Caesar the name as it is pronounced, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nôtradame.</hi></p>
                <p>The public were divided in their sentiments respecting this work. Many looked
                    upon the author as a simple visionary or a fool; whilst by others he was accused
                    of the black art, or magic, and treated as an impious person, who held a
                    commerce with the devil. But there were not wanting persons who believed him to
                    be really and truly endowed with the supernatural gift of prophecy. A few
                    remained in suspense, and refrained from giving any judgment at all respecting
                    his pretensions. But Henry II. and Catherine of Medicis his mother, having
                    resolved to see the prophet, he received orders to that effect, and immediately
                    repaired to Paris. He was very graciously received at court, treated with
                    extraordinary respect, and gratified with a present of two hundred crowns. He
                    was afterwards sent to Blois to visit his majesty’s children there, and report
                    what he should be able to discover concerning their destinies. No doubt he
                    exerted himself to the utmost on this occasion, but the precise nature of his
                    prognostications is not known; it is certain, however, that he returned to Salon
                    loaded with honours and presents. Animated with his success, he augmented his
                    work from three hundred quatrains to a complete milliad, and published it in
                    1558, with a dedication to the king. But that prince having died the next year,
                    of a wound which he received at a tournament, the book of the prophet was
                    immediately consulted; and in the 35th quatrain of the first century this
                    unfortunate event was found predicted in the following verse: <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560492" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0492-0279"/>Le lion jeune le vieux
                    surmontera,</p>
                <p>En champ bellique par singulier duel, Dans cage d’or les yeux lui crevera,</p>
                <p>Deux classes une puis mourir, mort cruelle.</p>
                <p>So remarkable a prediction added new wings to his fame, and he was shortly
                    afterwards honoured with a visit from Emanuel duke of Savoy, and the Princess
                    Margaret of France his consort. From this time Nostradamus found himself
                    overburdened with visitors, and his fame daily increased. Charles IX. on
                    visiting Salon, was eager to see him. Nostradamus, who then waited as one of the
                    retinue of the magistrates, being instantly presented to his majesty, complained
                    of the little esteem his countrymen had for him; upon which the monarch publicly
                    declared, that he should hold the enemies of Nostradamus as his own, and further
                    desired to see his children. Nor did that prince’s favour stop here. Not long
                    afterwards, in passing through the city of Arles, he sent for Nostradamus, and
                    presented him with a purse of two hundred crowns, together with a brevet,
                    constituting him his physician in ordinary, with the same appointments as the
                    rest. But the prophet enjoyed these honours only for the space of sixteen
                    months, having died at Salon on the 2d of July 1566. Besides his Centuries, we
                    have the following compositions of Nostradamus: A treatise <hi rend="italic">de
                    Far demens</hi><hi rend="italic">et de Senteurs,</hi> 1552; a Book of singular
                    Receipts, <hi rend="italic">pour Entretenir la Santé</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Corps,</hi> 1556; a piece <hi rend="italic">des Confitures,</hi> 1557; and a
                    French Translation of the Latin of Galen’s Paraphrase, exhorting Menedolas to
                    apply himself to study, especially to that of physic, 1552. Some years before
                    his death, he published a small instruction for husbandmen, showing the best
                    seasons for their several labours, which he entitled The Almanac of Nostradamus.
                    Lastly, after his death there came out the eleventh and twelfth Centuries of his
                    Quatrains. It is to these productions that the following pungent distich was
                    applied:</p>
                <p>Nostra damus cum falsa damus, nam fallere nostrum est, Et cum falsa damus, nil
                    nisi Nostra damus.</p>
