                <p><label type="entry">NEPAUL</label>, an extensive country of Hindustan, long and
                    narrow in its form, and, although somewhat curtailed in its dimensions by the
                    progress of British conquest, still one of the largest and most compact
                    independent kingdoms in the country. To the north it is bounded by the great
                    mountain wall of the Himalayas, which separates it from Thibet; to the south the
                    Nepaul territory reaches about twenty miles beyond the base of the mountains,
                    into the plains, being bounded by the provinces of Delhi, Oude, Bahar, and
                    Bengal, with the exception of about sixty miles of territory belonging to the
                    nabob of Oude, which intervene; to the east the river Mitchee separates Nepaul
                    from the British territories; and thence it is bounded by the principality of
                    Sikkim, which extends to the Chinese frontier. Previously to the late war with
                    Britain, the conquests of the Ghoorkhas or Nepaulese extended to the banks of
                    the Sutlege, the eastern river of the Punjab; but the boundary is now the river
                    Cali, or the western branch of the Goggra, which separates the Ghoorkha
                    territory from the British province of Kumaon. The above limits, however,
                    include a territory much larger than that to which the peculiar name of Nepaul
                    Proper belongs, and made up of conquests gained by the Ghoorkhas within the last
                    sixty years from a variety of petty hill states. This extended dominion is
                    mostly included between the twenty-seventh and thirty-first degrees of north
                    latitude, and in extreme length maybe estimated at 460 miles, by 115 miles in
                    breadth. The following are the modern districts into which this territory is
                    divided:</p>
                <p>1. Nepaul Proper.</p>
                <p>2. Country of the twenty-four rajahs.</p>
                <p>3. Country of the twenty-two rajahs.</p>
                <p>4. Muckwanpoor.</p>
                <p>5. Kirauts.</p>
                <p>6. Khatang.</p>
                <p>7. Chayenpoor.</p>
                <p>8. Saptari.</p>
                <p>9. Morung.</p>
                <p>Nepaul comprehends the greater part, probably about two thirds, of Northern
                    Hindustan. It is accordingly extremely diversified in its surface, the mountains
                    which form its northern boundary rising to the level of perpetual snow. These
                    high mountains generally decline into lower hills, from which they are separated
                    by fine valleys, which are still considerably above the level of the plains, and
                    the lowest belt of the Nepaul dominions forms part of the great, plain of
                    Hindustan. Immediately to the north of this flat country there is a region of
                    nearly the same width, consisting of small hills, which rise gradually<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558087" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8087-0094"/> towards the
                    north, and are watered by many streams from the loftier mountains to which these
                    hills gradually unite. The hills are covered with forests: on the lower hills
                    are found the saul forests, which, with the pines, are not surpassed in any
                    country, either for straightness or size, as well as for strength and
                    durability. Higher up there is a variety of other trees, and amongst the
                    northern hills many pines, and an abundance of mimosa, from which the catechu or
                    Indian rubber is made; also oaks, walnut and chestnut trees, hornbeam, Weymouth
                    pine, and common spruce, for the most part of but very little value, owing to
                    the inaccessible nature of the country. The breadth of this mountainous belt
                    immediately north and east of Catmandoo is estimated at from thirty to forty
                    miles. This is a very elevated region, consisting of one mountain heaped upon
                    another rising to a great height, so that in winter their summits are for a
                    short time covered with snow, and it even falls sometimes in the valley below. A
                    hoar frost also very often covers the ground; but although the cold is
                    occasionally for three or four months severe enough to freeze the tanks and
                    pools of standing water, the rivers are never frozen. Between the mountains are
                    narrow valleys of from 3000 to 6000 feet above the plains of Bengal. The height
                    of the valley of Nepaul, measured by the barometer, is about 4000 feet. It is
                    nearly of an oval figure; its greatest extent from north to south is twelve
                    miles, and it stretches east and west nine miles; and though it scarcely lies in
                    a higher latitude than twenty-seven and a half degrees, yet it enjoys nearly the
                    same climate as the southern countries of Europe.</p>
                <p>Lying near a region buried in snow, its climate must no doubt be somewhat
                    modified by such a vicinity. Still Kirkpatrick mentions, that in summer the
                    thermometer rose once to eighty-seven degrees during his residence in the
                    valley; and its usual height about noon varied from eighty-one to eighty-four
                    degrees. At sun-rise it was commonly between fifty and fifty-four, and at nine
                    in the evening it generally fluctuated from sixty-two to sixty-six degrees.
                    Fifty-one observations, from the 17th to the 25th March, gave an average of
                    sixty-seven degrees. The seasons are nearly the same with those in Upper
                    Hindustan. The rains commence a little earlier, and set in from the south-east
                    quarter; they are generally very violent, and break out towards the middle of
                    October. The mountain-torrents rush down in consequence with great impetuosity,
                    overflowing their banks, and spreading over all the adjacent country. By these
                    violent inundations, the plain is cut into numerous and deep ravines. The
                    temperature varies necessarily with the elevation of the ground; so that by
                    ascending the adjacent mountains, the heat of Bengal may in the course of a few
                    days be exchanged for the cold of Russia.</p>
                <p>The produce also varies along with the climate. In some parts rattans and
                    bamboos, both of enormous dimensions, are seen, and others produce only oaks and
                    pines. In several parts the pine-apple and sugar-cane ripen, whilst others yield
                    only barley, millet, and similar grains. The mulberry grows luxuriantly all over
                    the hills; and they cut its young and tender shoots annually, whilst full of
                    leaves, and, having dried them, stack them for fodder, which is said to be both
                    nutritious and agreeable to the animals. In this comparatively cold and elevated
                    climate, the periodical rains are not favourable for the ripening of fruits,
                    which everywhere abound, but never come to perfection, the heat of the climate
                    not being sufficient to bring them to maturity before the approach of the rains.
                    Peaches grow wild on every hill; but one side of them is rotted by the damp,
                    whilst the other side is green; and the grapes, which grow without shelter from
                    the rains, are always bad. Kirkpatrick, however, from the spontaneous
                    productions which he saw on the spot, namely, the peach, the raspberry, the
                    walnut, the mulberry, and others, thought that all the fruits and esculent
                    vegetables of England might with proper attention be successfully raised in the
                    mountainous valleys of Nepaul. In the warmer valleys, the pine-apple is
                    uncommonly fine; as also the orange, which ripens in winter. The abundant rains,
                    if they spoil the fruits, are, however, very favourable to the produce of grain;
                    and wherever the land can be levelled into terraces, however narrow, it is well
                    adapted for transplanted rice, which ripens after the rains have ceased. The
                    least rocky faces of the hills are generally cut into these terraces, which are
                    seen everywhere rising above each other. This operation produces numerous strips
                    of level ground, more or less narrow, according to the steepness of the hills.
                    Great labour and care are bestowed upon this operation, and it is often
                    necessary to build a retaining wall to support the edge of the small strip of
                    ground. Much attention is also paid to the levelling of its surface, to fit it
                    for irrigation, as every rivulet is first conducted by drains to the higher
                    cultivated spots, and then, after saturating them, to the lower range of fields.
                    In some parts the same land gives a winter crop of wheat and barley. Where the
                    land is too steep for terraces, it is generally cultivated after fallow with the
                    hoe, and produces rice sown broadcast, maize, cotton, three kinds of pulse, a
                    kind of mustard, manjeet or Indian madder, wheat, barley, and sugarcane. Tobacco
                    is an article of general cultivation in these hills, and it is considered as of
                    a fine quality. It is exported in considerable quantities both to the plains and
                    to Bootan. One of the great staples of agriculture in these mountainous
                    countries is a large species of cardamom; and ginger is likewise a valuable
                    production in the country between Nepaul Proper and the Cali, though rice is
                    still the main dependence of the farmer. Various dry rices are cultivated in
                    Nepaul, under the general name of ghya, some of which, so far from needing hot
                    weather to bring them to maturity, are actually raised in situations very much
                    exposed to falls of snow; whilst others do not require, as in Bengal, to be
                    flooded, but flourish in the driest and loftiest spots. There are also amongst
                    the spontaneous productions of this fertile soil several edible roots and herbs,
                    which form a considerable part of the sustenance of the poorer inhabitants. Of
                    these there are a species of yam, and a kind of wild asparagus, as well as
                    various other plants well deserving the attention of travellers. There are also
                    medicinal plants, and a rich variety of dyeing drugs procured from bitter or
                    aromatic woods, which grow naturally in the country, and which are held in great
                    estimation. The jeea is a very curious plant, from the expressed leaves of which
                    is produced a juice called cherris, which is a potent narcotic, and possesses
                    very valuable qualities, burning with a flame as bright as that of the purest
                    resin. Its leaves are fabricated into a species of hemp, from which the Newars
                    manufacture some coarse linen, and likewise a very strong kind of sackcloth.
                    Though the soil seems well adapted to the growth ofkitchen vegetables, yet the
                    inhabitants are either too indolent or unskilful <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> to
                    raise them. The only kitchen vegetables which Colonel Kirkpatrick met with were
                    cabbages and pease of the worst kind. They have the Thibet turnip, but cannot
                    raise it, any more than the potato, without renewing the seed annually. Amongst
                    these mountains are found the nettle, wild wormwood, raspberries, and
                    mulberries; also a curious shrub called khaksi, the leaf of which answers the
                    purpose of emery or sandpaper, giving a fine polish to the harder woods.</p>
                <p>The mountain pasture, though not so good as that in the low country, yet supports
                    numerous flocks of sheep, which migrate with the seasons, in winter to the lower
                    valleys, and in summer to the alpine regions, where they feed upon the herbage
                    of those extensive tracts which lie in the neighbourhood of perpetual snow. The
                    sheep in these altitudes are of considerable size, and have fine wool; the
                    larger are the same as in the lower countries, but are not numerous.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558100" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8100-0095"/>
                <p>Buffaloes are not reared by the natives, neither are hogs nor goats, though the
                    country is admirably adapted for both. Horses are brought from Thibet, as none
                    are bred south of the Himalaya; also the large ox of Thibet, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">bos</hi><hi rend="italic">grunniens,</hi> described by Turner, the
                    beautiful tail of which forms one of the exports from Nepaul; and the goat which
                    produces the shawl wool. The kustoora or musk-deer is a native of Lower Thibet,
                    though it is not very abundant anywhere. It is usually caught by means of a
                    snare made of a particular kind of mountain bamboo. It is difficult to obtain
                    the musk pure, even at Catmandoo; and Colonel Kirkpatrick mentions, that it is
                    even usual to adulterate it whilst it is yet in the bag on the body of the
                    animal. In the great forest which skirts the Nepaul territories throughout their
                    whole extent, from Serinagur to the Teesta, wild animals abound. Elephants are
                    found here in great numbers, and are a source <hi rend="italic">of</hi> revenue
                    to the Nepaul government. About 200 or 300 of these animals are caught annually;
                    but most of them being very young, and not being above seven feet and a half in
                    height, they are not of great value. They are extremely mischievous, and two or
                    three of them sometimes take possession of the road, and obstruct the progress
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> travellers for a considerable time. A large herd of
                    them assaulted the camp of the Nepaul deputies when they were on their way to
                    Patna, and were with great difficulty driven away. They sometimes issue from the
                    forest in droves, and overrun the cultivated country on its borders, penetrating
                    sometimes a considerable space within the company’s territories. The rhinoceros,
                    the tiger, the leopard, and other ferocious animals, find shelter in the depths
                    of the forests. The animal known in Bengal by the name <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the Nepaul dog is brought from Upper and Lower Thibet, of which it is a native.
                    It is a fierce, surly creature, about the size of an English bull-dog, and
                    covered with thick long hair. Several very fine birds are found in these
                    mountainous countries, as the manal <hi rend="italic">(meleagris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">satyra),</hi> and the damphya <hi rend="italic">{phasianus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">impeyanus).</hi> They are a species of pheasants, the damphya
                    being of the golden, and the manal or moonal of the spotted sort. They are both
                    extremely beautiful birds. The chakoor is well known to the Europeans of India
                    under the name of the fire-eater. It is a species of partridge, and derives its
                    name from its reputed power of swallowing fire. The fact is, that in the
                    breeding season this bird is remarkably fond of red pepper, after eating two or
                    three capsules of which, it will bite at a red coal if presented to it. The
                    khaledge is met with in the thickets which overrun the gorges of the mountains
                    near Noakote. The sarus, wild goose, wild duck, and several others of the
                    feathered species common to Bengal and the rest of the countries to the
                    southward of Nepaul, are occasionally seen in this and the adjacent valleys;
                    where, however, they merely appear as birds of passage, making Nepaul only a
                    stage in their flight from Hindustan to Thibet.</p>
                <p>The stones and ores collected in the country indicate the existence of a variety
                    of minerals in the mountains of Nepaul, such as iron, lead, copper, &amp;c. It
                    was formerly a prevalent idea amongst the Hindus, from whom it was received by
                    the British, that the country contained mines of gold. The only foundation for
                    this notion appears to be, that in the course of commerce the gold of Thibet
                    passed into Bengal and Bahar through Nepaul; or that a few grains of gold were
                    occasionally collected in the sands of the rivers, or found in the consecrated
                    pebbles of Gunduck; or sometimes that specimens of gold ore have been sent to
                    the governor-general by way of presents or curiosities. Other accounts of gold
                    mines may also be referred to the circumstance of scanty particles of gold being
                    found in the beds of torrents from the mountains. With regard to silver, it is
                    said that some veins of it have been discovered to the westward of Noakote. But
                    Kirkpatrick, in his account of Nepaul, suspects that it has no better foundation
                    than that silver has lately been found in certain ores which were very rich in
                    lead; whilst others appeared to be a species of galena, well worth the working
                    for the sake of the silver which they contained. Several attempts had been made
                    to extract the silver, but by such an unskilful process, that most part of the
                    baser metal was sacrificed, in consequence of which the return scarcely repaid
                    the expense. The copper is found quite near the surface of the earth, the ore
                    being dug from trenches open above, so that the work is entirely interrupted by
                    the rainy season. Those ores are found in several varieties, and are said to be
                    rich and of an excellent kind. The mine is shared amongst certain families along
                    with the rajah, who, there is every reason to believe, claims the lion’s share,
                    and, as in all other parts of Hindustan, leaves the workmen a bare subsistence.
                    Oude was formerly supplied with copper from Nepaul; but of late years it has
                    been superseded by European copper, owing to the difficulties and expense of
                    transferring it to the market through a mountainous country without navigable
                    rivers. The iron ore is also found near the surface, and is not surpassed in
                    excellence by that of any other country. Sulphur is likewise abundant, and
                    procured in great quantities. There is no good authority for believing that
                    either the ores of antimony or mercury are found in the territories of Nepaul;
                    but the western parts abound in arsenic and pyrites, though these sulphureous
                    ores are no longer worked, on account of the deleterious effects occasioned by
                    the operation. Stone is found in abundance and variety, particularly jasper and
                    marble; but the houses are universally built of brick, because the use of stone,
                    though abounding everywhere, is prevented by the expense <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> carriage in a country where the roads do not admit of wheel-carriages,
                    and where there is no navigation. There is said to be a considerable mass of
                    rock crystal near Ghoorkha, and limestone as well as slate abounds everywhere;
                    yet there are no limekilns in the country, the only cement employed being mud,
                    which, the natives pretend, answers better in their humid climate than
                    mortar.</p>
                <p>The alpine region belonging to Nepaul is about the same breadth of thirty or
                    forty miles from north to south. Scattered peaks are here seen covered with
                    perpetual snow, until, in advancing to the boundaries of Thibet, everlasting
                    winter reigns. This inhospitable region consists chiefly of immense rocks rising
                    into sharp peaks and tremendous precipices, covered with snow, and almost
                    constantly involved in clouds. Some of these mountains are estimated to rise
                    19,960 feet above the valley of Nepaul. The rains here are periodical, as in the
                    plains of Hindustan, and fall in the hottest season of the year. The snowy ridge
                    of the Himalaya Mountains, though it has a winding course, has few
                    interruptions, and is in most places impassable. Several rivers which take their
                    rise in Thibet make their way through the mountainous ridges, but by such narrow
                    chasms, and amidst such enormous precipices, that these openings afford no
                    practicable communication between the mountains and the plains. In the mountain
                    passes no sort of baggage or merchandise is transportable, except on the
                    shoulders of hill porters. The price of this carriage is regulated by the
                    government.</p>
                <p>The numerous valleys which are interspersed throughout the mountains of Nepaul
                    are inhabited by a variety of mixed races. The aboriginal inhabitants appear,
                    from their physiognomy, to have been of Tartar or of Chinese origin, and to have
                    had no resemblance to the Hindus either in features, religion, or manners.
                    Before their arrival they had no idea of caste. The period when these
                    mountainous regions were first invaded by the Hindus is uncertain; but,
                    according to the most authentic traditions, it is supposed to have taken place
                    about the fourteenth century. The Hindus who now inhabit these mountains were
                    about this <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558113" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8113-0096"
                    />period driven from their country by the invasion of the Mahommedan sovereign
                    of Delhi, who made proposals to marry a daughter of the rajah of Chitore,
                    celebrated for her beauty. This offer was refused, and the consequence was that
                    his city was captured and destroyed; and, to avoid the hated yoke of the
                    conqueror, great numbers of the inhabitants fled to the mountains. Many of the
                    chiefs amongst the mountain tribes, accordingly, claim descent from these
                    Chitore princes, although on doubtful grounds. There are a fewrajpoots whose
                    claims to a pure descent from the Chitore family are allowed; and the families
                    of the mountain chiefs who have adopted the Hindu rules of purity, and some even
                    who have neglected this, are now admitted to be rajpoots; whilst, on the other
                    hand, the purity of the Chitore blood has been so often contaminated by
                    alliances with the Tartar and Chinese races, that several of the Chitore family
                    have acquired the Tartar countenance, and some of the mountain tribes, by
                    intermarriages with pure rajpoots in a low station, have acquired the oval faces
                    and high noses of that remarkable race. The original purity of the rajpoot blood
                    having been thus lost by indiscriminate alliances, all the hill chiefs, whether
                    their descent from the Chitore family be real or pretended, are now called
                    rajpoots, and hold the principal offices, civil and military, of the petty
                    states in which the country was subdivided, until Nepaul was subdued by the
                    reigning family of the Ghoorkhas. In the eastern parts of the country the
                    aboriginal tribes still remain; and, until the predominance of the Ghoorkhas,
                    they enjoyed unmolested their customs and religion. But west of the Cali the
                    case is different, almost all the inhabitants claiming a descent from the Hindu
                    colony. They accordingly consist principally of the two superior classes of
                    Hindus, or brahmins and chetrees, with their various subdivisions.</p>
                <p>East of the Cali the tribes which possessed the country were chiefly, 1. Magars,
                    who occupied the lower hills in the western parts, and were very soon converted
                    to the brahmin doctrine of abstaining from beef. They are at present enlisted by
                    the Ghoorkha sovereigns, and compose a great majority of their troops. 2. The
                    Gurungs, a pastoral tribe, shift their abode between the mountains and the
                    valleys with the summer and the winter. They still adhere to the lama priesthood
                    and the Buddhist religion. They cultivate with the hoe, are diligent miners and
                    traders, and employ the numerous flocks which they possess in conveying their
                    goods to market. 3. The Jariyas form a numerous tribe, and inhabit the lower
                    hilly region between the Cali and the Nepaul valley, and are now nearly all
                    converted to the brahminical doctrines. 4. The Newars are an industrious people,
                    following agriculture and commerce, and are more advanced in the mechanical arts
                    than the mountain tribes. The greater part of them adhere to the tenets of the
                    Buddhists: though they have adopted the distinctions of caste, they do not
                    acknowledge the lamas, and have a priesthood of their own. The more fertile part
                    of what is called Nepaul Proper was chiefly occupied by the Newars, a race
                    addicted to agriculture and commerce, and far more advanced in the arts than any
                    other of the mountain tribes. Their style of building, and most of their arts,
                    appear to have been introduced from Thibet. All the Newars burn their dead; they
                    eat buffaloes, sheep, goats, fowls, and ducks, and are addicted to the
                    immoderate use of spirituous liquors. They live in towns or villages, in houses
                    built of brick cemented with clay, and covered with tiles; these houses are
                    three stories high, the ground-floor being allotted to the cattle and poultry,
                    the second to the servants, and the third to the family of the owner. Their
                    rooms are low, and have a mean and dirty appearance, and, besides, are infested
                    with vermin, which, in addition to the filth, the offals of the shambles, and
                    the blood of their sacrifices collected in the streets, give their towns an
                    exceedingly offensive aspect to Europeans. The Newar women are never confined to
                    the house. At the early age of eight years they are car- ' ried to a temple, and
                    married, with the usual ceremonies of the Hindus, to a fruit called <hi
                    rend="italic">ull</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when they arrive at puberty
                    they are betrothed to a man of the same caste, and the parents give a dower to
                    the husband, or rather her paramour, their manners being extremely licentious.
                    Like the women amongst the Nairs, they,may in fact have as many husbands as they
                    choose, being at liberty to divorce them as often as they please, and upon the
                    slightest pretences. The Newars are peaceable, industrious, and even ingenious;
                    much attached to the superstition which they profess, and now reconciled to the
                    chains imposed on them by their Ghoorkha conquerors. Their occupations are
                    chiefly those of agriculture; and they are, besides, almost exclusively employed
                    in the arts and manufactures of the country. They are generally of the middle
                    size, possessed of great corporeal strength, with broad shoulders and chest,
                    very stout limbs, round and rather flat faces, small eyes, low and somewhat
                    spreading noses, and open and cheerful countenances, with little or no
                    resemblance, according to Kirkpatrick, to the Chinese countenance. The
                    complexion of the women is somewhat between a sallow and a copper colour. 5. The
                    Dhenwars and Mhanjees are the husbandmen and fishers of the western districts.
                    6. The Bhootias. Though some families of this race are planted in the lower
                    lands, they occupy, generally speaking, such parts of the mountainous country as
                    are included in the Nepaul territories. They shave their heads, and observe many
                    idolatrous rites and customs. 7. The Bhanras are a sort of separatists from the
                    Newars, and are supposed to amount to 5000. They observe many of the customs of
                    the Bhootias. To the eastward some districts of the Nepaul dominions are
                    inhabited by tribes, such as the Lim-booas, Nuggerkootees, and others, of whom
                    little more is known than the names.</p>
                <p>With regard to the number of inhabitants within the bounds of Nepaul, we have no
                    data to form any thing like an accurate estimate. The wild and rugged nature of
                    the country gives no ground to suppose that the population is considerable. It
                    is in the valleys that the population is collected; and these, says Kirkpatrick,
                    with the exception of Nepaul and two or three others, are little better than
                    mountainous cavities. Even the Terriani, or low belt of land which runs along
                    the southern frontier, is but indifferently peopled, the villages being,
                    according to the traveller already mentioned, very thinly scattered, and mean
                    both&lt;n their appearance and in their size. The Nepaulese themselves give the
                    most exaggerated account of their numbers. They reckon their population by
                    houses; and to Patan, their largest town, they assign 24,000 houses, to Bhatgong
                    22,000, and to Catmandoo 18,000. This would give a population of 640,000. There
                    are, besides, many large villages and towns scattered around Kirtee-poor,
                    containing 12,000 houses; Theamee, Buneba, Phar-ping, Punonlee, Dhulkill,
                    Chappagang, all containing from 6000 to 7000 houses; and, besides these, there
                    are reckoned between twenty and thirty smaller, of from 1000 to 4000 houses, all
                    within the valley of Nepaul. But this gives a population that sets probability
                    at defiance, and is considered, both by Frazer and Kirkpatrick, as a glaring
                    fallacy. A loose estimate of the latter traveller lowers the population of
                    Nepaul to half a million of souls.</p>
                <p>The lands are held by various tenures. Those constituting crown-lands, or the
                    rajah’s immediate estates, are chiefly situated in the Ghoorkha territory,
                    though there is hardly any portion of the Ghoorkha conquests in which the prince
                    has not appropriated land to his own use. Some of these lands are cultivated by
                    husbandmen, who receive a share of the produce; others are tilled by the
                    neighbouring husbandmen, who are obliged to dedicate a certain <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558126" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8126-0097"/>number of days in the year to
                    this service. From such lands the rajah draws all the supplies necessary for the
                    support of his household. The brahmins also possess lands, the title to which
                    they receive by royal investiture. These lands are rent free, saleable, and
                    hereditary; but they may nevertheless be alienated for certain crimes. Their
                    proprietors are bound to the reigning prince for nothing beyond his prayers,
                    though they sometimes consider it as prudent to conciliate him by more
                    substantial gifts. Another tenure by which land is possessed by the Newars, is
                    the payment of a considerable fine when the original titles are confirmed, which
                    must be renewed on the accession of each prince. Other lands pay a rent to the
                    crown, or to the jaghiredar (proprietor), in proportion to their produce. The
                    khyra and barilands are those which are destitute of springs or running water,
                    and which, requiring considerable labour <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> yield,
                    after all, no very profitable return. These pay a rent according to their
                    produce, which is estimated by the number of spades or ploughs employed. Widows
                    may cultivate as much of this land as they can, without paying any rent at all.
                    The kaith or plantationlands, which are well supplied with water, and, being
                    situated in the valleys, are fruitful, and yield all the superior kinds of
                    grain, pay the half of their produce to the cultivator, who in return defrays
                    all the charges of tillage, with the exception of the seed. These lands are
                    reckoned to yield from twenty to thirty fold; and they pay different rates to
                    the proprietor, according to the value of their produce.</p>
                <p>The whole population of Nepaul are liable to military service in times of public
                    danger, though they arc not regularly trained to arms. But there is a standing
                    army dispersed over the country, besides a large force always in the capital,
                    amounting to 30,000 or 35,000 troops. These troops are regularly trained,
                    disciplined, and officered after the manner of European troops; and they
                    likewise affect the European exercise, dress, and arms. The regular force of
                    Nepaul has so long been accustomed to active service and to constant victory,
                    that they have acquired all the qualities of veteran soldiers, a fearlessness of
                    danger, and a contempt of any foe opposed to them. “They have,” says Frazer,
                    “much of the true and high spirit of a soldier, that setting of life at nought
                    in comparison of the performance of duty, and that high sense of honour which
                    forms his most attractive ornament, and raises his character to the highest.”
                    These qualities were frequently displayed in the course of the campaign with the
                    British, against whose overwhelming attacks fortresses were defended with a
                    determined bravery, and a patient endurance of famine and misery, that were
                    truly exemplary. And when they at length surrendered a fort which was no longer
                    tenable, they deplored their hard fate, called themselves wretched men that
                    ought rather to have died, and refused to return to their native country; whilst
                    the courtesy they showed to the British, and the reciprocal good offices
                    received and returned, resembled more the generous spirit of European warfare,
                    than the cruel practices of the East. The expenses of the military establishment
                    are mostly defrayed by assignments of land, though in some instances the soldier
                    receives his pay from the treasury, and occasionally from the public granary;
                    others are paid partly in money, and partly in land; but the most usual mode,
                    and the one most agreeable to the troops, is by putting them in possession of
                    tracts of land, on which they generally settle their families, whom they can
                    maintain better in this manner than by any pecuniary stipend. There seems no
                    fixed rate of reward for different ranks, a good deal depending on the interest
                    of the parties, and other incidental circumstances. One of the captains of the
                    rajah’s company of guards informed Colonel Kirkpatrick, that the lands which he
                    held yielded him 180 rupees a year, and that he received an additional sum in
                    money of 280 rupees; but added, that he was better off when he belonged to a
                    private company. It may be added, that government evinces great consideration
                    for its military and public servants, being particularly indulgent to their
                    widows, orphans, and other destitute branches of their families. The soldiers
                    are in general stout, thick, and well-built men. They are very brave, and prefer
                    close fighting, giving an onset with a loud shout. During the war with the
                    British they attacked with great valour and impetuosity, advancing to the very
                    muzzles of the cannon. They understand the use of the sabre; and each man wears,
                    besides, a “cookree,” or long crooked heavy knife, which may be used in war, but
                    is also of great use in all common operations where a knife or hatchet is
                    required. The soldiers also carry a long sort of matchlocks or muskets. The
                    officers, besides the sword and shield and “cookree,” carry bows and arrows,
                    which they use very dexterously. The sword which they use has the edge curved
                    inwards like a reaping hook, but far more straight, and very heavy, particularly
                    at the point, where it is very broad, and ends abruptly squace. A few small guns
                    are used; but they are confined to the walls of forts, and never carried into
                    the field.</p>
                <p>The government of Nepaul is essentially a despotism, and is good or bad according
                    to the character or temporary views of the reigning prince. It is no doubt
                    slightly ameliorated by the authority of immemorial customs, and the influence
                    of religion, which no prince, however despotic, can safely disregard; as well as
                    by the occasional opposition of the aristocracy or chiefs. But the great body of
                    the people derive little benefit from the struggle for power between the prince
                    and his nobles. They seem to possess no civil rights, and are at the mercy of
                    their rulers for whatever treatment the latter think proper to give them. It was
                    observed by Kirkpatrick, in the course of his journey into the country, that the
                    carriers were pressed, without ceremony, into the service of government, and
                    compelled to work without any promise of pay; and in the war with the British, a
                    detachment of troops, because they yielded a post to the enemy which they could
                    no longer hold, were punished with extraordinary cruelty, being mutilated in
                    their faces in the most shocking manner. In Europe the progress of improvement
                    has modified the rigour of the most absolute governments; but in Nepaul, as in
                    all the Asiatic states, despotism grows up to the most frightful maturity in the
                    congenial soil of ignorance; and although the arbitrary will of the prince may
                    be opposed by the force of circumstances, yet there is no permanent security for
                    life and property, such as is derived from the authority of fixed laws. The
                    administration of public affairs is carried on by various officers. The first of
                    these is the choutra or prime minister to the rajah, to whom he is invariably
                    akin. His business is to receive and examine all written and verbal
                    communications regarding public business, and to act as a sort of
                    comptroller-general over the inferior departments of administration. He holds
                    his office during the pleasure of the prince, to whom he submits all his reports
                    on matters of state; and the former, if he see proper, refers them for further
                    investigation to a court of inspection appointed for the purpose. He is paid by
                    a commission or fine on every rice plantation, with the exception of those of
                    the Thurgars or nobles and the military. Secondly, the kajees are four
                    commissaries who superintend all civil and military affairs, and are employed in
                    the collection of the revenue, and in the management of the Jaghire lands. They
                    are paid by a tax of one rupee on all taxable lands. Thirdly, the sirdars
                    command the armies of the state, and likewise participate in the management of
                    civil business. Fourthly, the kurdars act as secretaries, preparing all
                    communications from the rajah to foreign powers, or to the officers of state.
                    Fifthly, the kup-perdar and the kuzanchee have the charge, the one of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558139" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8139-0098"/> rajah’s private
                    wardrobe, jewels, and kitchen; and the other of the public wardrobe, from which
                    honorary dresses are issued. All these officers are paid by a moderate duty upon
                    all taxable lands. Sixthly, the ticksali or superintendent of the mint is paid
                    by a commission on the import duties from' Thibet, and on a tax payable by all
                    natives of Nepaul who return to their country from Lehassa, Diggerchch, or other
                    parts of Thibet. This tax is exacted with a good deal of rigour. Seventhly, the
                    dhurma-udhikar is the chief criminal judge, who commissions all the inferior
                    judges, excepting those who officiate in the farmed districts. The fees in this
                    department are very great; and as most crimes are punishable by fine, the
                    penalties constitute a large source of emolument, which does not by any means
                    favour the pure administration of justice. Civil questions regarding property
                    are decided by another tribunal, the members of which are usually brahmins. Over
                    this court the criminal judge sometimes presides. Intricate questions are
                    occasionally referred to a superstitious ordeal, in which chance decides; and
                    this barbarous process is a sure index to the manners of the people, and to the
                    low state of their civil institutions. There is, besides, a superintendent of
                    the police, a minister who is employed in complimentary embassies to foreign
                    powers, or in carrying orders to public officers. The soubahs are governors of
                    districts, or farmers, and government collectors, acting as officers of revenue,
                    of justice, and of police; and the omrahs are commanders of military posts.</p>
                <p>The public revenue is derived from land-rents, customs, fines of various sorts,
                    and from mines. Annual presents are made by the soubahs, and by everyone who
                    approaches the court; and a sort of arbitrary income-tax is besides levied from
                    all ranks, even the sacred <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> order, who possess free
                    lands, not being exempted. An officer is often employed for the express purpose
                    of collecting this tax, which is rated according to the exigencies of the state,
                    and which mounts up in many districts to more than the regular revenue.
                    According to Colonel Kirkpatrick, who visited the country in 1792, and who
                    derived his information from good authority, the revenue actually remitted to
                    Catmandoo never exceeded thirty lacs of rupees (L.35,000), but it sometimes fell
                    to twenty-five lacs. The subsequent conquests by the Ghoorkha sovereigns were
                    not productive of a great increase of income; and the reduction of territory by
                    the late war would of course occasion a corresponding diminution. The export
                    duties, and the profits on the sale of elephants, bring in from three to four
                    lacs of revenue. The import duties levied on the trade from Thibet, included
                    under the mint, as the returns consist chiefly in silver bullion, amount to
                    about seven or eight lacs. The duties on salt, the profits on saltpetre, which
                    appears to be a monopoly, on copper and iron mines, and the produce of the
                    land-tax, may be estimated at from fifteen to eighteen lacs. Formerly the
                    inhabitants of Thibet were supplied with a silver currency from the mint of
                    Nepaul, on which the treasury gained a profit of a lac of rupees.</p>
                <p>The trade of Nepaul is by no means so extensive as it might be if it were
                    conducted under proper regulations; being shackled by monopolies for the benefit
                    of government, or of a few favoured merchants, who labour to preserve their
                    privileges by the most invidious and corrupt means in their power, and by other
                    injudicious restraints. But, at the same time, the surplus produce of so poor a
                    country could scarcely afford the basis of an extensive trade; and it was
                    accordingly rather the medium of communication between other countries, than
                    remarkable for the extent of its own commerce. Formerly merchants from Cashmere
                    carried their manufactures to Kutti and other towns in Thibet, and received in
                    return the wool produced in these countries from the shawl goat. Such portions
                    of these manufactures as are not used in Thibet were exported by the way of
                    Teshoo Loomboo and Lassa, to Siling or Sining on the frontiers of China, and
                    partly sent to Catmandoo by way of Patna. The principal goods imported in return
                    to answer the demand of Cashmere and Nepaul were teas and silks; and from Patna,
                    it is said, they exported otters’ skins to a great amount, procured from the
                    neighbourhood of Dacca. The articles imported into Nepaul from Thibet are coarse
                    woollen cloths, paper, horses, sheep, shawl goats, chowry bullocks, chowries or
                    cow-tails, musk-deer, dogs, falcons, pheasants, salt, sal-ammoniac, hurtal or
                    yellow arsenic, borax, quicksilver from China, gold in grains and in small
                    lumps, antimony, rugs or coarse blankets, muιιijheet or Indian madder, cherris
                    or extract of hemp, besides various medicinal drugs and preserved fruits, such
                    as almonds, walnuts, raisins, dates. Of these articles, the greater part of the
                    musk, chowries, hurtal, borax, and bullion still find their way to Patna; whence
                    in return are sent north, buffaloes, goats, broad cloth, cutlery, glass ware,
                    and other European commoditiès, Indian cotton manufactures, mother of pearl,
                    pearls, coral, beads, spices, pepper, betel nut and leaf, camphor, tobacco, tin,
                    lead, zinc, and phajoo, the red powder thrown by the Hindus during the hooly.
                    Besides these articles, utensils in wrought copper, brass, bell-metal, and iron,
                    are sold to the merchants of Thibet. The borax and salt are said to be brought
                    from a lake which is situated nearly north from Catmandoo, about fifteen days’
                    journey beyond the Brahmaputra. The carriers of these articles are a large kind
                    of sheep, with four horns, which appear to be the common beasts of burden in all
                    countries towards the sources <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Indus, Ganges, and
                    Brahmaputra. Formerly the lamas of Lassa and Teshoo Loomboo sent a large sum in
                    bullion to be coined at the mint of Catmandoo, on which an allowance of four per
                    cent, was made for the coinage. But the rapacity of the rajah induced him to
                    alloy the rupee to the amount of eight per cent., which had the effect of
                    putting an entire stop to this source of revenue.</p>
                <p>The Newars are almost the only artisans in Nepaul; and they appear to be
                    acquainted with and to exercise most of the handicraft occupations of their
                    neighbours. The Newar women of all ranks, as well as the men, of the hill-tribe
                    of Mugar, weave two sorts of cotton cloth, partly for home use and partly for
                    exportation. These cloths are the dresses of the middling and lower classes,
                    although woollens would be much better fitted for the cold climate of a Nepaul
                    winter. Those, accordingly, who are not very poor, wear woollen blankets, which
                    ∣are manufactured by the Bhooteas, who wear nothing else. The dress of the
                    higher ranks is not manufactured at home, but is imported, consisting of Chinese
                    silks, shawls, low country muslins, and calicoes. European broad cloth is worn
                    by the military alone. They work very well in iron, copper, brass, &amp;c.; and
                    in Lalita, Patan, and Bhatgong, there are considerable manufactories of these
                    articles, and also of a species of bell-metal. One bell which was manufactured
                    at that place measured five feet in diameter. The Thibet bells are superior to
                    those of Nepaul, though a great many bell-metal vessels are made by the Newars,
                    and exported to Thibet, along with those of brass and copper. They are likewise
                    particularly ingenious in carpentry; but it is remarkable that they never use a
                    saw, dividing their wood, of whatever size, by a chisel and mallet. They are
                    skilful in gilding; and they manufacture at Bhatgong, from the bark of a shrub,
                    a very strong paper, remarkably well suited for packages. They distil spirits
                    from rice and other grains, and also prepare a fermented liquor from wheat,
                    munooa, rice, &amp;c. which they call jhaur. It is made somewhat in the manner
                    of malt liquors, but is more intoxicating. The Newar peasants use it in the same
                    manner, and consider it as necessary for their comfort as the labouring people
                    of Britain do porter. &gt; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558152"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8152-0099"/>The early history of Nepaul, like that of most of
                    the eastern countries, is buried under a mass of fable. The inhabitants exhibit
                    a list of princes for several thousand years back, which is given in Colonel
                    Kirkpatrick’s work, but without any evidence of their authenticity. It is
                    doubtful whether such persons ever existed. We know, however, that Nepaul was
                    the scene of important revolutions, though it never was subjected to the Delhi
                    emperors, or to any of the other great Asiatic powers. It is said to have been
                    completely subdued in <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1323, by Hurr Singh, one
                    of the princes of Oude, who was driven out of his own possessions by the Patans.
                    But from that period there exists no accurate information respecting the
                    dynastics which ruled during the interval, or the race of princes who governed
                    Nepaul at the time of the Ghoorkha conquest. Runjeet Mull was the last of the
                    Surya Bansi race, or children of the sun, that reigned in Nepaul. He formed an
                    alliance with Purthi Nirain, which ended in the loss of his dominions, of which
                    he was stript by his ally in the Newar year 890 or 888, corresponding to A. υ.
                    1768. He possessed great courage and insatiable ambition, and was indebted for
                    his success in war to his introduction of firelocks and European discipline
                    amongst his troops. It was in his reign that Captain Kinloch, with a British
                    force,’endeavoured to penetrate into Nepaul. But, from the sickness of the
                    troops, and the difficulty of the country, the enterprise was abandoned. Purthi
                    Nirain died about three years after the final conquest of Nepaul, that is, in
                    the year 1771. He left two sons, Singh Pertaub and Behadur Shah, the former of
                    whom succeeded to the throne, and, conceiving a jealousy of his brother, threw
                    him into prison, whence he was with difficulty released by the interference of
                    one of the spiritual guides of the Ghoorkha family, on condition that he should
                    live in exile. Singh Pertaub, after having extended his father’s conquests, died
                    in 1775, leaving one son, who was an infant. Behadur Shah, on the death of his
                    brother, returned from his exile to Catmandoo, and, having placed his nephew on
                    the throne, assumed the office of regent. But the mother of the infant prince,
                    Rajender Letchemi, contrived to supplant Behadur Shah in his office, and even to
                    secure the person of her rival. Through the mediation, however, of one of the
                    priests, an accommodation took place, and Behadur Shah was thus enabled to seize
                    and confine the ranee in his turn. Neglecting, however, to conciliate the chief
                    men of the state, he was again driven into banishment, from which he did not
                    return till the death of the princess, when he re-assumed the regency without
                    opposition. In the course of his administration, Palpa, and many other petty
                    states to the westward, Bhote to the north, and Sikkim to the east, were
                    compelled to submit to the rule of the Ghoorkhas.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the administration of Mr Hastings in India the Ghoorkha
                    sovereigns were involved in hostilities with Thibet, and finally with China. The
                    Teshoo Lama of Thibet having proceeded to Pekin, died soon after his arrival in
                    that city. His brother, Sumhur Lama, taking advantage of his absence, fled from
                    Lassa to the rajah of Nepaul, carrying along with him a considerable quantity of
                    treasure; and he made such representations to the Nepaul government that their
                    avarice was inflamed, and having marched a body of troops to Lassa, they
                    extorted from the lama a tribute of three lacs of rupees. In 1790 they detached
                    to Teshoo Loomboo, the residence of another sacred lama, a second body of
                    troops, amounting to 7000 men, who pillaged the place and the sacred temples,
                    and succeeded in carrying off a large booty, though closely pursued by a Chinese
                    army, and though, from the severity of the weather, they lost 2000 men in their
                    retreat. The emperor of China, as the terrestrial superior of the lamas, and
                    their worshipper and protector, incensed by these unprovoked aggressions,
                    despatched an army of 70,000 men against the Nepaulese, who were overthrown in
                    repeated battles; and the Chinese army advanced to Noakote, within twenty-six
                    miles of Catmandoo, and sixty of the British territory of Bengal. A peace was at
                    last concluded, though on terms ignominious to the Nepaulese, who were compelled
                    to become tributaries to the Chinese, and to refund the spoil which they had
                    taken from the Thibet lamas. It does not appear, however, that this tribute was
                    ever exacted. It was about this period that Lord Cornwallis attempted to
                    conclude a treaty of commerce with the Nepaulese; but every proposition of this
                    nature was frustrated by their extreme jealousy.</p>
                <p>The queen-regent died in 1786, when the care of the young rajah devolved entirely
                    on his uncle Bahadur Shah, who was accused of having, from disgraceful motives,
                    encouraged the rajah in his debaucheries, in hopes of bringing him into
                    contempt, and of thus securing to himself the reins of authority. In this
                    expectation, however, he was deceived, as the rajah, in 1795, when he had
                    entered into his twentieth year, suddenly announced to his uncle that he had now
                    resolved to assume the reins of government, and being supported by a large
                    proportion of the nobles, Bahadur Shah, making a virtue of necessity, forbore
                    all resistance, and received in return assurances of the most distinguished
                    favour. The young rajah rendered himself extremely popular during the first year
                    of his reign. But this fair prospect was speedily overcast, and the youth
                    plunged into all the excesses of the most furious despotism and cruelty. His
                    first act was to arrest his uncle, and, loading him with chains, to throw him
                    into prison, where he was starved to death. He daily tortured and mutilated his
                    subjects, and beheld their sufferings with savage joy. In his outrages he made
                    no distinction of age or sex. Women of all castes, even those belonging to the
                    sacred orders, were seized, and subjected to abuse from the vilest characters.
                    In 1797, he had a son by a brahmin widow, who being taken seriously ill next
                    year, and finding her end approaching, reminded the rajah of the prediction of
                    astrologers, that he would never complete his twenty-fourth year, and entreated
                    that he would provide for the unprotected orphan they were about to leave. The
                    rajah, relying implicitly on the superstitious prophecy, immediately, and in the
                    most solemn manner, before all the chiefs, abdicated the throne in favour of his
                    son, though illegitimate, and an administration was then appointed, over which
                    one of his ranees or queens was appointed to preside. The abdicated monarch now
                    devoted his whole time to attendance on his favourite widow, who,
                    notwithstanding all his attention, and rich offerings at the different temples,
                    soon afterwards expired. In his affliction he became quite frantic, and
                    perpetrated atrocities, the bare mention of which causes the Nepaulese still to
                    shudder, and which are too shocking to be narrated. Amongst various enormities,
                    he directed the sacred temple of Balwani to be demolished, and the golden idol,
                    which was a venerated object of worship, to be ground to dust; and when the
                    soldiers to whom he had issued the orders demurred at such an act of sacrilege,
                    he commanded boiling oil to be poured on their naked bodies. Nor did any one
                    escape his rage. Neither rank nor caste afforded any protection from his
                    violence. Even the first members of the government were scourged without mercy,
                    and otherwise tortured. A confederacy was at last formed against the tyrant, who
                    finding himself abandoned, absconded during the night, and fled to Benares,
                    which he reached in May 1800.</p>
                <p>A close connection with Nepaul had always been a favourite object with the
                    British rulers of India, and the flight of the rajah to Benares appeared to
                    present a fair opportunity for bringing it about. A treaty of alliance was
                    accordingly concluded between the two states, by Captain W. D. Knox, who was
                    appointed ambassador, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558165"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8165-0100"/>and who proceeded to Catmandoo for the purpose in
                    1802. The terms of the treaty were considered as favourable to the British
                    interests; the Nepaulese being anxious to secure the influence of such powerful
                    neighbours against the faction of the abdicated rajah, who still contended for
                    his restoration. But whatever advantages were attained by this treaty, were
                    ultimately rendered nugatory by the jealous opposition of the subordinate
                    officers amongst the Nepaulese, who were probably instigated by their chiefs,
                    the latter being entirely unable to fulfil the obligations which they had
                    entered into.</p>
                <p>The residency at Catmandoo was accordingly withdrawn in the year 1804. About this
                    time the abdicated monarch, Run· Bahadur, by the able management of his queen,
                    whom he had always ill treated, was restored to his former authority. But as he
                    continued to rule with his former barbarity, his reign was of short duration; in
                    1805 a conspiracy was formed against him, which terminated in his assassination.
                    His death was succeeded by the most violent conflicts between the adverse
                    parties in the state, and did not terminate until nearly the whole of the nobles
                    at Catmandoo had perished. The surviving adherents of the late rajah having at
                    length secured the person of his son, seized on the reins of government, putting
                    to death such of the opposite party as still remained.</p>
                <p>But during all these intestine commotions, it is remarkable that the Nepaulese
                    still extended their conquests on every side. To the west of Catmandoo, and
                    towards the Sutlege, the hill-chiefs were distracted by mutual jealousies, and
                    by no means in a condition to form a league for their mutual defence. They were
                    accordingly subdued one after another by the armies of the Ghoorkhas, who very
                    soon made themselves masters, without the aid of artillery, of every hill-fort,
                    from the Ganges to the Sutlege. When their movements first attracted the notice
                    of the British government, their chief was vigorously prosecuting the conquests
                    of these states; and as he advanced westward, he erected strong forts and
                    stockades at convenient positions, namely, Almorah, Serinagur, and Malowa. The
                    Sikh frontier was also guarded by a strong line of fortified posts; and thus the
                    consolidation of the Ghoorkha empire proceeded with a slow but sure progress.
                    The extensive tract which lies between Catmandoo and the Sutlege was held in
                    firm subjection by a strong military force, whilst to the east the Sikkim rajah
                    was deprived of half his territories, and compelled to pay a tribute for the
                    remainder. To the north the progress of conquest was restrained by the Chinese
                    power, with which the Ghoorkha chiefs had already found themselves unable to
                    cope, and also by a lofty range of barren mountains. But the fertile and low
                    situated plains of the south presented a more alluring prospect, and greater
                    probabilities of success in a contest with a new and untried power. The
                    consequence was a series of encroachments along the whole northern frontier of
                    the British possessions, especially in the district of Gorruckpoor and Sarun.
                    The British remonstrated against these proceedings, and an investigation into
                    the respective claims of the two powers was commenced by commissioners jointly
                    chosen, the result of which being entirely favourable to the British, a
                    detachment of regulars was ordered to take possession of the debateable ground.
                    But these being withdrawn during the rainy season, the chief police station upon
                    the frontier was attacked by large bodies of Nepaulese, and the officers were
                    compelled to fly, with a loss of eighteen killed and six wounded. Shortly
                    afterwards a second attack was made on another police station, and several
                    persons were killed, after which the whole body was withdrawn; and, in 1814, the
                    war commenced. A brief account of the operations of this war will be found under
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hindustan</hi>; and it is only necessary here
                    to state generally, that the invasion of the Nepaulese dominions was commenced
                    on the western frontier, beyond the Jumna and near the Sutlege, the country
                    there being considered as of easier access than the mountainous barrier which
                    bounds the Nepaulese dominions on the side of Bengal. But the British troops, in
                    attempting to storm the stockades and hill-forts, were repeatedly driven back
                    with severe loss, and suffered reverses to which they had been wholly unused in
                    the wars of India. Here it was that the brave General Gillespie was slain,
                    whilst he was encouraging his troops, who had been repulsed, to renew the
                    attack. In 1815, Sir David Ochterlony assumed the chief command, and by a series
                    of skilful operations, in which he dislodged the Ghoorkha troops from the
                    fortified heights of Malowa, and ultimately so hemmed in their renowned
                    commander Ameer Singh, and his son, that they were forced to sign a
                    capitulation, by which they agreed, on being permitted to retreat with their
                    remaining troops, to abandon the whole territory west of the Cali branch of the
                    Goggra. In Kumaon also the British troops succeeded in driving the enemy before
                    them; and, in consequence of these successes, a definitive treaty of peace was
                    signed on the 28th of November 1815. But the signature of the rajah being
                    withheld, it was determined to renew the war, and to strike a decisive blow
                    directly at the capital of the country. Preparations for this arduous enterprise
                    were made on a great scale, a force being assembled at Sarun amounting to about
                    13,000 men, of whom 3000 were Europeans, besides a large body of irregulars,
                    amounting in all to above 46,000 troops. This formidable force took the field in
                    the end of January 1816, and advanced from the Bettiah district directly on
                    Catmandoo. The greatest difficulties were encountered, from the ruggedness of
                    the country, in marching along the dry beds of torrents, through ravines, and in
                    the face of precipices. But all these obstacles were overcome by the patience of
                    the troops, and the consummate skill and science of their commander. The
                    Ghoorkhas made a brave resistance, but they were overthrown in several severe
                    encounters; and the British force had now approached within three days’ march of
                    their capital, Catmandoo. Deeming all further resistance vain, an ambassador was
                    sent to the British head-quarters, to sue for peace; and the unratified treaty
                    of the year 1815 was accordingly duly signed. By this treaty the Nepaulese
                    renounced all claims to the territory in dispute. They also ceded all the
                    conquests which they had made to the west of the Cali branch of the Goggra, and
                    which, with the exception of Kumaon, the Deyrah Doon, and some other portions of
                    territory annexed to the British dominions, were restored to the families of the
                    chiefs who had reigned there prior to the Ghoorkha invasion, and who were now to
                    rule as vassals of the British; it being understood, however, that the latter
                    were not to interfere in the internal administration, but were merely to act as
                    arbiters between rival chiefs.</p>
                <p>In the course of this contest with the British, the Nepaulese had earnestly
                    entreated the aid of the Chinese against the Europeans, whom their ambassadors
                    represented as desirous of acquiring Nepaul merely to serve as an intervening
                    point in their progress to China. Their application being transmitted by the
                    grand lama to Pekin, an answer was received, in which the emperor expressed his
                    conviction that the Ghoorkhas had themselves been the cause of the war by their
                    unjust encroachments, and declined all interference. After peace was concluded,
                    the Chinese emperor expressed deep offence against the rulers of Nepaul, who,
                    being merely tributaries, had presumed to make war or peace with the British,
                    without the sanction of their superior; and, to back those lofty pretensions, an
                    army of 15,000 men, commanded by five generals, and attended by Chinese
                    functionaries of superior rank, usually stationed at Lassa, actually advanced
                    towards the Nepaulese territories. At the request of the Nepaul ministers, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194558178" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8178-0101"/> the British
                    consented to act as mediators. But in the mean time they themselves despatched
                    to the Chinese camp agents, who having reached it early in September 1816,
                    succeeded in bringing about the restoration of peace, and of all the ancient
                    relations between the two powers. In 1816, Ameer Singh Thappa, one of the most
                    distinguished Ghoorkha commanders, who had so gallantly disputed the field with
                    Sir David Ochterlony, died, at the age of sixty-eight. To the last day of his
                    life he was endeavouring, by negotiation, and by every art, to excite amongst
                    thedifferent states a spirit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> hostility against the
                    British, as the common enemies of Indian independence. Two of his widows devoted
                    themselves to death along with him; one sacrificed herself on the spot, and the
                    other was at the same time preparing for the fatal pile at the temple of
                    Pushpoonath, within the valley of Catmandoo. In November 1816, the young rajah
                    died of the small-pox, at the age of twenty-one years. One of his queens, and
                    one of his concubines, together with five female attendants, devoted themselves
                    to the funeral pile along with the corpse. He left one son, three’years of age,
                    named Rajindra Bickram Shah, who succeeded quietly to the throne, under the
                    guardianship of the minister Bheem Singh Thappa; a very unusual circumstance in
                    the annals of Nepaul. No interruption has occurred since this period to the
                    peace happily concluded with the British; nor, according to the latest accounts,
                    has the internal tranquillity of the country been disturbed.</p>
