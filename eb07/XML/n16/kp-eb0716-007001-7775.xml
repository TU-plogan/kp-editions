                <p><label type="entry">NECKER, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a well-known
                    statesman and financier of France. He was born on the 30th of September 1732, at
                    Geneva, being descended of a respectable family, originally from the north of
                    Germany. At the age of fifteen be quitted Geneva, and proceeded to Paris with a
                    view to push his fortune in that city. He entered first into the banking-house
                    of Vernet, and afterwards into that of Thelluson, of which he became the
                    cashier, and at length a partner. On the death of Thelluson, he established a
                    bank on his own account, by which he accumulated a very large fortune. After
                    twenty years of unremitting attention to business, he married a Protestant lady
                    of respectable family, but in reduced circumstances, the patrimonial estate
                    having been lost in consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantes. With
                    this lady he appears to have enjoyed the highest degree of domestic happiness. A
                    short time after his marriage, he was named minister of the republic of Geneva
                    at Paris. In accepting of this employment he refused the emoluments which were
                    attached to it, a degree of forbearance not very usual in public men, but in
                    which he resolutely persisted during the whole course of his political life. Two
                    works which he published, namely, an Eulogium on Colbert, and a treatise on the
                    Legislation and Trade of Corn, greatly extended the reputation of his political
                    talents; and he had fortunately succeeded in adjusting some differences between
                    the East India Company and the crown, in such a manner as to receive the
                    approbation of both parties, a circumstance which added to the weight of his
                    character.</p>
                <p>About this time the disorder in the state of the French finances had become so
                    alarming, that it was found necessary to break through the routine of official
                    promotion, and to choose able men for the public service wherever they could be
                    found. These inducements so far outweighed the objections to Μ. Necker, as a
                    foreigner and a Protestant, that, after some conversations with Μ. Maurepas, he
                    was, in the year 1776, appointed director of the royal treasury, and, in the
                    following year, director-general of the finances. The great object of Μ. Necker
                    was to introduce order and economy in the public management. With this view he
                    found himself compelled either to suppress useless offices, or to diminish
                    emoluments; and his retrenchments drew upon him the enmity of all those who
                    suffered by his economical reforms. A party was formed against him, chiefly
                    composed of rapacious courtiers; and though the repeal of several most
                    oppressive imposts had conciliated the general good will of the people, he was
                    daily the object of malicious libels. His severe measures of economy had also
                    excited the dislike of the minister Μ. Maurepas, although others ascribe his
                    hostility to a different cause, namely, to his disappointment at not finding in
                    Necker that subserviency which he expected from a person of his comparatively
                    obscure origin, and a Protestant. Whatever was the reason, the minister was
                    amongst the number of his enemies; and he is charged by Madame de Staël with
                    secretly instigating those libellous attacks of which Μ. Necker now became the
                    object. To enable him, according to Madame de Staël, the better to struggle with
                    his opponents, he requested some signal mark of royal favour, such as a seat in
                    the council, which was granted. This demand on the part of Necker gave rise to
                    new and acrimonious discussions, in the course of which he tendered his
                    resignation, after having been five years in office. Others give a different
                    account of this transaction. Under the influence, it is said, of that passion
                    for popular applause, which proved the torment of his life, he published, in
                    1781, the well-known piece on the state of the finances, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Compte</hi><hi rend="italic">Rendu</hi><hi rend="italic">au
                    Roi,</hi> of which an immense number of copies were sold. Elated by this
                    success, he made a demand for a seat in the council, but was objected to on the
                    ground of his religion. Being persuaded that this scruple would be abandoned, he
                    persisted, and offered his resignation, which was accepted; and in this manner,
                    as is alleged, he became the dupe of his own presumption.</p>
                <p>The enemies of Necker reproached him with indulging, during his short
                    administration, his passion for popularity at the expense of the public
                    interest. The great point which he laboured to establish in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Compte</hi><hi rend="italic">Rendu</hi> was, that there was no
                    deficit in the public revenue, and that there was no necessity for additional
                    taxes. In lieu of new impositions, he is charged with supplying the public
                    necessities by the expedient of large loans; postponing, in this manner, the
                    evil day, but accumulating on posterity an increasing load of debt, which,
                    sooner or later, must be provided for by adequate taxes, and all this to procure
                    a temporary popularity at the expense of his rivals. Notwithstanding these
                    objections, he had numerous partisans, especially amongst the men of letters,
                    who regarded his elevation to power as the triumph of philosophy and liberal
                    principles over aristocratical prejudice.</p>
                <p>After his resignation, he retired to Switzerland, where he purchased the barony
                    of Coppet. In 1784 he published an able work, further illustrating his financial
                    policy, entitled <hi rend="italic">De l’Administration des Finances.</hi> This
                    work, of which 80,000 copies were speedily sold, served to support the
                    reputation of his plans, and also to keep together his adherents, whose numbers
                    formed a counterpoise to the influence of his enemies at court.</p>
                <p>In 1787 Μ. de Calonne convoked the Assembly of the Notables, and, in his opening
                    speech to that body, impeached the accuracy of the statements contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Compte</hi><hi rend="italic">Rendu.</hi> It was not to be
                    supposed that Μ. Necker would quietly submit to this charge. He sent a memorial
                    upon the subject to the king, with various other papers, for the purpose of
                    proving the correctness of his calculations. His majesty having read these
                    documents, requested that they might not be published, a proposition which by no
                    means suited the views of Μ. Necker. His statements were accordingly printed,
                    and for this offence he was exiled, by a <hi rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de cachet,</hi> forty leagues from Paris.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Calonne did not, however, remain long in power; and the Archbishop of
                    Toulouse, by whom he was succeeded, was also obliged to resign, and to make way
                    for Μ. Necker, the favourite of the people, who was reinstated in his former
                    post in August 1788. A new and remarkable era was now about to open in the
                    history both of France and of the world. The writings of the French philosophers
                    and men of letters had gradually given currency to notions of constitutional
                    freedom. The people could no longer endure, like their forefathers, the bondage
                    of feudal privileges, by which the few acquired the power of oppressing the
                    many. They had become jealous and discontented, and were deeply irritated at the
                    insolence and oppression of the aristocratical body; and with those indignant
                    feelings were mingled, in the minds of the popular leaders, the brilliant
                    visions of speculative reform. But as long as the people wanted a legitimate
                    organ through which their voice could be heard, it was clear that whatever<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194557788" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7788-0071"/> might be their
                    feelings, they could make little impression on the measures of the state. What
                    was wanting in this respect was now about to be supplied; and the popular voice,
                    hitherto so little considered, was, through the representative body, to become
                    the pre-eminent influence in the government. At this period the French
                    government was assailed by a complication of difficulties, the chief of which
                    was the impracticability of raising the necessary supplies, and the danger of an
                    immediate bankruptcy. A great scarcity also prevailed at Paris, which rendered
                    the populace unusually discontented and tumultuous. In this emergency various
                    expedients were suggested; and the convocation of the states-general, which had
                    long been talked of, was advised by Μ. Necker, as likely to give general
                    satisfaction to the people. In assenting to this proposition, it was the plan of
                    the court that the different orders of the clergy, nobility, and commons, should
                    vote in separate chambers, in order that the deputies of the commons might be
                    controlled by the other two bodies. But the popular leaders were by far too
                    penetrating to allow their influence to be annihilated by this device. They
                    determined, from the beginning, that the three orders should sit and vote
                    together; and it is well known that, after various fruitless efforts to bring
                    about this union, the commons resolved to form themselves into an assembly for
                    the despatch of business, without regard to the other two chambers. This
                    decisive step proved effectual, and the three chambers at length all met and
                    voted in one house, by which the whole power was thrown into the hands of the
                    commons.</p>
                <p>During these transactions, the king and his advisers pursued a weak and
                    vacillating policy. They perceived, when it was too late, the error they had
                    committed, or supposed themselves to have committed, in putting into the hands
                    of the people the powerful weapon of a representative body. But instead of
                    yielding to the necessity of circumstances, and conciliating this new power,
                    which could no longer be resisted, by conceding with a good grace every just
                    demand of constitutional right, they endeavoured to recover the ground which
                    they had for ever lost, vainly struggling against the power of the commons, and
                    meditating even the most violent measures for the recovery of their authority.
                    It was in pursuance of these views that troops were drawn from the most distant
                    parts, and encamped around Paris; a measure, the only construction that could be
                    put upon which was, that it was intended to overawe the deliberations of the
                    assembly, or, perhaps, to dissolve it at once at the point of the bayonet. These
                    violent courses Μ. Necker opposed, and he was accordingly dismissed on the 11th
                    of July 1789, and ordered to quit the kingdom in twenty-four hours. This order
                    he obeyed with equal secrecy and despatch, and had arrived at Brussels before it
                    was generally known in Paris that he was out of office.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to describe the consternation which prevailed in the capital
                    when the dismission and exile of this favourite minister was made known. The
                    person who first communicated the intelligence was considered as a madman, and
                    with difficulty escaped some harsh treatment; and the event was no sooner
                    confirmed, than all the shops and places of amusement were shut up, and his
                    bust, along with that of the Duke of Orleans, was paraded through the streets,
                    dressed in mourning. These proceedings were interrupted by a German regiment;
                    the busts were broken in pieces; and in the course of the tumult one man lost
                    his life, whilst others were wounded. Fresh troops arriving, a serious conflict
                    now ensued; and an old man being cut down in the Tuilleries by an officer of
                    distinction, the populace were enraged to the highest pitch, and being joined by
                    the French guards, who deserted their officers, they at last succeeded in
                    overpowering the Germans. New outrages and tumults succeeded; the Bastille was
                    stormed; and the capital became the scene of bloody massacres, whilst the
                    people’s minds were at the same time filled with dismay at the near approach of
                    foreign troops, from whom they apprehended nothing less than the sack of the
                    city. In the midst of these alarms, they beseeched the assembly to intercede
                    with the king for the recall of their favourite minister. The necessity of
                    complying with this demand was at length perceived by the king, and a letter was
                    written to Μ. Necker, requesting him to return.</p>
                <p>Μ. Necker was at Basle when he received this letter, with the request contained
                    in which he resolved immediately to comply. His progress to Paris was one
                    continued triumph. He was cheered as he passed through the different towns by
                    the acclamations of multitudes, who hailed him as their deliverer. This
                    popularity, however, was not of long duration. Being alarmed by the·excesses
                    which had already taken place, Μ. Necker became desirous to support the
                    authority of the sovereign; and, without conciliating the confidence of the
                    king’s friends, he lost that of the popular party. By the royalists he was
                    always hated; he now became an object of suspicion to the more violent patriots,
                    and was reproached as an aristocrat. Seeing his popularity on the decline, he
                    resolved to retire; and he accordingly wrote a letter to the assembly, pleading
                    the necessity of repose for the restoration of his health. No notice was taken
                    of this letter; and his personal safety being now in danger from the violence of
                    the people, he quitted Paris in the month of December 1790, having withdrawn in
                    the most private manner possible.</p>
                <p>i After the loss of his power and popularity, Μ. Necker seems to have sunk into
                    the greatest dejection. “I could have wished,” says Mr Gibbon, who passed some
                    days with him about this period, “to have exhibited him as a warning to any
                    aspiring youth possessed with the demon of ambition. With all the means of
                    private happiness in his power, he is the most miserable of human beings; the
                    past, the present, and the future, are equally odious to him. When I suggested
                    some domestic amusements, he answered with a deep tone of despair, ‘ In the
                    state in which I am, I can feel nothing but the blast which has overthrown
                    me.’”</p>
                <p>But his mind was soon diverted from the disappointments of ambition by domestic
                    griefs of a more poignant nature; his wife, to whom he was deeply attached,
                    dying after a long illness, in which he attended her with great affection. He
                    had now recourse to writing to divert his melancholy; and several works, which
                    he published, were the fruits of his labours. He died at Coppet, on the 9th of
                    April 1804, after a short but painful illness. His public character is, of
                    course, differently estimated, according to the political views of parties. In
                    his private and domestic relations he was amiable and affectionate, and appears
                    to have been greatly beloved.</p>
                <p>His writings, besides those already mentioned, are the following: An Answer to
                    the Memorial of the Abbé Morellet, on the East India Company, 1769; Memorials on
                    the Provincial Administrations, 1781; Answer to the Speech pronounced by Μ. de
