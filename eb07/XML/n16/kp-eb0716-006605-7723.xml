                <p><label type="entry">NAZARETH</label>, a town or village of Palestine, celebrated
                    in holy writ as the residence of our Saviour. It is situated in a deep valley,
                    on the side of a high hill, nearer to its summit than its base, and having a
                    rocky eminence along it. It contains about 250 buildings of stone, a material
                    always at hand. They are flat-roofed, generally of only one story, but
                    sufficiently spacious for the accommodation of the numerous poor families by
                    whom they are inhabited. The streets are steep and narrow, and, from the
                    looseness of the soil, exceedingly dirty. Of the public buildings the mosque is
                    the most conspicuous, and is a neat edifice. It is enclosed with a good wall of
                    masonry, so that Mr Buckingham, who visited it, could only see one of its sides,
                    on which there were five arches. It has a plain whitened minaret, surrounded by
                    a gallery, and surmounted by a crescent. The Greeks have a church on the
                    south-eastern edge of the town, at the foot of a hill; and the Maronites have
                    also a church in front of a Franciscan convent. This convent, Mr Buckingham
                    mentions, is one of the largest and most commodious he had seen anywhere, being
                    superior to those of Smyrna, Alexandria, or Cairo. It is still adorned with some
                    precious remains of antiquity. Two antique shafts of red granite columns are
                    used as portals to the door-way. Within is a court, and near the gate at its
                    further extremity is the fragment of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> shaft of another
                    granite column, lying on the ground. White pillars form the portals of entrance
                    to the original building, destroyed by the Turks; and of these the remains are
                    still to be seen. On the wall, both within and without, there are worked into
                    the masonry several pieces of the old ruins, containing delicate sculptures of
                    frize, cornices, capitals, &amp;c. The gate leads to a large paved square, in
                    which there are two wells, surmounted by the cross; and on the right hand is the
                    hall for the reception of strangers and visitors. The interior is furnished with
                    every convenience, in staircases, galleries, and apartments. Mr Buckingham
                    mentions, that he supped in a hall below, of considerable size. The table
                    service consisted altogether of pewter, but every thing was extremely clean, and
                    the provisions were excellent, particularly fine wheaten bread, and wine from
                    Mount Lebanon, not inferior to the wines of France. The church belonging to the
                    monastery is erected over a grotto, which is believed to have belonged to the
                    Virgin Mary. In this place are shown her kitchen and fire-place; and by way of
                    miracle a pillar is exhibited, the capital of which, separated from the shaft,
                    is represented as self-supported in the air. Dr Clarke, however, soon observed
                    that it was fastened into the wall above. Mr Buckingham was shown a second
                    grotto, or a continuation of the first, with two red granite pillars, of about
                    two feet in diameter at its entrance; and he was told that the one marked the
                    spot where the Virgin rested, the other where the angel stood when he appeared
                    to Mary. The church erected over this sacred spot is large, and well furnished
                    with paintings, mostly gaudy, though there were a few not altogether devoid of
                    merit. The synagogue in which Jesus read and expounded the prophet Esaias is
                    shown here within the town; the precipice from which his enemies would have
                    thrown him down is also pointed out; and, according to Mr Buckingham, it is not
                    improbable that this precipice, which overlooks the town, was the scene of this
                    outrage. But the most venerated relic is a stone called the table of Christ,
                    from which he is asserted to have eaten before and after his resurrection.
                    Nazareth forms part of the pachalik of Acre, and was reduced to indigence and
                    misery by the oppression of Djezzar Pasha. Many of the wretched people emigrated
                    in consequence; and several of the neighbouring Arabs said to Dr Clarke, that
                    the beggars in England were better and happier than they. The stationary
                    inhabitants are about 2000, of whom 500 are Catholic Christians, about 300
                    Maronites, and 200 Mahommedans, the rest being schismatic Greeks. Nazareth is
                    fifty miles north from Jerusalem.</p>
