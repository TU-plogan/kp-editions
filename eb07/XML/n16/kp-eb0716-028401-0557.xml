                <p><label type="entry">NOVA SCOTIA</label>, a British province of North America,
                    situated between the parallels of 43. 25. and 46. 0. north latitude, and the
                    meridians 61. 0. and 66.30. of west longitude, and connected with the south-east
                    part of the continent by an isthmus of only eight miles in width. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Strait of Northumberland, which divides it from Prince
                    Edward Island; on the northeast by the Gut of Canseau, which interposes between
                    it and the island of Cape Breton; on the south and southeast by the Atlantic
                    Ocean; on the west by the Bay of Fundy; and on the north-west by New Brunswick.
                    Its extreme length from Cape Canseau on the east to Cape St Mary’s on the west
                    is about 280 miles; but its breadth varies from fifty to about 100 miles, and it
                    contains a superficies of about 16,000 square miles, or upwards of nine millions
                    of acres. From this, however, nearly one third may be deducted for lakes, arms
                    of the sea, and rivers, leaving about seven millions of acres of land, five
                    millions of which may be considered as adapted for cultivation, and the
                    remainder as affording tolerable pasturage. It is estimated that above three
                    millions of acres of these lands still remain vacant, and in the hands of the
                    crown; but the largest unoccupied tracts do not in one place exceed forty
                    thousand acres.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable physical characteristic of this peninsula of the North
                    American continent is the numerous indentations along the coast. The shores are
                    lined with rocks, and studded with thousands of small islands; and close to
                    these, and in the harbours, almost without exception, there is a considerable
                    depth of water. All along the southern shore there is a succession of noble
                    harbours; and coasting vessels sail amongst and within the myriads of islands
                    which line the coast during the most blustering weather, thus enjoying
                    comparatively smooth water, whilst the main ocean heaves in violent agitation.
                    The interior of the country is very agreeably diversified with hill and dale,
                    river and lake, forest and grassy plain. The surface, although undulating, is
                    not mountainous, the highest land, Ardoise Hill or Arthur’s Seat, being only'
                    810 feet above the level of the sea, nearly the same height as Arthur’s Seat at
                    Edinburgh. The highlands generally run north and south, branching off in all
                    directions, and in some instances terminating in bold cliffs on the coast, the
                    most remarkable of which is Aspotagaen, between Mahon and Margaret’s Bay, which
                    is about 500 feet in height. The Horton Mountains run nearly north and south;
                    and the north mountains, which are washed by the Minas Basin, terminate in Cape
                    Blomi-don. The Blue Mountains, which lie in the interior of the counties of
                    Annapolis, Shelb urn, and Queen’s, are said to retain traces of volcanic
                    eruption. There is a great variety of rocks in Nova Scotia, but granite, trap,
                    and clayslate predominate. The most abundant variety is the gray granite, which
                    prevails along the shore, and is well adapted for mill-stones. Trap rocks,
                    sometimes interstratified with clay-slate, protrude in various places in immense
                    parallel ridges above the surface, and frequently in piles of loose masses
                    heaped confusedly together, traversed frequently by veins of quartz. Clay-slate
                    of a very fine quality, and used as a building stone, prevails in the eastern
                    section of the colony; and graywacke and graywacke-slate extend along both
                    shores of Chedabucto Bay, in which are found beds of limestone and numerous
                    species of specular iron ore. In connection with carboniferous limestone are
                    found, both in Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, those immense coal fields which are
                    supposed to rival in extent the mines of the mother country. Varieties of
                    copper, iron, and lead ores are also abundant; and different other minerals of
                    less importance are found. Salt springs, some of them strongly impregnated with
                    saline matters, are met with near Pictou, at River Philip, and some other parts.
                    The soil of Nova Scotia is of many different qualities, and various degrees of
                    fertility. The alluvial, or intervale lands, of which there are extensive
                    tracts, are rich, and produce plentiful returns of wheat, barley, oats, Indian
                    corn, potatoes, turnips, with all the vegetables and fruits common in England.
                    Some of the uplands, lying between the hilly country and the rivers, are light
                    and poor, whilst the high lands are rich and very productive. The lands on the
                    southern coast are generally so rocky as to admit of cultivation only at much
                    expense and labour; but after the stones are removed, the soil is by no means
                    barren.</p>
                <p>The interior of Nova Scotia is intersected and watered by numerous rivers, lakes,
                    and streams, which beautify and enrich the country. The two largest rivers are
                    the Annapolis and the Shubneccadie. The former takes its rise in King’s county,
                    and, running parallel with the bay of Fundy, after a long and serpentine course,
                    in which it receives the Moose and Bear Rivers, discharges itself into Annapolis
                    Bay. It is navigable to a considerable extent, and its banks present a rich and
                    pleasing landscape. The Shubneccadie, issuing from the Grand Lake in the county
                    of Halifax, divides that county from Hants, and, after a rapid and circuitous
                    course, the length of which has not yet been accurately ascertained, discharges
                    itself into the Bay of Minas. It receives the waters of ten other rivers, is
                    navigable for large vessels a long way into the interior, and contains on its
                    banks inexhaustible quantities of gypsum and lime, together with extensive
                    groves of fine timber. At Pictou, three rivers, navigable for large vessels,
                    empty themselves into the harbour; the East, West, and Middle Rivers. Besides
                    these, there are the Avon, navigable for a considerable distance; the La Have,
                    which issues from a chain of interior lakes, and has a course of about sixty
                    miles; the Mersey, which winds from Lake Rosignol through the Queen’s county,
                    and discharges itself into Liverpool Harbour; the Medway, the Shelburn, the
                    Clyde, the Tusket, the St Mary, and others, all of which owe their origin to
                    lakes in the interior. The most extensive still sheet of water is the Rosignol,
                    situated partly in each of the three counties of Queen, Shelburn, and Annapolis.
                    It is said to be thirty miles in length, but is little known. Lake George is
                    also of considerable size; and there are innumerable others, which it is
                    unnecessary to mention. The forests of Nova Scotia still constitute a prominent
                    feature of the country. The trees are the same as those common to America, and
                    the timber is generally large and lofty. Amongst the natural curiosities of this
                    country is a huge granite stone, supposed to weigh about a hundred and
                    sixty-four tons. It stands on the margin of a small lake, encircled with wood,
                    near Halifax, and is so nicely poised on a flinty base of twelve inches, that
                    the strength of one hand will put it in motion, but that of several hundreds
                    could not shift it from its place. There are several remarkable cavernsand
                    grottoes, one of which, at St Peter’s Point, on the coast of the Bay of Fundy,
                    displays in the interiora spacious ball, the roof of which is fretted with
                    stalactites; and brilliant gems are observed sparkling at the moment that the
                    light of a torch or a candle approaches. The climate of Nova Scotia was for many
                    years after its discovery considered as an insuperable barrier to agricultural
                    industry, and an idea long prevailed in England that it was peculiarly the
                    region of snow and fog. The temperature is indeed colder in winter in this
                    peninsula than it is in Great Britain; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560570"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0570-0285"/>but when the weather is cold it is usually dry,
                    and altogether the winter is milder, and the summer less intensely hot, than at
                    Quebec. The summer heat is moderate and regular; the autumn is a delightful
                    season; and there is seldom any severe winter weather until the end of December.
                    Frost continues generally from Christmas to April, only interrupted by a thaw,
                    which almost invariably takes place in January. The heaviest snow-storms occur
                    in February. Rain falls in greatest abundance in spring and autumn; and a fog
                    prevails on the south shore near the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, but does not
                    extend far inland.</p>
                <p>The wild animals are the moose, carriboo, bear, loup-cervier, tiger-cat, fox,
                    marten, otter, mink, beaver, muskrat, porcupine, racoon, wood-chuck, fisher,
                    weasel, squirrel, hare, and the like, all of which, excepting the two last, have
                    rapidly decreased in number. Nearly all the birds common to North America
                    frequent Nova Scotia; and there are but very few kinds of fish which are found
                    in the American seas that do not frequent the shores of this colony in vast
                    swarms.</p>
                <p>Nova Scotia is divided intoten counties, including Cape Breton; and the counties
                    are subdivided into districts and townships as follows, viz. Halifax, divided
                    into the districts of Halifax, Colchester, and Pictou, and containing the
                    townships of Halifax, Dartmouth, Preston, Lawrence Town, Truro, Onslow,
                    Londonderry, Pictou, Egerton, and Maxwelton; Lunenburg, containing the townships
                    of Chester, Lunenburg, and Dublin; Queen’s county, containing the township of
                    Liverpool; Shelburn, containing the townships of Shelburn, Yarmouth, Barrington,
                    Argyle, and Pub-nico Annapolis, containing the townships of Digby, Clements,
                    Clare, Annapolis, Granville, and Wilmot; King’s county, containing the townships
                    of Aylesworth, Cornwallis, Horton, and Sherbrooke; Cumberland, containing the
                    townships of Wallace, Amherst, and Pamborough; Hants, containing the townships
                    of Falmouth, Windsor, Rawdon, Kempt, Douglas, and Newport; Sydney, divided into
                    the Upper and Lower Districts, and containing the townships of St Mary’s,
                    Guysborough, Manchester, Wilmot, and Dorchester, or Antigonish; and Cape Breton,
                    divided into the north-western, north-eastern, and southern districts. The
                    townships are not all of equal extent, nor are there, as will be seen, the same
                    number in each county. The inhabitants meet, like an English parish, in vestry,
                    and assess themselves for the support of the poor. This regular subdivision
                    affords facilities for the administration of justice; and the principal
                    townships send representatives to the House of Assembly.</p>
                <p>Halifax is the largest county in the province, stretching quite across it from
                    the Atlantic Ocean to Cumberland Straits. It is bounded on the east by the
                    county of Sydney, on the west by the counties of Hants and Lunenburg, and on the
                    north by the county of Cumberland. The whole southern shore is washed by the
                    Atlantic Ocean, and a part of the northern shore by Northumberland Straits. With
                    the exception of the township of Halifax itself, the general appearance of the
                    three districts into which the county is divided corresponds with that of the
                    province as a whole; its surface being everywhere diversified by hill and dale,
                    and well irrigated by rivers and brooks. All the southern part which lies upon
                    the Atlantic is high, broken, rocky land, interspersed here and there with some
                    good belts of soil, but in general it is barren and uncultivated. The extensive
                    tract of country surrounding the Great Lake bears the same character, as does
                    that which extends several miles along the eastern and western sides of the
                    Shubneccadie River. Halifax, the capital city of the province, is situated on
                    the south-east coast, in latitude 44. 40. north, and longitude 63. 40. west. It
                    is built on the eastern side of a small peninsula, upon the declivity of a hill,
                    which rises gradually from the water’s edge; its length being about two miles,
                    and its breadth about half a mile, with wide streets crossing each other at
                    right angles, and containing nearly 2000 houses, and a population, including
                    strangers, of about 20,000. It has been very much improved within the last ten
                    years. The front of the town is lined with wharfs, alongside of which vessels of
                    all sizes are continually discharging or taking on board their cargoes. The
                    harbour of Halifax has perhaps not a superior in any part of the world,
                    affording safe anchorage for a thousand ships at once; and it is accordingly the
                    chief naval station of Great Britain in North America. It is accessible at all
                    seasons of the year, being scarcely ever ice-bound, as Quebec annually is. It
                    lies nearly north and south, extending in this direction about sixteen miles,
                    and terminating in a beautiful sheet of water called Bedford Basin, within which
                    are ten square miles of excellent anchorage. The bay from which the entrance of
                    the harbour leads is formed between Sambro Head and Devil’s Island, on the
                    former of which a lighthouse was very early erected. There are four islands
                    still farther in, upon the smallest of which, opposite the town, there are
                    batteries strongly mounted, whilst several other fortifications command the
                    harbour. A second lighthouse has been established on M‘Nab’s Island, situated
                    near the mouth of the harbour. This island forms two entrances to the harbour;
                    the eastern passage being for small vessels only, the other having depth of
                    water for ships of all sizes. Above the wharfs already mentioned are numerous
                    warehouses; and on the acclivity are the houses of the citizens, public
                    buildings, and other structures. The houses are very irregular in height, but
                    many of them are handsome stone and brick buildings, whilst those of wood are
                    neatly faced with plaster or stucco. The public edifices are substantial, the
                    Province Building in particular being one of the finest in our American
                    colonies. It contains chambers for the council and legislative assembly, the
                    supreme court, and all the provincial offices. The government-house, at the
                    south end of the capital, is an antique baronial-looking edifice; and the
                    military hospital, and other structures, are elegant and substantial. The
                    dock-yard is one of the finest establishments out of Britain. There are a number
                    of churches, and other places for public worship; and several markets, which are
                    extremely well supplied with necessaries. Amongst the benevolent institutions of
                    this city may be mentioned a college, which was established in 1820; and seven
                    or eight newspapers, and a monthly magazine, are published. The intercourse
                    between Halifax and Europe, America, the West Indies, &amp;c. is regular and
                    certain; and ever since its first settlement in 1749, it has continued to be of
                    considerable importance, not only as a rendezvous for his majesty’s ships, and
                    as the head-quarters of the troops on the establishment of the lower American
                    provinces, but also as the centre of a profitable fishery and trade. The
                    manufactures carried on consist chiefly of sugar-refining, distillation of
                    spirits, porter and ale brewing, and the making of soap, candles, leather,
                    flour, and cordage, and a few other minor articles. Halifax is a free
                    warehousing port, and its trade is very considerable.</p>
                <p>Opposite to Halifax, on the eastern side of the harbour, stands the little town
                    of Dartmouth. It was laid out about the time that the capital was founded, but
                    in 1756 it was destroyed by the Indians, together with most of the inhabitants.
                    It was subsequently resettled, and has slowly increased in population, and
                    extended in size. The lands on the Dartmouth side of the harbour are much less
                    stubborn than those on the opposite shore; and the industrious descendants of
                    the original German settlers have long subjected them to a fair and profitable
                    cultivation. The various other townships or settlements in the county of Halifax

                <p>They all contain a considerable quantity of excellent soil, and a small town or
                    hamlet where the settlers reside. Truro, situated on the southern side of
                    Cobequid Bay, near its head, contains about one hundred houses, and a number of
                    public buildings. The district of Pictou, which contains three townships, has a
                    very good soil, and, besides a great coalfield, abounds with iron ore, copper,
                    freestone, and lime. It has a number of excellent harbours, the principal port
                    being called Pictou. It is admirably situated on the Straits of Northumberland,
                    opposite Prince Edward Island, on the route from Halifax to Quebec, between
                    which places there is not a safer or better shelter for ships. The town of
                    Pictou, situated about two miles from the entrance, is well built, and contains
                    four churches, with other public edifices, and about 3000 inhabitants. It is a
                    free port, and its trade in lumber, coal, and the fishery, is considerable. An
                    excellent newspaper is published at this place.</p>
                <p>The county of Lunenburg is bounded on the north by King’s county and that of
                    Annapolis, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the east by Halifax, and on
                    the west by Queen’s county. It extends forty miles from east to west, and its
                    extreme width is thirty-five miles, exclusive of nearly three hundred islands
                    scattered along its shores. The land is in general covered with spruce and fir
                    timber, well watered, and capable of cultivation. The principal harbour is Mahon
                    Bay, which is very extensive, and affords secure anchorage inside its numerous
                    islands to vessels of the greatest magnitude. Chester town is situated on the
                    north side of the bay, about nine miles from its mouth, upon a snug and
                    commodious harbour. It is a thriving place, and carries on a very considerable
                    lumber trade and fishery. It was first settled by people from New England, who
                    afterwards abandoned the place. They were succeeded by Germans, who, being
                    industrious, soon secured their own independence and the prosperity of the
                    settlement. The population of the bay amounts to about 2000, who are chiefly
                    employed in agriculture, preparing lumber for exportation at the saw-mills, and
                    in fishery. Near the entrance of Mahon Bay, upon the western side, lies the
                    harbour of Lunenburg, the county town. It is regularly constructed, and contains
                    the county buildings, above 140 dwelling-houses, besides stores, and about 1400
                    inhabitants of Dutch and German origin. A few miles to the westward is La Have,
                    one of the largest rivers in Nova Scotia, and settled principally by Germans,
                    who own a number of saw-mills and grist-mills. The harbour is very spacious,
                    consisting of an outer and an inner place of anchorage. Considerable quantities
                    of fish are taken here, and several vessels are annually freighted with lumber
                    and timber for Great Britain. Several islands well calculated for drying fish
                    lie at the entrance, and they also form a protection to the shipping. Most of
                    the islands in this county remain in their natural state; but one, called the
                    Great Tancook, is settled, and contains thirty families.</p>
                <p>Queen’s county is bounded on the east by the county of Lunenburg, on the west by
                    the county of Shelburn, on the north by the county of Annapolis, and on the
                    south by the Atlantic Ocean. The interior of this county is stony, and generally
                    incapable of cultivation. On the sea-board, however, it is better, and there are
                    here several tracts of respectable soil, and some thriving settlements.
                    Liverpool, the county town, and the second place in the province, is situated
                    upon a harbour of the same name, about eighty miles west from Halifax. It is
                    regularly laid out and well built, containing a court-house, jail, several
                    places of public worship, a fort, above two hundred dwelling-houses, and a great
                    many wharfs, stores, and other buildings. There is a good lighthouse at the
                    entrance of the harbour, which never freezes over. The trade of the place is
                    very flourishing, consisting chiefly in lumber and fish; but a considerable
                    trade in timber is also carried on. Port Medway, into which the river Medway
                    runs, is a very fine harbour, capacious, and safe. There are some other small
                    settlements in this county, but none requiring special notice.</p>
                <p>Shelburn county is bounded on the north by Annapolis county, on the south and
                    west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the east by Queen’s county. It contains four
                    townships, one of which, Yarmouth, comprises 100,000 acres of land, exclusive of
                    lakes, of which Lake George is one. In the interior, this county remains, with
                    few exceptions, in the state of a wilderness; but some parts arc agreeably
                    diversified, and in point of scenery it is one of the most beautiful portions of
                    Nova Scotia. Shelburn, the shire-town, is built upon a harbour of the same name,
                    which is esteemed one of the best in America. It has a lighthouse at the
                    entrance, and is twelve miles in length, easy of access, and perfectly secure,
                    affording anchorage for the largest vessels. This town was at one time of
                    considerable importance, containing, it is said, about 12,000 inhabitants; but
                    the population does not now exceed 500. A few miles westward of Shelburn is Cape
                    Negro Harbour, sheltered by a high island of the same name. It forms the
                    embouchure of the river Clyde, which winds forty miles through the county, has
                    finely wooded banks, and, next to Annapolis, the most beautiful stream in the
                    province. Within Capc Sable Island, the most northern point in Nova Scotia, is
                    Barrington Harbour, where fishing to a considerable extent is carried on.
                    Yarmouth or Cape Fourche Harbour is the principal and most thriving place in
                    this part of the province. Its harbour is large, well sheltered, safe, and
                    navigable for ships up to Yarmouth village. Yarmouth and its neighbourhood
                    contain an industrious population of about 4500 inhabitants, who possess about
                    seventy vessels and large stocks of cattle. It has always gone on steadily
                    improving, and promises, from its numerous local advantages, to become a place
                    of considerable importance. Shebogue River, in this part of the province, is
                    navigable for seven miles from the sea, and at its mouth expands into a good
                    harbour.</p>
                <p>Annapolis county is bounded on the north and west by the Bay of Fundy, on the
                    south by Shelburn, Queen’s, and Lunenburg counties, and on the east by King’s
                    county. The first European settlements in Nova Scotia were established in this
                    county by the French, who made some very extensive improvements. They founded
                    Annapolis, the county town, and gave it the name of Port Royal. It is built upon
                    a peninsula, which, projecting into the river of the same designation, forms two
                    beautiful basins, one above and another below the town. Although once the
                    metropolis of Nova Scotia, it is not now more than a thriving village,
                    containing about sixty dwelling-houses, with the government buildings, several
                    places of public worship, and some stores. The trade is comparatively
                    insignificant, and arises principally from the fishery. Digby, which has sprung
                    up into a town within the last fifty or sixty years, is a much larger place,
                    containing about two hundred houses. The inhabitants here and in the
                    neighbourhood are principally engaged in the cod and mackerel fishery along the
                    coast. Bridgetown, another thriving village, is situated at die head of the
                    navigation of the river, and from this place the produce of the inland districts
                    is shipped for exportation. Fish of various kinds, such as shad, bass, salmon,
                    and particularly herring frequent Annapolis basin. About seven miles from
                    Annapolis, on a stream called Moose River, an iron foundery has been established
                    by a company under the protection of a legislative charter. The buildings are
                    extensive and substantial, and the iron ore is excellent; but a similar work at
                    Pictou possesses the great advantage of a coal mine in the immediate vicinity.
                    The basin of Minas, in this county, is one of the two great <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560596" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0596-0287"/>branches of the Bay of Fundy.
                    Its entrance is through a strait about three miles in width, with bold, abrupt
                    shores, within which it widens from eight to sixteen miles, and, receiving the
                    waters of upwards of twenty rivers and streams, extends about fifty miles to the
                    head of Cobequid Bay. The tide rises sometimes so high as seventy feet in the
                    bay, and flows with great rapidity, particularly when under the influence of
                    high winds. The other townships of this county are thriving places, containing
                    from 1000 to between 3000 and 4000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>King’s county is bounded on the south by the counties ofLunenburg and Hants, on
                    the north by the Bay of Fundy, on the east by Cumberland county, and on the west
                    by that of Annapolis. The township of Horton, in this county, contains about
                    4000 acres of diked land, besides intervale and salt marshes; and the upland,
                    which is hilly and broken, consists mostly of good tillage land. The principal
                    town is Kentville, on the borders of Cornwallis, containing several good private
                    houses, a court-house, a jail, and a grammar school. The township of Cornwallis
                    is well watered by several rivers, and the land throughout is of the very best
                    quality, being so fertile as to have obtained the name of the garden of the
                    province. The township of Aylesford is similar to it in soil and productions;
                    but that of Parrsburgh is much broken and hilly, although in many parts the soil
                    is excellent.</p>
                <p>Cumberland county is bounded on the north-west by the Chignecto Channel, the
                    Missiguash River, and part of New Brunswick; on the east by the straits of
                    Northumberland; on the south-east by the county of Halifax; and on the
                    south-west by King’s county. The soil of this county is various, containing a
                    considerable portion of excellent land, with some that is not so productive. On
                    the shore of the Chignecto Channel and Cumberland Basin there are considerable
                    tracts of valuable marsh land. The upland is in general of very superior
                    quality, and there are several thousand acres of dike land of the most
                    productive description. Coal, lime, and gypsum, are found almost everywhere; and
                    iron and copper ores have been discovered at several places. Rivers and streams
                    traverse the county in almost every direction, and it has several fine harbours
                    on both its shores. It contains a number of thriving settlements, particularly
                    those of Fort Lawrfence, Amherst, Wallace, and West Chester; but none of the
                    towns requires particular notice.</p>
                <p>Hants county is bounded upon the north by the Minas Basin, on the east by
                    Shubneccadie River, which separates it from Halifax, on the south by parts of
                    the counties of Halifax and Lunenburg, and on the west by King’s county. This
                    county contains a considerable quantity of the very finest soil, and is well
                    settled throughout. Windsor, the shire-town, is situated at the confluence of
                    the Avon, Windsor, and St Croix Rivers, and is a neat, well-built place,
                    containing about one hundred and thirty dwelling-houses, and a number of public
                    buildings, particularly an university, King’s College, an academy called the
                    Collegiate School, and several places of worship. This is the only town in the
                    county, the other settlements being small hamlets planted in positions
                    favourable for agriculture or fishing.</p>
                <p>Sydney county, forming the most easterly part of the province, is bounded on the
                    west by the county of Halifax; on the south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the east
                    by Chedabucto Bay, the Gut of Canseau, and St George’s Bay; and on the north by
                    Northumberland Straits. It is divided into an upper and a lower district, the
                    former being, in an agricultural point of view, far superior to the latter; and,
                    notwithstanding the numerous and beautiful harbours on the bays and coasts, and
                    the valuable fisheries, it is much more populous. The village of Dorchester,
                    situated about a mile above the navigation on Antigonish River, is the principal
                    trading place in the district. The lower district of Sydney extends on its
                    interior or northern boundary about forty miles, and on its western side (on the
                    sea coast) about one hundred and twenty miles. No part of Nova Scotia, and
                    perhaps few countries in the world, can boast of so many excellent harbours in
                    the same extent of coast. Many of them are navigable for the largest vessels,
                    and numbers affording safe and extensive anchorage-ground for ships of moderate
                    size occur at intervals of only a few miles. The soil along the shore being
                    stubborn, the agricultural resources of this part of the county are inferior to
                    those of the upper district; but it possesses much greater facilities for
                    commerce and navigation, and its fisheries are the best in the province.</p>
                <p>For a general description and history of Cape Breton, the reader is referred to
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Breton, Cape.</hi> In many respects it bears so
                    close a resemblance to Nova Scotia as to supersede any further description. The
                    staple products of the island are fish, coal, gypsum, and timber. In 1832 the
                    exports were, timber, 9500 loads; coals, 22,911 chaldrons; pickled fish, 21,000
                    barrels;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A great part of

                    2500 barrels; live stock, 820 head; oats, 6000 bushels; potatoes, 13,000 ditto;
                    total value, L.780,000. The imports, consisting chiefly of British manufactures,
                    amount to nearly the same sum. The revenue, amounting to about L.4000 a year, is
                    expended in salaries to a few public functionaries, in improving roads, and for
                    other purposes. This island is incorporated with Nova Scotia, and contains about
                    30,000 inhabitants, who send two members to the Provincial Assembly.</p>
                <p>Sable Island, although distant about eighty-five miles from Nova Scotia, is
                    considered as belonging to that province. It lies directly in the track of
                    vessels bound to or from Europe, and has been the scene of numerous and
                    melancholy shipwrecks. Within a few years forty vessels have been wrecked on it;
                    and in one year two hundred people perished on its shores. It is thirty miles in
                    length by about one and a half in breadth, the west end being in latitude 43.
                    56. 42. north, and longitude 60. 71. 15. west; and the eastern end in latitude
                    43. 59. 5. north, and longitude 59. 42. west. It is a barren desert throughout,
                    the soil consisting chiefly of sand, and the only vegetable productions being a
                    coarse grass and some wild berries. A sum of L.800 is devoted to keeping on the
                    island a superintendent from Nova Scotia, with a party of men provided with
                    provisions and other necessaries, for the purpose of affording assistance to any
                    shipwrecked mariners, of whatsoever nation, who may be driven upon its
                    inhospitable shores. There is a small stock of cattle on the island, but the
                    chief supplies of food are obtained from Nova Scotia.</p>
                <p>Agriculture was long almost entirely neglected in Nova Scotia, as other pursuits
                    afforded a more immediate return for labour and capital. In fact, the
                    cultivation of the soil was looked upon as rather a degrading employment, and
                    ranked far below that of the petty shop-keeper or itinerant pedlar. In 1817,
                    however, a board of agriculture was formed, the ob-jectsof which were, the
                    encouragement of agriculture on the most approved system; the improving of the
                    breed of horses, and of all kinds of live stock; the importing of the best kinds
                    of seeds, and the awarding of prizes to those who should excel in these various
                    departments. Under the auspices of this society and its numerous branches,
                    agriculture has made greater advances than could have been anticipated from the
                    contempt in which it had previously been held; but still farming operations are

                <p>The soil will produce, and the climate ripen, all the agricultural productions of
                    England in great perfection, so that it is unnecessary to specify individual
                    crops. The province is well stocked with horses, horned cattle, sheep, and
                    swine; and the last species of stock has more than doubled within the last
                    twenty-five years. There are few manufactures, properly so called, carried on in
                    Nova Scotia; but the preparation of lumber and ship-building are sometimes so
                    denominated. Saw-mills abound in every district, and the quantity of lumber
                    prepared and exported is immense. Ship-building is carried on to a great extent.
                    The average quantity has been estimated at 10,000 tons per annum, principally
                    sloops, schooners, and vessels for the fisheries. The total quantity of timber
                    shipped from the colony in 1833 was valued at L.62,447. The total value of the
                    produce of the mines exported was L.105,329, and of the fisheries L.127,455.
                    There were exported besides, beef, pork, flour, grindstones, gypsum, and other
                    articles, to the value of L.592,136, making the total amount of exports
                    L.887,367. The following parliamentary return presents a tabular view of the
                    exports from Nova Scotia, exclusive of Cape Breton, for several years ending 5th
                    January.</p>

                <p>The fish is thus the staple article of the trade of this province. The fishery is
                    carried on principally on the eastern shore, in and about Chedabucto Bay; on the
                    southern shore, at Lunenburg, Liverpool, and Shelburn; on the western shore, at
                    Yarmouth, Clare, Argyle, and Barrington; and at Annapolis, in the Bay of Fundy.
                    The fish principally taken are cod, herrings, mackerel, shad, alewives, and
                    salmon. The British fishermen complain much of the injuries which they receive
                    from the French and Americans, who are permitted to fish upon the coasts of our
                    North American colonies.</p>
                <p>The imports of Nova Scotia consist chiefly of British manufactures and spirits,
                    sugar, wines, and other articles from our colonies. The following is an abstract
                    of goods imported between the 31st <hi rend="italic">of</hi> December 1832, and
                    the 31st of December 1833, for which duties were paid or secured at the excise
                    office, including the island of Cape Breton:—Wine, 113,671 gallons; rum, brandy,
                    and gin, 887,352 gallons; sugar, 41,990 cwts.; beef and pork, 6016 pounds;
                    flour, 32,263 pounds; tobacco, 186,690 pounds. The amount of goods imported,
                    paying <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties, was L.347,388, and the amount
                    of duties levied was L. 105,386. The total value of the importations for that
                    year was L.1,035,660.</p>
                <p>With regard to the shipping of the colony, the total number of vessels inwards in
                    1833 was 1950, of 163,385 tons; and in 1834, 3068, of 253,921 tons. The total
                    number outwards in 1833 was 2330, of 179,956; and in 1834, 3116, of 250,239
                    tons. They belonged chiefly to Great Britain and the British colonies. To show
                    the increase of trade, it may be stated, that in 1807 the shipping
                    enterin&lt;&gt;∙ Nova Scotia was not more than 25,000 tons.</p>
                <p>The revenue of Nova Scotia is chiefly derived from the custom and excise duties
                    above mentioned, to which are added other items of small amount derived from the
                    sale of crown lands, which in 1831 realized L.645, and in 1832, L.1063; from the
                    rent of the coal-mines, which is upwards ofL.4000 per annum; and from the
                    lighthouse dues, which amount to an annual average of L.2000. Accordin&lt;&gt;∙

                <p>The colony of Nova Scotia is quite adequate to defray all its civil expenditure,
                    and the parliamentary grants, much of which had been applied to clerical
                    purposes, were nearly all withdrawn in 1833, with the exception of that given to
                    the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In 1831 the civil and military
                    expenditure amounted to L.94,876, which was less than the revenue. Besides the
                    salaries of the different functionaries, a considerable sum has been laid out
                    annually in making and repairing roads and bridges, keeping up lighthouses, and
                    for the purposes of religion and education. The established church is
                    Episcopalian, and under the management of a bishop, archdeacon, and thirty-two
                    clergymen, who by the last census had under their charge 28,659 people. Of the
                    church of Scotland there are twelve ministers, having 37,227 hearers. Of the
                    Roman Catholic church there are a bishop and fourteen priests, with 20,401
                    members. There are, besides, 19,790 Baptists, 9408 Methodists, 2968 Lutherans,
                    4417 dissenters from the church of England, 405 from the church of Scotland, 153
                    Quakers, and some few other persuasions. About 50,000 acres of land have been
                    granted for the support of religion and schools. For the year ending November
                    1832 there were in the province 420 schools, at which 11,771 scholars attended;
                    and independently of these there were twenty-four grammar-schools. Dalhousie
                    College, at Halifax, is in constitution similar to the University of Edinburgh.
                    There is a fine institution, called King’s College, at Windsor, with regularly
                    educated <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560622" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0622-0289"
                    />professors and others; and Pietou College is likewise an excellent
                    institution.</p>
                <p>NovaSeotia is governed by a lieutenant-governor, council, and house of assembly.
                    The president of the council is the chief justice of the province; the next in
                    station is the bishop, and there are ten other members. The house of assembly
                    contains forty-two members, each of the ten counties returning two, except the
                    county of Halifax, which returns four, and the town of Halifax two; seventeen
                    other towns return each a member, and the island of Cape Breton sends two. The
                    house of assembly act, and the laws are administered, as in Canada. There is a
                    strong body of militia for the defence of the province, the name of every male
                    from sixteen to sixty being enrolled. The king’s troops consist of artillery and
                    engineer detachments, and two regiments of infantry. Halifax is the chief naval
                    station for the West Indies and North America, the commander-in-chief being a
                    vice-admiral, with a suitable fleet. The forts protecting Halifax town and
                    harbour are strong, and the interior of the country is well guarded by the
                    militia.</p>
                <p>By the last census, which was taken in the year 1827, the population, exclusive
                    of Cape Breton, was 123,848. In 1837 it cannot be estimated under 145,000; for
                    during the last ten years a great quantity of land has been sold, and a number
                    of settlers have gone out, whilst the revenue has also greatly increased. The
                    inhabitants consist of natives, the descendants of Europeans, English, Scotch,
                    Irish, Americans, loyalists, Germans, Acadian French, Indians, and freed
                    negroes. They mingle and live together in much harmony, and, generally, the
                    social state of this province is rapidly improving. Its prosperity has greatly
                    increased; and, instead of importing, it now exports provisions. Its fisheries,
                    to which proper attention is at length paid, its rich and prolific soil, and its
                    mines of coal and iron, are sources of wealth which were too long neglected by
                    Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Our limits will only admit of a brief abstract of the history of Nova Scotia.
                    Ancient authorities state that it was discovered by the Cabots in 1497; but it
                    was not until 1604 that the French attempted to form settlements. They were,
                    however, expelled from it by the English colonists of Virginia, who claimed the
                    country in right of the discovery of Sebastian Cabot. In 1621, Sir William
                    Alexander obtained a grant of the whole peninsula, and it was named in the
                    patent Nova Scotia, instead of Acadia, as the country was called by the French.
                    In the mean time, the latter obtained a footing in it a second time; and it was
                    not until 1654, when a strong force was despatched by Cromwell, that the French
                    settlers were brought undersubjection. In 1667, Nova Scotia was ceded to France
                    by the treaty of Breda; but, after suffering during the war which broke out in
                    1701, as well as previously, it was finally ceded to England by treaty in the
                    year 1711. From this period till 1749 it was neglected by Great Britain; but the
                    designs of the French called the attention of government to the province.
                    Encouragements were held out to settlers, parliament gave a large grant, and
                    about 4000 adventurers with their families embarked for the colony. Halifax was
                    immediately founded; but the French settlers, under the name of neutrals, were
                    still very numerous; and, with the aid of the Indians, they inflicted repeated
                    injuries upon the British, until they were forcibly expelled by the latter. In
                    1758 a constitution was granted to Nova Scotia; and the capture of Louisburg, in
                    the island of Cape Breton, during the same year, gave additional security to the
                    colony, which now began to improve. By the treaty of Paris, lθth of February
                    1762, France resigned all further claims on any of her former possessions in
                    North America, and nothing of any material importance has since occurred. New
                    Brunswick and Cape Breton were separated into two distinct governments in 1784,
                    and the latter was re-annexed to Nova Scotia in 1819. This the colonists
                    strongly protested against, and applied to government to allow them to remain as
                    a separate province; but, as might have been expected, their application proved
                    unsuccessful. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
