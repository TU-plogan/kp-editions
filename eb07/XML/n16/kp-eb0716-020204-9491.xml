                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    Greek historian, was born about the close of the thirteenth century, and
                    flourished in the fourteenth, under the Emperors Andronicus, John Palaeologus,
                    and John Cantacuzenus. He was a great favourite of the elder Andronicus, who
                    made him librarian of the church of Constantinople, and sent him as ambassador
                    to the Prince of Servia. He accompanied this emperor in his misfortunes, and
                    assisted at his death, after which he repaired to the court of the younger
                    Andronicus, where he seems to have been well received; and it is certain that,
                    by his influence over the Greeks, that church was prevailed on to refuse
                    entering into any conference with the legates of Pope John XXII. But in the
                    dispute which arose between Barlaam and Palamos, he took part with the former,
                    and maintained his cause zealously in the council held at Constantinople in
                    1351. For this he was cast into prison, and continued there till the return of
                    John Palaeologus, who released him; after which he held a disputation with
                    Palamos, in the presence of that emperor. He compiled the Byzantine history from
                    1204, when Constantinople was taken by the French, to the death of Andronicus
                    the younger, in 1341; a work which is not only barbarous in style, but
                    inaccurate in facts. This history, with a Latin translation by Jerome Wolf, was
                    printed at Basil in 1562, and again at Geneva in 1615; but a more correct
                    edition than either of the preceding is that which was printed at the Louvre in
                    1702, by Boivin, in two vols. folio. Nicephorus was the author of several other
                    works, all of which remain inedited, excepting his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scholia</hi> upon the treatise of Synesius <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Insomniis,</hi> which were published by Turnebus in 1553.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nicephorus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Calistus,</hi> a learned
                    monk of Constantinople, who flourished in the fourteenth century, under the
                    Emperor Andronicus Palaeologus the elder. He wrote in Greek an ecclesiastical
                    history in twenty-three books, eighteen of which are still extant, and contain
                    the transactions of the church from the birth of Christ till the death of the
                    Emperor Phocas in the year 610. Of the other five books we have nothing but the
                    arguments, which show that they embraced the portion extending from the
                    commencement of the reign of the Emperor Heraclius to the end of that of Leo the
                    Philosopher, who died in the year 911. This history was dedicated to Andronicus
                    Palaeologus the elder; it was translated into Latin by John Langius, and has
                    gone through several editions, the best of which is that of Paris, published in
                    1630.</p>
