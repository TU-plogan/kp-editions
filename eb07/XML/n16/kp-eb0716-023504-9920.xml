                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NOBILITY</label>, in general, signifies dignity, grandeur, or
                    greatness, but more particularly antiquity of family, joined with riches. In the
                    common acceptation of the word, it means that quality or dignity which raises a
                    man above the rank of a commoner.</p>
                <p>Whether that equality of rank and condition which has sometimes been contended
                    for would be more agreeable to the order of nature, or more conducive to the
                    happiness and prosperity of mankind, may be made a question; but it is one, we
                    apprehend, which cannot receive different answers from men capable of reflecting
                    without prejudice and partiality. A state of perfect equality can subsist only
                    amongst beings possessing equal talents and virtues; but such beings are not
                    human. Were all mankind under the constant influence of the laws of virtue, a
                    distinction of ranks would be unnecessary; but in that case civil government
                    itself would likewise be unnecessary, because men would have attained all that
                    perfection to which it is the object of civil government as well as of religion
                    to guide them, and everyman would then be a law unto himself. But whilst, in so
                    many breasts, the selfish passions predominate over those which are social,
                    violence must be restrained by authority; and there can be no authority without
                    a distinction of ranks, such as may influence-public opinion.</p>
                <p>It is observed by Hume, that government is founded solely on opinion; and that
                    this opinion is of two kinds, opinion of interest and opinion of right. When a
                    people are persuaded that it is their interest to support the government under
                    which they live, that government must necessarily be stable. But amongst the
                    worthless and unthinking part of the community, this persuasion has seldom
                    anyplace. All men, however, have a notion of rights —of a right to property, and
                    a right to power; and when the majority of a nation considers a certain order of
                    men as having aright to that eminence in which they are placed, this opinion,
                    call it prejudice or what you will, contributes much to the peace and happiness
                    of civil society.</p>
                <p>“The distinction of rank and honours,” says Blackstone, “is necessary in every
                    well-governed state, in order to reward such as are eminent for their services
                    to the public, in a manner the most desirable to individuals, and yet without
                    burden to the community; exciting thereby an ambitious yet laudable ardour, and
                    generous emulation, in others. And emulation, or virtuous ambition, is a spring
                    of action which, however dangerous or invidious in a mere republic or under a
                    despotic sway, will certainly be attended with good effects under a free
                    monarchy; where, without destroying its existence, its excesses may be
                    continually restrained by that superior power from which all honour is derived.
                    Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, 'fives life and vigour to the
                    community; it sets all the wheels of government in motion, which, under a wise
                    regulator, may be directed to any beneficial purpose; and thereby every
                    individual may be made subservient to the public good, while he principally
                    means to promote his own particular views. A body of nobility is also more
                    peculiarly necessary in our mixed and compounded constitution, in order to
                    support the rights of both the crown and the people, by forming a barrier to
                    withstand the encroachments of both. It creates and preserves that gradual scale
                    of dignity which proceeds from the peasant to the prince; rising like a pyramid
                    from a broad foundation, and diminishing to a point as it rises. It is this
                    ascending and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government; for
                    when the departure is sudden from one extreme to another, we may pronounce that
                    state to be precarious.”</p>
                <p>The origin of nobility in Europe is a subject involved in considerable obscurity.
                    In this place we shall only consider the manner in which nobility may be created
                    in this country, with the incidents attending it.</p>
                <p>1. The right of peerage seems to have been originally territorial, that is,
                    annexed to lands, honours, castles, manors, and the like, the proprietors and
                    possessors of which were, in right of those estates, allowed to be peers of the
                    realm, and were summoned to parliament to do suit and service to their
                    sovereign; and, when the land was alienated, the dignity passed along with it as
                    an appendage. Thus in England the bishops still sit in the House of Lords in
                    right of succession to certain ancient baronies annexed, or supposed to be
                    annexed, to their episcopal lands; and thus in 11 Henry VI. the possession of
                    the castle of Arundel was adjudged to confer an earldom on its possessor. But
                    afterwards, when alienations became frequent, the dignity of the peerage was
                    confined to the lineage of the party ennobled, and, instead of territorial,
                    became personal. Actual proof of a tenure by barony became no longer necessary
                    to constitute a lord of parliament; but the record <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    writ of summons to him or his ancestors was admitted as a sufficient evidence of
                    the tenure.</p>
                <p>Peers of Great Britain are now created either by writ or by patent; for those who
                    claim by prescription must suppose either a writ or patent to have been issued
                    or granted to their ancestors, though by length of time it has been lost. The
                    creation by writ or the king’s letter is a summons to attend the House of Peers,
                    by the style and title of that barony which the king is pleased to confer; that
                    by patent is a royal grant to a subject of any dignity and degree of peerage.
                    The creation by writ is the more ancient way; but a man is not ennobled thereby,
                    unless he actually take his seat in the House of Lords; and some are of opinion
                    that there must be at least two writs of summons, and a sitting in two distinct
                    parliaments, to establish a hereditary barony; and therefore the most usual,
                    because the surest way, is to grant the dignity by patent, which endures to a
                    man and his heirs according to the limitation thereof, although he himself
                    should never make use of it. Yet it is frequent to call up the eldest son of a
                    peer to the House of Lords by writ of summons, in the name of his father’s
                    barony, because in that case there is no danger of his children’s losing the
                    nobility in the event of his never taking his seat; for they will succeed to
                    their grandfather. Creation by writ has also one advantage over that by patent.
                    A person created by writ holds the dignity to himself and his heirs, without any
                    words to that purport in the writ; but in letters-patent there must be words to
                    direct the inheritance, otherwise the dignity endures only to the grantee for
                    life. For a man or woman may be created noble for their own lives, and the
                    dignity not descend to their heirs at all, or descend only to some particular
                    heirs; as where a peerage is limited to a man and the heirs male of his body by
                    Elizabeth his present lady, and not to such heirs by any former or future
                    wife.</p>

                <p>2. Let us next take a view of a few of the principal incidents attending the
                    nobility, exclusive of their capacity as members of parliament, and as
                    hereditary counsellors of the crown. And here it may be observed, that in
                    criminal cases a nobleman must be tried by his peers. The great are always
                    obnoxious to popular envy. Were they to be judged by the people, they might be
                    in danger from the prejudices of their judges; and would moreover be deprived of
                    the privilege of the meanest subjects, that of being tried by their equals,
                    which is secured to all the realm by Magna Charta (c. 29). It is said that this
                    does not extend to bishops, who, though they are lords of parliament, and sit
                    there by virtue of the baronies which they hold Jure <hi rend="italic"
                    >ecclesiae,</hi> yet are not ennobled in blood, and consequently not peers with
                    the nobility. As to peeresses, no provision was made for their trial when
                    accused of treason or felony, till after Eleanor duchess of Gloucester, wife to
                    the lord protector, had been accused of treason, and found guilty of witchcraft,
                    in an ecclesiastical synod, through the intrigues of Cardinal Beaufort. This
                    very extraordinary trial gave occasion to a special statute (20 Hen. II. c. 9),
                    which enacted, that peeresses, either in their own right or by marriage, should
                    be tried before the same judicators as peers <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> pf the
                    realm. If a woman, noble in her own right, marries a commoner, she still remains
                    noble, and must be tried by her peers; but if she be only noble by marriage,
                    then by a second marriage with a commoner she loses her dignity; for as by
                    marriage it is gained, so by marriage it is also lost. Yet if a duchess-dowager
                    marries a baron, she continues a duchess still; for all the nobility are <hi
                    rend="italic">pares,</hi> and therefore it is no degradation. A peer, or
                    peeress, either in her own right or by marriage, cannot be arrested in civil
                    cases; and they have likewise many peculiar privileges annexed to their peerage
                    in the course of judicial proceedings. A peer sitting in judgment gives not his
                    verdict upon oath, like an ordinary juryman, but upon his honour; he answers
                    also to bills in chancery upon his honour, and not upon his oath; but when he is
                    examined as a witness either in civil or criminal cases, he must be sworn; for
                    the respect which the law shows to the honour of a peer does not extend so far
                    as to overturn a settled maxim, that <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >judicio</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">creditur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nisi</hi><hi rend="italic">juratis.</hi> The honour of peers is
                    however so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread
                    false reports concerning them, and certain other great officers of the realm,
                    than concerning other men; scandal against them being called by the peculiar
                    name of <hi rend="italic">scandalum magnatum,</hi> and subjected to peculiar
                    punishment by different ancient statutes.</p>
                <p>A peer cannot lose his nobility except by death or attainder, although there was
                    an instance, in the reign of Edward IV., of the degradation of George Neville,
                    duke of Bedford, by act of parliament, on account of his poverty, which rendered
                    him unable to support his dignity. But this is a singular instance, which, by
                    having happened, serves to show the power of parliament; and, by having happened
                    only once, proves how tender the parliament has been in exerting so high a
                    power. It has been said, indeed, that if a baron waste his estate, so that he be
                    not able to support the degree, the king may degrade him; but it is expressly
                    held by later authorities, that a peer cannot be degraded except by act of
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>Matthaeus observes, that nobility amongst the Romans was quite a different thing
                    from what it is amongst us. The nobles, amongst the Romans, were either those
                    raised to the magistracy, or descended from magistrates; there was no such thing
                    as nobility by patent.</p>
                <p>Bartoli states, that doctors, after they have held a professor’s chair in an
                    university for twenty years, become noble, and are entitled to all the rights of
                    counts. But this claim is not admitted at court; though Bartoli’s sentiments be
                    backed by those of several other authors, particularly Chassanaeus in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Consuetudines</hi><hi rend="italic">Eurgundiae,</hi> Boyer <hi
                    rend="italic">sur lu Coutume</hi><hi rend="italic">de Perry,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Faber C. de Pig. Der.</hi> 9. The last, however, restrains
                    Bartoli’s rule to doctors in law, and; princes’ physicians.</p>
