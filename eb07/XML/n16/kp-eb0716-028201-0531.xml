                <p><label type="entry">NOTTINGHAMSHIRE</label>, an inland county of England, bounded
                    on the north by Yorkshire and a part of Lincolnshire, on the east by
                    Lincolnshire, on the south by Leicestershire, and on the west by Derbyshire. It
                    is of an oval figure, with its narrowest end towards the north. Its greatest
                    length is about fifty miles, and its greatest breadth twenty-seven. Its
                    circumference is estimated at 140 miles. According to the statement of Mr
                    Rickman, the extent is 837 square miles, or 535,680 acres.</p>
                <p>The county is divided into six hundreds, or, as they are usually denominated,
                    wapentakes; three of which are to the north and three to the south of the river
                    Trent. It contains nine market-towns, and 207 parishes. The annual value of all
                    the real property of the county, as taken in the year 1815, for the purposes of
                    the property-tax, was found to be L.737,220. The number of inhabitants at each
                    of the four decennial enumerations amounted, in 1801 to 140,350, in 1811 to
                    162,000, in 1821 to 186,873, and in 1831 to 225,400. The burials in the ten
                    years from 1821</p>
                <p>to 1831 appear to have been one in fifty-four of the inhabitants then living. The
                    illegitimate births were one in twenty of the whole births.</p>
                <p>The occupations of the inhabitants in 1831, according to the arranged returns of
                    Mr Rickman, were as follow:</p>

                <p>The face of the country is generally level, with moderate undulations; and its
                    beauties are of a mild description, somewhat picturesque in the vicinity of
                    Sherwood Forest, but displaying neither the striking features of the adjoining
                    county of Derby on its western side, nor the flat insipidity of the plains of
                    Lincolnshire on its eastern side. From its position between these two
                    descriptions of country, and from its moderate elevation, it enjoys a milder
                    climate than either, partaking neither of the raw air of the one nor the moist
                    atmosphere of the other. The dryness of the climate is favourable to early
                    vegetation, and is supposed to be the cause of the seed-time and harvest in
                    Nottinghamshire commencing at the same period as in the more southern
                    counties.</p>
                <p>The soil of this county is very various. On the borders of Derbyshire there is a
                    stripe of land with coal and limestone, partly in wood, but mostly under arable
                    culture. Parallel to it is a broader tract, including Sherwood Forest, the soil
                    of which is chiefly sandy and gravelly; but though naturally sterile, it has in
                    some degree been brought into a productive state by the extensive cultivation of
                    turnips, and the maintenance of considerable flocks of sheep. The tract which
                    adjoins is a clayey soil, extending to the banks of the river Trent. It is
                    chiefly arable land, but varied with woods and meadows, and highly productive of
                    wheat, oats, beans, and, in some parts, of hops. The lands on the banks of the
                    Trent are very fertile, being mostly devoted to pasture, on which many oxen are
                    fattened; and some of the dairies are extensive. The arable land of this
                    district is celebrated both for the quantity and the quality of the oats which
                    it produces. The beautiful vale of Belvoir, in the south-easternmost part of the
                    county, enjoys some of the best soils, both for pasture and arable husbandry, of
                    any part of this island. The farms are in general small, and commonly held by
                    tenants at will, the rents taken from whom are generally moderate; and a very
                    great proportion of the land is free from the burden of the tithes. 1he spirit
                    of agricultural improvement has not proceeded so far as in many other counties,
                    though it has made considerable progress of late years. Neither the breeds of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560544" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0544-0283"/>cows and
                    sheep, nor the modes of cultivation, differ so much from those of the adjoining
                    counties as to deserve any especial notice.</p>
                <p>There are no mines except those of coal, which are exclusively confined to a
                    narrow district bordering on Derbyshire; the coal is of good quality, very
                    abundant, and, by means of internal navigation, diffused throughout the whole
                    county. Excellent stone for building is raised in many parts, some of which has
                    the peculiarly valuable quality of improving by exposure to the weather. Many
                    parts of the county abound in veins of gypsum. In the parish of Gotham it is
                    found in strata of the thickness of three feet. At Beaconhill, near Newark,
                    there are large quarries of this substance. Although it has been much praised as
                    a manure, the trials of it that have been made in its vicinity have not been
                    attended with such beneficial results as to induce the continued use of it for
                    that purpose.</p>
                <p>The Forest of Sherwood, formerly celebrated as the scene of the exploits of Robin
                    Hood, whose deeds amused our nursery days, is mostly an open heathy plain,
                    bordered with recent plantations, and upon which the plough has made very
                    extensive encroachments. The boundaries of the forest are extensive, it being
                    twenty-five miles in length, and from seven to nine in breadth; but a great
                    portion of it has become the property of private individuals, and is enclosed in
                    farms and parks; in the latter of which is to be found the deer with which this
                    forest was once most abundantly stocked. The trees of most ancient date are
                    those now remaining on&lt;the estates of the Duke of Newcastle and Lord
                    Manvers.</p>
                <p>•Nottinghamshire is, for its population, one of the greatest manufacturing
                    counties. The frames for making hosiery were the discovery of a clergyman of
                    this county named Lee, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who, finding but little
                    encouragement in England, repaired to Paris, and commenced his work under the
                    auspices of Henry IV. The murder of that monarch having deprived him of a
                    patron, he died of chagrin in France, and the workmen returned home, when, after
                    many fluctuations, the machinery was introduced into this county. The making of
                    stockings, caps, pantaloon-pieces, and other similar articles, has long given
                    employment to the great mass of, the labouring population; and of late years the
                    making of lace upon a similar principle has been introduced, and created
                    additional employment. Although the riotous conduct of the workmen, under the
                    denomination of Luddites, has driven some of the large capitalists to other
                    parts of the kingdom, yet the hosiery business is by far the most important
                    means of employment throughout the whole county. The spinning of cotton-yarn,
                    from its natural connection with hosiery, has been introduced and very widely
                    extended; and the establishments at Nottingham, at Mansfield, at Newark, at
                    Southwell, and several other places, are upon an extensive scale. There are also
                    several large manufactories for spinning worsted yarn. Malting and brewing are
                    carried on to a considerable extent; and the beer of Nottingham and of Newark
                    rivals that of Burton-upon-Trent. There are potteries at Sutton Ashfield; starch
                    I is made near Southwell; and sailcloth and candlewick at</p>
                <p>Retford.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of this county is mostly conducted by the mercantile houses of
                    London and Liverpool; but some of the larger manufacturers export their own
                    goods, both to the continent of Europe and to the more distant parts of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The river Trent, the fourth in magnitude of the English streams, passes across
                    the county, and is navigable for barges throughout the whole of it; but its
                    deficiencies of water and its shoals are such great impediments that a canal by
                    the side of it, ten miles in length, is found of great use to the intercourse.
                    The other rivers are not navigable, but are beneficial for the purposes of
                    irrigation. They are the Erwash, the Soar, the Maun, the Mcden, the Wollen, the
                    Worksop, the Idle, the Lene, and the Dover or Dare. These all discharge their
                    waters into the Trent. The canals are, the Nottingham, the Grantham, the Idle,
                    and the Chesterfield. The last of these is about forty miles in length; the
                    others about ten each. By means of these and the Trent, the intercourse by
                    internal navigation is extended to almost every district of the county.</p>
                <p>The titles derived from this county are those of Marquis of Granby, Earl of
                    Mansfield, Viscount Newark, and Barons Pierrepoint and Carrington. For election
                    purposes, the county has been divided into two districts, the northern and the
                    southern. Each of them returns two members. The election for the northern
                    division is held at Mansfield, and the pol 1 ing places are, that town, East
                    Retford, and Nottingham. The election for the southern division is held at
                    Newark, and the other polling places are Bingham and Southwell. The three
                    boroughs, Nottingham, Newark, and Retford, return each two members, as before
                    the passing of the reform bill. The whole of the county is in the diocese of
                    York, and it is on the midland circuit of the judges.</p>
                <p>The remains of Roman and Saxon antiquities are numerous. Amongst the former are
                    the camps at Barton Hill, at Combes Farm, at Gringley, at Hexgrave, and at Wenny
                    Hill, and a Roman villa near Mansfield. Amongst the latter are the Castle of
                    Newark, the abbeys of Newstead, Rufford, and Welbeck; the priories of Mattersey
                    and Worksop; and the churches of Bingham, Blythe, Southwell, and Balderton.</p>
                <p>The most distinguished natives of this county have been, Archbishop Cranmer, Dr
                    Erasmus Darwin, Sir Martin Frobisher, Denzil Lord Hoiles, Ireton the son-in-law
                    of Cromwell, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Paul Sandby, Archbishop Secker, Gilbert
                    Wakefield, and Bishop Warburton.</p>
