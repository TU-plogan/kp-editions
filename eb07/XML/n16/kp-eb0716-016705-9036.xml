                <p><label type="entry">NEWSPAPERS</label> are publications issued in numbers,
                    consisting generally of single sheets, which, appearing at short and regular
                    intervals, convey intelligence of passing events, and at the same time advocate
                    certain principles in politics, literature, and religion, but chiefly in the
                    first of these departments.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of modern, as compared with ancient
                    times, is the periodical press, an engine affecting society in all its
                    relations, and forming one of the most important safeguards of public liberty.
                    Under this head are usually included reviews, magazines, and other publications
                    of a similar kind, as well as newspapers. But although, upon certain grave and
                    important questions, the former sort of periodicals may contribute more to
                    enlighten the public mind, and to guide public opinion into safe and proper
                    channels; yet the wide diffusion of newspapers, their rapid communication of
                    intelligence on subjects ofimmediate interest, their hasty and rough but often
                    vigorous comments on the leading events of the day, and the means which they
                    thus afford of acting immediately and constantly upon the public mind, in all
                    its varied states, render them much more powerful as instruments of political
                    influence, and thus secure to them a prominence to which, intrinsically, they
                    are by no means entitled. They circulate every kind of information with equal
                    celerity and regularity; they bring to every man’s home and fireside
                    intelligence of all that is passing in the great world, whether at home or
                    abroad, in war, in politics, in government, in commerce, and in the common
                    affairs of life; they are registers of extraordinary events, as well as of
                    ordinary occurrences, of discoveries and inventions, as well as accidents,
                    offences, calamities, or crimes; they often diversify their contents with
                    scientific<pb break="no" facs="nls:194559049" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9049-0168"/> and
                    literary notices; and from the variety of facts and information which they
                    contain, they are indispensable to many classes of society, and more or less
                    agreeable or instructive to all. To persons engaged in mercantile transactions
                    they are peculiarly important, inasmuch as, from the advertisements they
                    circulate, and the details they furnish respecting the supply and demand of
                    commodities in all parts of the world, with the prices ’and the regulations by
                    which these are affected, newspapers supersede a great mass of epistolary
                    correspondence; place merchants in remote situations upon an equality, in point
                    of information, with those frequenting the principal marts; and wonderfully
                    quicken all the movements of commerce. Besides, these publications have
                    themselves become a considerable article of commerce, in the production of which
                    skill, talents, and capital are equally requisite.</p>
                <p>An historical account of newspapers, and of periodical publications in general,
                    is still a desideratum in literature; nor can it be doubted, that if the task
                    were undertaken by an individual of competent ability, and executed with the
                    requisite care and research, the result would be a work of the greatest interest
                    and importance. From the researches of Mr Chalmers, it appears that to the state
                    of Venice belongs the honour of having produced the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >gazetta</hi> or newspaper, which appeared as early as the year 1536. The war
                    which the republic of Venice then waged against Suleiman II. in Dalmatia,
                    appears to have given rise to the custom in that state of communicating both
                    military and commercial information in written sheets <hi rend="italic">{notizie
                    seritte),</hi> which were read at a particular place by those desirous of
                    learning the news, and who paid for this privilege in a coin that is no longer
                    in use, called <hi rend="italic">gazetta.</hi> From this circumstance, it would
                    seem, the name was, in course of time, transferred to the newspaper itself, not
                    only in Italy and France, but at length also in England and in other
                    countries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some have
                    thought that the word <hi rend="italic">gazetta</hi> is derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">gazza</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gazzera,</hi> a magpie, or
                    chatterer; whilst others deduce it from the Latin <hi rend="italic">gaza,</hi>
                    colloquially lengthened into <hi rend="italic">gazetta,</hi> and therefore
                    signifying a little store or treasury of news. From the Italian the word passed
                    into the Spanish language, which has also <hi rend="italic">gazetista,</hi>
                    signifying one fond of or partial to the gazette. In German, <hi rend="italic"
                    >zeiiung</hi> is formed from the ancient <hi rend="italic">theidinge</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">teidung,</hi> identical with the English <hi rend="italic"
                    >tiding</hi> and the Swedish <hi rend="italic">tidingar.</hi></p></note> The
                    first of these <hi rend="italic">notizie</hi> or gazettes was a monthly paper,
                    circulated, or rather read, at Venice. The jealousy of the government prevented
                    its being printed; and the <hi rend="italic">gazetta</hi> continued to be
                    distributed in manuscript till towards the. close of the sixteenth century. In
                    the Magliabecchi library at Florence there are still preserved thirty volumes of
                    these <hi rend="italic">gazettas,</hi> all of them in manuscript. Those who
                    first wrote newspapers in Italy were commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >menanti,</hi> because, according to Vossius, they intended, by these loose
                    papers or sybilline leaves, to spread about defamatory reflections; and for this
                    reason all such gazettes were prohibited by Gregory XIII. in a bull entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Minantes,</hi> from the Latin <hi rend="italic">minari,</hi> to
                    threaten. But Ménage, with more probability, derives the name from the Italian
                    verb <hi rend="italic">menare,</hi> which signifies to lead, direct, or
                    produce.</p>
                <p>The first English newspaper appeared in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, during the
                    alarm occasioned by the approach of the Spanish Armada to our shores. In the
                    British Museum, there are several copies which were printed in 1558, whilst the
                    Spanish fleet was in the English Channel; in order that, during a moment of
                    general anxiety, the circulation of false reports might be prevented by
                    publishing real information. This newspaper is entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    English</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercurie,</hi> which, by authority, “was imprinted
                    at London, by Christopher Barker, her highnesses printer, 1583.” Burleigh’s
                    newspapers, however, were all extraordinary gazettes, not regular journals, and
                    they were published from time to time, according as that skilful statesman
                    desired to soothe, inform, or exasperate the people. Periodical papers appear to
                    have first come into general use during the civil wars in the reign of Charles
                    I., and in the time of the commonwealth; in fact, each party had their
                    newspapers, to disseminate sentiments of loyalty, or to foster a spirit of
                    resistance against the inroads of power. The country was accordingly overflowed
                    with tracts of every size, and of various denominations, many of them written
                    with great ability, and displaying uncommon courage. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercury,</hi> however, was the prevailing title, although generally qualified
                    with some epithet; and the quaintness peculiar to the age is curiously
                    exemplified in the names of some of the “news-books,” as the Dutch Spye, the
                    Scots Dove, the Parliament Kite, the Secret Owle, Heraclitus Ridens, the
                    Parliament Vulture, the Parliament’s Screech Owle, the Loyal Scout, and so
                    forth. A catalogue of the different Mercuries would exhibit <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> curious picture of those singular times. Mercurius Acheronticus brought
                    hebdomadal tidings from the infernal regions; Mercurius Democritus communicated
                    marvellous intelligence from the world in the Moon; the Laughing Mercury gave
                    exact information of proceedings at the antipodes; and the Mercurius Mastix
                    lashed unmercifully all other Mercuries, Scouts, Posts, Spies, Discoverers, and
                    Intelligencers. The Restoration and the Revolution occasioned each the
                    establishment of a number of newspapers in England, all of which have long since
                    disappeared; nor was it until the reign of Queen Anne that London could boast of
                    a daily paper. The first of the class published in Great Britain was the Daily
                    Courant, which for a considerable time occupied the field alone; but at length
                    two rivals appeared in the Daily Post and the Daily Journal, and, in 1724, we
                    find that these three papers were simultaneously published. Little change seems
                    to have taken place during the reign of George I.; but in that of George II.
                    every kind of periodical publication increased abundantly. The number of
                    newspapers annually sold in England, according to an average of three years
                    ending with 1753, was 7,411,757; in 1760 it amounted to 9,464,790; in 1767 it
                    rose to 11,300,980; in 1790 it was as high as 1.4,035,636, and in 1792 it
                    amounted to 15,005,760.</p>
                <p>The victorious arms of Cromwell communicated to Scotland the first newspaper. It
                    appeared at Leith in October 1653, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercurius Politicus,</hi> but, in November 1654, was transferred to Edinburgh,
                    where it continued to be published until the 11th of April 1660, when it came
                    out under the name of <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Publicus.</hi> This paper was
                    a reprint, for the information of the English soldiers, of a London publication,
                    entitled a Diurnal of some Passages and Affairs. But a newspaper of native
                    manufacture soon made its appearance, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercurius</hi><hi rend="italic">Caledο∙ nius.</hi> The first number of this
                    journal was published at Edinburgh on the 31st of December 1660, “comprising,”
                    as its title bears, “the affairs in agitation in Scotland, with a summary of
                    foreign intelligence.” The publication, however, extended only to ten numbers,
                    which, as Chalmers says, “were very loyal, very illiterate, and very affected.”
                    Even after the Restoration the newspapers published by authority continued to be
                    reprinted in Edinburgh, and the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Publicus</hi>
                    instructed the natives until it was superseded by the Kingdom’s Intelligencer.
                    At the era of the Revolution there was not a newspaper printed in Scotland; nor
                    was it until after ten years had elapsed that the Edinburgh Gazette was
                    published, in the month of February 1699, by James Watson, author of a History
                    of Printing, who, after the publication of forty numbers, transferred it to one
                    John Reid, whose son continued to print the paper even after the union. In
                    February 1705, Watson established the Edinburgh Courant, which he relinquished,
                    after the publication of fifty-five numbers; and, in September 1706, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194559062" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9062-0169"/> he commenced the
                    Scots Courant, which he continued to print until after the year 1718. To these
                    papers were added, in October 1708, the Edinburgh Flying Post; in August 1709,
                    the Scots Postman, printed for David Fearne by John Moncur; and, in March 1710,
                    the North Tatler, printed by John Reid for Samuel Colvil. In 1715, a newspaper
                    was for the first time attempted in Glasgow, under the title of the Glasgow
                    Courant; but this did not prevent the establishment of other newspapers in
                    Edinburgh. In March 1714, Robert Brown began to print the Edinburgh Gazette, or
                    Scots Postman, twice a week; and, in December 1718, the town-council gave an
                    exclusive privilege to James MΕwen to publish three times a week the Edinburgh
                    Evening Courant; upon the condition, however, that “the said James” should,
                    before publication, “give ane coppie of his print to the magistrates.” This
                    journal still continues to be published, but whether or not the original
                    stipulation be complied with, we are unable to say. The establishment of the
                    Courant was followed by that of the Caledonian Mercury, the sequel of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercurius</hi><hi rend="italic">Caledonius,</hi> the first number
                    of which appeared on the 28th of April 1720. The original proprietor was a
                    lawyer of the name of Roland, upon whose decease, in 1729, the property of the
                    paper was transferred to Mr Thomas Ruddiman, the original editor, and continued
                    in his family until May 1772, when it uas sold by the trustees of his
                    grandchildren to John Robertson, an opulent typographer, along with the
                    printing-house and printing materials. From the commencement, the Caledonian
                    ÁIercury, like the Courant, has been published three times a week.</p>
                <p>Having given this slight sketch of the origin and progress of newspapers, we now
                    proceed to consider the actual state and condition of this portion of the press
                    amongst ourselves; and here our attention is naturally directed, in the first
                    instance, to the metropolitan journals, which are pre-eminent for the amount and
                    variety of matter they contain, the rapidity with which they are printed and
                    circulated, and the fulness and accuracy of their reports. The establishment of
                    a first-rate London paper is the most complete of the kind in existence. Its
                    activity is immense, extending not only to all that is important at home, but to
                    every thing that is particularly interesting abroad. In 1826, when Mr Canning
                    sent a body of troops to Portugal, in compliance with a demand made by the
                    government of that country, reporters belonging to several London journals
                    accompanied the expedition; and since the commencement of the civil Avar in
                    Spain, the head-quarters of Don Carlos, and those of the Christino generals,
                    have respectively been frequented by emissaries of the leading morning papers.
                    Reports of the proceedings in the Spanish Cortes, and the discussions in the
                    French Chamber of Deputies, have on particular occasions accompanied those of
                    the debates in the British houses of parliament. Indeed there is almost nothing
                    beyond the reach of their enterprise and activity.</p>
                <p>Employed upon each morning paper of the first class there are an editor and
                    sub-editor; from ten to twelve, or even fourteen, regular reporters, at salaries
                    of from four to six guineas each per week; from thirty to thirty-five
                    compositors in the printing-office; several readers, who correct the proofs as
                    they come from the compositors; a certain number of men and boys to attend to
                    the printing machine, and take off the papers as they fall from the cylinders; a
                    publisher and sub-publisher, besides a number of clerks in the office to receive
                    advertisements and keep the accounts, with various other individuals engaged in
                    the performance of subordinate duties. The salary of an editor varies from L.600
                    to L.1000 per annum, and that of a sub-editor from L.400 to L.600. Te largest
                    item in the expenditure of a morning paper is that charged under the head of
                    reporting, which generally amounts to upwards of L.3000 per annum. In fact, the
                    salaries paid weekly to editors, reporters, and others upon the establishment,
                    do not fall short of L.180; and if to this be added the expense of occasional
                    reporting, the cost of foreign newspapers and private correspondence, the sums
                    paid for expresses, and various other items which it is unnecessary to
                    enumerate, the total weekly expenditure can scarcely be estimated under L.250,
                    or L.13,000 per annum. The duty of the principal editor commences with the
                    publication of the evening papers, the leading articles of which he has to read,
                    that, if necessary, he may refute or support their statements and arguments. He
                    generally remains at his post until a late hour, prepared to write comments on
                    the foreign journals as they arrive (a duty in which he is generally assisted by
                    the subeditor), and also to direct attention, in a leading article, to any topic
                    of public interest. During the sitting of parliament, he is frequently obliged
                    to remain at the office of the paper until two or three o’clock in the morning;
                    and such is the energy with which the metropolitan press is directed, that it is
                    not uncommon to see a leading article of nearly a column in length written on a
                    subject which had been debated in the House of Commons until a late hour in the
                    morning. The promptitude of execution which this presupposes is wonderful, and
                    can only be the effect of habit invigorated by the impulses peculiar to the
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>But perhaps the most extraordinary part of the machinery of a morning paper is
                    the reporting. The establishment of reporters varies, as already stated, from
                    ten to fourteen; and most of the persons so engaged are gentlemen of education,
                    sometimes students of law, remarkable for their activity and intelligence.
                    During the session of parliament, the reporters of the leading papers attend by
                    turns each day, from the time the business commences, one succeeding the other,
                    according to previous arrangement, and each remaining in the house for half or
                    three quarters of an hour. If the debate be not protracted, or “heavy,” as it is
                    called, the reporter in the House of Commons, when relieved, enters a small
                    apartment at the end of the lobby, appropriated exclusively for the purpose, and
                    there arranges his notes, which are seldom taken in short-hand, from the
                    impossibility, in ordinary cases, of finding room in a newspaper for all that a
                    member may say, or even the half of it. He then proceeds at once to the office
                    of the paper on which he is engaged, and by him the attention of the editor is
                    directed to any thing of commanding interest which may have transpired. His
                    slips, as they are written, are handed by the printer to the compositors, whose
                    number during the session of parliament is generally increased; and as one
                    reporter follows another, it is not unusual for a debate which has terminated at
                    midnight to be set up in types, and ready for printing, by two o’clock in the
                    morning. On nights of prolonged discussion, when the houses sit late, some of
                    the reporters, particularly those whose previous task may have proved least
                    onerous, are required to return to the gallery, and take what is called “a
                    double turn.” In general, however, owing to the subdivision of labour, the duty
                    of an individual reporter is by no means burdensome, and requires promptitude
                    and facility rather than prolonged exertion. The expertness produced by habit is
                    remarkable, and it not unfrequently happens that a single reporter, from the
                    notes taken in three quarters of an hour, supplies from one to three columns of
                    printed matter to the paper on which he is engaged. Besides the corps of regular
                    reporters attached to a newspaper, there are several occasional ones,called
                    “penny-a-line men,” from the circumstance of their furnishing articles of
                    intelligence at a fixed price per line. The reporters of this class are to the
                    body of the press what the Cossacks are to a disciplined army; a species of
                    active but irregular troops, who forage for news in all directions, pick up
                    every scrap that comes in their way, and having dressed it up in their best
                    style, straightway offer it for sale at the newspaper offices.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559075" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9075-0170"/>
                <p>In obtaining intelligence by express, and also in forwarding it in this manner,
                    some of the evening papers have latterly made great exertions. The Courier and
                    the Sun have sometimes published the speech of the king of the French twenty-six
                    or twenty-seven hours after it had been obtained by their agents at Paris; and
                    the latter journal has, on many occasions, forwarded “express editions” to all
                    parts of the country, containing the conclusion of an important debate which
                    terminated several hours after the departure of the mail, and thus anticipating
                    by a day the ordinary course of publication.</p>
                <p>Newspapers, in London, are, for the most part, sold to newsmen or news-venders,
                    by whom they are distributed to the purchasers both in town and country. The
                    newsmen, therefore, are the retailers, and for the business of distribution they
                    receive a certain regulated allowance, amounting to two shillings and threepence
                    upon a <hi rend="italic">quire</hi> (as it is called) of twenty-seven papers.
                    Some of the clerks at the post-office, called clerks of the roads, are likewise
                    considerable news-agents. The stamp-duty charged upon each newspaper was
                    formerly fourpence, with a discount, however, of twenty per cent, on such as
                    were sold at a price not exceeding sevenpence, which reduced the stamp-duty
                    actually paid to threepence and one fifth. But, by the act 6 and 7 William IV.
                    c. 76, this duty has been repealed, and the following duties are now imposed in
                    its stead:</p>
                <p>For every sheet, or other piece of paper, whereon any newspaper shall be printed,
                    one penny. But where such sheet or piece of paper shall contain on one side a
                    superficies, exclusive of the margin of the letter-press, exceeding 1530 inches,
                    and not exceeding 2295, the additional duty of one halfpenny is charged; and
                    where the same shall contain on one side a superficies, exclusive of margin,
                    exceeding 2295 inches, a further duty of one penny; provided always that any
                    sheet or piece of paper containing on one side a superficies, exclusive of the
                    margin of the letter-press, not exceeding 765 inches, which shall be published
                    with and as a supplement to any newspaper chargeable with any of the foresaid
                    duties, shall in that case be charged only with the duty of one halfpenny. Then
                    follow definitions of what are to be deemed and taken to be newspapers
                    chargeable with these duties. These are, 1st, Any paper containing public news,
                    intelligence, or occurrences, printed in any part of the united kingdom, to be
                    dispersed and made public; 2dly, any paper printed in any part of the united
                    kingdom weekly or oftener, or at intervals not exceeding twenty-six days,
                    containing only or principally advertisements; and, 3dly, any paper containing
                    any public news, intelligence, or occurrences, or any remarks or observations
                    thereon, printed in any part of the united kingdom, for sale, and published
                    periodically, or in parts or numbers, at intervals not exceeding twenty-six days
                    between the publication of any two such papers, parts, or numbers, where any of
                    the said papers, parts, or numbers shall not exceed two sheets of the specified
                    dimensions, exclusive of any cover or blank leaf, or shall be published for sale
                    for a less sum than sixpence, exclusive of the duty imposed by the act. With
                    reference to this last description of newspapers, it is provided, that no
                    quantity of paper less than a quantity equal to twenty-one inches in length by
                    seventeen inches in breadth, in whatever way or form the same may be made or
                    divided into leaves, or in whatever way the same may be printed, shall, with
                    reference to any such paper, part, or number, as has been above described, be
                    deemed or taken to be a sheet. And it is also generally provided, that any of
                    the several papers before described shall be liable to the duties imposed by the
                    act, in whatever way or form they may be printed or folded, or divided into
                    leaves or stitched, and whether the same shall be folded, divided, or stitched,
                    or not. The <hi rend="italic">exemptions</hi> are, the Police Gazette or Hue and
                    Cry; daily accounts or bills of goods imported and exported; warrants or
                    certificates for the delivery of goods, and the weekly bills of mortality; and
                    also papers containing lists of prices current, the state of the markets,
                    accounts of the arrival, sailing, or other circumstances relating to merchant
                    ships or vessels, and generally any other matter wholly of a commercial nature;
                    provided such bills, lists, or accounts do not contain any other matter than
                    that which has usually been comprised in them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">regulations</hi> prescribed by this act are the following,
                    viz. A discount of twenty-five per cent, on the above duties is allowed to
                    newspapers printed in Ireland. To prevent fraud in the returns as to newspapers,
                    it is enacted that, from the 31st of December 1836, a separate or distinctive
                    stamp or die must be employed for each paper. No person can print or publish a
                    newspaper until after a declaration has been made and lodged at the
                    stamp-office, containing certain particulars specified in the act as to the
                    names and addresses of the printer and certain of the proprietors, &amp;c. of
                    such paper, under a penalty of fifty pounds; and persons wilfully making a false
                    or defective declaration are, upon conviction, to be deemed guilty of a
                    misdemeanour. There are also a number of regulations intended to provide for the
                    discovery and liability of the printer and proprietors, the security of the
                    duties, and the prevention of the sale of unstamped papers. Any person
                    publishing, selling, or disposing of newspapers not duly stamped, is subjected
                    to a penalty of twenty pounds; and it is declared to be lawful for any officer
                    of stamps, or any person authorized by the commissioners for that purpose, to
                    seize any such offender, and take him before any justice having jurisdiction
                    where the offence is committed, who shall summarily determine the matter, and,
                    in default of payment upon conviction, commit such offender to prison for some
                    term not exceeding three calendar months, nor less than one. The penalty for
                    sending abroad newspapers not duly stamped is L.50. Justices may grant warrants
                    to search for unstamped néwspapers, to seize presses, &amp;c. used in printing
                    them; on admittance being refused, officersand others may enter forcibly; and
                    persons offering resistance to officers in the discharge of their duty incur a
                    penalty of twenty pounds.</p>
                <p>Such are the provisions, exemptions, and regulations of the act 6 and 7 William
                    IV. c. 76. The duty, which formerly amounted (deducting the discount) to
                    threepence one fifth, being thus reduced to one penny, the price of the great
                    majority of the London papers has in consequence been lowered from sevenpence to
                    fivepence; but provincial papers, which are got up at comparatively little
                    expense, are now generally sold for fourpence halfpenny or fourpence; and this
                    is also the case with one or two of the metropolitan journals. The reduction of
                    the price occasioned a considerable increase in the demand for the established
                    journals; and, since the reduction of the duty, a considerable number of new
                    weekly papers also started into existence, both in the metropolis and throughout
                    the country; but hitherto no new daily paper has been established, and several
                    of the weekly prints have already disappeared. Supposing it to have been
                    expedient to reduce the duty, and to fix it at an uniform amount upon all
                    papers, the arrangements prescribed in the act 6 and 7 William IV. are perhaps
                    as unexceptionable as any that could be devised; but some persons are of opinion
                    that it might have been better to assess the duty upon an <hi rend="italic">ad
                    valorem</hi> principle, making it in every case a certain aliquot part of the
                    price.</p>
                <p>The returns of the London journals arise from two sources; the profits on the
                    circulation, and those derived from advertisements. Each paper being now sold to
                    the newsman at fourpence, the sum received by the proprietor for <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559088" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9088-0171"/>paper, printing, and the
                    expense of his establishment, is threepence, or one halfpenny more than under
                    the former law. Advertisements form a considerable source of profit to
                    newspapers; indeed, without this, some of the most widely circulated of their
                    number could not support the great expenditure necessary for carrying them on.
                    Each advertisement published in Great Britain is now charged with a duty of one
                    shilling and sixpence, without distinction of length; but until the year 1833
                    the duty charged was three shillings and sixpence. In 1832, the advertisements
                    produced L.155,400 in Great Britain, and L.15,249 in Ireland, at least three
                    fourths of which were derived from newspapers.</p>
                <p>The following table has been constructed from detailed returns showing the number
                    of stamps issued to each newspaper in Great Britain and Ireland, with the number
                    of advertisements published, and the amount of advertisement duty paid, by each
                    paper during the first six months of the year 1837. The duty is charged at one
                    shilling and sixpence upon each advertisement published in Great Britain, and at
                    one shilling upon each advertisement published in Ireland.</p>

                <p>In 1832, when the government duty was charged at three shillings and sixpence
                    upon each advertisement, the produce of this branch of the revenue in Great
                    Britain and Ireland amounted to L.170,649. The portion of this sum derived from
                    newspapers, as distinguished from other periodical publications, has not been
                    stated; but it may fairly be taken at not less than three fourths of the whole,
                    or L.127,986. From the above table, however, it appears that the newspaper
                    advertisement duty, for the first six months of 1837, amounted to L∙55,503s. 5s.
                    2d. which, for the whole year, would give a return from this source alone of L.l
                    11,006. 10s. 4d. But in 1833 the duty was reduced to one shilling and sixpence
                    in Great Britain, and one shilling in Ireland, at which rates it is now charged
                    upon advertisements in each country respectively; yet notwithstanding this
                    reduction, it appears that, if the second half <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1837
                    equal the first, the total produce of that year, arising from advertisements,
                    will fall short of the total produce <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1832, the year
                    before the duty was reduced, by only L.16,980.</p>
                <p>Newspapers were of later origin in France than in England. The earliest notice we
                    have of any publication of this kind is that contained in Saint Foix’s curious
                    <hi rend="italic">Essai Historique sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Paris,</hi> where
                    it is stated that Renaudot, a physician of Paris, sought to amuse his patients
                    by collecting and circulating news, and thus greatly increased his practice. As
                    the seasons were not always sickly, and the doctor had a taste for
                    newsmongering, he considered that he might turn both his time and his talents to
                    account by giving weekly to his patients some fugitive sheets containing the
                    news of various countries; and for this he obtained a privilege in 1632. But
                    there was really no political press in France until the year 1789, when the
                    Constituent Assembly, in the declaration of rights, decreed (õth October) that
                    the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious
                    rights of man, and that every citizen may therefore speak, write, and print
                    freely, “sauf a repondre de l’abus de cette liberté dans le cas déterminé par la
                    loi.” This decree, which formally recognised the liberty of the press, at the
                    same time called it into existence. But no distinction was made between the
                    various modes of publication, and no greater securities were required for
                    newspapers than for books and pamphlets. The periodical press was a stranger to
                    the habits of the country, and the public were not prepared for it. Violent and
                    witty pamphlets were indeed written, but no one had yet learned either to write
                    or to read a journal. In this respect the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> an
                    official paper, began the education of the community in France. No journals were
                    previously known, except the <hi rend="italic">Mercure,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazette de France,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Courrier</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Provence,</hi> which had been the depository of Mirabeau’s
                    harangues, before the opportunity had arrived for launching them in the National
                    Assembly. As the passions of men became heated, a new brood was hatched, amongst
                    which Marat’s <hi rend="italic">Ami</hi><hi rend="italic">du Peuple,</hi> and
                    Hébert’s <hi rend="italic">Pere Duchesne,</hi> enjoyed a bad pre-eminence. The
                    rapidity and accrbity of the pamphlets of the time were suited to the taste of a
                    people which lived upon excitement. But still a journalist was, in fact, an
                    individual who united and confounded all the branches of the work in his own
                    person; it was Marat, or Hébert, or Camille-Desmoulins. Violent alternations of
                    license and despotism distinguished the most stormy period <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the Revolution; yet, in spite of the extravagance of the one, and the
                    disproportionate severity of the other, the press continued to make way. Under
                    the consulate and the empire it was subjected to systematic control. No journal
                    could appear without the authority of the minister of the interior; the number
                    of provincial papers was limited to one for each department, and these were
                    placed under the authority of the prefects. On some occasions, however, Napoleon
                    himself became a journalist, and replied in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>
                    to the manifestoes of the British government. He also encouraged a revival of
                    religious doctrines, the influence of which was felt in literature before it
                    reached the sphere of politics. Of this school the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats</hi><hi rend="italic">was,</hi> the
                    centre, and Chateaubriand and Bonald were the organs. Things proceeded in this
                    way till after the disastrous campaign of Moscow, when the liberty of writing
                    and speaking began to be once more asserted, and public opinion was ardently
                    supported by the rising generation; so that, upon the whole, when the French
                    empire was broken up, the press had in some measure taken root in the habits of
                    the country, and the demand for newspapers had become general. Even whilst the
                    expression of opinion was checked, the means of publicity were established and
                    increased. The <hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Idulleun
                    des Loix,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Librairie,</hi> awakened attention to the public interests; each department had
                    a paper of its own; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559101"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9101-0172"/>Paris had already several journals, particularly
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quotidienne,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Debats,</hi> which, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    l’Empire,</hi> had as many as 20,000 subscribers. Literary criticism was
                    installed in the daily papers, and gave birth to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Feuileton,</hi> to which the pens of Dussault and Geoffroy imparted that sharp
                    and sparkling vivacity which still preserves its traditional charm. At first,
                    however, it was no better treated by the government of the restoration than it
                    had been by that of the empire. Its history during this period is filled with
                    laws and ordinances, succeeding each other at short intervals, and marking the
                    various turns of the conflict between the men of the past and those of the
                    present time, the restored government, and the liberal party, as it is called.
                    But in 1819 a law was passed which had the merit of acknowledging sound
                    principles respecting the rights of publicity; and by another enactment, made in
                    1828, a sort of compromise was entered into between the rights of the press and
                    the prejudices of the government. Since the revolution of July 1830, however, a
                    material change has taken place. In 1819, the interest and the position of the
                    parliamentary tribune and the press were identical; since 1830, they have become
                    two distinct and rival powers, one or other of which must ultimately give way.
                    In the meanwhile, the gagging enactments of the year 1835, which characterize
                    the existing legislation, have given a decided preponderance to the tribune,
                    and, through it, to the government.</p>
                <p>The French journals fluctuate so greatly that they can only be described
                    generally in connection with the events of the time. When M. de ViIIèle came
                    into office, the two organs of the liberal party were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitutionnel</hi> (established in 1815), the <hi rend="italic">Courrier
                    Français,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Journal du Commerce,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst the royalist
                    party divided their patronage between the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Debats,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de France,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quotidienĭze.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Aristarqιιe</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oriflamme</hi> were then set up by the ultra-royalists; and
                    Villèlc established the <hi rend="italic">Etoile,</hi> an evening paper devoted
                    to the personal defence of the minister. The <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Debats</hi> now seceded from the side of government, and brought over to the
                    liberal party the support of that portion of the middle classes which had
                    espoused the interests of the restored monarchy. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Producteur</hi> led on the public to the
                    study of science, literature, politics, political economy, and philosophy, and
                    sowed the seeds of instruction in many minds where they have since ripened into
                    an abundant harvest. The daily papers obtained an entire mastery over public
                    opinion. The <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal des</hi><hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> were really the kings of the
                    multitude; and their slightest hint acted sympathetically upon the resolutions
                    of the community.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When
                    General Foy died, the daily press called upon the country to provide for his
                    children, and a million of francs was soon subscribed. The same potver collected
                    200,000 persons to attend the obsequies of Manuel, in presence of the guards
                    drawn out, and at the risk of a battle. At the general election, in 1827, the
                    press designated the candidates, and decided the contests. More recently, the
                    funeral of General Lamarque was attended by an immense assemblage, which the
                    press had called together, at the imminent hazard of another conflict in the
                    streets of Paris.</p></note> The administration of Μ. de Martignac, which was a
                    compromise with the liberal party, abolished the censorship, and reduced the
                    securities paid in by the journals. It only gave birth to one ministerial paper.
                    But that of Μ. de Polignac, which was openly hostile to the liberty of the
                    press, elicited a new class, resolved to go all lengths, and to yield to no
                    obstacle. Then appeared the <hi rend="italic">Universel,</hi> a partisan of
                    absolute power; the <hi rend="italic">Temps,</hi> representing the <hi
                    rend="italic">centre gauche</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >National,</hi> detached from the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel,</hi> and
                    conducted by M. Thiers, in the interest of the house of Orleans; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Globe,</hi> which now became a daily paper. In the provinces
                    appeared the <hi rend="italic">Tribune des Departements,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Courrier des Electeurs;</hi> but the great body of the people
                    still clung to the old-established and well-known papers. The popularity of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Débats,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Courrier Français,</hi>
                    increased with the danger. When the revolution of July broke out, the first of
                    these papers had a circulation of 22,000, and the second of 18,000; and each of
                    the twelve shares in the former journal, which were originally taken at L.200,
                    though the money was never paid, returned a dividend of L.2000. In fact, the
                    revolution of July was the royal reign of the press, when the two journals
                    already mentioned enjoyed an almost supreme authority. But since that period it
                    appears to have undergone very considerable changes. The republican party was
                    the first to multiply its organs. In a short time it brought out the <hi
                    rend="italic">National,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mouvement,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Révolution,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Tribune,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Patriote,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Avenir,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Réformateur,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Populaire,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rons Sens.</hi> The two last were Sunday papers, which only
                    cost one penny each, and were sold by hawkers. As many as 50,000 copies of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rons Sens</hi> have been sold in this manner in one day. But
                    the law which subjected the public hawkers to the monopoly of the police put a
                    stop to this traffic; the republican press shared the same fate as the
                    republican <hi rend="italic">erneutes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    subsequent enactments gave it the <hi rend="italic">coup de grace.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rons Sens</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">National,</hi> however,
                    still maintain ∙a languishing existence as daily papers. From 1832 to 1835,
                    whilst the <hi rend="italic">tiers-parti,</hi> headed by Dupin, had a majority
                    in the Chambers and in the country, several journals were published in harmony
                    with that state of affairs, and some of the old ones moderated their tone, or
                    changed their denominations. In 1836, newspapers were founded, not in support of
                    any party or opinion, but purely on speculation, the profits realized by a few
                    fortunate journals having tempted adventurers to embark in such undertakings. We
                    may add, that a few enterprising individuals have undertaken to bring the daily
                    press in France to the level of the humblest fortunes, by publishing newspapers
                    at forty francs, or L.l. 12s. per annum. The projector of this system was Μ.
                    Emile Girardin, deputy of the Creuse, whose own paper, <hi rend="italic">La
                    Presse,</hi> has obtained a circulation of about 12,000. But the ultimate
                    success of the experiment is far from being certain.</p>
                <p>We have no means of ascertaining with any degree of precision the actual number
                    of the French journals, and the extent of their circulation respectively. In an
                    article written in 1829, and inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Compilateur,</hi>
                    the author, speaking of things as they then stood, says, “There are in Paris a
                    hundred and fifty-two journals, literary, scientific, and religious, and
                    seventeen political; in all a hundred and sixty-nine. Of these papers a hundred
                    and fifty-one are constitutional, or, as they are called, liberal, the eighteen
                    others being more monarchical in their spirit. The hundred and fifty-one
                    constitutional journals have, it is stated, 197,000 subscribers, 1,500,000
                    readers, and produce an income of 1,155,000 francs (L.46,200); the eighteen
                    others have 21,000 subscribers, 192,000 readers, with an income of 437,000
                    francs (L.17,480). The <hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> the official paper, has
                    from 2500 to 4000 subscribers, principally public functionaries; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Constitutionnel,</hi> from 18,000 to 20,000 subscribers; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Débats,</hi> from 13,000 to
                    14,000 subscribers; the <hi rend="italic">Quotidienne,</hi> 5000 subscribers;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Courrier Français,</hi> 4500 subscribers; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal du Commerce,</hi> 3500 subscribers; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette de France,</hi> 7000 subscribers; the <hi rend="italic">Messager des
                    Chambres,</hi> 2500 subscribers; the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Départements,</hi> a new paper, 100 subscribers; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveau Journal de Paris,</hi> from 1000 to 1500 <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559114" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9114-0173"/>subscribers. All these are
                    published in the capital. The journals printed in the provinces are calculated
                    at seventy-five, exclusive of papers for advertisements and ministerial
                    bulletins. Of these, sixty-six are constitutional, being supported only by
                    subscribers of the same way of thinking. One, the <hi rend="italic">Memorial de
                    Toulouse,</hi> is supported by the archbishop of that diocese; four are, it is
                    asserted, paid from the secret funds of the Jesuits; and the other four are
                    monarchical, but possess little influence.” Since the period to which this
                    applies, however, great changes have taken place, and the circulation of some of
                    the leading daily journals has declined. Nevertheless, it appears that a share
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> is still worth twenty-five times
                    its original cost; that the shares in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tribunaux,</hi> which, at the outset, were worth only 500 francs,
                    are now sold for 30,000; and that the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de France</hi>
                    has, for a long time, brought the proprietor an income of 200,000 francs, or
                    L.8000 a year.</p>
                <p>In Germany, newspapers originated in the <hi rend="italic">Relations,</hi> as
                    they were termed, which sprung up at Augsburg and Vienna in 1524, at Ratisbon in
                    1528, at Dillingen in 1569, and at Nuremberg in 1571, and which appeared in the
                    form of letters printed, but without date, place, or number. The first German
                    newspaper in numbered sheets was printed in 1612, and entitled “Account of what
                    has happened in Germany and Italy, Spain and France, the East and West Indies,
                    and other countries.” Since that time, public papers have successively appeared
                    in different places, and under various titles, but all of them subject to a
                    strict censorship. In Germany, however, as in France, the periodical press was
                    of little importance till the era of the French Revolution, and, in comparison
                    with the state of matters in these countries, it has always remained so. By the
                    resolutions of the German Diet in 1819, it was placed under strict supervision,
                    and still continues subject to a vigilant censorship. Till the commencement of
                    the French Revolution, the <hi rend="italic">Hamburger Correspondent</hi> was
                    almost the only paper in Germany which derived its information respecting
                    foreign countries from original correspondence; and at that time its sale was
                    estimated at between 30,000 and 36,000 copies. Subsequently, however, it
                    declined, principally owing to the occupation of Hamburg by the French, and its
                    sale amounted to only a few thousands. In the year 1828, twenty-one gazettes,
                    daily and weekly, were published at Hamburg. But a new kind of periodical sprang
                    up in Germany in the year 1798, and soon outstripped all others. This was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung,</hi> or Universal Gazette, established by
                    Cotta, a bookseller in Tubingen, and destined to become an important political
                    organ. The <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi> is now published at
                    Augsburg. In all the countries of Europe it has correspondents, who supply it
                    with intelligence; and both the German and foreign governments frequently make
                    use of it to influence public opinion by demi-official articles. This has been
                    done with much dexterity by the Austrian government, especially in its
                    transactions respecting paper money and the public stocks; and even the French
                    ministry have, it is said, occasionally made use of it for similar purposes. But
                    with all these advantages, the sale is small, not exceeding 2000 or 2500, and
                    barely covers the expenses. The deliverance of Germany in the year 1813 gave
                    rise to a number of political papers, all imbued with the awakened spirit of the
                    times. Kotzebue and Niebuhr each commenced a journal of this description; but
                    both were soon discontinued. The most celebrated gazette of this period was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rheinische Merkur</hi> of Görres, which appeared in January
                    1814, and terminated its career in the beginning of 1816. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oestereichische Reobaster,</hi> or Austrian Observer, was established by the
                    private secretary of Prince Metternich, and, as the official organ of the
                    cabinet of Vienna, it speedily acquired a considerable circulation. The German
                    papers of amusement originated with the <hi rend="italic">Zeitung</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fur die Elegante Welt,</hi> which was established at Leipzig in
                    1801. The number of papers of this description has since been constantly
                    increasing, although many of them have perished as rapidly as they arose. But of
                    those which have maintained their ground, the most important are, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morgenblatt</hi> of Stuttgart, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abendzeitung</hi> of Dresden, the <hi rend="italic">Gesellschafter</hi> of
                    Berlin, and the <hi rend="italic">Litterarische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wochenblatt,</hi> established by Kotzebue. Of all these, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mor-genblatt</hi> has the greatest sale.</p>
                <p>Italy, Spain, and Portugal, present little worthy of notice as respects the
                    newspaper press. Of the Italian journals, the <hi rend="italic">Gazetta di
                    Firenze,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Gazetta di Milano,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diario</hi><hi rend="italic">di Roma,</hi> are almost the only
                    ones which are read in foreign countries. ∙ The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Giornale</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcadico</hi><hi rend="italic">di Roma</hi>
                    embraces literature, the fine arts, and miscellaneous subjects, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eco</hi><hi rend="italic">di Milano</hi> endeavours to keep up a
                    literary intercourse between Italy and other countries. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ga-ceta</hi> of Madrid has a semi-official character, but in other respects is
                    undeserving of notice. Lisbon has also its organ for the publication of official
                    documents and communications. In Belgium and Holland there are, in French and
                    Dutch respectively, a considerable number of daily and weekly papers, besides
                    monthly publications. In 1830 Switzerland had twenty-four weekly papers, and
                    five others which appeared once a fortnight. The first Russian paper was
                    published in 1703, under Peter I. In 1829 the number of papers and periodicals
                    published in the Russian empire was seventy-three; but the only important
                    political journals are the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de St Petersbourg</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal de St Petersbourg,</hi> both of which are written
                    in the French language. In Sweden there is not much opposition nor independence
                    amongst the newspapers, and political discussion is at a very low ehb. An
                    interesting account of the Norwegian journals will be found in Laing’s Residence
                    in Norway, to which the reader is referred. Denmark has about eighty journals,
                    of which twenty-three are devoted to politics, and twenty-five to the
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>The Greeks have now several newspapers in their own language, though none of them
                    exerts any considerable influence, or has a numerous subscription. A journal is
                    also published at Corfu. In Smyrna the <hi rend="italic">Spectateur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oriental</hi> was in 1827 displaced by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observateur</hi><hi rend="italic">Impartial,</hi> and subsequently by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Courrier</hi><hi rend="italic">de Smyrne,</hi> which is conducted
                    in a spirit friendly to the sultan. At Constantinople the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moniteur</hi><hi rend="italic">Ottoman</hi> is published in French under the
                    sanction of the sultan; and the viceroy of Egypt has likewise his official
                    organ, in the same language, printed at Boulak, near Cairo.</p>
                <p>The increase of newspapers in the United States has been much more rapid than in
                    England. The total number of newspapers annually issued in the Union has been
                    estimated at from 55,000,000 to 60,000,000, whereas the total number issued in
                    Great Britain and Ireland during the year 1833 was only 34,515,221. It follows
                    that, making allowance for the difference of population, every individual in
                    America has, at an average, more than twice the supply of newspapers enjoyed by
                    each person in England. From the low price of the American, as compared with the
                    English and even the French newspapers, they are liberally patronised by all
                    classes, and are to be seen in almost every dwelling and counting-house, and in
                    all hotels, taverns, and shops. But we must not estimate the value nor the
                    influence of newspapers by their quantity alone. Regard must likewise be had to
                    its quality, which indeed is the principal consideration to be attended to. But
                    in whatever degree the American may exceed the English or French journals in
                    number, they sink immeasurably below them in point of quality. In the United
                    States the state of the newspaper press is such that it can scarcely descend
                    lower; indeed it may be considered as a disgrace <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559127" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9127-0174"/>to the country. These
                    journals, with but few exceptions, indulge in the most offensive, and often
                    brutal personalities. Instead of examining the principles of measures, they
                    assail the character and misrepresent the motives of those by whom they are
                    introduced; and, in fact, it would be difficult to name an individual of any
                    distinction who has not been libelled and calumniated by a large portion of the
                    press, to a degree which can scarcely be imagined. The magnitude of the evil,
                    however, will in all probability lead to its cure. It can scarcely be supposed
                    that an intelligent and well-instructed people will long continue to patronise a
                    press which traffics in misrepresentation, scurrility, and exaggeration, and
                    which, besides the outrages it commits against individuals, opposes a serious
                    obstacle to wise government and well-considered improvement.</p>
                <p>From the immense number of newspapers circulated in the United States, as
                    compared with the population of the country, it follows that the number of
                    subscribers to each paper must be limited; indeed 2000 is considered as a
                    respectable list. The consequence is, that one paper is unable to command the
                    talents of several able men, as in France, and that, in the general scramble,
                    the object is rather to flatter the known prejudices, and minister to the bad
                    passions of the people, than to enlighten their understandings by inculcating
                    sound principles, or enforcing salutary truths. Their abundance, however,
                    happily neutralises their effects. Declamation and sophistry are rendered
                    comparatively innocuous by running in a thousand conflicting currents. But the
                    case would be very different, and the evil altogether intolerable, if there were
                    in the United States only a few papers, with from 25,000 to 30,000 subscribers,
                    and perhaps five times as many readers. Upon such a supposition, journalism
                    would be as influential in America as in France, and in its effects ten times
                    more dangerous. To show the progressive extension of the American newspaper
                    press, it is only necessary to state, that at the commencement of the
                    revolutionary war in 1775, the number of newspapers published in the United
                    States was only thirty-seven; that in 1810 it had increased to 359; that in 1828
                    it exceeded 850; and that in 1834 it amounted to no less than 1265. At this time
                    the number of daily papers published within the Union was ninety, and that of
                    other periodical journals 130.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the number of periodicals and inhabitants of different countries,
                    made in the year 1827, gave the following results. At that time there appeared
                    in the United States upwards of 800 journals to 11,600,000 inhabitants; in Great
                    Britain, 483 different newspapers to 23,400,000 inhabitants; in Sweden and
                    Norway, eighty-two journals to 3,866,000 inhabitants; in Denmark, eighty
                    journals to 1,950,000 inhabitants; in Prussia, 288 journals to 12,416,000
                    inhabitants; in the Netherlands, 150 journals to 6,143,000 inhabitants; in the
                    German confederation, exclusive of both Austria and Prussia, 305 journals to
                    13,300,000 inhabitants; in Saxony, fifty-four newspapers to 1,400,000
                    inhabitants; in Hanover, sixteen newspapers to 1,550,000 inhabitants; in
                    Bavaria, forty-eight newspapers to 3,960,000 inhabitants; and in France, 490
                    periodical publications of all kinds to a population of about 32,000,000. A
                    comparison of the number of periodicals and inhabitants in different capitals
                    gives results scarcely less varied. Thus, Stockholm, with 38,000 inhabitants,
                    has thirty journals; Rome, with 154,000, has only three; Berlin, with 221,000,
                    has fifty-three periodical works; Copenhagen, with 109,000 inhabitants, has
                    fifty-seven journals; and in Paris, which contains a population of nearly
                    900,000, there are 176 periodical works. Since the date to which this comparison
                    refers, however, the numbers in both respects must have varied considerably; but
                    it is probable that the relative proportions remain pretty nearly the same. It
                    may also be observed, that no general conclusion as to the state of intellectual
                    culture or of political information amongst a people can safely be deduced from
                    such comparative expositions as that which is above given. The proportional
                    number of journals circulated in the United States is much greater than in any
                    other country; yet, as we have already shown, they are the most worthless, and
                    consequently the least calculated to diffuse useful knowledge, or to excite a
                    spirit of inquiry, of any in the world.</p>
                <p>Much has been said both as to the absolute and the comparative effects, moral and
                    political, produced by newspapers, in those countries where they are freely
                    circulated; and there is room for considerable diversity of opinion respecting
                    the degree and the kind of influence which they exert upon the sentiments and
                    opinions of the public. But that this influence must be considerable, in
                    whatever mode or direction it may operate in particular cases, or under peculiar
                    circumstances, there can be no doubt at all, even amongst those who differ most
                    widely as to its real character and effects. It will of course vary according to
                    the relative condition of different classes or communities in point of
                    information; but the joint effect and full result of its continual appliance can
                    scarcely fail to be very considerable, even where its action is least
                    concentrated. The power of the newspaper press depends, not on single and
                    disjoined impulsions, but on the aggregate effects of constantly reiterated
                    action; it is a practical exemplification of the proverb, that the drop hollows
                    the stone, <hi rend="italic">non vi sed saepe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cadendo.</hi> All experience shows, that any agency or force, however small, if
                    continually applied in the same direction, and towards the same object or
                    objects, will in course of time produce the greatest results. Still, in
                    different countries, variously circumstanced in point of education and general
                    information, considerable diversity may be observed in the operation of this
                    power, and in the mode in which it attains its ultimate effect upon the public
                    mind. Where the mass of the people are comparatively enlightened, and more or
                    less habituated to reflection, the press, in order eventually to govern, must
                    begin by following the current of opinion. It cannot stem, but it may divert,
                    the stream; it must not begin by opposing a direct resistance, but by skill and
                    address it may ultimately succeed in turning it into a new channel, and in some
                    measure governing it at pleasure. In such cases, there is both action and
                    re-action. Public opinion acts upon the press, and the press re-acts upon public
                    opinion, with an accumulating force, of which, in certain circumstances, it is
                    difficult to exaggerate the extent and the power. But it is otherwise in
                    countries where the mass of the people are comparatively unenlightened, and
                    unaccustomed to form an independent judgment amidst the conflict of antagonist
                    opinions. There the press is a real and direct poyer, which acts at once on the
                    public mind, and which, if left to act uncontrolled, may eventually produce the
                    most baneful, not to say fatal, impressions. In the former case, there is a
                    check in the preexistent condition of society; in the latter, there is none
                    whatever, except that which may happen to be applied by the law.</p>
                <p>From an elaborate calculation made in the year 1819, it was inferred that,
                    including the provincial journals, an Englishman reads daily twenty or thirty
                    times as much as a Frenchman does of the newspapers of his country. This
                    calculation may have been exaggerated, and the disparity is probably much less
                    now than it was eighteen years ago; but it is nevertheless evident that the
                    balance of the newspaper reading, all kinds of journals included, is still on
                    the side of the Englishman, who, again, is exceeded in this respect by the
                    North-American. Yet, in France, the journals exert a much more direct influence
                    upon public opinion than either in England or in America. They constitute a sort
                    of power in the state, which is altogether irresponsible within the limits
                    prescribed by the law, that is, in its <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559140"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9140-0175"/>ordinary exercise; and they give the tone to the
                    sentiments and opinions of the nation. They are not so much mirrors which
                    reflect the state of the public mind, as agencies which impart to it whatever
                    bias or tendency they please. Journalism in that country is therefore seen under
                    a different aspect from that in which it appears in almost any other; and hence
                    it has been an object of constant vigilance and suspicion on the part of the
                    general government. But if its influence be greater in France than elsewhere,
                    that influence has also been more contested. From its birth, as it displayed a
                    tendency to absorb every thing, so nothing was granted to it without a struggle.
                    No power has ever excited more alarm, has had more enemies, has survived severer
                    trials, or has undergone more singular revolutions. From 1789 to 1830, the
                    ordinary condition of the French press was a rule of censorship and oppression;
                    the rare intervals of liberty vouchsafed to it only served as moments of rest to
                    take breath in that adventurous campaign, every advance in which was won by hard
                    fighting. Yet the power of the press has grown amidst these trials; the bonds
                    which were imposed upon it to check its movement have fortified its strength,
                    and it is now a sort of dictatorship in the state. The existence of this
                    extraordinary power is accounted for by the circumstances of the country. In
                    Great Britain, and in the United States, where a representative government is
                    firmly established, each political power occupies its natural place, without
                    transgressing the limits of its proper sphere of action. The press does not
                    invade the province of the legislative chambers, nor do the latter encroach upon
                    the domain of the press. But in France the government is still at a stage of
                    experiment and difficulty; it alternately looks back to the past, and forward to
                    the future, seeking its equilibrium and its point of rest. The time is not yet
                    come for it peaceably to work out its established principle, because that
                    principle is still a matter of doubt and debate; and as long as this
                    experimental state of things shall continue, the constituted powers will have
                    only a secondary importance, and the press, which takes the lead and opens the
                    road to discovery, will necessarily govern the country. But, in a country like
                    Great Britain, where the great body of the people are possessed of information,
                    and the habit of political discussion has long been formed and matured; where
                    the conflicts of party enter as an essential element into the practical working
                    of the constitution, and there exists a steady independent opinion, upon which
                    violence and exaggeration are powerless, except in periods of great public
                    excitement; the press is rather an exponent or index of the feelings,
                    sentiments, and opinions of the people, than a controlling or governing power,
                    assuming the form of a dictatorship, and really constituting an <hi
                    rend="italic">imperium in</hi><hi rend="italic">imperio,</hi> as in France. The
                    whole action of government is concentrated in the houses of parliament and in
                    the hands of the administration; and the press is restricted to its proper
                    function, namely, the criticism of events and of public opinions. The people,
                    too, are trained and habituated to this state of things. They are not the
                    slaves, but the patrons, and even the critics, of the press; nor are their minds
                    primarily moved by its speculations, commentaries, and arguments, directed, as
                    these generally are, towards the support of some particular set of opinions.
                    Party journals are for the most part read as such, and the statements or
                    reasonings of one set of writers are coolly compared with those of another.
                    There is nothing, or next to nothing, of that undoubting faith, or that blind
                    credulity, which leads men to believe merely because it is written. Even the
                    warmest partisan will not submit his understanding to the exclusive guidance of
                    the writer whom, perhaps, he in general most admires and approves of; and hence
                    the best safeguard against the abuse of free discussion, or the licentiousness
                    of the press, is to be found in the inherent stability of our institutions, and
                    the sense, intelligence, and morality of the people.</p>
