                    was discovered in Captain Cook’s last voyage, and was so named in honour of Sir
                    Fletcher Norton, afterwards Lord Grantley, a near relation of Mr, afterwards Dr
                    King. It extends as far as north latitude 64. 55. There is no good station for
                    ships, nor even a tolerable harbour, in all the sound. Mr King, on his landing
                    here, discerned many spacious valleys, with rivers flowing through them, well
                    wooded, and bounded with hills of a moderate height. One of the rivers towards
                    the north-west seemed to be considerable; and he was inclined to suppose, from
                    its direction, that it discharged itself into the sea from the head of the bay.
                    Some of his people, penetrating beyond this into the country, found the trees to
                    be of a larger size the farther they proceeded. Long. 197. 13. E. Lat. 64. 31.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Norway</hi> is an extensive country in the north of Europe,
                    and, along with Sweden, forming one kingdom. All the countries which now
                    comprise Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, were designated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scandia</hi> by the ancients. Pliny calls it <hi rend="italic">Scania
                    insula,</hi> an appellation which derives its origin from the circumstance of
                    the Romans, in the time of their great naturalist, being only acquainted with
                    that part of the country called Skanen or Skonen, the little information which
                    they possessed being obtained from some Germans. This is the ancient province of
                    Schonen or Scania, the most southerly of Sweden. The name was afterwards changed
                    to Scandinavia, which has been called the “storehouse of nations ;” but without
                    any just title to such a distinction. It seems now pretty certain that
                    Scandinavia was not the native country of the Scythians or Goths, but that they
                    migrated from Asia to Europe. The fact of Pliny having designated Scandinavia as
                    an island of considerable although uncertain magnitude, has also given rise to
                    some discussion. To the imperfect knowledge of geography which the ancients
                    possessed, may reasonably be ιttributed their mistaken notion as to the insular
                    position )f these countries; but the difficulty may be got rid of in mother
                    manner. It is well known that the Baltic Sea has liminished in height to a
                    considerable extent, or, in the anguage of geologists, the coast on its shores
                    has been ⅛vated. In the course of about a century, this elevation s proved to
                    have been considerable by the high-water narks left upon the rocks on the sea
                    coast at different pe-iods. If the sinking of the water or the rising of the
                    land n this quarter has continued at the same rate from a very .&gt;arly period,
                    then, at the time when Pliny wrote, Scandi-ιavia, penetrated in every direction
                    by gigantic arms of he sea, may have had the appearance of a number of islands

                    ancients entertained of the northern countries of Europe,” says Malte-Brun, “it
                    cannot be doubted that the country which Pliny<note anchored="true"

                    We thus see that the name of Nerigou has much more analogy with that of Norrige
                    than with that of Norweg, which at the first glance appears to be the origin of
                    the modern name.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Norway is interwoven with the annals of Sweden and Denmark, and consists in
                    legends contained in the Heimskringla or Saga, a collection of ancient
                    manuscripts, which is to Norway what the Edda is to Iceland. The petty
                    sovereigns who held sway in Norway in remote ages were independent, but appear
                    to have acknowledged a kind of supremacy in the kings of Sweden and Denmark,
                    probably more nominal than real; but until the ninth or tenth century little is
                    known of the annals of the country. The Norwegians, of course, constituted no
                    inconsiderable proportion of those daring adventurers who, under the general
                    name of Normans on the continent, and Danes in Britain, became at one time the

                <p>Ιhe Royal Northern Antiquarian Society of Copenhagen has published a series of
                    the Saga, comprehending the historical account of events which belong to
                    European history, and also to that of Scandinavia, during the eleventh and
                    twelfth centuries. It includes a period of about one hundred and seventy years,
                    beginning with the Saga of St Olaf, the contemporary of Canute the Great of
                    England, who assumed the crown of Norway in 1013, and continuing the series
                    until the death of Magnus Ellingson in a sea-fight with Sverrer I. in 1184. This
                    is one of the most <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560219"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0219-0258"/>curious and minute pictures of an age long past,
                    which the literature of Europe is possessed of. It is not only valuable as an
                    historical document, confirming or adding to our stock of facts relative to a
                    dark period of English history, but as a record of the social condition of the
                    country at that time, and of the influence of the Thing, or assembly of the
                    people; a reference of all matters to this popular convocation being one of the
                    most striking facts recorded in the Saga. From these rude annals we learn, that
                    at a period immediately preceding the first traces of free institutions in our
                    own country, similar institutions existed in great activity amongst these
                    northern people. It seems a fair inference from these facts, therefore, that we
                    owe the political institutions which we enjoy to the Danes and Normans, who were
                    more likely to impose their own peculiar institutions upon those whom they
                    subdued, than to receive institutions from the conquered.</p>
                <p>From other Sagas preceding that of St Olaf, we learn, that about the middle of
                    the ninth century, Halfden the Black divided Norway into five districts, with
                    fixed head places for holding Things in each. At these assemblies, laws were
                    framed suitable to the local circumstances of each district, which gave its name
                    to the code. This potentate was succeeded by the celebrated Harold Harfagr, or
                    the Fair-Haired, who ascended the throne at ten years of age, and reigned from
                    863 to 936. This warlike monarch, after long fighting, reduced all the
                    independent nobles or petty kings to the condition of subjects, and consolidated
                    the various principalities of Norway into one kingdom. Thus was consummated in a
                    single reign, and that too in the ninth century, a work which afterwards cost
                    the other nations of Europe several centuries of bloodshed and contention. But
                    this was more easily accomplished in Norway than elsewhere; for in that country
                    the great nobility never had feudal powers, and consequently those who were
                    under them as servants were bound by no such ties of vassalage as the retainers
                    of a Highland chieftain or a Norman baron. They were not taught passive and
                    unconditional submission to a superior, although he might bear the title of
                    king; for before a small sovereign could make war, he was under the necessity of
                    assembling the Thing, and obtaining its sanction. The equal division of property
                    amongst children, which extended to the crown itself, prevented the accumulation
                    of power in the hands of individuals; and the circumstance of the total want of
                    fortresses, castles, or strongholds in the country, owing to the division of
                    estates, effectually prevented a nobility from attaining the same power with the
                    nobles of feudal countries, and setting the royal authority at defiance. Some of
                    these nobility or small kings colonized Iceland; and Normandy was conquered by
                    Rolf Gangr, one of those whom Harold Harfagr expelled from Norway. In this
                    king’s reign Christianity was introduced into the country, and from this period
                    the events recorded in the historical Saga may claim some degree of
                    confidence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Harold
                    Harfagr was born in the year 853; he began to reign in 863, and died in 936. St
                    Olaf’s father was Harold Graendske, his grandfather Gudrod, his
                    great-grandfather Biorn Staerke, and his great-great-grandfather Harold Harfagr,
                    and St Olaf was born anno 99ð, only fifty-nine years after the death of his
                    great progenitor Harfagr. A contemporary of St Olaf was therefore a credible
                    source of information for all the evehts of Harfagr’s reign, such as the
                    conquest of Normandy by Rolf Gangr, the colonization of Iceland, &amp;c.
                    (Laing’s Journal of a Residence in Norway.)</p></note> The length of this reign
                    was no doubt favourable to the lower orders, by consolidating their
                    institutions, which, as they weakened the authority of the petty kings, were
                    favoured by Harold. Eric, his son and successor, whom he had associated with
                    himself in the royal authority, was deposed by the Thing on account of his
                    cruelty, and a younger brother succeeded him. Hakon, which was the name of this
                    son of Harfagr, was brought up from his childhood at the court of Athelstane,
                    king of England. He reigned nineteen years, during which period there was
                    frequent reference to the Things, both for amending the laws, and for the
                    dissemination of Christianity. It appears, that in attempting to establish the
                    religion of the Cross in his dominions, Hakon had recourse to what were
                    considered as unconstitutional means; for we find that at a meeting of the
                    Thing, held in the year 956, a husbandman named Asbiorn, of Medalhuus, stood up
                    and declared, on the part of his neighbours and of himself, “that they had
                    elected Hakon to be their king, upon the condition that freedom of religion and
                    freedom of conscience should be warranted to every man; and if the king
                    persisted in attempting to suppress their ancient faith, they would elect
                    another king,·” adding, “and now, king, make thy choice.” This is certainly one
                    of the most striking instances of parliamentary patriotism to be met with in the
                    history of Europe; and we must descend six or seven centuries nearer to the
                    present time before we can match it in the annals of our own country. Hakon was
                    not only compelled to give way, but also to take part in the heathen ceremonies
                    of the meeting. This king was slain in 963, in a battle with the sons of his
                    elder brother Eric, upon whom Athelstane of England had conferred the kingdom of
                    Northumberland.</p>
                <p>It appears that, after the death of Harfagr, the small kings again had risen to
                    some degree of power, and that each in his own assembly, called also a Thing,
                    had exercised a limited authority. Olaf the saint, before he assumed the name of
                    king, consulted one of these assemblies of the nobility as to the way of
                    proposing his claim as heir of Harfagr to the general Things of the people; and
                    proceeded in such a manner as to show that their voice alone was insufficient to
                    constitute him supreme chief in the land, without the sanction of the general
                    Thing. These institutions appear to have always conferred or confirmed the royal
                    prerogative, and to have been of great importance in that age amongst the whole
                    Scandinavian people. In cases where the good of the community was at stake, they
                    set the royal authority at defiance, and obliged the sovereign to accept of such
                    international contracts as the Things of both countries conceived was for their
                    mutual benefit. The Thing of Sweden compelled the sovereign of that country to
                    conclude a peace with Norway, and to bestow his daughter in marriage on King
                    Olaf, towards whom he cherished implacable enmity. Olaf had the title of saint
                    conferred on him from the exertions which he made to introduce Christianity
                    amongst his subjects; but in prosecution of this object he exercised the most
                    atrocious cruelties, and completely alienated the affections of his people. He
                    attempted to govern without the intervention of the Things, which became the
                    cause of his ruin; for when Canute the Great, who conquered Norway, invaded his
                    dominions, the people literally “stopped the supplies ;” and, unable to collect
                    a force sufficient to oppose the king of England, he was compelled to seek
                    refuge in Russia. For the purpose of recovering his crown, he landed in Sweden
                    with a few followers, and, having received an accession to his force from the
                    king of that country, who was his brother-in-law, marched from the Gulf of
                    Finland across the peninsula to the Fiord or Gulf of Drontheim. In the mean time
                    the Thing of Norway raised an army of twelve thousand bonder, and placed it
                    under the command of Olver of Egge. At the débouché of the valley of Vaerdal
                    they met Olaf at the head of about four thousand adventurers. The conflict could
                    not be doubtful where there was such an inequality of numbers, and where the
                    superiority layon the side of those who were fighting in defence of their
                    liberties<pb break="no" facs="nls:194560232" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0232-0259"/>.
                    King Olaf was defeated and slain, without even showing the prudence and courage
                    which had distinguished his early career. This battle was fought on the 31st of
                    August 1030, and not on the 29th of June or July 1033, as is commonly
                    stated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is put
                    beyond a doubt by a circumstance which all accounts of the battle mention,
                    namely, that a total eclipse of the sun occurred on the same day. Professor
                    Hansteen of Christiania has calculated that such a celestial phenomenon could
                    onlv have taken place on the 31st of August 1030.</p></note> The body of the
                    fallen monarch was transported to Saint Clement’s Church, in Drontheim, which
                    had been erected by himself. In return for the services which he had rendered
                    the church, the clergy soon afterwards canonized him; and even at Constantinople
                    temples were erected to his memory. His tomb was regarded as a consecrated spot,
                    to which pilgrimages were performed, not only by ardent devotees from the north,
                    but also from the south of Europe.</p>
                <p>Canute the Great did not long remain in Norway; and from the period of Olaf’s
                    death the country was ruled by native monarchs, who even for a time governed
                    Denmark. It may be gathered from the ancient chronicles before referred to, that
                    at this period society was composed of four distinct orders. The first was the
                    nobility, who were descendants of royal families; and, without regard to
                    priority of birth, those who were descended both on the mother’s side and
                    father’s side from Harfagr were eligible to the supreme monarchy. They appear to
                    have had no civil power or privilege as nobles, but merely this odclsbaarn-ret
                    to the crown. The odelsbaarnmen, bondermen, or husbandmen, were the proprietors
                    of lands held neither from the king nor from any feudal superior. These were the
                    people who had a voice at the Things. A third order consisted of the unfree men,
                    holding land for services as vassals or as labourers in cottages, but who had no
                    voice in the Things in respect of their land. A fourth order was composed of the
                    traelle or domestic slaves, who were private property, and in a lower state than
                    the former class. This condition of society, which was equivalent to slavery,
                    was abolished by Magnus VII., who reigned from 1319 to 1344.</p>
                <p>The most important event in the history of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, in the
                    middle ages, was the union of the three kingdoms under one sovereign, Margaret,
                    daughter of Waldemar, king of Denmark, which was effected by the league of
                    Calmar, in the year 1397. The circumstances which led to this remarkable
                    occurrence will be found narrated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Denmark.</hi> Had this princess been as capable of conquering national
                    prejudices as she was of defeating armies, her dominions would have constituted
                    a great and powerful monarchy. But the passions of her people were more than a
                    match for her policy; and it was no doubt better that the three nations which
                    she governed should each remain in quiet possession of its own freedom, as
                    enjoyed under its own form of government and laws, than that they should lay
                    aside all differences, and, heartily uniting as one kingdom and people, become
                    the terror and scourge of Southern Europe. Margaret died without issue; but
                    during her lifetime she appointed her grand-nephew, whom some historians call
                    her cousin, Eric, a descendant of the Dukes of Pomerania, as her successor; and
                    he acceded to the triple crown of Scandinavia in 1412. The union, however, was
                    far from being cordial, and for rather more than a century local insurrections
                    from time to time broke out and distracted the country. The Swedes, in
                    particular, felt great reluctance to submit to a foreign dynasty; and after
                    various attempts on their part to shake themselves free from the compact of
                    Calmar, the oppression and cruelty of Christian II. led to the final separation
                    of Sweden in 1520, under the celebrated Gustavus Erickson or Vasa. Norway and
                    Denmark, however, remained under one sceptre till, at the adjustment of European
                    affairs after the fall of Napoleon, Norway was separated from Denmark, and
                    united to the crown of Sweden. This took place in the year 1814.</p>
                <p>The circumstances which led to the forcible separation of two countries that had
                    for centuries been united by the closest relations, and the union of one of them
                    with another country which had for as many ages been regarded as a natural
                    enemy, may be shortly stated. The grand object of the leading powers was to
                    induce every state to join in the league against Napoleon; and Sweden, in
                    consideration of an ample bribe, acceded to the general confederacy. One of the
                    foulest stains on the escutcheon of Great Britain is the treaty which she
                    entered into with Sweden, dated 3d March 1813. By this notorious compact against
                    the liberties of a whole people, England gave to the king of Sweden the kingdom
                    of Norway (which was no more hers than Rome or Pekin), together with Guadaloupe,
                    and a million of pounds sterling, as a remuneration to his Swedish majesty for
                    joining the allied powers against France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the article containing the accession of England to the
                    treaty, after various mutual stipulations, there is a provision containing the
                    following words: “And his majesty the king of Sweden engages that this union
                    shall take place with every possible regard and consideration for the happiness
                    <hi rend="italic">and liberty of</hi> the people of Norway.”</p></note> After
                    the battle of Leipsic, fought in October 1813, the Crown Prince of Sweden
                    entered Denmark with his army, and, after some bloody scenes in Holstein, peace
                    was concluded at Kiel on the 14th of January 1814. By this treaty Denmark gave
                    up all right to Norway, considering it as quite hopeless to enter into a contest
                    with Sweden and England. Although the king of Denmark might relinquish his claim
                    to the sovereignty of Norway, this was no reason for the people of that country
                    making an unconditional surrender of themselves to a foreign potentate. They
                    declared themselves an independent nation, framed a constitution of their own,
                    and proclaimed Prince Christian, son of their former sovereign, and governor of
                    Norway, as their lawful king. Not a little blood was shed in the contention
                    between Sweden and Norway; and England actively interfered, by blockading the
                    ports of Norway, for the purpose of starving the inhabitants of the country into
                    subjection. But a speedy settlement of the question became necessary to all
                    parties. The constitution which the Norwegians had prepared in April 1814, and
                    which they were in arms to maintain, was guaranteed to them, upon condition of
                    their accepting along with it the Swedish monarch as king, and the Crown Prince
                    of Denmark abdicating the throne. Matters were arranged on this footing; and on
                    the 17th of May 1814, both parties, the king of Sweden and the Norwegian nation,
                    solemnly entered into a compact to the effect stated, under the sanction and
                    guarantee of the allied powers, and of Great Britain amongst the rest.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is a fact worthy of being
                    recorded, that the committee which drew up this constitution, and laid it before
                    the national assembly, sat only four days, viz. from the 12th to the 16th of
                    April. That so perfect a model of a free constitution should have been framed in
                    so short a period, is truly marvellous; especially as it was not a rough,
                    unfinished outline, but a system of government complete in all its
                    details.</p></note> By the treaty, the entire independence of Norway as a
                    kingdom was secured, the crowns alone being united, as in the case of Hanover
                    and England. She had a constitution of her own framing, a legislature of her own
                    electing, without being interfered with by any foreign authority in the exercise
                    of her right, and laws of her own making and administering; in short, Norway
                    remained a pure democracy in all but the name.</p>
                <p>Since this union of Norway and Sweden under one sovereign, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560245" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0245-0260"/>there have occurred only two
                    events of any importance in the history of the former. The first was the
                    abolition of hereditary nobility by the Storthing; and the second was an attempt
                    of the Swedish cabinet in 1824 to force on the Norwegian people an entire
                    amalgamation of their country with Sweden. But the firmness of the Storthing or
                    parliament, the honourable feelings of the sovereign, and, it is said, the
                    interference of Russia on the part of the allied powers, prevented such an
                    infamous attempt to violate the faith of treaties, and bring disgrace upon those
                    who had guaranteed them. Great Britain, as a party to the toeaty of 1813, and as
                    having inflicted some injury on the country by her ships of war, was especially
                    bound to protect the liberties and national independence of Norway, and to
                    preserve her from becoming a mere province of Sweden, as Poland is now of
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>The facts relative to the abolition of hereditary nobility may be shortly stated.
                    It is fixed that the executive power has not a final veto, but only a suspensive
                    negative, till the law is passed by three successive Storthings. In the year
                    1815, both chambers of the Storthing proposed and passed a motion to abolish
                    nobility for ever in Norway. The slender remains of this class were of foreign,
                    and almost in every instance of recent origin; besides, few of them had enough
                    of property to enable them to hold a dignified station in society. By the law of
                    succession land is equally divided amongst all the children, so that large
                    estates could not be entailed on the possessor of the family title; and hence,
                    to maintain his rank and respectability, a nobleman must have become a placeman
                    or a pensioner, or engaged in operations which would bring nobility into
                    contempt. The existence of an hereditary nobility, in a country where the law of
                    primogeniture was unknown in the succession to real property, seemed, therefore,
                    an anomaly, which, in any circumstances, could not long be tolerated, and which
                    was altogether unsuitable to the state of things which had long obtained in
                    Norway. The royal assent, however, was refused to the proposed enactment in
                    1815, and again in the year 1818, after it had passed through a second
                    Storthing. To prevent it from passing a third time became the grand object of
                    government; for then it would necessarily have become the law of the land, with
                    or without the royal consent. In 1821, the year when the measure was to be again
                    brought forward, the king in person repaired to Christiania, and used every
                    means to induce the Storthing to abandon it; but in vain. Six thousand soldiers
                    were marched to the neighbourhood of that city, to overawe both the legislature
                    and the people, and extreme irritation prevailed. At this critical moment, when
                    the flames of civil war were about to be kindled, both the Russian and American
                    ministers interfered. What arguments or remonstrances they employed is unknown;
                    but the fact is, that government lowered its tone, the troops were withdrawn,
                    and the Swedish cabinet gave way. The Storthing having passed the measure
                    abolishing hereditary nobility for the third time, it consequently became law.
                    Norway, therefore, remains a pure democracy, federally united with the monarchy
                    of Sweden. Its constitution has outlived two dangerous attacks upon it; and as
                    the principles upon which it is based have been developed by practice, it has
                    gained additional strength, and been further secured by the love and veneration
                    of the people. The sudden disjunction of Denmark and Norway, left, of course,
                    much business to be adjusted between individuals of the two countries. It thus
                    occasioned much distress and loss to persons having connections and property in
                    both; and it still produces a constant intercourse. Few, we believe, will admire
                    the manner in which the union between Sweden and Norway was effected; but as few
                    will doubt the benefits which must result to both from the exchange of mutual
                    hostility for mutual cordiality, and to a certain extent an identity of
                    interests.</p>
                <p>If the reader turn to the map of Europe, he will find that Norway extends from
                    the fifty-eighth to the seventy-first degree of north latitude, and at the
                    broadest from the fifth to about the thirteenth degree of longitude east from
                    Greenwich. On the east it is bounded by Sweden, on the west and south by the
                    North Sea, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. At the broadest part it is
                    scarcely three hundred miles across, and north of the sixty-third degree of
                    latitude the breadth is very inconsiderable, the country narrowing to a mere
                    belt. Its shape is very peculiar, and, in the main, it strikingly resembles that
                    of a Florence flask, the rounded bottom being presented to the south, and the
                    long narrow neck stretching to the north. Norway thus begins about the point
                    where Scotland ends, that is, the Naze. The most southerly headland in the
                    former is nearly in the same parallel as the Pentland Frith, which divides the
                    latter country from the Orkney Islands. These facts will serve to convey a
                    somewhat precise idea of the position of Norw ay. The sea-coast presents
                    features similar to those which characterise Iceland, the North of Scotland,
                    Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Labrador, and other islands and continental tracts of
                    country exposed to the storms, the currents, and the perpetual buffetings of the
                    Northern Ocean. The action of the sea alone, however, could not have formed such
                    immense fissures as are found in the solid primary rock on the Norwegian coast.
                    The theory of the elevation of the land by volcanic impulse from below seems
                    alone sufficient to account for such phenomena.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Indeed, the large rounded boulder stones
                    found on the tops of the highest mountains afford evidence sufficient of the
                    fact that at one time Norway had been submerged beneath the Northern Ocean. That
                    the sea never flowed in this quarter of the globe (and consequently in every
                    other), eight thousand feet (the height of the highest mountains) above its
                    present level, may readily be taken for granted. We may, therefore, conclude,
                    that the land has been raised by some mighty power; and we know of none which
                    could effect this but the pent-up fire and compressed gases of a volcano, which,
                    striving for vent, upheaved the solid pavement of the globe which lay above
                    them, and thus broke it up into innumerable fragments.</p></note></p>
                <p>The greater part of Norway may be said to have an outer and an inner coast, the
                    former being a succession of rocky islands of all dimensions, from a mere point
                    to more than a mile in length, and lying within about a mile of the mainland,
                    thus circling all the coast as with a girdle. Boats and small vessels make their
                    coasting voyages within the rocks; for, even when the ocean is strongly
                    agitated, the outer barrier acts as a sort of break-water, preventing the
                    channel within from being thrown into violent commotion.</p>
                <p>Those immense arms of the sea which penetrate deep into the country are called
                    fiords in Norway; a name in geographical nomenclature identifying them with the
                    friths of Scotland, to which they bear a general resemblance, and also to the
                    maritime lochs so numerous on the west coast of that country. To enumerate these
                    were only to présenta catalogue of names designating the same object in
                    different situations and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> different sizes. They vary
                    from sixty to two hundred miles in length, and from being several miles to less
                    than a gunshot in breadth; and altogether they constitute one of the most
                    remarkable physical features of the country. The inland streams generally empty
                    themselves into these fiords; and, as in the case of the Friths of Forth, Clyde,
                    and others, in Scotland, it is often difficult to say where the river ends and
                    the ocean begins. All along the rock-bound coast these arms of the sea succeed
                    each other with melancholy sameness; but in penetrating within their sombre and
                    sometimes dangerous mouths, the scene is all at once changed, presenting, at the
                    bottom of these bays, creeks, and other indentations, towns of a pleasant and
                    cheerful aspect, and banks finely wooded with all the varieties<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560258" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0258-0261"/> of those forest trees which
                    we are accustomed to meet in more temperate latitudes, and studded with
                    cottages, farm-houses, and country residences, indicating taste and comfort, if
                    not luxury and wealth. The tide rushes into many of these fiords with great
                    violence, especially on the north-westerly quarter of the peninsula. This is
                    readily accounted for from the fact, that the interior basins are often very
                    capacious, whilst the mouths by which the water flows in to fill them are
                    frequently very confined. Opposite to Folden Fiord is the Maelstrom, or
                    Moskoestrom, long celebrated as the most appalling whirlpool in Europe; but it
                    owes much of its reputation to the exaggerated accounts of travellers. It is
                    situated nearly at the extremity of the range of the Lofoden Islands, beginning
                    between Moskoenaes and Moskoe, and exhausting itself between Varoe and Rost, the
                    last of which is the most westerly of the Lofodens. The whirlpool is simply
                    caused by the rushing of the ocean, as the tide rises and falls, between this
                    chain of islands, which impedes its course like the narrow mouths of the fiords.
                    The relative position of the surrounding islands causes the Maelstrom to form a
                    large circle; and the great inequalities of its bottom, which, from a few
                    fathoms, deepens suddenly in many parts to 200, increase the violence of the
                    current.</p>
                <p>The interior of Norway is traversed by a succession of mountain ranges, called
                    Fjeldes, whence the Cumberland term Fell, designating an elevated tract of
                    ground. Some geographers have divided the Scandinavian Alps into groups, a
                    classification which appears to be more fanciful than real. Those which
                    intersect Norway, extending from the southern extremity of the country to Cape
                    North, the most northerly point in Europe, are called the Dofrines; and the most
                    considerable of these ranges is the Dovre Fjelde, lying between the sixty-second
                    and sixty-third parallels of north latitude. Travellers are proverbially prone
                    to give exaggerated descriptions of the physical features of the countries which
                    they traverse; and from this cause our ideas of the height of the Norwegian
                    mountains, and the sublimity of the scenery which they present, have hitherto
                    been pitched rather above the truth. Mr Laing, in his excellent account of the
                    country, thus describes this great natural feature of Norway. “The Dovre Fjeldc
                    here (at Jerkin, on the northern verge of the range) may be from twenty-four to
                    twenty-eight miles across. When we give things their real names, we take away
                    much of their imagined grandeur. TheDovre Fjelde sounds well, and we fancy it a
                    vast and sublime natural feature. It really is no more than <hi rend="italic"
                    >īifell,</hi> like those of Yorkshire or Cumberland; an elevated tract of
                    ground, whence run waters in opposite directions, and which forms the base of a
                    number of detached hills of moderate elevation. In fact, as a scene impressing
                    the traveller with ideas of vast and lonely grandeur, the tract from the waters
                    of the Tay to those of the Spey, by Dal-nacardoch, Dalwhinny, and Pitmain,
                    greatly surpasses it. You are indeed 3000 feet above the level of the sea; but
                    that is not seen; it is a matter of reflection and information. You look down
                    upon nothing below you, and look up only to hills of moderate elevation.
                    Schneehoette alone comes up to a mountain in magnitude: it is 7300 feet ιbove
                    the level of the sea; but this fell is 3000 at this arm-house (Jerkin, where Mr
                    Laing resided), which is about twelve miles from the base of Schneehoette. The
                    actual height of this mountain, therefore, for the eye, is about the same as
                    that of Ben Nevis, about 4300 feet, with the disadvantage of gaining its
                    apparent height by a slow rise from the fell. 1here is a considerable mass of
                    snow in a hollow on the bosom of Schneehoette, but not more than remains for
                    great part of the summer on hills in Aberdeenshire, and nothing like a
                    glacier.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Glaciers,
                    however, are not unknown in Norway. Mr Lloyd, in his Field Sports of the North
                    of Europe, observes, confirming what Mr Laing says in reference to Schneehoette,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> There were no glaciers on Schneehoette, though
                    such are to be found on several others of the Norwegian mountains.
                    Justedalsbraen, or Sneebraen, as well as Folgefonden, Mr Forsell says, are the
                    greatest glaciers in Europe.” This we are inclined to consideras a great
                    exaggeration. We learn from another authority, Mr Edward Forbes, that one of the
                    glaciers, forming a branch of the great Folgefond, is yearly diminishing in
                    size; a remarkable circumstance, but by no means an anomaly.</p></note> The head
                    and shoulder are clear of snow. The most remarkable feature of this mountain
                    tract is, that the surface of the fell, and of Schneehoette to its summit, is
                    covered with, or more properly composed of, rounded masses of gneiss and
                    granite, from the size of a man’s head to that of the hull of a ship. These
                    loose rolled masses are covered with soil in some places, but in others they are
                    bare, just as they were left by the torrent which must have rounded them, and
                    deposited them in this region.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was informed by one of the officers employed in the trigonometrical survey of
                    Norway, that Schneehoette is not the most elevated of the Norwegian mountains,
                    and that, in all probability, Hurunger Fjelde exceeds it by about 700 feet. The
                    names of the other elevations to the south and west of Dovre Fjelde, are Lang
                    Fjelde, Stagen Fjelde, Sogne Fjelde, Ska-gen Fjelde, Fille Fjelde, Hardanger
                    Fjelde, and some others which need not be named. The Hurunger, the Fille, and
                    the Hardanger Mountains, running into the sea at the Naze of Norway, “form, with
                    the Dovre Mountains, one vast triangular range, with its apex at Lessee, and its
                    base overflowed by the ocean in the height called the Shagerrak.”<note

                    instances almost perpendicular from the top to the bottom.</p></note></p>
                <p>There are a number of lakes in Norway, the largest of which is the Myosen, a
                    splendid sheet of water, about eighty miles in length and from one to ten in
                    breadth. Its scenery has been classed with the pastoral or beautiful, rather
                    than with the sublime. Its shores are well cultivated, and, with the exception
                    of a few rough promontories dipping into the lake, the slopes are easy, and
                    yield fine crops of oats, bear, flax, pease, and potatoes. Its direction, like
                    that of a great many of the lakes and rivers in Norway, is from north-west to
                    south-east, crossing the sixty-first parallel of north latitude. The depth of
                    the Myosen varies greatly; but it is considered as shallower than most of the
                    other Norwegian lakes. The depth in the lower parts is not more than forty
                    fathoms, often it is much less; but in the upper part it has been found to
                    exceed a hundred. Yet even this is nothing in comparison with the depth of the
                    other lakes, particularly of the Famund Soe, which is reputed to be
                    unfathomable; a distinction always allotted to the deepest lake in every
                    mountainous country. A large stream, called the Vormen Elv, issues from the
                    southern limit of Lake Myosen; and at Sunde, which is its northern extremity, it
                    forms a communication with Lake Losness, or Losness Soe, by the Lossen Elv or
                    River, which derives its name from the lake. Into this lake flows a river which
                    rises in the Dovre Fjelde range of mountains, and appears to be the one alluded
                    to by Mr Laing in the following passage. “The stream which runs through
                    Gul-brandsdal and the Myosen, and reaches the sea at Frederickstad, being the
                    same I left at Lien, comes down from the hills at or near Lessoe, and is there
                    divided into two branches, one of which, as above stated, runs into the Myosen,
                    and the other into the North Sea at the fiord in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560271" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0271-0262"/>Romsdal amt, in which the
                    town of Molde is situated, thus including in its delta between four and five
                    degrees of latitude, and all the west and south of Norway. The course of this
                    little river from Lessoe to the sea is very important, as it gives precision to
                    our ideas of the shape and direction of the Dovre Fjelde, and its connection
                    with the. Hurunger, the Fille, and the Hardanger Mountains.” This river must
                    therefore have a course of probably one hundred miles in a north-westerly, and
                    above two hundred and fifty in a south-easterly direction. It is in several
                    parts of its course of considerable breadth, and at more than one hundred miles
                    from its embouchure is described as a large dark-coloured and rapid river. A
                    still larger stream is the Glommen, called by way of distinction Stor Elven, or
                    the Great River, from its being the largest in Norway. It rises in the
                    government of Drontheim, not far from Ovesund Lake, through which it runs; and
                    it afterwards traverses the extensive government of Christiania, flowing through
                    Osterdaelen and Hedemarken, passing Kongsvinger, and finally falling into the
                    sea at Frederickstad, after a course of not less than three hundred miles, all
                    in Norway. From the heart of this continent it opens an easy communication with
                    the ocean, and through its means the produce of the interior is brought down to
                    the coast. At about two hundred miles from the sea it is described as a fine
                    majestic stream, two hundred yards in breadth. Navigation, however, is
                    obstructed by numerous falls, one of which, not far from its mouth, is called
                    the cataract of Sarpen, the roar of which is heard at a great distance. There
                    are other falls on the same river; but the most stupendous natural phenomenon of
                    this description is situated upon the opposite side of the mountain range, on
                    streams which flow into the North Sea. Mr Lloyd<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Field Sports of the North of Europe, vol. ii.
                    p. 295.</p></note> describes the falls of Rinkan-fos and Voringfos as
                    particularly grand, the first having a perpendicular descent of 450 feet, and
                    the second of 900 feet, the body of water in both cases being very considerable.
                    Mr Forsell, in giving some statistical information regarding Norway, mentions
                    other falls even more stupendous than these. There are many other lakes and
                    rivers in Norway besides those which we have described, amongst which we may
                    mention the Torris Elv, called the Odderen Elv during part of its upper course,
                    a large stream, which enters the sea at Christiansand; the Topdals, which falls
                    into the sea nepr the same place; the Louven Elv, which rises in the Hardanger
                    Fjelde, traverses several long, narrow lakes, passes through Kongsberg, and
                    enters the sea near Nauvig, in latitude 59°; and between this stream and the
                    Lossen, which lies considerably to the north-east, there is more than one large
                    river. A multitude of streams also run into the North Sea. The most important of
                    these is the Namsen, which, from its exit out of the lakes that give rise to it,
                    has a course of about ninety miles. From the ground sloping with more rapidity
                    upon this side of the mountain chain than on the other, the water-courses must
                    be considerably steeper. “Few countries in the world,” says the traveller just
                    mentioned, “present such sublime natural scenery; its numerous lakes and rivers,
                    its magnificent cataracts, its boundless forests and solitary wilds, where
                    silence seems to brood eternally, its terrific precipices, its smiling valleys,
                    and its towering alps covered with everlasting snows, impress the mind of the
                    traveller always with admiration, and often with awe.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. p. 293</p></note> The forests of
                    Norway, as is well known, are large and numerous; but they do not appear to be
                    so extensive as those of Sweden. In the southern parts of Norway, indeed, and up
                    as far as Drontheim, the supplies of timber are very considerable; but to the
                    north of the latter place, and along the sea-coast, as well as on the mountain
                    ranges, wood is not plentiful, many parts of the country being perfectly
                    destitute of it. Norway, however, from the district of Drontheim southwards, may
                    be considered as a country abundantly supplied with gigantic forests of
                    magnificent trees, amongst which the pine, birch, and aspen, are the most
                    celebrated and the most valuable to the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The prevailing rocks found in Norway belong to the primitive and transition
                    series. The west coast is wholly composed of primitive rocks, gneiss and mica
                    slate greatly predominating. Secondary rocks occur but rarely, and alluvial
                    deposits are not so abundant as in many other less extensive regions. Contrary
                    to the general belief of geologists, granite is but a rare rock. When it
                    appears, it is frequently in veins traversing the primitive stratified rocks, or
                    running parallel with beds or strata; and sometimes it is found spread over the
                    surface of mica slate, as at Forvig; or irregularly associated with clay slate
                    and diallage rock, as in the island of Mageroe. But by far the most abundant
                    rock in Norway is gneiss, all the others of the primitive series appearing to be
                    subordinate to it. Extensive tracts of country, and long mountain ranges, seem
                    to consist almost entirely of gneiss. In some parts it abounds in veins of rose
                    and milk quartz, in iron ores, in garnets, sometimes the precious, but most
                    frequently the common garnet, and other minerals. Mica slate, however, which
                    rests upon and alternates with the gneiss, is far from being so generally
                    distributed, as is also the case with the clay slate, ln some places steatite
                    occurs in beds, and is quarried in slabs to be used for different purposes.
                    Quartz rock, various hornblende rocks, and limestone, occur in beds subordinate
                    to the gneiss and mica slate. One side of the valley of Shalheim, situated
                    between Bergen and Sognefiord, is bounded by hills of snow-white quartz, which
                    are almost bare, and present mural precipices, having a very singular appearance
                    at a distance, from their shining-white colour. Gabbro or diallage rock occurs
                    in great quantities, connected with clay slate, in the island of Mageroe, and in
                    other parts of Norway. The class of transition rocks contains, besides
                    graywacke, alum, slate, limestone (combined with some tremolite), and other
                    rocks well known to mineralogists as belonging to the following series:—1.
                    Granite, which sometimes contains hornblende; 2. syenite, which contains a
                    beautiful Labrador variety of common felspar, and numerous crystals of the gem
                    named zircon; 3. porphyry, and associated with it various trap-rocks allied to
                    basalt and amygdaloid.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a great number of minerals sought after in collections, and of metals valuable
                    to man, amongst which may be mentioned gold, silver, iron, copper, cobalt, and
                    others. The mines of silver in Norway are situated at Kongsberg, but although
                    they once afforded rich returns, they now scarcely repay the labour bestowed on
                    them. Large masses of native silver have been found here, one of them, now in
                    the Museum of Copenhagen, weighing upwards of five hundred pounds. The Kongsberg
                    mines abound with mineralogical curiosities, of which the most remarkable is

                    rare, such as botryolite, datholite, wernerite, scapolite, and moroxite; besides
                    abundance of epidote, actinolite, cocolite, and colophonite. The ore (magnetic
                    iron ore) is found in beds of gneiss, of which the country is chiefly formed.
                    The mine of Laurwig, in the vicinity of the town of that name, affords annually
                    26,000 quintals of bar iron, and 6000 quintals of cast iron. The establishment
                    of the same kind at Moss affords annually 10,000 quintals of bar and cast iron.
                    Other mines, situated in various parts of the country, likewise yield large
                    quantities of this valuable metal; and the whole produce of the Norwegian mines
                    has been estimated at about 150,000 quintals annually. The mines of cobalt,
                    which are worked at Modum and Fossum, are extensive, but not very deep. There is
                    a mine of plumbago and black lead at Engledal. The mines of alum, which are
                    worked in the mountain of Egcberg, near to Christiania, afford not only a
                    sufficiency for the consumption of the Danish states, but some for exportation.
                    Norway possesses quarries <hi rend="italic">of</hi> granite, marble, millstone,
                    whetstone, slate, and clay. Granite is exported to Holland, and marble and other
                    minerals to Denmark.</p>
                <p>Norway possesses an island called Berend Island, situated between Spitzbergen and
                    North Cape, which presents some interesting features to the geologist. It is
                    about thirty English miles in circumference, and is composed of a formation
                    totally different from the primary rocks of which the Norwegian peninsula, and,
                    it is understood, Spitzbergen, and other polar islands, consist. The whole
                    island appears to be one entire mass of coal. It is not the fossil-wood brown
                    coal, or surturbrand, found in Iceland, Germany, and some parts of the west of
                    England, but mineral coal. Quantities of it have been brought to the mainland by
                    vessels sent to hunt the white bear and the walrus, which abound in the icy
                    region where Berend Island is situated.</p>
                <p>Some valleys in Norway give abundant indications of their having been lakes of
                    fresh water, which were either gradually drained as the land became elevated,
                    or, bursting the barriers that confined them, suddenly laid their basins dry. Mr
                    Laing describes one of these in the following passage. “On ascending the steeps
                    which bound the flat alluvial bottom of the valley on each side, and which
                    consists generally of banks of gravelly soil, one is surprised to find a kind of
                    upper terrace of excellent land, cultivated and inhabited like the bottom, and
                    consisting of the same soil, a friable loam. This terrace rests against the
                    primary rocks of the Fjelde, which are here limestone, marble, and gneiss, or
                    rock of the micaceous family, of which the laminae are singularly twisted and
                    contorted; and the terrace has evidently been the bottom of an ancient lake
                    which has been bounded by these Fjelde ridges.” The same traveller gives an
                    account of one of these ancient sea-beaches, which, in other countries besides
                    Norway, are calculated to arrest the attention and excite the wonder of the
                    observer of nature. He is speaking of the Snaasen Vand, a lake some sixty or
                    seventy miles north from Drontheim. “About seven miles inland from the present
                    sea strand, at the head of the fiord, and about sixty feet above the present
                    high-water level, there is an ancient sea-beach <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a very
                    remarkable character. Above the house of Fossum, and forty feet higher than the
                    lake of that name, the sea-shells are so abundant that they might be applied to
                    ιgricultural purposes, and they lie close to the surface.” At another place in
                    the neighbourhood there is a large bed of shells, which have been used in
                    mending the road for a considerable distance towards Snaasen Vand. “They are
                    entire; the upper and under ones of the mussel, cockle, and clam are united, and
                    the mussels grouped together, as in the living state; so that this bed has
                    clearly been the spot upon which the animals lived.” From these and other
                    indications, it is concluded, that a shore in a direction nearly parallel to
                    that of the present one of the Drontheim Gulf, and on a level at least sixty
                    feet higher, has existed at a recent geological period. These beds are not
                    covered with any thickness of decayed vegetable soil, and the shells retain in
                    part their natural hue and enamel. The land, therefore, has been elevated at no
                    very distant period; at what rate per century has not been determined as to this
                    side; but the Swedish philosophers assert, that the change of level in the Gulf
                    of Finland is at the rate of four feet and a half in a hundred years. Such could
                    not have been the case on the shores <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Norway washed by
                    the North Sea; for the relative position of known points upon the line of the
                    sea-shore, to the present level of the sea, are by historical evidence
                    ascertained to have changée! little if any during a thousand years. The change
                    of level may have been local, or it may have gone on more rapidly at one time
                    than at another.</p>
                <p>Earthquakes have been repeatedly experienced in Norway, at least seven having
                    occurred within the last forty years. History records one which occurred at
                    Dronthcim on the 18th of July 1686, and another on the 1st of April 1692. On the
                    14th of September 1344, the river Guul disappeared in the earth; and on its
                    bursting out again, destroyed forty-eight farms, and 250 human beings. About the
                    same time a great earthquake took place in Iceland. Indeed the whole aspect of
                    this country bears evidence to the fact, that at some period, or more probably
                    at different periods, its surface has been elevated, depressed, and shattered by
                    great convulsions.</p>
                <p>It would occupy too much space to enumerate in detail the characteristic plants
                    of Norway. The vegetation of the west coast is very similar to that of Britain,
                    but in the south and east there is found a completely different Flora,
                    approximating to that of Denmark and Germany. The cause of the remarkable
                    difference between the Flora, and also the Fauna, of the two coasts, is probably
                    to be referred to the absence of tides on the south coast. This circumstance
                    εeems to exercise an important influence on the character of the natural
                    productions of the country; and we the more especially refer to it, as it seems
                    to have been hitherto entirely overlooked by naturalists. At Bergen the tide
                    falls six or eight feet, but on the south coast it does not fall six inches.</p>
                <p>The animal kingdom of Norway requires some notice. As population has increased,
                    the wild animals have of course gradually disappeared, and the bear and the wolf
                    are no longer the terror of the traveller, as they were wont to be. In winter,
                    indeed, they may sometimes be found in disagreeable proximity to a stranger who
                    intrudes within their range; but they are in general timid, and only formidable
                    in herds. In Norway the bear retires to his den, which is generally some
                    sheltered hole in the rocks of the Fjelde, in November, and remains in a state
                    of inactivity, without food, it is said, until April. Indeed many of the smaller
                    animals, the field-mice, the lemmings, and, Mr Laing conjectures, many of the
                    birds, pass the winter in this climate in a state of occasional torpidity. The
                    wolves are not so dangerous animals as those of the south of Europe. They rarely
                    attack a man, but they will carry off a dog at his side; and they often commit
                    serious havoc amongst the domestic animals. The loss of sheep, calves, cows, and
                    foals, in certain parishes, during the season when they are at pasture, is
                    sometimes immense. Bears also commit depredations of the same kind, but not
                    nearly to the same ex <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560297"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0297-0264"/>tent, as the wolf, which, when he gets into a
                    herd, bites and tears all that he can overtake. The elk is now very rarely to be
                    met with, and in all likelihood will soon disappear from this part of Europe. It
                    is described as a magnificent animal, being often seventeen hands in height, and
                    sometimes exceeding in size the largest horse. But such splendid specimens are
                    now seldom or never seen. During winter it resides chiefly in hilly woods; but
                    in summer it frequents swamps and the borders of lakes, often going deep into
                    the water to escape the stings of gnats and other insects, and to feed without
                    stooping. with its enormous horns it turns down with great dexterity branches of
                    trees, in order to feed upon the bark; and these are also used as shovels to get
                    at pasture when it is covered with snow. The glutton or wolverine, so called in
                    America, is reckoned a Norwegian animal. Its total length is not more than two
                    feet and a half, and it flies from the face of man. It feeds chiefly upon beasts
                    which have been accidentally killed; but it will hunt small animals, such as
                    meadowmice, marmots, and the like, and occasionally attack disabled animals of a
                    large size. Although not fleet, it is very industrious, and does great injury to
                    the small fur trade in the northern parts of Europe. The rein-deer, which is
                    found in considerable numbers on the Hardanger Fjelde and the Sogne Fjelde, and
                    the diversified qualities of which are so beautifully adapted to the bleak and
                    inhospitable regions in the north of Norway, will be found described in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lapland.</hi> The beaver, although not extinct, is
                    rare, and lives solitary, not, like the American beaver, in society. A
                    particular kind of dog, with a remarkably fine, soft, and glossy fur, is bred
                    for its skin, which is made into pelisses for winter wear. Besides the wild and
                    tame reindeer, red deer are pretty numerous in some districts. The fox and the
                    lemming are abundant in some parts, particularly in the north. A multitude of
                    birds inhabit the coasts of the ocean, and Norway furnishes a considerable part
                    of the eider-down, so well known to the luxurious in couches. Game is plentiful;
                    the principal birds being called the tydder, roer, ryper, and jerper. The tydder
                    is the bird known of old in Scotland by the name of capercailzie, but now
                    extinct. The cock is a noble bird, of the size of a turkeycock, with a bill and
                    claws of great strength. The roer is the female, and in size, plumage, and
                    appearance so different from the male, that it has received a different name in
                    the language. The ryper is the same as the Scottish ptarmigan, but larger and
                    better clothed. Its flavour, however, is inferior to the game of the Scottish
                    hills. But the jerper is a more delicate bird for the table than any of our
                    game. It is of the grouse species, and about the size of a full-grown pigeon.
                    The silence of the forest solitudes is occasionally broken by the sweep of the
                    eagle’s or the heron’s wing; but the traveller in Norway is generally struck
                    with the limited number of small birds which he meets in the course of his
                    ramblings. Magpies, the Royston crow, and swallows, are common; but the lark,
                    linnet, thrush, blackbird, robin, and some others common to Great Britain, are
                    little known here. Hares and squirrels are in considerable abundance; and there
                    are some other quadrupeds and birds no strangers to the country, but they are of
                    too little importance to require any particular mention. Amongst domestic
                    animals may be mentioned the horse, goat, sheep, and cow; the goose, the duck,
                    and the turkey, which are also found wild. Of horses there is a small breed very
                    general in Norway, and another of a larger size, which is much esteemed for its
                    swiftness and sureness of foot. “These Norwegian horse are beyond all praise,”
                    says Mr Laing; “they scamper down hills as steep as a house roof, and in going
                    up hill actually scramble. They have no objection whatever, if you have none, to
                    any path or any pace; they are the bravest of horse kind.” They are fed entirely
                    upon hay, which, although merely withered grass, appears to be more substantial
                    than ours, from the wind and powers of the horses which live upon nothing else.
                    The sheep are shaped like deer, having long legs and small muzzles. Numbers of
                    goats and cows are kept, the milk which they yield being very rich, and highly
                    esteemed. Fish abound in the seas,lakes,and rivers of Norway; and the
                    inhabitants not only derive a considerable portion of their subsistence from
                    fishing, but it also forms an important article of export. Amongst the insects
                    of Norway, the gnat, or rather mosquito, is found exceedingly annoying. They are
                    in greatest abundance and most venomous in the north. The∕lm'α <hi rend="italic"
                    >infernalis,</hi> so called from the dreadful effects which follow from its
                    bite, frequents the marshes or boggy grounds. The acute pain and inflammatory
                    swelling which its bite produces are removed by a curd poultice, which is said
                    to be an infallible cure. The entomology of the south of Norway is very similar
                    to that of the south of England, whilst that of the west resembles the
                    entomology of Scotland.</p>
                <p>From the general elevation of the land, the climate is of course rendered more
                    severe than would naturally belong to a country under the same parallel the
                    general elevation of which was more nearly on a level with the ocean. The
                    winters are long and very cold; but, as in all northern climates, their length
                    and severity are in some measure compensated by the great heat, and consequently
                    rapid vegetation, in summer. Towards the east, and in the interior, the winter
                    is longest, the cold, generally speaking, always increasing towards the north.
                    The effects of the sea-breezes upon the general temperature of the coasts of all
                    countries are well known. Winter, however, is very pleasant and salubrious; for
                    although the air is cold, it is dry and bracing, not damp and raw. But the
                    western part, especially about Bergen and along the coast, is proverbially
                    rainy, owing probably to the high mountains, which attract the clouds wafted
                    from the ocean. But the country behind this barrier is on that account
                    particularly dry, perhaps somewhat too much so. In Norway the weather is in
                    general more steady than in Britain; it is either good or bad for considerable
                    periods. The summer season is delightful, and very warm. In narrow glens it is
                    too hot during the middle of the day; but the morning, evening, and midnight
                    hours are charming, and peculiar-to this country. The sun is below the horizon
                    for so short a time that the sky retains the glow and the air the warmth and
                    dryness, which are as grateful to the eye as they are pleasing to the feelings.
                    Summer lingers long in this country; and, in general, it is an unbroken series
                    of beautiful days. The disagreeable season is the spring, April and May, when,
                    in the transition from winter to summer, the snows are suddenly melted, and the
                    ground is rendered uncomfortable for travelling. Damage is sometimes done by the
                    rapid swelling of the torrentsand rivers. When the white covering of winter
                    disappears, vegetation bursts forth at once, and advances with astonishing
                    rapidity.</p>
                <p>The following account of the climate of Norway, divided into several districts,
                    is abridged from a popular book of travels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The luxuriance <hi rend="italic">of</hi> vegetation being abridged by the length
                    and severity of the winter, the soil is thus indirectly rendered comparatively
                    sterile. In America the immense forests are continually enriching the mould with
                    their decaying foliage; but in Norway the paucity of alluvial tracts, the
                    prevalence of rock, seldom far beneath, and often forming the surface, together
                    with the want of vegetable decomposition, materially detract from the quantity
                    as well as the quality of the soil. In some parts it is very rich; and the
                    valleys, in particular, are celebrated for their luxuriant fertility. But much
                    of the soil is thin, and obstructed by rocky knobs rising above its surface, and
                    interfering with the labours of the husbandman. “1 have not, indeed,” says Mr
                    Laing, “seen in Norway twenty acres of arable land in one field, without some
                    obstruction from knobs of stone.” Excepting in the extreme northerly divisions
                    of the country, agriculture is prosecuted with considerable spirit and
                    success.</p>
                <p>“In Norway,” says Mr Laing, “the trees of the pine tribe are called furu and
                    gran. Furu is our pine <hi rend="italic">(pinus silvestris),</hi> and gran is
                    our fir <hi rend="italic">(pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">abics)</hi>; the one is
                    the red wood and the other the white wood of our carpenters. There are whole
                    districts which produce only furu, others only gran; and this seems not exactly
                    regulated by latitude or elevation. The zones at which different trees cease to
                    grow appear to be a theory to which the exceptions are as numerous as the
                    examples. In Roinsdal amt, at Fanne Fiord, near Molde, in latitude 62° 47'
                    north, and with a medium temperature of only 4° <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Reaumur (41° of Fahrenheit), pears, the bergamot, gravenstein, and imperial, and
                    also plums, come to perfection; and the walnut-tree often bears ripe fruit.
                    Hazel and elm in the same amt form continuous woods, as at Egerdal. Yet the gran
                    disappears altogether, although in the same degree of latitude it grows at an
                    elevation of 1000 feet above the sea in the interior of Norway, and even in
                    latitude 69° in Lapmark. It has been found a vain attempt to raise it in
                    llomsdal amt, a locality in which the following trees and bushes grow readily;
                    Canadian poplar, balsam poplar, borse-chestnut, larch, elder, yew, roses of
                    various sorts, avender, box, laburnum, white thorn, and ivy. Larch orought from
                    Scotland appears to thrive. There must be something in the nature of the plants
                    not connected with flevation or latitude that determines the growth <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the ξran and furu.” Mr Laing mentions instances
                    sufficient-y striking to prove that the “theory of the zones of flevation at
                    which different species of trees will or will not rrow must be taken with
                    caution, as it does not satisfac-orily cover all the facts observable in this
                    country.” In mother place he observes, that “wood of considerable size 'rows as
                    far north as the valley of the Namsen, the largest &gt;f the Norwegian rivers,
                    about 120 miles from Drontheim. t grows in sheltered situations in Nordland and
                    Finmark, is far north as Alten Fiord (latitude 70°), but of diminu-ive size, and
                    in such limited quantity that it is thought ιecessary to preserve it for the use
                    of the inhabitants, and ts exportation is prohibited.” Trees in the valley of
                    the 'ïamsen are large enough for building material and the nasts of ships. In
                    another place Mr Laing says, “1 did not xpect certainly to be charmed with the
                    crops in the sixty-fth degree of north latitude; but the vegetative power,
                    diatever be the cause, is more vigorous , here than in the orth of Scotland.
                    Some <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the largest establishments of aw-mills in Norway
                    are supplied with trees from the fo- ≡sts around the Snaasen Vand. Ofordinary
                    productions, as ye, oats, bear, flax, hops, there appeared to be great crops,
                    'his may well be in a soil and climate which raises such oble forests. Behind
                    the house 1 inhabited is a standard berry· tree bearing ripe fruit. It would be
                    a rarity in</p>
                <p>Scotland to raise them unless against a wall, even eight degrees of latitude
                    south of this.” Here Mr Laing found hops cultivated as a crop, whilst flax
                    ripened so as to be fit for seed. The mountain and common ash are here scarce;
                    the aspen, wild cherry, birch, and the pine tribes, being the trees, and the
                    juniper, wild raspberry, and wild rose, the bushes, which generally prevail.</p>
                <p>Taking the river Namsen as a boundary line separating the productive from the
                    unproductive part of Norway, the country lying to the south of it may be
                    considered as capable of producing, in favourable situations, the grains and
                    fruits <hi rend="italic">of</hi> England, and these, too, often in the highest
                    degree of perfection. Most kinds of fruit are abundant, but the greatest
                    favourite is the cherry. The crop of cherries is scarcely ever known to fail;
                    and in proof of the abundance of this fruit, it may be mentioned, that the
                    Norwegians preserve it in great quantities, and use it in many culinary
                    operations. Amongst the fruits growing wild are strawberries, raspberries,
                    cloudberries, cranberries, and various other kinds of berries. The three first
                    mentioned are considered as delicious, and they are eaten both when freshly
                    gathered, like cultivated strawberries, and after being preserved.</p>
                <p>The principal products of the Norwegian farm are oats, rye, wheat, bear, hops,
                    flax, a kind of bearded spring grain, with potatoes; and a large portion of
                    every farm is set apart to grow grass for the cattle and horses. The grass for
                    the most part is natural, sown grasses for hay being very little cultivated. The
                    land, after a bear crop following potatoes, is left to sward itself with natural
                    grasses for four years, and to form the hay land, so that the proportion of
                    grass to arable land is much greater than in our farms. The natural grasses do
                    not attain any length, and they are shaven as close to the ground as a
                    bowling-green. The fields are not what is called top-dressed, as with us. The
                    scythe in use is much shorter in the blade than that of Great Britain, and it
                    answers the purpose much better. Potatoes, which appear to occupy the place of
                    turnips with us, have been much cultivated since 1812 and 1814, when bad crops,
                    together with the war then raging, reduced many to the use of bark-bread. Large
                    quantities of spirits, called Norwegian brandy, are distilled from potatoes. A
                    small enclosure for hops is attached to every farm-house; but carrots, onions,
                    cabbage, and all garden vegetables, are little used. Probably the short interval
                    between winter and summer allows little time for attending to any but the
                    essential crops. The hop flourishes with little attention under the sixty-fourth
                    parallel; a striking fact, when we consider that this plant is delicate and
                    precarious in the south of England. But there are doubtless families of plants,
                    as there are races of animals, more hardy, or at least more exempt from disease,
                    than others of the same species, and thus enabled to endure the rigours of a
                    stern climate. In farming operations, ditching, draining, and clearing land of
                    vegetable and other obstructions, are prosecuted with great spirit and success.
                    Agriculturists are continually adding to the quantity of arable land in the
                    country by thus redeeming the soil from its original wild state. However, from
                    causes already mentioned, Norway is not capable of furnishing the means of
                    subsistence to any considerable population. Generally speaking, only the glens
                    of the country are inhabited. On the dividing ridges there is little or no
                    cultivation, and indeed no soil to cultivate, but only rounded masses of gneiss
                    and micaceous rocks, with juniper, fir, aspen, birch, and beech, growing where
                    they can amongst the stones.</p>
                <p>Mr Laing gives a very minute account of a Norwegian farm rented by a Scotchman;
                    and as he considers it “fitted to be the representative <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> a large portion <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the estates into which this
                    country is divided,” we shall abridge his description, retaining all the
                    essential parts. Land in <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560323"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0323-0266"/>Norway is measured by the maeling, which contains
                    forty-nine square ells, the ell containing two feet, and the Norwegian foot
                    being three percent, longer than ours. Thus the English acre of 43,560 square
                    feet contains four maelings and four tenths. Each farm may be considered as
                    consisting of three divisions. The first is the infield, or what we should call
                    the mains, or home acres, enclosed for the crops and the best hay. The next is
                    the mark or outfield, also enclosed, and affording the out-pasture for the
                    cattle. Parts of it are occasionally fenced off, and broken up for grain, and,
                    when exhausted, are left to sward themselves; so that when the cattle are sent
                    to the Fjelde in summer, some hay is got from the mark. There is often a still
                    rougher piece of ground divided from the mark, as a range for goats and young
                    cattle, called the out-mark. The third division is the seater. This is a pasture
                    or grass farm often at the distance of thirty or forty miles up in the Fjelde,
                    to which the whole of the cattle and dairymaids are sent for three or four
                    months in summer. The huts on these scaters are substantial buildings, with
                    every accommodation necessary for the dairy; and butter and cheese are
                    accordingly made in very considerable quantities. When speaking of farms of so
                    many maelings, the seater and mark are not included in the measurement, but
                    thrown in as appendages. “The farm of my countryman,” says Mr Laing, “consists
                    of 1276 maelings, or 290 English acres; but this does not include the seater,
                    which happens here to be on the hills immediately behind the farm, is covered
                    with fine trees, and is of a defined boundary, extending about a Norwegian mile
                    (seven English miles) in circuit. On the measured land 148 acres are cleared;
                    but, being farmed in the Norwegian style, one third only bears crops of corn and
                    potatoes. The remainder is always in grass or hay, for the winter support of the
                    cattle. It is natural grass, not top dressed with manure, and is mown when not
                    above the length of one’s finger, so that the proportion of arable land that
                    must be given up to keep the cattle in winter is enormous. It is the system of
                    farming in this quarter; 142 acres outside of the 148 infield are half cleared,
                    being fenced off and ploughed in patches. It bears good grass, but is encumbered
                    in some places with brushwood and stones.”</p>
                <p>“This farm supports twenty cows, seven horses, and a score or two of sheep and
                    goats. The accommodation for cattle is excellent. They stand in a single row in
                    the middle of a wide house, with partitions between each, and room before and
                    behind greater than is occupied by the animal itself. The cow-house is lighted
                    by glass windows on each side. The cattle stand on a wooden floor, below which
                    is a vault, into which the dung is swept by a grated opening at the end of each
                    stall.” All the cowhouses in Norway are constructed on this large and convenient
                    scale; and neither cows nor horses require litter, which is a great saving of
                    fodder. Besides, they are kept perfectly clean, with comparatively little
                    trouble. The annual rent of this farm was two hundred dollars, or L.37. 10s.
                    sterling, and the amount of taxes paid was L.6. 14s. 5s., nearly one sixth of
                    the rental, which appears very heavy. But this is nearly all that is paid in any
                    shape; the indirect taxes, such as our excise and custom-house duties, being
                    inconsiderable. It includes tithe, and all charges connected with the church
                    establishment, poor rate, and so forth. Such a property as that now described is
                    considered worth about 4000 dollars. From 2500 to 4500 dollars include, it
                    appears, the prices of all ordinary estates, and any thing very much above or
                    below would be an exception to a general rule. As to the dwelling-houses on such
                    estates, the material for building is so easily obtained that there is really no
                    difference between the residence of a public functionary, of a clergyman, or of
                    a gentleman of large property, and that of a bonde or peasant proprietor. The
                    Norwegians are the best lodged people in Europe, Mr Laing says; but there is
                    little show, and no magnificence which can well be dispensed with in such a
                    country. The division of property among children prevents the erection of
                    splendid mansions, or any thing more expensive than is proportioned to the
                    property upon which they stand. The harvest work in this district,” continues
                    our traveller, “and I believe all over Norway, is well done; and parts of their
                    management might be adopted with advantage in our late districts, where so much
                    grain is lost or damaged almost every autumn by wind or rain. For every ten
                    sheaves, a pole of light strong wood, about the thickness of the handle of a
                    garden rake, and about nine feet in length, is fixed in the ground by an
                    iron-shod borer; it costs here almost nothing. A man sets two sheaves on the
                    ground against the stem, and impales all the rest upon the pole, one above the
                    other, with the heads hanging downwards.” This is certainly a mode very superior
                    to ours; and they have likewise a better way of cutting it, by which little of
                    the grain is lost. But for an account of this process, and other farming
                    operations, we must refer to Mr Laing’s work (pp. 96, 106).</p>
                <p>The breed of cattle in Norway is fine boned, thin skinned, and kindly looking;
                    the colour is generally white, sometimes mixed with red, but seldom entirely
                    black. The head and muzzle are as fine as in our Devonshire breed. There is so
                    little coarseness about the head or neck of the bull, that the difference
                    between him and the ox is less observable than in our breeds. The cattle are all
                    very carefully attended to, and form an important branch of the husbandry, as
                    dairy produce enters much into the food of every family, and is more certain in
                    this climate than that of grain. The cows, sheep, and goats are more tame and
                    docile than they are in Britain, from the constant care and attendance bestowed
                    on them during the long period which they must stand within doors; and the
                    Norwegians are remarkably kind to their domestic animals. Goats are a favourite
                    stock, and on every farm appear to be much more numerous than sheep. The goat
                    will eat and thrive on the shoots of the dwarf birch, beech, and young fir; but
                    the sheep will not, and in winter it requires some hay. The goat then gets a
                    bundle of dried leaves and shoots of the beech, which only cost the trouble of
                    collecting and drying them. Every farmhouse at this season is surrounded with
                    bundles of these withered branches and leaves of beech tied together, and stuck
                    upon poles to dry. The goat, too, gives some milk in winter, when that of cows
                    is scarce; and from the uncommon richness of milk in Norway, this small quantity
                    can bear to be increased with water, without materially deteriorating it.</p>
                <p>Irrigation is carried on in many parts to an extent quite unknown in this
                    country. Hay being the principal winter support of live stock, and both it and
                    corn, as well as potatoes, being liable, from the shallow soil and powerful
                    reflection of sunshine from the rocks, to be burned and withered up, the
                    greatest exertions are made to bring water from the head of each glen, along
                    such a level as will give the command of it to each farmer at the head of his
                    fields. This is done by conducting water in troughs made of the half of a tree
                    roughly scooped out, from the highest perennial stream amongst the hills,
                    through woods, across ravines, along the rocky and often perpendicular sides of
                    the glens; and from this main trough lateral branches shoot off to each farm.
                    The farmer distributes this supply by moveable troughs amongst his fields,
                    watering each rig successively. The quantity of land traversed by these
                    artificial water-courses is very great.</p>
                <p>In winter, when agricultural operations are suspended, the Norwegian employs
                    himself in making all the implements, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560336"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0336-0267"/>furniture, and clothing, which his family may
                    require; thrashing out the crop, attending to the cattle, distilling his
                    potatoes, brewing, driving about to fairs, or paying visits. The heaviest of his
                    occupations is driving wood out of the forests, or bog-hay from the Fjelde,
                    where it is made in summer by those who attend the cattle. The distillation of
                    spirits from potatoes is general throughout Norway, grain not being in such
                    abundance as to allow of its consumption in this way. By far the greater part of
                    the spirits used in the country is made in families, not in regular
                    distilleries; every common bonde, or peasant proprietor, distilling his own few
                    barrels. It is part of the women’s work, like cheese making or brewing, and is
                    carried on once a week or once a fortnight, on every gaard, for the sake of the
                    wash and refuse to the cattle, as well as for the spirits. The most profitable
                    way of distilling potatoes,” says Mr Laing, “is with a mixture of crushed wheat
                    and malt, or, instead of wheat, rye or any other kind of grain. The best
                    proportions are these ~ To six heaped barrels of potatoes, weighing
                    seventy-eight stones of sixteen pounds each, nine and a half stones of wheat or
                    other corn, and five of malt from bear or big. If more of any of the parts be
                    taken, the wort or liquor to be distilled is too heavy, and is apt to burn or
                    singe in the still. By this proportion the smallest distilling, as a barrel or
                    half a barrel at a time, is regulated. The crushed grain and malt are first
                    mixed in about a hundred and twenty quarts of water, heated to 50° of Reaumur,
                    or 144° of Fahrenheit, and no higher. The potatoes being perfectly steamed
                    (brought to such a state as to be fit for eating), are crushed between two
                    rollers, and, as they leave the rollers, are shovelled into the vat in which the
                    fermentation is to take place.” “Boiling water to the extent of about four
                    hundred and fifty quarts is then poured into the vat, and is cooled down with
                    cold water to 20° Reaumur, or 77° Fahrenheit, at which the mash of w heat and
                    malt is added to it; the vat is then immediately covered up as tightly as
                    possible, and left to ferment.” After fermentation has ceased, distillation
                    immediately commences, the process being conducted in the usual way. Somewhat
                    more than eighteen quarts English, of a strong fiery spirit, destitute of any
                    disagreeable taste or smell, is produced from the barrel of potatoes. Of its
                    exact strength Mr Laing was unable to form any judgment.</p>
                <p>In Norway there is no restriction on mills, every man who chooses having a right
                    to erect one, without entailing upon himself any feudal burden, such as service,
                    suit, or feu, for he is the superior of his own lands. These mills are very
                    numerous in the country, being not only necessary to almost every farm, but for
                    sawñng timber for exportation, as well as for home consumption.</p>
                <p>The thrashing machines in general use amongst agriculturists are similar in
                    construction to those of Scotland; and some have grinding machinery attached to
                    them. There is an institution of a very peculiar nature, which is quite common
                    all over Norway. In this country there are no merchants equivalent to our
                    corn-dealers, nor are there any weekly markets held for the sale of grain. There
                    are no middle-men between the grower and the consumer, and any surplus grain
                    which the farmer may have is stored up in what may be called corn-magazines,
                    which are just large warehouses erected in various parts of the country, as the
                    necessities of the inhabitants require them. What grain the farmer thinks he
                    will not require he conveys in sledges to these places, and for every eight
                    bushels which he deposits, he receives nine at the end of twelve months; in
                    short, be lays it out at interest, and has an increase of one eighth per annum.
                    If, however, he has none deposited, or overdraws, he pays for the quantity
                    received in loan at the rate of one fourth of increase per annum; so that for
                    every eight bushels which he takes he pays back ten at the end of twelve months,
                    or at that rate for whatever time he may have the loan This is, in fact, a
                    savings’ bank for corn, and is probably the most ancient of these institutions.
                    There being no corn-merchants is decidedly a material check upon the prosperity
                    of agriculture; for, from the want of a ready market where he might dispose of
                    his produce, and the consequent comparatively small inducement which he has to
                    store it up in these magazines, the farmer naturally wastes it, or does what is
                    probably worse, distils it into ardent spirits. But these institutions are
                    exceedingly useful to the Norwegians as they are circumstanced; and were it not
                    for them, many might be placed in great difficulties, for want of seed or bread
                    tvhen a bad season disappointed their hopes of a supply from their own fields.
                    The small profit which occurs upon these transactions defrays the necessary
                    expenses of building and keeping up the magazines, which are entirely under the
                    management of the bonder or peasant proprietors. However, under such a system,
                    husbandry can never become what it is in Great Britain, a manufacture of corn,
                    beef, and other provisions, carried on by a class of individuals who pay a very
                    high rent for the premises on which they work, and embark large capitals in the
                    business. In Norway the bulk of the farmers have no rent to pay, the property
                    being their own; the articles which their farms produce constitute nearly the
                    whole of the food or raiment which they and their people require; and there are
                    not, as in other countries, considerable masses of population in towns and
                    villages, who, not being producers of food themselves, must obtain it from those
                    who. are; so that the farmer is less dependent upon money-bringing crops than is
                    the case with us. If he raise what is sufficient for his own household
                    consumption, with a little surplus for sale to pay the taxes, and for the
                    purchase of a few luxuries, all the purposes of farming are served with him.
                    This is partly owing to the state of property in Norway.</p>
                <p>Property in Norway is held by what is called the udal or odel system of rights,
                    not from any superior, not even from the king, but, as the possessors proudly
                    express it, by the same right by which the crown itself is held; consequently
                    there is no acknowledgment, real or nominal, as feu-duty or reddendo, paid. In
                    this country all lands are theoretically said to be held from the king; and,
                    according to Sir Edward Coke, we have no allodial lands. In Norway estates are
                    allodial, the absolute property of the owner; they are therefore possessed
                    without charter, and are subject to none of the burdens and casualties affecting
                    land held by feudal tenure direct from the sovereign, or from his superior
                    vassal. There is, in short, a total negation of the feudal principle; there is
                    neither superior nor vassal, so that the military service which the latter paid
                    to the former in consideration of the land which was granted appears never to
                    have existed in Norway; and as this constituted the foundation of the law of
                    primogeniture, so, where such service was entirely unknown, there was no
                    necessity for that law, which consequently remained equally unknown. In all
                    feudal countries the eldest male heir has to pay an acknowledgment to the feudal
                    superior on his entering as vassal in the land. But udal, or noble land, as the
                    word signifies, not being held for military service to a superior, no <hi
                    rend="italic">delectus personae</hi> as to who should inherit it was competent
                    to any authority, and consequently no preference of the eldest male heir could
                    grow into the law of succession to land. Hence the land came to be equally
                    divided amongst all the surviving children, male and female. There appears,
                    however, to be a species of entail connected with the udal tenure. If the
                    udalman in possession should alienate to a stranger, the next of kin has a right
                    of redemption on paying the price of the land. This is called the Odelbaarn’s
                    Ret, and all the kindred of the udalman in possession <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560349" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0349-0268"/>are what is called Odelsbaarn
                    to his land, or, in other words, have a certain right in the order of
                    consanguinity. By recent enactments, this right of redemption has been limited
                    in its exercise to a period of five years; and it is provided that all
                    improvements, as well as the original price, must be paid for.</p>
                <p>The equal partition of property amongst children by the udal tenure has prevented
                    the accumulation of property in large masses; but, as might have been expected
                    by theorists, it has not led to subdivisions of estates to an injurious extent.
                    “The division of the land appears not,” says Mr Laing, “during the thousand
                    years it has been in operation, to have had the effect of reducing the landed
                    properties to the minimum size that will barely support human existence. I have
                    counted from five and twenty to forty cows upon farms, and that in a country in
                    which the farmer must, for at least seven months in the year, have winterhouses
                    and provender provided for all the cattle. It is evident that some cause or
                    other, operating on aggregation of landed property, counteracts the dividing
                    effects of partition among children.” In another place Mr Laing says, “The
                    estates of individuals are generally small; and the houses, furniture, food,
                    comfort, ways and means of living, among all classes, appear to me to approach
                    more nearly to an equality to one standard than in any country in Europe. This
                    standard is far removed from any want or discomfort on one hand, or any luxury
                    or display on the other. The actual partition of the land itself seems, in
                    practice, not to go below such a portion of land as will support a family
                    comfortably, according to the habits and notions of the country; and it is
                    indeed evident that a piece of ground without houses upon it, and too small to
                    keep a family according to the national estimation of what is re quisite, would
                    be of no value as a separate property. The heirs accordingly either sell to each
                    other, or sell the whole to a stranger, and divide the proceeds. The duty of the
                    Sorenskriver, or district judge, consists chiefly in arranging this kind of
                    chancery business, and all debts and deeds affecting property are registered
                    with him.”</p>
                <p>The cause which, according to Mr Laing, has prevented excessive subdivision, is,
                    “that in a country where land is held, not in tenantry merely, as in Ireland,
                    but in full ownership, its aggregation by the deaths of co-heirs and by the
                    marriages of female heirs among the body of landowners, will balance its
                    subdivision by the equal succession of children.” This is undoubtedly true, and,
                    when taken in connection with other facts, may sufficiently explain the case. Mr
                    Laing informs us that the standard of living is high in Norway; or that the
                    population is much better clothed, lodged, fed, and generally provided for, than
                    our labouring and middling classes in the south of Scotland. The dwelling-houses
                    of the meanest labourers are divided into several apartments, and have wooden
                    floors and a sufficient number of good windows, with some kind of cuthouse for
                    cattle and lumber. Their food and clothing are equally good and substantial. Now
                    it seems quite clear that a people habituated to such a standard of subsistence
                    and coinfort will not only not suffer their condition to sink indefinitely below
                    it, but, by prudence and foresight in the contraction of marriage and the
                    raising of a family, will keep down their numbers considerably within their
                    means of subsistence. In Norway that condition which secures respectability to a
                    common man, is one in which he commands not only all the comforts, but most of
                    the luxuries of life, common to the country; and the natural desire of all
                    mankind to keep up caste, to maintain themselves in that station in which they
                    were born, not to decline from it, and fall, as it were, out of the ranks, will
                    operate as a most powerful check upon the minute subdivision of land. There are
                    other causes in operation to which our circumscribed limits will only admit of
                    our adverting. These are the ancient and confirmed habits of the people, which
                    may be taken into account as a corollary of the preceding proposition; and the
                    absence of impediments, such as fines on alienation, or imposts of any kind, in
                    the way of sale or conveyance. Where such fines exist, the difficulties of
                    re-uniting land which has been subdivided are great and annoying. But in Norway,
                    when an udalman dies, the co-heirs do not break up the estate leit to them into
                    six or eight, or any other number of estates, corresponding to the number of
                    children; which would at once reduce the standard of living of the whole of them
                    below that to which they were accustomed. They appear either to sell to each
                    other, which is easily effected in the absence of fines and other burdens on
                    conveyance of property; or they make a joint-stock business of it, till
                    circumstances permit some of the members to dispose of their shares to those who
                    may remain, and employ the capital in such an advantageous manner as will secure
                    them in that comparative independence and affluence to which they were all their
                    lives accustomed. The diffusion of property in Norway is no doubt very great,
                    compared with its diffusion in this country, but not as compared with Canada.

                <p>These small estates are scattered on the sides of glens, lakes, and fiords, over
                    a vast extent of country, and, generally speaking, are situated at great
                    distances from towns.</p>
                <p>There are two classes of landholders in Norway; those who have farms larger than
                    they themselves can cultivate, and those who exclusively farm their own estates.
                    These constitute the bulk of the population. The first are called proprietors, a
                    sort of conventional term, equivalent to our esquire; the smaller landholders
                    who work upon their own estates are called <hi rend="italic">bonder,</hi> a
                    term, as appears, nearly equivalent to feuar in Scotland. The incomes of the
                    former seldom exceed eight hundred or nine hundred dollars, although there are
                    some who possess as much as three or four thousand pounds sterling per annum.
                    The Norwegian valleys are crowded with bonder farms, which are very numerous
                    throughout the country, and, with their look of plenty and completeness, may
                    compete with the richest and most beautiful in Scotland. Mr Laing draws a very
                    pleasing and interesting picture of this class of people, whose comfort and
                    happiness may indeed be inferred from a short statement of facts. They are
                    owners of their own little estates, which produce all the necessaries of life,
                    and afford a surplus for the payment of taxes and the purchase of luxuries. They
                    have no feu-duty nor other incumbrance on their property, except the scot or
                    land-tax, which, although heavy, renders every thing used by a family so much
                    cheaper, the indirect taxes being little or nothing. They are exceedingly well
                    lodged, and the families live abundantly; the manner of living, indeed, is
                    pretty much the same amongst all classes. These, and the comfortable assurance,
                    that in case of death the udalman leaves his wife and family provided for, are
                    certainly calculated materially to promote human happiness. “This class,” says
                    Mr Laing, “are the kernel of the nation. They are in general fine athletic men,
                    as their properties are not so large as to exempt them from work; but large
                    enough to afford them and their households abundance, and even a superfluity, of
                    the best food.”, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560362"

                    shore-side to the hill foot,” whereon corn will grow, there is another class
                    called Fjelde bonder, who form a connecting link, as it were, between the class
                    above described and the wandering Laplander. They also possess land, and have
                    houses, which, although small, are comfortable; but being above the level of the
                    corn growing country, their situation is not so favourable, nor is their
                    condition equal to that of the other small proprietors. The Fjelde bonder are
                    “the hewers of wood and drawers of water” in Norway; but they still possess
                    property in cattle as well as in land, and they are described as extremely hardy
                    and active, and as having more robust frames than the agricultural bonder. There
                    is yet another class of the population, which is altogether distinct from any of
                    the preceding, consisting entirely of fishermen, whose social condition must be
                    considerably inferior to that of the others.</p>
                <p>In the provinces of Nordland and Finmark, which occupy the northern part of
                    Norway, beyond the river Namsen, agriculture is but a secondary business, and
                    fishing may be said to occupy most of the attention of the inhabitants. The
                    crops of grain are too inconsiderable and precarious to afford them the means of
                    subsistence, and the riches of the deep are brought in as a compensation for the
                    poverty of the land. The winter fishery in the Lofoden Islands, from the middle
                    of February to the middle of April, and the summer fishery over all the coast,
                    which in some branch or other gives employment for the remainder of the year,
                    furnish the inhabitants with the means of purchasing the necessaries which they
                    require. The fish trade is a very curious monopoly. It does not belong to Norway
                    as a whole, but is in the possession of Bergen, Drontheim, Christiansand, and
                    one or two other towns of minor note. Those who manage the business as merchants
                    or shop-keepers, are licensed burgesses of these towns; and each has a certain
                    tract of coast or circle belonging to his shop or factory, within which no other
                    person is entitled to buy or sell. These privileged traders pay a certain tax,
                    and are besides obliged to receive and entertain travellers; and their exclusive
                    privilege has become hereditary, attached to the house or factory in which it
                    may be exercised by a duly privileged trader. The average value of the winter
                    fishery has been estimated at L.86,500 sterling; and as the number of
                    inhabitants in the two provinces is only about 80,000, the trade of Nordland and
                    Finmark with the rest of Norway is at the rate of little more than twenty
                    shillings a head. The merchants send out vessels furnished with articles
                    required in the country, and receive the produce of their eight weeks’ fishery
                    in payment. In fact, these distant provinces are connected with the rest of the
                    country for just two months in the year, and that only through a few merchants
                    in two or three towns. During the other ten months the trade is left entirely in
                    the hands of the Russians, who feed the population, and receive in return all
                    that their industry produces in the fishing. The privileged Norwegians take no
                    more brandy, colonial produce, or such other articles as are wanted, than what
                    is sufficient to pay the persons who fish for them for eight weeks; their
                    further supplies the inhabitants obtain from Russia. Were the trade free to all
                    the natives of Norway, as it is in every country where trade has flourished,
                    there would have been a body of Norwegian traders to and from these provinces,
                    carrying on every branch in which employment and profit could be found and
                    realized. Instead of this, the business is almost entirely in the hands of
                    strangers, and Norway receives little or no benefit from her own possessions. To
                    the absurdity of such a monopoly it would be difficult to find a parallel in the
                    history of commercial restrictions.</p>
                <p>The fishing business itself is conducted in a peculiar manner. Every twenty or
                    thirty of the fishing companies have a yacht, or large tender, which conveys the
                    provisions, nets, lines, and other articles, to the Lofoden Islands, the great
                    scene of the Norwegian fishery, and brings back the produce. The stations are
                    all correctly defined by marks on the coast, and by judicious regulations
                    confining line-fishers to the inside, and net-fishers to the outside. In 1827,
                    which was a medium year, there were 2916 boats fishing in eighty-three different
                    stations, accompanied by 124 yachts or tenders, the number of men employed being
                    15,324 in all. The produce was 16,456,620 fish, which would amount to about 8800
                    tons dried; there were also 21,530 barrels'of cod oil, and 6000 of cod roe. When
                    this fishing ends, the seafaring peasantry of this part of the country, as we
                    have already said, are employed by the Russians; the others return to their
                    homes, and catch sethe <hi rend="italic">(gad us</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >virens)</hi> or herrings. The herring fishery is very judiciously managed; so
                    much so, indeed, that the Norwegians have beaten the Scotch herring curers out
                    of the markets of the Baltic, as they deliver fish better assorted, and of
                    superior quality. Besides these important general fisheries, there is in every
                    creek of the fiords, even at a hundred miles up from the ocean, abundance of
                    cod, whitings, haddocks, flounders, sea-bream, and herrings, caught for daily
                    use and for sale by the seafaring peasantry. The rivers and lakes are likewise
                    well supplied with fish, which may indeed be said to constitute the basis of a
                    Norwegian repast.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Norway are too unimportant to detain us long. Wood and fish
                    are the chief produce of the country; and these find their way to every part of
                    Europe, chiefly in Norwegian vessels, which in return bring home whatever
                    foreign articles are required, at the cheapest possible rate of freight. The
                    import duties are very moderate. Articles which have been in use, and are not
                    intended for sale, as furniture, books, clothes, or household goods, are not
                    subject to duty. Before the importer pays his duties, he is allowed to take his
                    goods to his own warehouse and shop, upon giving security for the amount of the
                    duties ascertained by the custom-house officers at landing; he also keeps an
                    account of his sales, and pays the duty every three months upon the quantity
                    which appears to have been sold. This must be of great advantage to the dealer
                    in a country so poor as Norway, since it leaves his capital entirely free for
                    active employment. Coffee, sugar, tea, a little French brandy, and French and
                    Spanish wines, a little tobacco, (for the Norwegians smoke less than any other
                    continental people), and a limited quantity of spiceries, are the principal
                    articles for which the house-keeper has to disburse money. The other necessaries
                    of life are produced by themselves. Shoes, furniture, cloths, and the like, are
                    all made at home. Looms are at work in every house in the country; carding,
                    spinning, and weaving forming constant occupations of the female part of the
                    household. Woollen cloth, substantial but coarse, excellent bed and table linen,
                    and checked or striped cotton or linen for female apparel, are the ordinary
                    fabrics produced. These homemade stuffs, including boots, gloves, and in bad
                    weather great-coats, clothe the greater part of the inhabitants, and more
                    comfortably than is the case with the lower and middling classes of people in
                    most other countries. The upper ranks, or the people of condition, dress as in
                    other parts of Europe; and as living and lodging are nearly on a level amongst
                    all the respectable classes, the peasant proprietor, and those more wealthy than
                    he is, this wearing of foreign articles by the latter, and home-made stuff’s by
                    the former, would seem to constitute a kind of conventional distinction between
                    them. This is not the place to speculate on the general economy of these family
                    manufactures; it seems, however, to be extremely well adapted to the Norwegians,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560375" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0375-0270"/>as they are
                    circumstanced, both in regard to climate and social relationship.</p>
                <p>The principal articles of export are timber, bark, iron, copper, fish, and some
                    others. The principal articles of import are corn, colonial produce, woollen,
                    linen, and cotton goods, wine, brandy, &amp;c. Salted and pickled fish, one of
                    the staple products of Norway, is principally exported from Bergen. In the year
                    1833, there were exported from this place, of dried fish or stock fish,
                    22,620,992 pounds, and of salted and dried fish 4,802,000 pounds. The deals of
                    Christiania have always been held in the highest estimation; a consequence of
                    the excellence of the timber, and of the care with which the sap-wood and other
                    defective parts are cut away. Like many other branches of the trade of Norway,
                    that of preparing wood was formerly fettered by pernicious restrictions; the
                    saw-mills being licensed to cut a certain quantity only·, and the proprietors
                    bound to make oath that it was not exceeded. But this absurd regulation no
                    longer exists. British manufactured goods are admitted into Norway on moderate
                    duties, and are very generally made use of. The imports from Norway were,</p>

                <p>In some articles our trade with Norway has declined, but the amount of British
                    and Irish produce and manufacture exported to that country has steadily
                    increased, as the following statement will show. Our exports were, in 1827,
                    L.39,129; in 1828, L.53,582; in 1829, L.64,234; in 1830, L.63,926; in 1831,
                    L.58,580; in 1832, L.34,528; in 1833, L.55,038; in 1834, L.61,998; and in 1835,
                    L.79,278.</p>
                <p>Were the discriminating duty on Norwegian and Baltic timber repealed, our
                    commercial relations with the whole north of Europe would be greatly extended.
                    Compared with the Swedish customs-duties, those of Norway are moderate, the
                    import duties seldom exceeding two per cent. <hi rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi>
                    In 1831 they amounted to L. 161,840 inwards, and to L.47,381 outwards, making in
                    all L.209,22l. To these should be added L.27,436 received on account of tonnage
                    duties, lights, and sundries. The weights and measures of Norway are the same as
                    those of Denmark.</p>
                <p>With regard to money, the principal silver coin in circulation (for there are
                    none of gold) is called a species dollar, which is divided into one hundred and
                    twenty skillings. There are also half species, one fifth species, one fifteenth
                    species, and what is denominated skillemynt or small change, that is, four and
                    two skilling pieces of silver, and also one and two skilling pieces of copper.
                    The dollar is worth three shillings and tenpence sterling at the present rate of
                    exchange (1837). There are, besides, notes of one dollar, half a dollar, and
                    twenty-four skillings, all printed on white paper. The notes of five dollars
                    value are on blue paper, those of ten dollars on yellow paper, and those of
                    fifty on green paper. This is, we think, a very wise and convenient
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian finances are in a flourishing condition, the revenue having
                    latterly increased considerably. The Bank <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Norway,
                    which was founded in 1816, has its head office in Drontheim, with branches in
                    the principal towns, and is under the direction of five stockholders, with a
                    council of fifteen representatives of the other proprietors. The transactions of
                    this bank are conducted upon a principle totally opposite to that of the Scotch
                    and other banking establishments. It is there considered as a first principle
                    that the bank should hold only available securities, as bills or bonds at a
                    short date, or payable at a short notice, for its issues or advances. The
                    national bank of Norway is therefore a bank for landed property, and discounts
                    mercantile bills and personal securities only as a secondary branch. Its chief
                    business is advancing its own notes, upon first securities over land, any sum
                    not exceeding two thirds of the value of the property, according to a general
                    valuation made in the year 1812. The borrower pays four per cent, for what he
                    draws, and is bound to pay also five per cent, of the principal yearly. This
                    kind of bank is exceedingly well adapted for the wants of the country; and their
                    paper can scarcely be considered as less secure than their silver. Since it
                    commenced business, discussions have more than once taken place regarding the
                    return of the bank to cash payments, as it was originally agreed that after the
                    lapse of a certain period it should begin to pay its notes in cash. This has not
                    been found practicable, although the maximum has been reduced to 125 paper
                    dollars for 100 of silver; but the paper dollar has for a considerable time been
                    at 112 for 100 silver on the exchange of Hamburg. The bank is able to provide
                    for all its notes in silver; and the question recently agitated in the Storthing
                    was, whether its course of 125 paper for 100 silver dollars should not now be
                    reduced to par, 100 paper for 100 silver, which has not been agreed upon.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian army consists of some twelve thousand troops of all arms, besides
                    which there are thirty thousand militia enrolled. Two companies belonging to
                    each regiment in the Norwegian service are trained to the use of the skidor or
                    skate. This corps, called the skielöbere, move with singular agility and speed,
                    and, whilst skating along with the greatest velocity, perform their military
                    evolutions with uncommon precision. The army is at the disposal of the king, as
                    far as its services can be rendered available in Scandinavia; it cannot,
                    however, be sent beyond the limits of the peninsula without the special
                    permission of the Storthing. The king has the nomination of the superior
                    officers of the army, as well as of some few of the first civil officers under
                    the government; that of others rests with the Storthing. Norway is governed by a
                    viceroy, appointed by the king of Sweden; Christiania, the capital of the
                    country, being the seat of government. She contributes nothing towards the
                    expense of the Swedish government beyond a trifling annual allowance to the
                    royal family; but she supports all her own civil and military institutions.</p>

                <p>In the year 1825 the population of Norway amounted to 967,959. According to the
                    census of 1835, it was 1,098,291, being an increase of 130,332 in ten years. The
                    town population of 1825 was 112,778, and in 1835, 125,139, being an increase of
                    12,361 in the same period; and that of the country amounted in 1825 to 855,181,
                    and in 1835 to 973,152, being an increase in ten years of 117,971. It is quite
                    clear, therefore, that the great bulk of the population is engaged in
                    agricultural pursuits; trade, manufactures, and the other occupations employing
                    but a very limited number. The town population is confined to thirty-eight
                    places, only nine of which have more than 3000 inhabitants, and only two reach
                    20,000. Besides, in the whole of these, with the single exception of Bergen, a
                    considerable proportion of the inhabitants are partially engaged in agriculture.
                    During these ten years, no manufacture has been produced fit to be exchanged for
                    the commodities of other countries. The staple trade in wood, which formerly
                    gave employment to a large portion of the inhabitants, has latterly been in a
                    very depressed state, from the restrictive duty already referred to. The
                    increase of population, therefore, has chiefly taken place amongst the
                    agricultural classes; and the additional food raised for their support, together
                    with the admitted advance of the people during these ten years, is to be
                    attributed partly to additional tracts of land having been taken in, and partly
                    to improved methods of cultivating the old soil. The country has unquestionably
                    made great progress under its own peculiar legislation; and taxes have gradually
                    been reduced.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Norway is divided into four sees or stiffs, each of which is
                    divided into a certain number of districts, corresponding to its size and
                    importance, and these again into parishes, of which there are 336 in the
                    country. The dioceses are Aggershuus, containing Christiania, the capital;
                    Christiansand, the largest town in which bears the same name; Bergen, containing
                    the large and important city of the same name; and Drontheim, which contains the
                    city ofDrontheim, situated on the south shore of a great fiord of the same name;
                    the northern territories of Nordland and Finmark, which goes also by the name of
                    Drontheim, being presumed to be in the same see. The stiffs are thus
                    distributed. Christiansand occupies the southern extremity of the country;
                    Bergen and Aggershuus occupy, the former the western, and the latter the eastern
                    sideof Norway, where it is widest, extending over its whole breadth in that
                    quarter, and being separated by the great mountain chain; still farther north
                    lies Drontheim, which is succeeded by Nordland and Finmark, the most northerly
                    region of Norway, and of which the reader will find some account in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Lapland.</hi> Each district, called a fogderie or
                    bailiwick, is under a foged, who has charge of the collection of taxes, police,
                    and all executive functions in his district. Besides this public functionary,
                    there are military officers, who have official residences in the district; and
                    the amtman, and sorenskriver or judge ordinary. Christiania, Bergen, Drontheim,
                    and the other large towns in Norway, will be found described each under its own
                    respective head in this work.</p>
                <p>The Norwegians enjoy more political liberty than any other European nation. The
                    parliament, called the Storthing, is chosen by the owners or life-renters of the
                    land who have attained the age of twenty-five years complete. The minimum value
                    which gives a vote is a hundred and fifty dollars, or L.30, a value which, from
                    the large diffusion of property, renders the suffrage nearly universal. To
                    render the elector himself eligible as a representative, it is only necessary
                    that he should be thirty years of age, have resided ten years in Norway, and be
                    altogether unconnected with the state. The voters choose electing men, one to
                    every fifty voters in towns, and one to every hundred vo ters in counties. The
                    elective franchise is not connected with the place, but with the number of
                    electors; and expands or contracts as they increase or diminish. If numbers
                    change, the power of choosing electing men changes also; and as the Storthing
                    bears a proportion to the number of electing men, the number composing the
                    Storthing likewise varies; but the variation cannot be great, indeed seldom more
                    than two or three. By this self-acting system of parliamentary reform, places
                    which increase obtain a direct voice in the making of laws, whilst such as
                    decrease below fifty electors must join another district. The electing men, on a
                    day fixed by law, choose their representatives, and the body thus elected forms
                    the Storthing. The proportions of members chosen is founded on the principle,
                    that the towns in Norway should as nearly as possible return one third, and the
                    country two thirds, of the whole body, which must not consist of less than
                    seventy-five, nor of more than one hundred members. Each district elects as many
                    substitutes as it elects representatives, to provide against death and other
                    casualties. The Storthing is chosen every three years, and is assembled only
                    once in three years, when it sits for three months, or until the business be
                    despatched. The 1st of February is the day of meeting fixed by law. An
                    extraordinary Storthing may be convened by the king, but its acts must be
                    confirmed by the next regular Storthing. After some preliminary business, such
                    as electing a president, speaker, and secretary, the Storthing divides itself
                    into two chambers. One fourth of its whole number is formed into a second
                    chamber, called a Lagthing, or division, in which the deliberative functions of
                    the legislative body are vested. This chamber appears to be equivalent to a
                    house of peers, but its powers are much more confined. No bill can be introduced
                    there; it must come from the other house, which is called the Odelsthing, or
                    house of commons. The Lagthing can only deliberate upon what is sent to it, and
                    approve, reject, or send back the bill with proposed amendments. It is also the
                    court before which, aided by the Hoieste Ret Court, an independent branch of the
                    state, the lower house may impeach ministers of state. Asthe Storthing of 1836
                    consisted of ninety-six individuals, the Lagthing comprised twenty-four members,
                    and the Odelsthing seventy-two. Mr Laing thus speaks of the Norwegian
                    parliament. “The Storthing consists, in fact, of three houses, the Lagthing of
                    twenty-four members, the Odelsthing of seventy-two, and the entire Storthing
                    consisting of the whole ninety-six united in one house. In this latter all
                    motions are made and discussed; and, if entertained, are referred to committees
                    to report upon to the Storthing. The report, when received back from a
                    committee, is debated and voted upon; and if approved, a bill in terms of the
                    report is ordered to be brought into the Odelsthing. This house entertains or
                    rejects the proposed bill, frames and discusses the enactments if it is not
                    rejected <hi rend="italic">in toto,</hi> and sends it up to the Lagthing or
                    upper house, to be deliberated upon, approved, rejected, or amended.” In regard
                    to the passage of bills through these two houses, the practice of the Norwegian
                    parliament does not differ materially from that of our own, except in the more
                    limited functions of the Lagthing, the king having only a suspensive veto. But
                    if a bill pass through three successive Storthings, it becomes the law of the
                    land without the royal assent. This was exemplified in the case of the bill,
                    already mentioned, for the abolition of hereditary nobility. The duties of the
                    Storthing need not be minutely specified; they may easily be inferred. The
                    members are paid for their services; and no executive officer of government can
                    sit in either house.</p>
                <p>For legal purposes, the whole country is divided into four stifts or provinces;
                    and these are farther subdivided into sixty-four judicial districts, each of
                    which last comprehends<pb break="no" facs="nls:194560401"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0401-0272"/> several prestigilds or parishes. To each of these
                    divisions there is a distinct tribunal, with a supreme court of ultimate appeal
                    for the whole kingdom, established at Christiania. The lowest court, which is
                    strictly one of equity, not of law, is the court of mutual reconcilement or
                    agreement held in every parish, and over which presides a commissioner, who is
                    elected every three years by the householders, and holds his court once a month,
                    receiving a small fee. Every case or law-suit whatsoever must pass through this
                    preliminary court, where no lawyer or attorney is permitted to practise. Each
                    party states his own case; and if by the judgment or advice of the commissioner
                    the parties are brought to agree, his opinion is duly registered in another
                    court held in the parish, and it has all the validity of a final decision. If,
                    however, the litigants are not satisfied, they carry their case to the lowest
                    legal court, that of the sorenskriver, or sworn writer, which is held in every
                    parish of every district once in every quarter. The sorenskriver’s court is of
                    great importance. Besides judging civil and criminal matters, it is the court of
                    registration affecting property in the district, and also for ascertaining the
                    value of and succession to the property of deceased persons. The court next
                    above is the stift-amt court, or that of the province, and is thus constituted.
                    It consists of three judges with assessors, is stationary in the chief town of
                    each province, and is the court of appeal from all the lower tribunals of the
                    province, having at the same time the revision of their administration. It must
                    likewise sanction their decision in criminal matters before sentence can be
                    pronounced. There is, lastly, the Hoieste Ret Court of final appeal. It consists
                    of seven judges, and, by the ground law, is one of the three estates of the
                    constitution, being independent of the executive and legislative branches. To
                    this court appeals are carried in the last resort, from the stift-amt courts, in
                    criminal as well as civil cases.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian system of jurisprudence presents some remarkable features, not the
                    least important of which is that the judge is responsible for his legal
                    decision; and in a case of appeal to a higher court, he must there defend his
                    judgment, being liable in damages for a wrong decision. This principle involves
                    a high responsibility, and must occasion some individual annoyance, as well as
                    expense; but it does not prevent able lawyers from becoming candidates for
                    judicial functions; and beyond all doubt it is of great advantage to the public
                    in giving certainty to the law, and in preventing as well as remedying erroneous
                    decisions. The punishment of death was abolished by the Danish government about
                    the latter end of the last century, a measure of questionable expediency in this
                    country, at least where the secondary punishments are by no means perfect. But
                    the punishment which is found the most effective, and which forms one of the
                    most distinguishing characteristics of the country, is that of the “loss of
                    honour.” From the earliest times this has been a specific punishment in the
                    criminal law of Norway, standing next in degree to the loss of life. “The
                    possession of property,” says Mr Laing, “naturally diffuses through all classes
                    the self-respect, regard for character and public opinion, circumspection of
                    conduct, and consideration for others, which flow from and are connected with
                    the possession of property, and render these influential on the morals, manners,
                    and mode of thinking of the whole body of the people.” There is and has always
                    been much more of the real business of the country in the hands of the people of
                    Norway, and transacted by themselves, than is possessed by the inhabitants of
                    any other European nation. Now, as the “loss of honour” involves exclusion from
                    all the functions which naturally devolve upon them, the punishment is very
                    severely felt, and looked upon, even by the humblestpeasant, with the greatest
                    dread. Imprisonment is regarded by the great bulk of the population as light
                    compared with the sentence of dishonour; and the prevalence of such a high tone
                    of feeling regarding a check to crime, which in other countries is altogether
                    ineffectual, is a. phenomenon in social polity highly to the credit of the
                    Norwegians.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian church is in principle and doctrine Lutheran, and remains as it was
                    originally moulded after the subversion of the ancient faith, unaltered by the
                    spirit of innovation, and unviolated by the hand of power. It is essentially
                    ceremonial, almost as much so as the Roman Catholic. The altar is decorated with
                    crosses and images, and the priest, arrayed in embroidered robes of velvet,
                    celebrates high mass under that name. To maintain the ceremonial with decent
                    splendour, as well as to support the clergyman in a respectable manner, it is
                    necessary that the parishes should be of considerable size. There are in Norway
                    336 prestigilds or parishes; and many of these are exceedingly large, extending
                    in some parts from the seacoast to the Swedish frontier, and containing from
                    5000 to 10,000 inhabitants. This is certainly a low provision for religious
                    instruction; but the people, generally speaking, are scattered all over the
                    country, not clustered in towns and villages; and although individually they are
                    not affluent, they are at least respectable, notwithstanding that as a whole
                    they are poor. Under such circumstances, parishes must necessarily be large.
                    There are five bishoprics in Norway, each of which has in it a suitable number
                    of inferior clergymen. The patronage is in the hands of the five bishopsand the
                    Norwegian council of state, acommitteeof which has charge of all the affairs of
                    the church. By judicious arrangements the abuse of patronage is prevented.
                    Amongst the regular clergy there is one who has the superintendence over the
                    concerns of four or five of the adjoining parishes; and the state of the
                    church-property buildings, and the manner in which clerical duties are
                    discharged, come under his cognizance. He communicates with the bishop of the
                    diocese, and has a small allowance for performing these services, as dean or
                    probst. This appears to be the only dignity in the church, with the exception of
                    that of bishop. The incomes of the clergy are derived from tithes, commuted into
                    a payment of grain, glebe farms, one of which the widow has for her life,
                    offerings, and dues. These incomes in country parishes vary from 800 to 1600
                    dollars; but in large towns, or thickly settled parishes, they are higher. The
                    bishops, says Mr Laing, have about four thousand dollars each. In proportion to
                    the other professional classes in the country, the clergy are well paid, and the
                    church has always been the first profession to which talent is naturally
                    directed. The clergy are laborious and zealous in the discharge of their duty,
                    the church service forming the smallest part of it. They have school
                    examinations, Sunday schools, and other institutions for the promulgation of
                    Christian knowledge. Mr Laing’s impression is, that the Norwegian clergy are a
                    highly educated body of men, being all acquainted with the literature of Europe,
                    and some of them celebrated for their classical attainments. It is a peculiar
                    characteristic of the Norwegian church, that there is no dissent from it; there
                    are no sectarians in the country. This arises partly from the church having no
                    temporal power, no political existence as a part of the state, no interests
                    jarring with those of the other members of the community. In political rights
                    and privileges the clergy are on a footing with the rest of the inhabitants, and
                    are represented in the Storthing, like other citizens. The Lutheran religion is
                    part of the state, but not the ministers who teach it. One chief cause of the
                    influence of the ministers of religion, and the absence of dissent, is the high
                    consideration in which the right of confirmation is held. The person who has
                    passed this ordeal is regarded as having received a moral as well as a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194560414" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0414-0273"/> religious
                    diploma, which capacitates him for an office of trust and responsibility. In
                    connection with religion, we may mention the singular fact, that Bibles are
                    remarkably scarce. Mr Laing could not obtain a copy of the Old or New Testament
                    from the only bookseller in Drontheim, which contains 12,000 inhabitants, nor
                    from the bookdealers at the fair of Levangor. The reason assigned for this
                    remarkable deficiency in the sacred writings in a country attentive to religion,
                    and sufficiently supplied with the catechism and the book of common prayer as
                    used in the Norwegian church, is, that the Bible Society of London at one time
                    sent over a great supply, and drove the regular dealers from the market by
                    underselling them. In consequence of this they are now afraid to speculate in
                    such a precarious stock.</p>
                <p>Education is very generally diffused; but the standard of excellence is rather
                    low, reading and writing constituting nearly the whole. It is provided for in
                    the country parishes by an arrangement similar to that of Scotland. There are
                    parochial schoolmasters, of whom some have fixed residences, and others live for
                    one half of the year in one place, and for the other half in another. A small
                    tax is levied from each householder, and every adult pays a small personal fee.
                    There is a considerable degree of intelligence evinced in some of these
                    communities; but the schools are too widely scattered over a thinly peopled
                    country to be equally beneficial to all. It may be mentioned, that the clergy
                    pay particular attention to the diffusion of education. The higher department of
                    university education at Christiania is exceedingly expensive; and, besides,
                    there is not such a demand for educated men in the medical, legal, and
                    commercial professions, as in more densely-peopled and commercial countries, the
                    tendency of which undoubtedly is to raise the standard of intellectual
                    proficiency amongst all classes of the community. Those belonging to the learned
                    professions are not numerous, became the demand is not great, and the supply is
                    adjusted accordingly. The restrictions on the free exercise of trade and
                    industry also operate with great force in depressing general education. Before a
                    person can enter upon any medical or legal employment, before he can
                    manufacture, buy, or sell as a merchant, he must obtain peculiar privileges from
                    a corporate body. “As the expense of preparation,” says Mr Laing, “and the small
                    number of prizes to be obtained, place the higher and learned professions out of
                    the reach of the main body of the people, as objects of rational ambition, for
                    which they might endeavour to bestow superior education upon their children, so
                    the restrictions and monopoly system shut them out from various paths and
                    employments for which ingenuity, with ordinary useful education, might qualify
                    them.” With such a legislature as Norway possesses, it is to be hoped that these
                    fetters upon the industry and intelligence of the country will not be allowed to
                    remain much longer unremoved.</p>
                <p>From the general diffusion of periodical publications, Mr Laing is led to infer
                    that the Norwegians are a reading people. What is of great importance to the
                    community is, that the press is by law perfectly free. There is no duty on
                    newspapers, of which upwards of twenty are published; seven or eight in
                    Christiania alone, and all in extensive circulation. Every little town has its
                    local newspaper; and from the importance attached to local subjects there
                    discussed, the bulk of the community are the purchasers, not the educated few.
                    In type and paper they are superior to the French or German papers, and much
                    ability is shown in conducting them. “Such newspapers as the American people
                    read,” says Mr Laing, “would not find readers in this country.” There is no
                    scurrility nor personal abuse displayed by those who write in them; yet the most
                    entire freedom of discussion exists, public men and public measures being
                    handled freely but decorously, and with a strict eye to the general good. There
                    is no tax upon advertisements; and a measure to allow all periodical
                    publications to be transmitted free of postage was lately negatived, only
                    because the revenue of the post-office had been appropriated to certain specific
                    purposes for the three years next ensuing. Some newspapers which are supposed to
                    be particularly favourable to government are allowed by royal favour to pass
                    free of postage at present, and no doubt is entertained that ere long all will
                    be placed upon the same footing. A number of periodical and occasional works
                    besides newspapers are published. There are two weekly magazines in great
                    circulation; several monthly journals devoted to literature, antiquarian,
                    agricultural, and military subjects; and in almost every newspaper there is the
                    announcement of some new work or translation. Yet the literature which ought
                    strictly to be considered as Norwegian is not yet of a very high order compared
                    with that of other countries. But the mind of the country is advancing, and
                    literature, which is young in Norway, will advance along with it.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Norway are very polite in their manners, as well to each other
                    as to strangers. They are partial to theatrical representations, so that the
                    drama holds a high place in their estimation; and, besides the public theatres,
                    there are societies of amateur performers in all the larger towns, and even in
                    some of the villages. In music, dancing, and dress, the Norwegian females arc by
                    no means deficient. They have pleasing voices, and in every family of every
                    station singing and dancing are constantly practised in the long winter
                    evenings. Music is taught in the country by the organist attached to each
                    parish. In the winter regular fairs are held, at which Swedes and Laplanders
                    attend for disposing of goods. Christmas is kept in great style, and there are
                    other festivals and various amusements which serve to relieve the tedium of
                    winter and spring. The 17th of May, also, being the anniversary of their
                    independence, is celebrated both at home and abroad by every Norwegian, and with
                    marked propriety. Mr Laing gives a favourable account of the state of morals in
                    Norway; but, without impugning so high an authority, if we are to take bastardy
                    as a test, the statement is not borne out by the facts. The proportion of
                    illegitimate to legitimate children is as one to five, which is as high as in
                    London or Paris. But the evils entailed upon society by illegitimacy arc
                    partially alleviated by the state of the law in respect to this. Children are
                    not only rendered legitimate by the subsequent marriage of the parents, as in
                    Scotland, but the father, previously to his contracting a marriage with another
                    party, may, by a particular act, legitimize them. The Norwegians are at all
                    events a very hospitable, honest, industrious, and peaceable people.</p>
                <p>The government of Norway, aware of the value and importance of steam navigation,
                    is making great and judicious exertions to promote it. This is a country where
                    it is calculated to produce its greatest benefits, from the manner in which the
                    peninsula is traversed by long arms of the sea, penetrating sometimes to its
                    very centre. Steam-vessels are now seen plying on these fiords; they are
                    commanded by naval officers; the fares are moderate; and in all that regards the
                    comfort of passengers they rival our own. Roads and bridges are kept in a state
                    of excellent order; a circumstance likely to happen in a country of proprietors,
                    whose common interest it is to keep them in repair. There are no tolls in
                    Norway; the principle of the farmers and others is to work in concert, and to
                    keep up establishments for the common benefit.</p>
                <p>The worst feature, perhaps the only thoroughly bad one, in the institutions of
                    Norway, is, that the trade is not free. Each trade is monopolized by a sort of
                    guild or fraternity, by which even country dealers are licensed. The pernicious
                    effects of such a system we have sufficiently shown <pb break="no"

                    fisheries; and we shall close our account of this interesting country with the
                    following observations, extracted from a work of great authority on such
                    subjects:</p>
                <p>“The principle of equal partition of land among all the children, retained in
                    Norway from the earliest period, prevailed also in England before the conquest.
                    A relic of it remains in the law of gavelkind, still existing in Kent. The
                    different effects produced on society by the retention of that law in the one
                    country, and its general disuse in the other, are remarkable. In Norway, chiefly
                    by its operation, a high standard of sufficiency has been preserved among the
                    middle and labouring classes. Population has been prevented from increasing too
                    rapidly by the fear which people have of falling below the general standard.
                    There has, therefore, been a continual prevalence and diffusion of ease and
                    well-being. But, on account of the absence of great inequalities of condition,
                    and therefore of many of the usual stimulants to exertion, society has been kept
                    at a low level. Great social freedom has indeed always existed, in consequence
                    of the land being in the hands of the mass of the people; but there has been a
                    want of ability, until a very recent period, to combine for the preservation of
                    their political independence. During their earlier history, their political
                    liberties were often variable and uncertain. After the union of their crown with
                    that of Denmark in 1380, it appears that the Danish nobility gradually
                    encroached upon their privileges; for when, in 1660, the crown and the people
                    combined against the nobility, and abolished the states in Denmark, a similar
                    revolution also took place in Norway; and that country continued under absolute
                    government until the establishment of its constitution in 1814. Their udal laws
                    trained them in the management of their own affairs, and produced that feeling
                    of self-respect which the possession of property, and of land in particular, is
                    calculated to give. These, together with the civil institutions preserved or
                    introduced whilst they were under the Danish crown, prepared them for the large
                    measure of freedom to which they have now attained. The evil of their udal
                    system is its tendency to obstruct the development of intellect, and to keep
                    society stationary. But since 1814 they have made great progress. Stimulants to
                    mental activity are now no longer wanting. Their continual collision with
                    Sweden, the problem of their internal restrictions on trade and commerce, the
                    routine of their government, and the wholesome struggles always arising in a
                    free state, will supply them. Their land will become more productive, by the
                    application of science to its cultivation; their trade will also be expanded. If
                    we open our ports to their timber, which we may one day see accomplished, their
                    wealth will increase. And, according to the experience of the last twenty years,
                    wealth will not materially disturb the peculiarities of their social
                    system.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh
