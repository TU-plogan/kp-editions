                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NAZARITE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Nazarean,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nazarene</hi></label>, a term which signifies one who is of
                    Nazareth, or any native of the city of Nazareth. It was given to Jesus Christ
                    and his disciples, and is commonly employed in a sense of derision and contempt
                    by those authors who have written against Christianity. It has also been applied
                    to a sect of heretics called Nazarenes; and sometimes it means a Nazarite, or
                    one who has laid himself under the obligation of a vow to observe the rules of
                    Nazariteship, whether it be for his whole life, as Samson and John the Baptist,
                    or only for a time, as in the case of those mentioned in Numbers (vi. 18, 19,
                    20) and Amos (ii. 11, 12). Lastly, the name of Nazarite, in some passages of
                    Scripture, denotes a man of particular distinction and great dignity in the
                    court of some prince. Of these several sorts of Nazarites we shall now give some
                    account.</p>
                <p>The name of Nazarene belongs to Jesus Christ, not only because of his having
                    lived the greater part of his life at Nazareth, and because this city has always
                    been considered as his country, but also because the prophets had foretold that
                    he should be called a Nazarene (Matth, ii. 23). “And he came and dwelt in a city
                    called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He
                    shall be called a Nazarene.” We find no particular passage in the prophets where
                    it is said that the Messiah should be called a Nazarene; and St Matthew only
                    quotes <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557736" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7736-0067"/>the
                    prophets in general. Perhaps he meant to insinuate, that the consecration of the
                    Nazari tes, and the great purity of which they made profession, were a type and
                    a sort of prophecy of those of our Saviour, or else that the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Nazir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nazarite,</hi> given to the
                    patriarch Joseph (Gen. xlix. 26; Deut, xxxiii. 16), was a prophecy which was to
                    be fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, of whom Joseph was a figure. Lastly,
                    St Jerome was of opinion, that St Matthew here alludes to a passage in Isaiah,
                    where it is said, “And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
                    and a branch <hi rend="italic">(Nezer)</hi> shall grow out of his roots.”
                    According to the general consent of all the fathers and interpreters, this
                    branch, or <hi rend="italic">Nezer,</hi> and this root, are intended to denote
                    Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p>When the word Nazarene is applied to the heretics known by this name, it denotes
                    Christians converted from Judaism, whose chief error consisted in defending the
                    necessity or expediency of the works of the law, and who obstinately adhered to
                    the practice of the Jewish ceremonies. The name of Nazarenes at first had
                    nothing odious attached to it, and it was often applied to the first Christians.
                    The fathers frequently mention the Gospel of the Nazarenes, as differing in
                    nothing from that of St Matthew, which was either in Hebrew or Syriac, being for
                    the use of the first converts, but afterwards corrupted by the Ebionites. These
                    Nazarenes preserved the first gospel in its primitive purity. Some of them were
                    still in being in the time of St Jerome, who does not reproach them with any
                    error; they were very zealous observers of the law of Moses, and held the
                    traditions of the Pharisees in supreme contempt.</p>
                <p>Nazarite, when used to signify a person under the ancient law who had made a vow
                    of observing a more than ordinary degree of purity, denotes a man or woman who
                    engages himself or herself by a vow to abstain from wine and all intoxicating
                    liquors, to let the hair grow without cutting or shaving, and not to enter into
                    any house which was polluted by having a dead corpse in it, or to be present at
                    any funeral. But if by chance any one should have died in the presence of such a
                    person, he or she began again the whole ceremony of consecration and
                    Nazariteship. This ceremony generally lasted eight days, sometimes a month, and
                    sometimes their whole lives. When the time of their Nazariteship had been
                    accomplished, the priest brought the person to the door of the temple, who there
                    offered to the Lord a he-lamb for a burnt-offering, a she-lamb for an expiatory
                    sacrifice, and a ram for a peace-offering. They likewise offered loaves and
                    cakes, with wine necessary for the libations. After all this had been sacrificed
                    and offered to the Lord, the priest or some one else shaved the head of the
                    Nazarite at the door of the tabernacle, and burned his hair, throwing it upon
                    the fire of the altar. Then the priest put into the hand of the Nazarite the
                    shoulder of the ram roasted, with a loaf and a cake, which the Nazarite returned
                    into the hands of the priest, who offered them to the Lord, lifting them up in
                    the presence of the Nazarite; and from this time he might again drink wine, his
                    Nazariteship being now accomplished. As to those who were perpetual Nazarites,
                    like Samson and John the Baptist, it appears that they were consecrated to their
                    Nazariteship by their parents, and continued all their lives in this state
                    without drinking wine or cutting their hair.</p>
                <p>Those who made a vow of Nazariteship out of Palestine, and could not come to the
                    temple when their vow was expired, contented themselves with observing the
                    abstinence required by the law, and afterwards cutting their hair in the place
                    where they happened to reside. As to the offerings and sacrifices prescribed by
                    Moses, which were to be offered by themselves, or by others for them at the
                    temple, they deferred this till they found a conve nient opportunity. Hence it
                    was that St Paul being at Corinth, and having made the vow of a Nazarite, he had
                    his hair cut off at Cenchrea, and postponed fulfilling the remainder of his vow
                    till he should arrive at Jerusalem (Acts, xviii. 18). When a person found that
                    he was not in a condition to make a vow of Nazariteship, or had not leisure to
                    perform the ceremonies which it rendered necessary, he contented himself by
                    contributing to the expense of the sacrifice and offerings of those who had made
                    and fulfilled the vow; and by this means he became a partaker in the merit of
                    such Nazariteship. When St Paul went to Jerusalem, in the year of Christ 58, the
                    apostle St James the Less, with the other brethren, said to him (Acts, xxi. 23,
                    24), that to quiet the minds of the converted Jews, who had been informed that
                    he everywhere preached up the entire abolition of the law of Moses, he ought to
                    join himself to four of the faithful who had made a vow of Nazariteship, and
                    contribute to the charge of the ceremony at the shaving of their heads; by which
                    .the new converts might perceive that he continued to keep the law, and that
                    what they had heard of him was not true.</p>
                <p>The Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Nazir,</hi> which is employed to signify a
                    person exalted to great dignity, as it is said of the patriarch Joseph (Gen.
                    xlix. 26; and Deut, xxxiii. 16), “that he was separated from his brethren,” as
                    it is in our translation, or as the Vulgate and others understand the Hebrew,
                    “that he was a Nazarite amongst his brethren,” has been variously understood.
                    Some think that the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Nazir,</hi> in these places,
                    signifies one who is crowned, chosen, separated, or distinguished; indeed the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Nazir</hi> signifies a crown. The Septuagint translate
                    this word a <hi rend="italic">chief,</hi> or him who is honoured. Calmet thinks
                    that it was a term of dignity in the courts of eastern princes; and mentions,
                    that at this day in the court of Persia the word <hi rend="italic">Nazir</hi>
                    signifies the superintendent-general of the king’s household, the chief officer
                    of the crown, the high steward of his family, treasures, and revenues; in which
                    sense Joseph was the Nazir of the court of Pharaoh. Le Clerc translates the term
                    <hi rend="italic">Nazir</hi> a prince, and calls Joseph “the prince of his
                    brethren and Pool declares in favour of this last translation.</p>
