                <p><label type="entry">NORTHAMPTONSHIRE</label>, an inland county of England, nearly
                    in the centre of the kingdom. It is of an irregular and very extended figure,
                    being about sixty-seven miles in length. In the widest part it is thirty miles,
                    and in the narrowest not more than eight miles in breadth. The extent, according
                    to the returns collected by Mr Rickman, is 646,810 acres. The land is thus
                    appropriated:—About 290,000 acres are in arable cultivation, 235,000 acres are
                    in pasture, and about 86,000 are uncultivated, or occupied as forests and
                    woodlands. The county contains one city, eleven market-towns, 301 parishes, and
                    is divided into 1901 liberties.</p>
                <p>The population, according to the official returns at the four decennial
                    enumerations, amounted in 1801 to 131,757, in 1811 to 141,353, in 1821 to
                    162,483, and in <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> 183l to 179,300. The annual value
                    of the whole real property of the county, as taken in the year 1815 for the
                    purposes of the property-tax, was L.942,162. The burials, including both the
                    registered and the unregistered, in the ten years from 1821 to 1831, appear to
                    have been about one in fifty of the whole number of inhabitants then living. The
                    illegitimate births were one in twenty-five of the whole number born.</p>
                <p>The occupations of the people, according to the returns arranged by Mr Rickman in
                    1831, were as follow:</p>

                <p>From its oblong shape, lying obliquely across the middle of the kingdom,
                    Northamptonshire comes in contact with, and is bounded by, a greater number of
                    other counties than any other division of England. Proceeding from the north, on
                    its western side, it touches upon Lincolnshire, Rutlandshire, Leicestershire,
                    Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire; and on its eastern side it is bounded by
                    Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, and Cambridgeshire. The whole of
                    the county is within the diocese of Peterborough, with the exception of three
                    parishes which are included in the see of Lincoln.</p>
                <p>Northamptonshire is generally a pleasant country, with such undulations as give
                    an agreeable variety; but, owing to the numerous enclosures, the prospects are
                    not in general extensive, except upon the summits of the higher hills. The
                    centre of the county is a level elevation, from which the rivers have their
                    rise, and, descending in opposite directions, take a course both to the German
                    Ocean and the English Channel.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of this county partakes so much of the nature of the several
                    counties that border on it, as to be almost as various, and not to merit any
                    particular description. The most important rural pursuit is the grazing of
                    cattle, for which the excellent pastures are admirably adapted. The cattle, when
                    fattened, are sent in weekly droves to the market of Smithfield for the supply
                    of the metropolis, where they are highly esteemed. The arable land produces
                    excellent wheat, beans, and oats; but the soil in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560128" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0128-0251"/>general is not well
                    calculated to raise good barley. The artificial grasses, clover, trefoil,
                    sainfoin, and rye-grass, are very extensively cultivated, and, aided by turnips,
                    form important articles of food for the flocks and herds.</p>
                <p>Within this county there are several large forests belonging to the crown, with
                    two chases, over which the king has certain rights. The largest of these is the
                    Forest of Rockingham, in the northern part of the county, extending over 11,000
                    acres. The land, in many instances, belongs to individuals; but the royal deer
                    have, under certain restrictions, the range over the whole. Whittlewood Forest
                    contains about 5000 acres. It is stocked with about 1000 deer; a proportion of
                    which, according to ancient prescription, are killed annually for the royal
                    household, and for the great officers of the government, who receive them as a
                    matter of right attached to their appointments. This forest contains much
                    excellent naval timber, which is reserved for the use of the government; but,
                    from the reports of the commissioners, it appears to be very negligently
                    preserved, and very injudiciously managed. Salcey Forest is about 1850 acres in
                    extent. This tract was formerly covered with most valuable ship-timber, but has
                    furnished for the navy only a very small proportion of what it is capable of.
                    The mixture of opposite interests in this kind of property diminishes its
                    productiveness to all the parties interested in it. The underwood does not
                    belong to the crown. The individuals who own it cut it down every twenty-one
                    years. During the following nine years it is enclosed, and for the remaining
                    twelve it is open for the deer to feed on the land. The crown enjoys only this
                    right of pasture and the timber trees. The pasture does not belong exclusively
                    to it, for many of the surrounding parishes possess also a right to turn their
                    cattle into the forests, under ancient grants and prescriptions, and with
                    limitations of a complex nature, which are productive of perpetual dissensions
                    and litigations. The rangership of these forests is hereditary in the Dukes of
                    Grafton, who have, during the last century, derived from it a very large income,
                    whilst the revenue to the crown has been very trifling, scarcely amounting to
                    L.200 per annum upon an average of the last hundred years.</p>
                <p>The only navigable river in this county is the Nen or Nine. It rises in the
                    western part, flows across, and then runs north, till it enters by Lincolnshire
                    into the German Ocean. The Welland rises in the county, then forms the boundary
                    between it and Leicestershire and Rutlandshire, and only becomes navigable after
                    entering Lincolnshire at Stamford. The other rivers, the Ouse, the Avon, the
                    Learn, and the Charwell, although they have their sources in Northamptonshire,
                    are but inconsiderable rivulets till they enter the contiguous counties. The
                    benefits of internal navigation have been very freely bestowed here by the
                    canals, which afford great facilities to internal intercourse. The Oxford Canal
                    connects it with that city. The Grand Junction Canal, communicating on one hand
                    with London, and on the other with Liverpool and Manchester, passes through this
                    county. The Grand Union Canal connects it with Leicester. Thus the heavy
                    products, especially coals, are brought to every part on very moderate terms.
                    Great advantage to this county is anticipated from that great work, now
                    hastening to its completion, the London and Birmingham Railway, which will enter
                    it near Stony Stratford, and proceed more than thirty miles, when it will
                    advance through a corner of Leicestershire to Warwickshire.</p>
                <p>The remains of Roman and Saxon antiquities are very numerous. Amongst the former,
                    the Watling Street Road, he Ermine Street Road, the camps of Arbury, of the
                    Boroughs, and of Rainsbury, and the tesselated pavements it Cotterstock, at
                    Stanwick, and at Woodford Field, have ingaged the attention of Stukely and other
                    eminent antiquaries. As there were more than sixty monasteries and other
                    religious houses at the period of the Reformation, traces of which may still be
                    seen, they, with the baronial castles, present a wide field for the researches
                    of the lovers of antiquity; but the bare enumeration of them would be
                    incompatible with the limits of this work.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of this county are chiefly of a domestic nature, and carried on
                    in the dwellings of the workmen. Boots and shoes are made for foreign markets,
                    and, in war, for the supply of the army. Both fine thread and silk lace are
                    made, and afford employment to the females, who are taught the art in schools
                    for that purpose, and attain great perfection. The principal places for
                    collecting the lace are Northampton and Wellingborough. A large quantity of
                    horse-whips were made at Daventry, and, though diminished in some degree, the
                    trade is still continued there.</p>
                <p>The titles derived from this county are Duke of Grafton; Marquis of Northampton;
                    Earls of Peterborough, Fitzwilliam, Spencer, and Harrington; Viscount Sackville;
                    Barons Braybrooke and Lilford; and as second titles, Baron Burleigh to the
                    Marquis of Exeter, Viscount Milton to Earl Fitzwilliam, Viscount Brackley to the
                    Earl <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Bridgewater, and Baron Finch to the Earl of
                    Winchelsea. By the reform act this county is formed, for the purpose of electing
                    members of parliament, into two divisions, distinguished into North and South,
                    each returning two members. The election for the northern division is held at
                    Kettering, and the polling places are, that town, Peterborough, Oundle,
                    Wellingborough, and Clipston. The election for the southern is held at
                    Northampton, and, besides that town, at Daventry, Towcester,and Brackley. The
                    boroughs of Brackley and Higham Ferrers were by the same law disfranchised.</p>
                <p>The most celebrated natives of Northamptonshire have been, Robert Browne, the
                    founder of the sect of Independents; Mrs Chapone; John Dryden, the poet;
                    Fletcher, the dramatist; Fuller, the historian and divine; Harrington, author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oceana',</hi> Hervey, author of Meditations and other
                    works; Knolles, the historian of the Turks; Dr William Paley; Bishop Wilkins;
                    and Thomas Moolston.</p>
                <p>The catalogue of all the noblemen and gentlemen’s seats in this county would
                    extend to a long list, and we therefore can only notice the most remarkable of
                    them, viz. Castle Ashby, Marquis of Northampton; Aldwinckle, Lady Lilford;
                    Althorp, Earl Spencer; Apethorpe, Earl of Westmoreland; Brinworth, Walter
                    Strickland, Esq.; Burleigh, Marquis of Exeter; Canons Ashby, Sir J. E. Dryden;
