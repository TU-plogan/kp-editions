                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">NORIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, a cardinal,
                    and a great ornament of the monastic order of St Augustin, was descended from
                    the president Jason, or James de Noris, and was born at Verona in 1631. He was
                    carefully educated by his father Alexander Noris, originally of Ireland, and
                    well known by his history of Germany. From his infancy he discovered an
                    excellent understanding, great vivacity, and quick apprehension. His father
                    instructed him in the rudiments of grammar, and procured an able professor of λ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> erona, called Massoleim, to act as his preceptor.
                    At fifteen he was admitted as a boarder in the Jesuits’ College at Rimini, where
                    he studied philosophy; after which he applied himself to the writings of the
                    fathers of the church, particularly those of St Augustin; and taking the habit
                    in the convent of the Augustinian monks of Rimini, he in a short time
                    distinguished himself amongst that fraternity by his erudition, insomuch that,
                    as soon as he had completed his noviciate, the general of the order sent for him
                    to Rome, to give him an opportunity of improving himself in the more solid
                    branches of learning. Nor did he disappoint the expectations of bis superior. He
                    gave himself up entirely to his studies, and spent whole days, and even nights,
                    in the library of the Angeliques of St Augustin. His constant course was to
                    study fourteen hours a day; and this he continued till he became a cardinal.
                    Thus he became qualified to instruct others, and was first sent to Pezaro, and
                    thence to Perugia, where he took his degree of doctor of divinity; after which,
                    proceeding to Padua, he applied himself to finish his History of Pelagianism. He
                    began it at Rome at the age of twenty-six, and when he had completed his design,
                    the book was printed at Florence, and published in 1673. In the following year
                    the Grand Duke of Tuscany invited him to that city, made him his chaplain, and
                    appointed him professor of ecclesiastical history in the university of Pisa,
                    which his highness had recently founded.</p>
                <p>In his history he explained and defended the condemnation pronounced, in the
                    eighth general council, against Origen and Mopsuesta, the original authors of
                    the Pelagian errors; and he also added an account of the schism of Aquileia,
                    with a vindication of the books written by St Augustin against the Pelagians and
                    Semi-Pelagians. The work procured the author great reputation, but called forth
                    several antagonists, to whom he published proper answers. The dispute grew warm,
                    and was carried before the sovereign tribunal of the Inquisition. There the
                    history was examined with the utmost rigour, and the author dismissed without
                    the least censure. It was reprinted twice afterwards, and the author was
                    honoured by Pope Clement X. with the title of qualificator of the holy office.
                    Notwithstanding this, the charge was renewed against the History, and it was
                    delated afresh to the Inquisition in 1676; but it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560089" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0089-0248"/>came again out of the trial
                    with the same success as before. Mr Noris was now suffered to remain in peace
                    for sixteen years, and taught ecclesiastical history at Pisa, without any
                    molestation, until he was called to Rome by Innocent XII., who, in 1692, made
                    him under-librarian of the Vatican. This post was a step to a cardinal’s hat;
                    his accusers, therefore, took fire afresh, and published several new pieces
                    against him. Upon this the pope appointed some learned divines, who had taken
                    neither side, to re-examine Father Noris’s books, and report on them. Their
                    testimony was so advantageous to the author, that his holiness made him
                    counsellor of the Inquisition. Yet this did not prevent one of his adversaries,
                    the most formidable on account of his erudition, from rising up against him, and
                    attacking him warmly, under the assumed title of a Scrupulous Doctor of the
                    Sorbonne. Noris tried to remove these scruples in a work which appeared in 1695,
                    under the title of, An Historical Dissertation concerning One of the Trinity
                    that suffered in the Flesh, in which, having justified the monks of Scythia, who
                    had made use of that expression, he vindicated himself also from the imputation
                    of having attainted the Pope’s infallibility, and abused Vincentius Lirinensis,
                    and other bishops of Gaul, as favourers of Semi-Pela2f1an- ism, and as having
                    themselves fallen into the errors of the Bishop of Ypres. But his answers to all
                    these accusations were so much to the satisfaction of the pope, that at length,
                    in 1695, his holiness honoured him with the purple.</p>
                <p>After this he was in all the congregations, and employed in the most important
                    affairs; so that he had little time to spend in study, a circumstance of which
                    he frequently complained to his friends. Upon the death of Cardinal Casanati, he
                    was made principal keeper of the Vatican Library in 1700, and two years
                    afterwards he was nominated, amongst others, to reform the calendar; but he died
                    at Rome, of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> dropsy, in 1704. He was one of the most
                    learned men of his time; his writings abound with erudition, and are also
                    remarkable for their elegance. His works are numerous, and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> were published at Verona, in 1729 and 1730, in five
                    volumes folio.</p>
