                <p><label type="entry">NEW HAMPSHIRE</label>, one of the United States of North
                    America, is bounded on the north by the mountainous ridges which separate Canada
                    from the states of the union, on the east and south-east by Maine and the
                    Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Massachusetts, and on the west by Vermont. It is
                    situated between 42. 4L and 45. 11. of north latitude, and between 70. 40. and
                    72. 23. of west longitude; extending in length about 168 miles, whilst its
                    average breadth is about fifty miles, and its area is computed at 9491 miles. On
                    the map its shape nearly resembles a wedge inserted between the states of Maine
                    and Vermont, and having Massachusetts for its base. New Hampshire, for its
                    narrow extent, differs morè in relative elevation than any other state of the
                    union', and of course the extremes of temperature are in corresponding excess.
                    The line of coast is indented with small inlets of the sea, and skirted by a
                    narrow sandy plain. At no great distance the country swells into a mountainous
                    region, and New Hampshire has jnstly been called the state of hills, and also
                    the granite state. The highest peaks of the White Mountain range, some of them
                    7000 feet in height, are more elevated than any others in the United States,
                    with the exception of the Rocky Mountains. Between the Merrimack and the
                    Connecticut are situated many considerable mountains; the names of the principal
                    heights being Monadnock, Sunapee, Kearsarge, Carr’s Mountain, and Moosehillock.
                    As a whole, the physiognomy of New Hampshire is bold and prominent, and,
                    although rugged, often sublime in the highest degree. The mountains of the state
                    are in the centre, with a zone of finely-diversified hill and dale country
                    around, the hills consisting generally of stony and moist land, and affording
                    excellent pasturage. There are no extensive barrens, and most of the land is
                    capable of cultivation. Many of the valleys are beautifully green, sheltered,
                    and fertile. The rivers in particular have rich alluvial bottoms or intervale
                    lands, the soil, although encumbered with stones, having a considerable degree
                    of fertility. The state originally was heavily timbered, and in the interior
                    there are still considerable tracts of forest country. There are extensive
                    plains of warm, light, sandy, and peculiar soil, resembling, when cleared, the
                    poorer lands of the high western prairies, covered in their natural state with
                    white pine, and called pine plains. Mount Washington, one of the White
                    Mountains, often visited by travellers, Mr Hinton thus describes: “After
                    climbing the side of the mountain for some distance, the forest trees begin to
                    diminish in height, till, at the elevation of about four thousand feet, you come
                    to a region of dwarfish evergreens, about the height of a man’s head, which put
                    forth numerous branches, and surround the mountain with a formidable hedge, a
                    quarter of a mile in thickness. On emerging from this thicket, you are above all
                    woods, at the foot of what is called the bald part of the mountain, which is
                    very steep, and consists of a huge pile of naked rocks. After attaining the
                    summit, the traveller is recompensed for his toil, if the sky be serene, by a
                    most noble and extensive prospect. On the south-east there is a view of the
                    Atlantic Ocean, the nearest part of which is sixty-five miles distant in a right
                    line; on the south, Winnidiscogee Lake lies full in view; in the south-west is
                    the lofty summit of Moosehillock; and far away in the horizon is the Grand
                    Monadnoe. The barren rocks, which extend a great distance in every direction
                    from the summit, add a melancholy cast to the grandeur of the scene. The notch
                    or gap in the White Mountains is also frequently visited as a curiosity. It is
                    on the west side of the mountains, near the source of Saco River. It is a deep
                    and narrow defile, in one part only twenty-two feet wide. The mountain appears
                    as if cloven quite to its base, perpendicularly on one side, and on the other at
                    an angle of forty-five degrees.” The Lake of Winnidiscogee, mentioned above, is
                    the largest sheet of water in New Hampshire, being about twenty-three miles in
                    length. It is sprinkled with numerous islands, and abounds in the finest kinds
                    of fresh-water fish. Umbagog <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558997"

                    in Maine. Squam, Ossipee, Sunnapee, and Newfound Lakes, are also large
                    collections of water. Five of the largest rivers of New England have their
                    sources in this state, viz. the Connecticut, Merrimack, Androscoggin, Saco, and
                    Pascataqua. Ι here are also a number of inferior streams; and, throughout, New
                    Hampshire is remarkably well watered, the water being generally of the purest
                    quality. In reference to the geological features of the state, it may be
                    mentioned, that the high ridge of mountains which divides the waters of the
                    Connecticut from those of the Merrimack is composed of the older primitive
                    rocks. Granite prevails in the northern and more elevated part, and mica slate
                    in the southern. A beautiful fine-grained granite occurs in many parts of the
                    state, and great quantities of it are transported to Boston as a building stone.
                    To the eastward of the great ridge, mica slate, gneiss, and greenstone, are
                    found. Steatite or greenstone of good quality is found at Orford and
                    Francestown, and primitive limestone abounds in several places. New Hampshire
                    also possesses beds of iron ore of excellent quality, and copper ore has
                    likewise been discovered. Plumbago is found at some places in large quantities,
                    and of excellent quality. These are the principal minerals which this state
                    produces in such quantities as to be much regarded by the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The climate of New Hampshire is subject to the extremes of heat and cold, and to
                    great and sudden changes, yet it is reckoned healthy, the air being generally
                    pure and salubrious. Winter commences in November, and continues till April, the
                    lakes being ordinarily frozen four months in the year, during six weeks of which
                    travelling by means of a species of sledge is quite common, both on the ice and
                    on terra firma. The open fields are commonly cleared of snow by the end of
                    April; but the cold weather, which commences as early as the first of September,
                    continues till May. In all the states in this neighbourhood the autumn is a
                    delightful season. New Hampshire is an agricultural state, and by far the
                    greater number of the inhabitants are engaged in the cultivation of the soil.
                    The articles principally cultivated are, wheat, rye, Irfdian corn, oats, barley,
                    pulse, and flax. The quantity of live stock is considerable, consisting of
                    horned cattle, sheep, swine, and horses. Apples are abundant, and no good
                    husbandman considers his farm as complete without an orchard; but other kinds of
                    fruit are not so extensively cultivated. The principal articles of export are,
                    lumber, fish, beef, pork, horses, neat cattle, sheep, flax-seed, and pot and
                    pearl ashes. The manufactures of New Hampshire have of late years greatly
                    increased. In 1831 there were forty cotton mills, which manufactured during that
                    year 29,060,500 yards of cloth, and employed 875 males and 4090 females, besides
                    some children. There are likewise some woollen establishments, ten or twelve
                    paper mills, a number of iron founderies, and works for preparing the ore; and
                    glass is also manufactured. In this and in some other states, large quantities
                    of carpeting, of an inferior quality, are made in families, but these are not
                    noticed in the estimated amount of exports. Mr Pitkins, in his statistics of the
                    United States (1835), observes regarding this manufacture in New Hampshire: “The
                    agent for New Hampshire, in his return to the secretary, says that the amount*
                    of carpeting made in the counties of Rockingham, Strafford, Grafton, and Coos,
                    mostly in families, and sold in other states, exceeds, in his opinion, the
                    amount of foreign articles consumed.” The value of the imports from December
                    1832 to December 1833 was 167,754 dollars; and the value of the exports for the
                    same period was, of domestic produce, 145,355 dollars, and of foreign produce,
                    9903 dollars; total, 155,258 dollars; the tonnage entered being 17,126. From the
                    same source (the American Almanac) we learn, that for the year ending the 30th
                    of September 1835, the value of the imports was 71,514 dollars; that of the
                    exports, of domestic produce, 75,076 dollars, and of foreign produce, 6605
                    dollars, total, 81,681 dollars; whilst the tonnage which entered was, 6564, and
                    that which departed, 3996 tons. This remarkable falling off in the trade of the
                    state we have no other means of accounting for, than by supposing that the trade
                    in this part of the United States is becoming more and more concentrated at
                    Boston, where goods of all kinds can be more readily disposed of; and this, we
                    have been informed by a native of the country, is the fact. Amongst the towns
                    where the principal manufacturing establishments are situated may be mentioned
                    Exeter, Dover, Peterborough, Franconia, Pembroke, New Ipswich, Keene, and
                    Durham. In 1835, there were in New Hampshire twenty-six banks, having a capital
                    of 2,655,008 dollars, and a circulation of 1,389,970 dollars. The number of
                    post-offices was 289, and the amount of postages for the preceding year was
                    23,429 dollars. There are several savings’ banks and insurance offices in this
                    state. At the commencement of the war in 1775, New Hampshire had only one
                    newspaper; but in 1834 twenty-seven were published, besides a few other
                    periodicals. The following table exhibits a view of the counties and county
                    towns.</p>

                <p>Portsmouth, the largest town, and the only seaport in the state, is situated on
                    the south side of Piscataqua River, three miles from its junction with the sea,
                    in latitude 43.4. north, and longitude 70. 45. west. The harbour is consi∙</p>

                <p>dered as excellent, having sufficient depth of water for vessels of any size,
                    being easy of access, protected from every wind, and, owing to the rapidity of
                    the tide, never frozen. It is so well fortified by nature, that it can be made
                    secure against any attack, with little trouble or expense. Several forts have
                    been planted upon commanding positions. A lighthouse on Great Island indicates
                    the entrance, and the largest ships can come close up to the wharfs. Portsmouth
                    is well provided with houses of public worship, and contains a custom-house, an
                    insurance office, and several banks. This town enjoys considerable trade; but as
                    a great portion of that from the interior of the state centres at Boston, and a
                    part at Portland, its commerce is not so extensive or flourishing as it would
                    otherwise be, and, as has already been shown, it is on the decline. In Navy
                    Island, on the Piscataqua, opposite to Portsmouth, there is a navy yard of the
                    United States. The island belongs to the general government, and is convenient
                    for building ships of war, being well furnished for this purpose. Portsmouth has
                    suffered much from fires at different periods, the places of the buildings
                    destroyed being supplied by brick edifices. A very handsome bridge across the
                    Piscataqua connects it with the state of Maine. This town was settled in 1623,
                    and incorporated by charter in 1633.</p>
                <p>Concord, the capital of New Hampshire, and the seat of government, is situated on
                    both sides of the river Merrimack, in latitude 43.12. north, and longitude 71.
                    29. west. The principal portion of the town is exceedingly pleasant, extending
                    along the western bank of the river for nearly two miles. It contains a
                    state-house, a state-prison, a court-house, several places of public worship,
                    and above two hundred dwelling-houses. Two bridges connect the chief village
                    with that on the opposite bank, and much of the trade of the upper country
                    centres here; whilst the importance of the town is increased by the boat
                    navigation which has been opened between this place and Boston by means of the
                    Merrimack River and Middlesex Canal. The town of Concord issues three or four
                    gazettes, and is altogether a place of large and growing business. Exeter is a
                    handsome village, fifteen miles south-west of Portsmouth; it is situated at the
                    head of tide-water on the Exeter River, and small vessels ascend to it. This
                    village contains a number of public buildings, with three or four churches, and
                    is the seat of very considerable manufactures. Philips’ Exeter Academy, in this
                    place, is one of the most ancient, opulent, and useful institutions in the
                    United States, having many of the advantages and endowments of a college. Dover
                    is a large manufacturing village, situated on the western bank of the
                    Piscataqua, twelve miles north-west of Portsmouth, and through it flows the
                    Cochecho. This river has several falls, the largest of which, being upwards of
                    forty feet perpendicular, is at the centre of the town, and affords water-power
                    equal to any in New England. Large iron and cotton manufactories have been
                    erected upon these falls,and upon others a few miles higher up the river. Dover
                    contains a number of good public buildings, has a considerable share of
                    shipping, and is one of the most flourishing towns in the state. The greatest
                    part of the timber exported from New Hampshire is brought to this place. Keene
                    is a pleasant town, in the south-west part of the state, on the Ashuelot. The
                    principal towns on the Connecticut River are Walpole, thirteen miles north-west
                    of Keene; Charlestown, twelve miles north of Walpole; Hanover, the seat of
                    Dartmouth College; Haverhill, twenty-seven miles north of Hanover; and Bath,
                    adjoining Haverhill, at the head of the boat navigation. There are, besides,
                    numerous thriving and beautiful villages. The common schools are well supported,
                    and flourishing academies are established in many of the towns. Dartmouth
                    College, at Hanover, was founded in 1770, and ranks as the third literary
                    institution in New England. In 1836 there were connected with it ten
                    instructors, 1858 alumni, 512 ministers, and 186 students, with 6000 volumes in
                    the college libraries, and 8500 volumes in the students’ libraries. The funds of
                    this institution are considerable, the annual income being above 4000 dollars.
                    It has likewise a medical school of deserved reputation at Hanover, where there
                    are three professors and about eighty students. Philips’ Exeter Academy, at
                    Exeter, is an old and flourishing institution. It has funds amounting to about
                    80,000 dollars, a library of700 volumes, and a handsome philosophical apparatus.
                    Its officers are, a principal, a professor of mathematics and natural
                    philosophy, and an assistant. The funds are appropriated in part to the support
                    of theological students. There are a great number of less extensively-endowed
                    academies, and the primary and other schools established throughout the state
                    are upon the general footing of the New England system. The state has a literary
                    fund amounting to 64,000 dollars, formed by a tax of one half per cent, upon the
                    capital of banks. The proceeds of this fund, and also an annual income of 9000
                    dollars derived from a tax upon banks, are appropriated for the support of
                    schools; and for maintaining common schools, 90,000 dollars are annually raised
                    by a separate tax. There are in New Hampshire 159 churches for
                    Congregationalists, and eleven associations; the Baptists have ninety churches
                    and six associations; the Free-will Baptists have a hundred congregations; the
                    Methodists, seventy-five ministers; the Presbyterians,ten congregations; the
                    Christians, twenty-three congregations; the Unitarians, seventeen congregations;
                    the Friends, fifteen societies; the Episcopalians, nine congregations; the Roman
                    Catholics, two congregations; and the Shakers, two societies. The clergy of New
                    Hampshire are supported by salaries, which are raised by subscription, or by
                    voluntary taxation on property, or by contribution. The average salary of the
                    Congregational ministers is about 400 dollars, that of the Episcopalian 600
                    dollars, that of the Unitarian 500 dollars, that of the Baptist 300 dollars, but
                    those of other persuasions have still less. The inhabitants are a strong,
                    healthy, industrious, and well-informed people; frugal, religious, and jealous
                    of their rights. The salubrity of the climate is proved by the fact, that many
                    instances of considerable longevity occur in the state.</p>
                <p>As in the other states of the Union, internal improvements have within the last
                    ten years made considerable advances in New Hampshire. Several canals have been
                    constructed around falls in the Merrimack, viz. Bow Canal, three miles below
                    Concord, with four locks, and passing a fall of twenty-five feet; Hooksett
                    Canal, fifty rods long, with three locks, and a lockage of sixteen feet, passing
                    Hooksett Falls; Amosheag Canal, with nine locks, and a lockage of forty-five
                    feét, passing Amosheag Falls, nine miles below Hóoksett Falls; Union Canal,
                    immediately below Amosheag, overcomes seven falls in the river, and has seven
                    locks in nine miles. A canal is now in progress around SewalΓs Falls, in
                    Concõrd. The Nashua and Lowel Railroad, extending from Nashua, New Hampshire',
                    to Lowell in Massachusetts, about fifteen miles in length', was incorporated in
                    the year 1836, and is nofr (1837) in progress. This railroad is expected to be
                    continued from Nashua to Concord. The Concord Railroad Corporation has been
                    organized.</p>
                <p>The early history of New Hampshire will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">New England.</hi> In the year 1741 a final separation took
                    place between it and Massachusetts. A constitution was established in 1784; but
                    in 1792 this constitution was altered and amended by a convention of delegates
                    held at Concord, and it is that now in force. The legislative power is vested in
                    a senate and house of représentatives, which together are styled The General
                    Court of New Hampshire. Every town or incorporated township having one hundred
                    and fifty rateable polls may send one représenta-tive, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559023" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9023-0166"/>and for every three hundred
                    additional polls it is entitled to an additional representative. The senate
                    consists of twelve members, who are chosen by the people in districts. The
                    executive power is vested in a governor, and a council which consists of five
                    members. The governor, council, senators, and representatives, are all elected
                    annually by the people, their term of service commencing on the first Wednesday
                    in June, upon which day the general court meets yearly at Concord. The right of
                    suffrage is granted to every male inhabitant of twenty-one years of age,
                    excepting paupers, and persons excused from paying taxes at their own request.
                    The judiciary power is vested in a superior court and a court of common pleas.
                    The judges are appointed by the governor and council, and hold their offices
                    during good behaviour, but not beyond the age of seventy years. <hi
