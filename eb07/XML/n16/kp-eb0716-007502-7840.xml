                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NEEDLE</label>, a very common little instrument, made of
                    steel, pointed at one end, pieced at the other, and employed in sevying,
                    embroidery, tapestry, and the like.</p>
                <p>Needles form a very considerable article in commerce; and as there is scarcely
                    any commodity cheaper, the consumption of them is almost incredible. The sizes
                    vary from No. 1, the largest, to No. 25, the smallest. In the manufacture of
                    needles, German and Hungarian steel is in general preferred.</p>
                <p>In making this article, the first thing is to pass the steel through a coal fire,
                    and under a hammer, to bring it out of its square figure into a cylindrical one.
                    This being done, it is drawn through a large hole of a wire-drawing iron, and
                    returned into the fire, and drawn through a second hole of the iron smaller than
                    the first; and thus successively from hole to hole, till it has acquired the
                    degree of fineness required for that species of needles; observing, every <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194557853" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7853-0076"/> time it is drawn,
                    that it be carefully greased over with lard, to render it more manageable. The
                    steel, thus reduced to a fine wire, is cut in pieces of the length of the
                    needles intended; and these pieces are flattened at one end on the anvil, in
                    order to form the head and eye. They are then put into the fire to soften them
                    farther, and thence taken out and pierced at each extreme of the flat part on
                    the anvil, by force of a puncheon of well-tempered steel, and laid on a leaden
                    block, to bring out, with another puncheon, the little piece of steel remaining
                    in the eye. The corners are then filed oft’ the square of the heads, and a
                    little cavity is filed on each side of the flat of the head; the point is then
                    formed with a file, and the whole filed over. They are next laid to heat red hot
                    on a long narrow iron, crooked at one end, in a charcoal fire; and when taken
                    out thence, they are thrown into a bason of cold water to harden. On this
                    operation a good deal depends; too much heat burns them, and too little leaves
                    them soft; the medium is only learned by experience. When they are thus
                    hardened, they are laid in an iron shovel, on a fire more or less brisk, in
                    proportion to the thickness of the needles, taking care to move them from time
                    to time. This serves to temper them, and take off their brittleness; but great
                    care must be taken as to the degree of heat applied. They are then straightened
                    one after another with the hammer, the coldness of the water used in hardening
                    them having twisted the greater part of them.</p>
                <p>The next process is that of polishing them. To effect this, the workmen take
                    twelve or fifteen thousand needles, and range them in little heaps against each
                    other upon a piece of new buckram sprinkled with emery dust. The needles being
                    thus disposed, emery dust is thrown over them, which is again sprinkled with oil
                    of olives; at last the whole is made up into a roll, well bound at both ends.
                    This roll is then laid on a polishing table, and over it a thick plank loaded
                    with stones, which two men work backwards and forwards a day and a half, or two
                    days successively; by which means the roll is continually agitated by the weight
                    and motion of the plank over it, and the needles withinside, being rubbed
                    against each other with oil and •emery, are insensibly polished. After
                    polishing, they are taken out, and the filth washed off them with hot water and
                    soap; they are then wiped in hot bran, a little moistened, placed with the
                    needles in a round box, suspended in the air by a chord, which is kept stirring
                    till the bran and needles be dry. The needles being thus wiped in two or three
                    different brans, are taken out and put in wooden vessels, to have the good
                    separated from those whose points or eyes have been broken either in polishing
                    or wiping; the points are then all turned the same way, and smoothed with an
                    emery stone turned with a wheel. This operation finishes them, and there remains
                    nothing but to make them up into packets of 250 each. Needles were first made in
                    England by a native of India, in 1545, but the art was lost at his death; it
                    was, however, recovered in 1560, by Christopher Greening, who settled with his
                    three children at Long Crendon in Bucks, where the manufactory has been carried
                    on from that time to the present day.</p>
