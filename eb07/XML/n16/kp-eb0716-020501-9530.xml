                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NICGBAR ISLANDS</label>, a group of islands situated in the
                    Bay of Bengal, between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude, and
                    between the ninety-third and ninetyfifth degrees of east longitude. They occupy
                    the space from the north-west point of Sumatra to the most southerly of the
                    Andaman Islands. There are seven large and twelve small islands. The principal
                    ones arc Carnicoar, Teressa, Chowry, Bombocha, Kaichull, Carmorta, Nancowry,
                    Toulongar, Sambelong, and Nicoar or Great Sambelong; besides a multitude of
                    smaller islands without any distinct appellation. These islands are mostly
                    hilly, and some of the mountains in them rise to a considerable height; but
                    others, again, are flat, and covered with cocoa-nut trees. On the other islands
                    also a large proportion of cocoa and areca palms, with timber trees of various
                    kinds, some of them of an enormous size, and very fit for naval purposes, are
                    produced; and so thickly are they interwoven in some places, that they are
                    impervious to the beams of the sun. The falling of the leaves, twigs, and fruit
                    below, with the heavy dews, renders the island extremely unhealthy, especially
                    to Europeans. The best island for supplies is Carnicoar; and perhaps the worst
                    is the large one, or Great Nicoar, to the north of which runs St George’s
                    Channel; a very dangerous passage for ships, on account of the strength of the
                    tide, and the rocks.</p>
                <p>The wild beasts common in the Indian continent are not to be found here, such as
                    leopards, tigers, &amp;c. Large flocks of sheep and other cattle, originally
                    brought hither by the Danes, and which have since run wild in the woods, are
                    found in some of the islands; dogs and swine are also common in most of them,
                    and being fed on cocoa-nuts, the quality of the pork is excellent. In some of
                    the southernmost islands monkeys are found. Snakes also abound, but they are not
                    so numerous nor so venomous as those on the coast of Coromandel. There are
                    numerous alligators, some of them of large size, and a variety of crabs, which
                    swarm everywhere. Shell-fish are found in such numbers, that the most beautiful
                    collections of shells may be made here. The inhabitants appear, from their
                    features and their figure, to belong to the Kalmuck race. They are of a copper
                    colour, and have small eyes, small flat noses, large mouths, thick lips, and
                    black teeth. They are well made and muscular, and are of a lively disposition,
                    resembling the Piguans and Chinese in features, having scarcely any beard. Their
                    mode of living is rude. They dwell in huts of an oval form, covered with
                    cocoa-nut leaves, and supported on posts about five or six feet from the ground.
                    These huts are always circular, resembling a stack of corn. They gain their
                    subsistence chiefly by fishing, and trading to the neighbouring islands; whilst
                    the women are employed in preparing the victuals, and in cultivating the ground.
                    Vessels touching at these islands are abundantly supplied with cocoa-nuts,
                    pine-apples, plantains, lemons, and other fruits, and also with ducks and fowls;
                    all of which they readily exchange for cloth, tobacco, and any kind of cutlery;
                    but they do not appear to set much value on gold and silver, such metals not
                    being current amongst them, and tobacco being the ordinary medium of all barter
                    and exchange. A considerable traffic is carried on amongst the islands, the
                    chief articles of which are cloth, silver coin, iron, tobacco, and some other
                    commodities, which they obtain from Europeans. The chief productions of these
                    islands are the cocoa-nut and areca-nut trees. Wild cinnamon and sassafras also
                    grow in them; and there is, besides, a nutritive fruit resembling in some
                    respects the jaca fruit of Bengal, and growing on a species of palm which is
                    found in abundance in the woods. The country is divided into villages,
                    consisting of ten or twelve huts, each of which has a captain, who carries on a
                    bartering trade with the ships that arrive, but who has no peculiar privileges.
                    The clothing of the men is somewhat peculiar, consisting of a narrow piece of
                    cloth about three yards long, which they wrap round their waists, and then pass
                    between their legs, and through the girth behind, leaving the end of it to drag
                    after them; a circumstance which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559543"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9543-0206"/>has given rise to the fabulous stories of men with
                    tails related by Kioping, a Swedish navigator.</p>
                <p>The religion of the natives is an absurd and unintelligible superstition,
                    consisting of sorceries, conjurations, and other delusions practised on the
                    ignorant multitude by the priests. Their language is remarkably poor in words;
                    and the missionaries never having been able to acquire any considerable
                    knowledge of it, have not succeeded in making many converts.</p>
                <p>These islands were first settled by the Danes in 1756, for the purposes of
                    commerce, and from that people they received the name of Frederic’s Islands.
                    But, owing to the unhealthiness of the island, almost the whole colonists died.
                    A new attempt was made in 1768, in conjunction with the Baptist missionaries;
                    but in 1771 only two Europeans and four Malabar servants survived. The
                    missionaries still persevered in their attempts to effect a settlementon
                    theislands, and received supplies from Tranquebar, both of provisions and of
                    recruits. But the mortality continued unabated; and no progress having been made
                    in the conversion of the natives, the attempt was finally abandoned in the year
                    1787. The missionaries mostly died of fevers and obstructions of the liver.</p>
