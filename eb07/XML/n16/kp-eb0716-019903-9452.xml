                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NICANDER</label>, a Greek physician of the empirical sect,
                    and also a poet and grammarian, was a native of Colophon, and, according to some
                    authors, had been a priest of Apollo at Claros in Ionia. The date of his birth
                    is uncertain; but it is probable that he died about a century before the
                    commencement of our era. His father’s name was Damnaeus, and he was sometimes
                    called an Aetolian, because he appears to have lived during many years in
                    Aetolia, and to have written a history of that country. This physician occupied
                    himself much with materia medica and pharmacy, and composed his works in verse.
                    The greater part of his <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559465"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9465-0200"/>writings, however, which are said to have been
                    numerous, is no longer extant. One of his poems, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Georgica,</hi> which he dedicated to Attalus III. the last king of Pergamus, is
                    cited with commendation by Cicero in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oratore</hi> (lib. i. c. 16). In some others of his lost works,
                    which were also in verse, he appears to have described the various poisons and
                    their antidotes; at least such is the' statement of Eustathius and Athenaeus. Of
                    his various poems two only remain; the <hi rend="italic">Theriaca</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Alexijìharmaca.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Theriaca,</hi> though composed without critical
                    discernment, contains, nevertheless, some remarkable facts in natural history.
                    In it may be found an exact but somewhat prolix description of the combats of
                    the rat of Pharaoh, or mangouste <hi rend="italic">{viverra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ichneumon),</hi> with the serpents, the flesh of which is eaten by
                    that quadruped with impunity. The author also treats of scorpions, which he
                    divides into nine species; a division adopted by some modern naturalists. His
                    description of the <hi rend="italic">amphisbaena</hi> accords with that wh ich
                    has been given by Linnaeus in his <hi rend="italic">Αmcenitates Academicae</hi>
                    (tom. i.). Then follow some very curious observations on the effects of the
                    poison of different kinds of serpents, each of which produces different
                    phenomena. Nicander thought he had ascertained that the poison of serpents is
                    concealed in a membrane surrounding the teeth; an opinion which is not very far
                    from the truth. He describes a species of serpent which always takes the colour
                    of the soil on which it crawls, and which he denominates ♯ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ^ψ. He was the first who distinguished
                    night-butterflies from those which are seen only during the day; and to the
                    former he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">phalaenae,</hi> which they still
                    bear. This poem contains a great number of popular fables, which, however, were
                    all firmly believed at a period when the science of natural history was in its
                    infancy. Thus we find it gravely stated that wasps are produced by the putrefied
                    flesh of horses. As to the poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Alexipharmaca,</hi>
                    it may be considered as a continuation of the preceding. The effects of poisons
                    are there explained with tolerable accuracy. They are divided into animal,
                    vegetable, and mineral; but under the last head Nicander only mentions white
                    lead, and litharge, which is also an oxide of lead.</p>
                <p>Of these two works there have been numerous editions. The first, which is in
                    folio, was published at Venice in 1499; and the next, in quarto, appeared at
                    Cologne in 1530, with an interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">Theriaca,</hi>
                    and various commentaries on the <hi rend="italic">Alexipharmaca,</hi> by an
                    anonymous annotator. Of both there have been various Latin translations, some
                    into prose and others into verse; but the principal are those of Lonicer,
                    Cologne, 1531, in 4to; Erycius Cordus, Francfort, 1572, in 4to; Jean de Gorris,
                    Paris, 1549, in 8vo; and Pierre-Jacques Stève, Valence, 1552, in 8vo. Lastly,
                    the works of Nicander were translated into French by Jacques Grévin, Antwerp,
                    1567, 1568, in 4to. In the Imperial Library at Vienna there is a beautiful
                    manuscript copy of both poems, ornamented with figures of venomous animals, and
                    accompanied by a commentary from the pen of the sophist Euteichnius, which has
                    been printed in the Greek edition of Nicander published by J. G. Schneider,
                    Halle, 1792, in 8vo. Demetrius Phalereus, Theon, Plutarch, and Diphilus of
                    Laodicea, all wrote commentaries upon the <hi rend="italic">Theriaca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and there are still extant learned Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >scholia</hi> on both poems, which Vossius has ascribed to Diphilus, though upon
                    what authority we know not. Besides the poems above mentioned, Nicander also
                    wrote in verse <hi rend="italic">Ophiaca,</hi> or a treatise on serpents; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hyacinthia,</hi> or a collection of remedies; and a commentary on
                    the Prognostics of Hippocrates. He was likewise the author of five books of
                    Metamorphoses, some verses of which have been preserved by Tzetzes; and he wrote
                    in prose several historical works, one of which, being the history of</p>
                <p>Colophon, is cited by Athenaeus, whilst the others mentioned are accounts of
                    Aetolia, Boeotia, Thebes, and a general description of Europe. This Nicander has
                    sometimes been confounded with a grammarian of the same name, a native of
                    Thyatira; and Vossius, in giving the titles of the works written by both, has
                    not been careful to distinguish clearly their respective productions. Mérian, in
                    his essay on the Influence of the Sciences on Poetry (see Memoirs of the Royal
                    Academy of Berlin for 1776), cites the works of Nicander, as affording evidence
                    of the incongruity which exists between the language of poetry and the
                    nomenclature of science; and stigmatizes the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theriaca</hi> as a therapeutic versifier, who wrote lines for the apothecaries,
                    and a mere grinder of anecdotes, who sung of toads, scorpions, and spiders. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pharmacie</hi> for 1810,
                    however, Μ. Cadet de Gassicor has given an analysis of the works of Nicander,
                    affording materials for a more accurate judgment than the exaggerated and
                    burlesque representations of Mérian. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
