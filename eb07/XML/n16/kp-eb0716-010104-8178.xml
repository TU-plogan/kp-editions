                <p><label type="entry">NEPOS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cornelius</hi></label>, a Latin
                    writer, who was the friend of Cicero, Atticus, and the poet Catullus, and
                    flourished B. c. 40. It is uncertain where he was born, but Pliny (iii. 22, 2)
                    calls him <hi rend="italic">Padi</hi><hi rend="italic">accola;</hi> and his
                    friendship with Catullus makes it not improbable that Hostilia, near Verona,
                    where that poet was born, was also his birthplace. We possess no information
                    respecting his private life; but many of his works are cited by later writers.
                    1. His Chronicles or Annals, probably in three books, of which the fragments do
                    not enable us to decide whether they were confined to the history of Rome, or
                    included that of all nations. Some have asserted that this was a mere
                    translation of the work of Apollodorus on the same subject; but they have no
                    sufficient grounds for so believing. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Exemplorum
                    Libri,</hi> of which the fifth book is cited by Aulus Gellius (vii. 18), and
                    which seems to have been a work containing remarkable transactions selected from
                    history; but this may have been only another title for his work. 3. The Lives of
                    Illustrious Men, of which the sixteenth book is cited, and the lives we now
                    possess no doubt formed a part. 4. The Lives of Historians (Nep. Dion, iii.),
                    which included both Greek and Latin. It seems not unlikely that the biographical
                    sketch still remaining of Atticus, and the longer one of Porcius Cato, which he
                    mentions (Cato, iii.), belonged to this collection. 5. The Letters to Cicero,
                    which must have been published, as some of them are quoted by Lactantius (Inst.
                    iii. 15). It would appear that he had also made successful attempts in poetry
                    (Plin. Ep. V. 3).</p>
                <p>We possess a work under the name of Nepos, <hi rend="italic">Vitae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Excellentium Imperatorum,</hi> which is not mentioned by any
                    ancient writer under this title. It contains short biographical sketches of
                    twenty commanders, mostly Greek; an essay, <hi rend="italic">De Regibus,</hi>
                    which is little else than the mere names of Greek and Persian kings; and the
                    lives of Hamilcar and Hannibal. There are also two other biographical sketches
                    of Atticus and Cato, which used to be separated from the rest, because they were
                    not found in all the manuscripts, or, when found, were entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic">libro</hi><hi rend="italic">Com.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nepotis</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Latinis
                    Historicis,</hi> whilst the others used to be considered as the work of a
                    certain Aemilius Probus, whose name was found in all the manuscripts. The
                    following unpoetical lines were found to precede them:</p>
                <p>Vade liber noster, fato meliore memento, Cum legat haec dominus, <hi
                    rend="italic">te sciat esse meum.</hi> Si roget auctorem, paullatim detege
                    nostrum Tunc domino nomen, <hi rend="italic">me sciet esse Probum.</hi></p>
                <p>This Aemilius Probus was long considered as a contemporary of Nepos; but he is
                    now generally believed to be the <hi rend="italic">praefectuspraetorio</hi> to
                    whom Ausonius addresses his sixteenth epistle, and is supposed to have lived in
                    the reign of Theodosius, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi>
                    370. At first, however, this work appeared under the name of Probus, and was
                    thus published 1471, and in the following editions till 1563. Gifanius in 1566
                    first directed the attention of the literary world to Nepos as the author; and
                    subsequent investigation has nearly set the question at rest. Attempts have,
                    however, been recently made by an Italian critic (in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saggio di</hi><hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">Esame</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">critico</hi><hi rend="italic">per restituire ad Emilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Probo</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic">libro</hi><hi

                    the old opinion; and he founds his belief on the authority of the manuscripts
                    and of the poetical address or dedication, on the silence of ancient writers, to
                    whom these lives seem to have been unknown, on several mistakes in history and
                    chronology which appear in the work, and on the language, which he considers as
                    unworthy of the golden age of Roman literature. (See this question treated fully
                    by Bardili, in his preface to his edition, Stuttgard, 1820; and by Dahne, Lips.
                    1827.)</p>
