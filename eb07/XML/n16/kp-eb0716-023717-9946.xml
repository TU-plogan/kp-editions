                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NOLLEKENS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished English sculptor, was born at London, on the 11th of August 1737.
                    His father, a native of Antwerp, was a painter by profession, and is mentioned
                    by Horace λValpole, under the name of Old Nollekens, as an artist of some
                    repute. He died whilst Joseph was still very young, and his widow having married
                    again soon after his decease, the education of the youthful sculptor was much
                    neglected. In his thirteenth year we find him in the studio of Scheemakers,
                    where he exhibited his passion for his art by drawing and modelling early and
                    late with the utmost assiduity. As his powers expanded, he became a candidate
                    for the prizes offered to rising genius by the Society of Arts, which in the
                    year 1759 gave him a premium of fifteen guineas for a group of figures in clay;
                    in 1760 they presented him with thirty <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559959"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9959-0238"/>guineas for a bas-relief, and during the same year
                    they 'gave him ten guineas more for a model in clay of a dancing faun. He now
                    began to attract considerable notice, as much on account of his quiet, mild,
                    inoffensive appearance, as from the unquestionable cleverness of his
                    productions; and Garrick, proverbially an observer of character, set down Joseph
                    as a rising man of genius. No artist was ever greeted with even the
                    comparatively limited applause which the works of this young sculptor elicited,
                    without longing to visit those miracles of genius which are treasured in the
                    land where art, like one of the native deities, sprang forth at once; nor was
                    Nollekens an exception to the rule. In his twenty-third year, we find him in
                    Rome, friendless, and nearly reduced to want, but enthusiastically pursuing his
                    vocation. He modelled and carved in stone a bas-relief which brought him ten
                    guineas in England; and in the following year, his group of Timoclea before
                    Alexander, in marble, was honoured by the Society of Arts with a premium of
                    fifty guineas. This success placed him above absolute dependence; and he was now
                    noticed by the artists in Rome, particularly Barry, and also by some English
                    visitors, amongst whom were Garrick and Sterne. The great English actor
                    recognised him one day in the Vatican, invited him to breakfast next morning,
                    and ended by sitting to him for his bust, for the model of which Garrick paid
                    twelve guineas to the artist. Sterne likewise sat to him at Rome; and the bust
                    of the wit, which is in terracotta, is considered as an admirable likeness. To
                    the last hour of his life Nollekens alluded to it with pleasure. “Dance,” he
                    used to say, “made my picture with my hand leaning on Sterne’s head; he was
                    right.”</p>
                <p>But Nollekens, if he did not discover, profited by other means of enriching
                    himself, which were less laborious than cutting"out beautiful forms from the
                    marble. In 1761, fragments of antique sculpture were more frequently to be met
                    with in Rome and its vicinity; and legs, arms, heads, and other members of the
                    body, strewed about like wrecks, when collected and put together with skill,
                    were sold at very considerable prices. Joseph being sprung of a race of
                    picture-makers and sellers, his spirit for bargaining was probably never
                    surpassed; and this, with his proficiency as a sculptor, enabled him not only to
                    collect the best fragments at the most reasonable prices, but to supply
                    deficiencies, and put them together to the greatest advantage. That this proved
                    a most successful speculation, the following anecdote, amongst many of the same
                    kind which might be related, will sufficiently show. A loose head of Minerva,
                    which even Englishmen would not purchase, lay on the shelf of a regular dealer
                    in such articles, where it attracted the attention of Nollekens. It happened
                    that the body of the same, or some other heathen goddess, was brought to light,
                    and purchased by him for fifty guineas. A consultation was held with his brother
                    dealer; the head and trunk were found of similar proportions, and the sculptor
                    undertook to unite them as neatly as if they had both been chiseled from the
                    same block of marble. This he accomplished, and Minerva stood forth restored.
                    “It was sold,” says bis biographer and executor, Mr Smith, “for the enormous sum
                    of one thousand guineas, and is now at Newly, in Yorkshire.” A few speculations
                    equally profitable would soon have raised the artist to affluence. He was,
                    besides, liberally patronised by his countrymen who annually migrated to the
                    capital of Italy, and for whom he executed many considerable works in marble, of
                    which Mercury and Venus chiding Cupid are considered as the best. For all his
                    productions he received immediate and liberal payment. Early misfortunes had
                    made Nollekens acquainted with privation. Being an economist from necessity, he
                    became frugal from habit; and this continued to influence his conduct when the
                    necessity for parsimony no longer existed. He lived at Rome in a very humble
                    manner, and after ten years of profitable study, he returned to London
                    comparatively rich.</p>
                <p>&gt; Nollekens was now prepared to commence business upon his own account, and
                    accordingly he took a lease of extensive premises in Mortimer Street. The busts
                    of Sterne and Garrick had spread his fame in his native country, and he no
                    sooner opened his doors than orders came in abundance. In 1771 he was admitted
                    an associate of the Royal Academy, and in the following year was elected a
                    member, much to the satisfaction of George HL, who soon afterwards honoured the
                    artist by sitting for his bust. The history of a man of genius is that of his
                    works; and the few events which diversify his career, besides the successive
                    appearance of his productions, serve but little to relieve its characteristic
                    monotony. Amongst these the choice of a partner for life is probably the most
                    important. Nolle-kens was not unfortunate in this respect. &gt; The lady of his
                    choice was the friend of Samuel Johnson, and, if report may in aught be
                    credited, the great critic was not insensible to her charms. Mrs Nollekens was
                    endowed with no small share of that parsimonious spirit which her husband is
                    said to have been so abundantly gifted withal, and was quite of his opinion as
                    to one material point, namely, that the accumulation of wealth is not the least
                    of our terrestrial pleasures. Nollekens was fully aware that his strength lay in
                    busts; and as this line of art was an exceedingly profitable one, it may readily
                    be supposed that his time and talents were principally devoted to it. Amongst
                    his sitters were the great, the beautiful, and the titled of the land; and his
                    profits were commensurate with the condition of his employers. He also found
                    leisure to work out, slowly and with much care, marble groups and statues,
                    amongst which may be mentioned those of Bacchus, Venus taking off her sandal,
                    Hope leaning on an urn, Juno, Paetus and Arria, and Cupid and Psyche. His
                    portraits were excellent, and there was generally a gentleness in the
                    expression, and a gracefulness in the handling, which never failed to please.
                    The likenesses of his busts were acknowledged by all, and the prettiness of the
                    statues could not fail to be as generally admitted. But original vigour was
                    wanting. He was one in whom the merely imitative faculty infinitely surpassed;
                    the imaginative. He could transfer to the marble, with the most perfect
                    certainty and success, the features of a sitter; but he could not impart to the
                    works of his hands that ideal beauty which etherealzes the subject, and is equal
                    to the creation of a whole dynasty of gods and goddesses. As his strength lay in
                    the sculpture of busts, so he pursued it with unparalleled success, and his
                    studio became a fashionable lounge for those who reckoned their heads of
                    sufficient importance to theirfriends or their country to have them modelled and
                    cut in marble.</p>
                <p>Towards his sitters, even the most exalted personages, he conducted himself with
                    exceeding homeliness. Nollekens was all his life an unsophisticated child of
                    nature, and his manners would no doubt appear very uncouth, perhaps vulgar, to
                    that class of people who were accustomed to the dignified respect of Reynolds,
                    or have since admired the courtly attentions of Lawrence. He bad too much
                    knowledge of human nature, however, not in his own blunt manner to employ
                    flattery for the purpose of securing steadiness or a good position in the
                    sitter.</p>
                <p>i The want of imagination Nollekens partially supplied by a diligent study of the
                    antique; and hence, whilst every statue surpassed its predecessor in delicacy of
                    workmanship, the artist only attained eminence by incessant labour. He was not
                    one of those prodigies who reach their zenith as it were at the first flight. He
                    was probably as little indebted to nature as most men who have attained
                    greatness; but never-failing zeal for his profession, joined to unflinching
                    industry, would have raised to distinction a less promising artist than
                    Nollekens. During a period of ten years, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559972"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9972-0239"/>from 1776 to 1786, he exhibited sixteen busts,
                    five statues, and four groups, some of which were not in marble. The statues
                    were those of Juno, Diana, Adonis, Cupid, and Mercury, in which he followed the
                    beaten track, without attempting any thing new. Amongst his monumental effigies
                    may be mentioned that which commemorated the three commanders who fell in
                    Rodney’s great battle of the 12th April 1782. This being one of the government
                    statues, the choice of the sculptor rested with the Royal Academy, and, after a
                    fair competition, the design of Nollekens was that approved of. The monument is
                    of large dimensions, and has a look of magnificence; but it is deficient in
                    nature and sentiment, which can only be compensated to a limited extent by fine
                    marble and fine workmanship. Another of his monumental works commemorates a
                    lovely woman who died in childbed, and in it Religion is by her side holding up
                    her finger to heaven. This production has always been greatly admired for the
                    simplicity and beauty of the design, and for the skilful manner in which it is
                    executed. The love of the nation for busts seemed to increase with the supply,
                    and Nollekens found ample employment for his talents. Between 1786 and 1800, he
                    sent some dozen of these to the exhibition; but during that period he is well
                    known to have executed thrice as many more, his prices increasing with his fame,
                    from one hundred to one hundred and fifty guineas. From his Venuses and other
                    statues of that description, we pass on to those productions which were more
                    suitable to the genius of the artist. The ten years which followed 1800 were the
                    busiest in the life of Nollekens; for although he was between sixty and seventy
                    years of age, he continued to work with the same diligence and skill as in his
                    youth. Upwards of fifty busts proceeded from his chisel, besides nearly a score
                    of groups and statues. Amongst the former were the far-famed heads of Pitt and
                    Fox, those of the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV., Dr Burney, the Marquis
                    of Stafford, the Duke of Bedford, and others. Of the twenty statues and groups,
                    the statue of Pitt for Cambridge attracted most attention at the time. The Venus
                    anointing herself, however, was the favourite work of Nollekens, though it is
                    deficient both in originality and in propriety of action. The workmanship of the
                    statue, however, is very fine.</p>
                <p>By temperance and perpetual equanimity of mind, Nollekens, although declined into
                    the vale of years, still laboured as assiduously as ever. From 1810 till 1816,
                    the last year of his exertions, he modelled some thirty busts, not a few of
                    which are ranked amongst the most valuable of his works. The principal heads are
                    those of the Duke of York, Lords Castlereagh, Aberdeen, Erskine, Egremont,
                    Liverpool; Canning, Perceval, Benjamin West, and Thomas Coutts the banker. In
                    1817 Nollekens lost his wife, but being above eighty years of age, he was beyond
                    that period of life when grief can be very acutely felt; and it is even hinted
                    by some of his biographers, that his natural parsimoniousness, not being kept
                    alive by the example of his still more penurious lady, assumed a milder form. He
                    became in every respect more liberal, and presents to the needy members of his
                    profession, with donations to benevolent institutions connected with art, were
                    occurrences not so uncommon as formerly. For several years he lingered in that
                    state of listlessness in which the mind shares ;he decay of the body, and
                    dissolution, being preceded only ny a gradual and almost imperceptible sinking
                    of the vital lowers, when it does take place, may be said to be felt ather than
                    observed. Nollekens departed this life on the 23d of April 1823, leaving a
                    fortune of some two hundred housand pounds. This appears a vast sum indeed to
                    have “cen accumulated by an artist; but several other distinguished ornaments of
                    the profession have been even more berally rewarded than he was, and have only
                    left less be-ause they were either less industrious or less economical.</p>
                <p>With regard to the merits of Nollekens as an artist, little need be added to what
                    has already been said. It was in bust sculpture that he most excelled; and here
                    the chief attraction is ease and simplicity, whilst the chief defect is a want
                    of dignity and sentiment. “There is little dignity,” says his biographer, “but
                    much truth; sometimes mechanic vigour, never exaggeration. It cannot be denied,
                    however, that his vigour is often tame, his serenity languid; that his women are
                    often beautiful without sentiment, and that in his men he is apt to miss that
                    manly breadth of character which is the token of all that is great and noble.”
                    There is, however, some cant and affectation in all this. It is not the business
                    of an artist to look into the soul or read the characters of men and women. He
                    has to do only with material forms, and all that can be expected of him is to
                    interpret faithfully, and fix permanently, that natural expression by which each
                    individual is distinguished. Mr Nollekens, like Crabbe, was “nature’s sternest
                    painter, but her best.” Adhering to strict truth, rather than dealing in
                    sentiment, he did not feel himself at liberty to misinterpret the signs of
                    natural expression according to the rank of his sitter, and give the
                    intellectual grandeur of a forehead like Burke’s to the features of Castlereagh
                    because he was a lord, or to those of Mr Coutts because he was a banker and
                    could afford to pay for it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
