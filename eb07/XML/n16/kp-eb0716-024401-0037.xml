                <p><label type="entry">NORFOLK</label>, an English maritime county, bounded on the
                    northern and north-eastern sides by the German Ocean, on the south and
                    south-east by the county of Suffolk, and on the west by the counties of Lincoln
                    and Cambridge. The shape is nearly that of an ellipsis bounded by a convex line,
                    a little indented on the western extremity. Its greatest length is fifty-nine
                    miles, and its greatest breadth thirty-eight. According to the most recent
                    calculation, as made by Mr Rickman, the number of acres is 1,292,300.</p>
                <p>The population, according to the returns at the four decennial enumerations,
                    appears to have amounted in 1801 to 273,371, in 1811 to 291,999, in 1821 to
                    344,366, and in 1831 to 390,000. The annual value of the real property of the
                    whole county, as taken for the property-tax in 1815, amounted to
                    L.1,540,952.</p>
                <p>The burials, including both the registered and the unregistered, in the ten years
                    from 1821 to 1831, appear to have been one in fifty-two of the whole number of
                    inhabitants then living. The illegitimate births were one in nineteen of the
                    whole number born.</p>
                <p>The occupations of the inhabitants, according to the returns arranged by Mr
                    Rickman in 1831, were as follow:</p>

                <p>The surface of this county presents less variety than almost any other in
                    England. It is generally a level plain, with few undulations, and no bold or
                    abrupt elevations. With the exception of some recently-planted districts around
                    the seats of noblemen and gentlemen, the woody parts of the county are very
                    inconsiderable; and there is generally a great scarcity of the more umbrageous
                    trees. The streams have almost all a languid and sombre appearance. Though, to
                    the traveller of taste, the sameness and uniformity is wearisome, yet to him who
                    directs his attention to the wealth and comforts of the districts through which
                    he journeys, few countries can be more pleasing. The number and substantial
                    appearance of the farm-houses, and even of the cottages, the condition of the
                    roads and fences, and the high cultivation of the fields, are marks of rural
                    prosperity that are nowhere more striking. Some few portions on the eastern side
                    of the county form exceptions to this general description, but these are
                    inconsiderable when compared with the whole.</p>
                <p>From its exposure to the North Sea, the winters in Norfolk are usually severely
                    cold, and the powers of vegetation are retarded to a later period of the year
                    than in the western counties. In the hundred of Marshland the climate is not
                    only cold, but damp; and the inhabitants are subject to intermitting fevers,
                    which commonly attack all strangers who come to reside in that district. The
                    soil of Norfolk is generally a light sand or sandy loam; for although a part of
                    the fens are within the county, and the district of Marshland consists of ooze
                    formed by deposition from the sea, as well as a narrow tract of land upon the
                    banks of the river Waveney, yet these form but trifling exceptions to the
                    general character of the soil of the county. Mr Arthur Young, in his
                    Agricultural Survey of Norfolk, has made an attempt to classify the soils, and
                    estimate their quantities. The difficulty of doing this with accuracy must be
                    acknowledged by every one who considers the nice gradations which soils
                    discover, and how various are their modifications. M e give this estimate rather
                    as an approximation to the truth than as absolutely exact.</p>

                <p>Since the land of Norfolk, from the representation here given, appears to be far
                    from being naturally of a fertile description, the great amount of its
                    productions must be attributed to the excellent system of agriculture which has
                    been there introduced and extended, and which, though scarcely calculated for
                    most of the other districts of our island, is admirably adapted for the soil and
                    climate where it is pursued. The foundation upon which the whole system of its
                    agriculture is built is the cultivation of turnips. These light soils are easily
                    brought into a fine tilth by repeated ploughings and harrowings, and their
                    produce maintains so large a portion of live stock, that their manure, when
                    carefully preserved, and properly distributed, enriches the soil at every
                    successive course more than it is impoverished by the crops of corn which are
                    grown upon it. The land is thus in a constantly progressive state of
                    improvement. The soil being so light, no deep ploughing is required, but such a
                    repetition of moving it as will be sufficient to destroy the surface weeds, and
                    to pulverize it effectually. This is easily effected by means of
                    well-constructed light ploughs, drawn by two horses, which are guided by reins
                    in the hands of the man who directs the plough. In many instances a four-course
                    system of rotation is followed, consisting of turnips, barley, artificial
                    grasses, and wheat. In some instances the artificial grasses are left two years
                    in the ground, and then, after three or four ploughings, the wheat is sown. A
                    very common rotation, provincially termed the six-course shift, is wheat, barley
                    with or without clover, turnips, barley or oats, clover mown for hay, clover
                    fed, and then wheat again. Both these systems, with the varieties of each, are
                    founded upon the principle that as much <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560050"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0050-0245"/>land shall be cultivated with green crops which
                    furnish sustenance for cattle, and thereby produce manure, as is destined to the
                    growth of corn. The system of drill-husbandry is carried to a great extent, and
                    the practice of planting or dibbling grain of all kinds has been of late years
                    very much and beneficially increased. By perseverance in these excellent plans,
                    many extensive portions of the county of Norfolk, especially in the
                    north-eastern part of it, which were a few years ago deemed incapable of
                    producing a wheat crop, now yield abundant harvests of that grain. Oats are but
                    a small object of cultivation; but barley is deemed the grain most appropriate
                    to the soil and climate, and is consequently sowed to the greatest extent,
                    occupying nearly one fourth of the arable land of the county. The increase of
                    grain varies very considerably. On the heavy soils of Marshland and Flegg the
                    produce of wheat is frequently six quarters, and of oats ten quarters, to the
                    acre; but as these districts form but a small proportion of the whole, the
                    average quantity of wheat in the county is about three quarters to the acre, and
                    of barley four quarters. In no part of the kingdoni have the various mechanical
                    inventions for facilitating agricultural labour been so generally diffused as in
                    Norfolk; and the implements used there may' well serve as models for the other
                    counties. Besides the common grains, wheat, barley, oats, pease, and beans, this
                    county yields mustard, saffron, flax, and hemp; but none of them in such
                    quantities as to merit especial notice.</p>
                <p>The live stock of this county possess few peculiarly discriminative features. The
                    horses, crossed by the breed of Suffolk, are bony, active, and hardy, and well
                    adapted for husbandry or the road; and they are almost universally used for
                    agricultural labour, to the exclusion of oxen. The native cows were a small
                    breed, not unlike those of Alderney and Guernsey; but they have been improved by
                    a mixture with the cows of the richer adjoining counties. The greater part of
                    the cattle fattened in Norfolk are bought from the Scotch drovers, who bring
                    them to the fairs about Michaelmas. They are fed upon the banks of the rivers on
                    the natural grass, or upon the arable farms on turnips, till they become fit for
                    slaughter. The number of Scotch cattle annually bought by the Norfolk farmers is
                    estimated to vary from 15,000 to 20,000. The original sheep of Norfolk were a
                    very hardy race, with horns, black feet, and black noses, the fleece yielding
                    about two pounds of wool of third-rate fineness, and the quarters weighing, when
                    fattened, about eighteen pounds. They were well calculated for the land when it
                    was less highly cultivated than at present, as they were good travellers, and
                    ate the herbage very close; but as the improved systems of husbandry have been
                    extended, this native breed has sometimes been crossed by others, and in many
                    instances has given place to the South Down sheep. The increase of arable farms
                    has diminished the dairies, and consequently the pigs which were reared from
                    them; and the practice of fattening bogs for bacon is scarcely known.</p>
                <p>The poultry of Norfolk has been long celebrated, and vast quantities of it are
                    conveyed to the London markets. The turkeys are most highly prized, from their
                    superior delicacy of flavour. The dry nature of the soil is deemed peculiarly
                    favourable to the rearing of these birds; and the numbers which are sent from
                    Norfolk to other districts amount to hundreds of thousands. No part of England
                    is so abundantly stocked with game, especially pheasants and partridges, as
                    Norfolk. They are sedulously preserved by the landlords, and generally reserved
                    in the leases, so that they have obtained the character of property, and are
                    commonly respected as such by adjoining proprietors of estates. Great numbers of
                    rabbits are bred on extensive warrens in many parts of the county, both for the
                    sake of the flesh and of the wool.</p>
                <p>Norfolk has long been and still continues to be an extensive manufacturing
                    county. The Flemings first settled here as early as the year 1336, and made
                    woollen goods at the village of Worstead; hence the name of that place was
                    applied to the thread made of the longer kinds of wool. Under the persecutions
                    of the Duke of Alva in Flanders, many more natives of that country found refuge
                    in and near the city of Norwich. The fabrics have indeed successively changed
                    with the change of fashions and the fluctuations of markets, but the
                    manufactures have been continued through many vicissitudes to the present time.
                    The chief goods now manufactured are bombazeens, camblets for the markets of
                    China, and shawls of various and elegant kinds, principally for home
                    consumption. This last article, introduced when the demand for stuffs from Spain
                    ceased, has been highly beneficial to the city of Norwich and its vicinity. The
                    introduction of machinery in the northern counties had destroyed tht&gt; habit
                    of spinning, which, a few years ago, universally prevailed amongst all the
                    females of the peasants’ families in this and the adjoining counties. Besides
                    the manufactories of Norwich and its vicinity, some inferior kinds of bone-lace
                    are made in Diss, and some other parts of the county; but the quantity produced
                    is slowly and gradually diminishing.</p>
                <p>Scarcely any of the goods manufactured in this county are sent directly to
                    foreign markets, those destined for distant countries being almost wholly
                    exported from London. The commerce is notwithstanding very extensive, from the
                    two ports of Yarmouth and Lynn. Yarmouth, in regard to the number of its ships,
                    is the eighth port in the kingdom, having more than 300 registered vessels. It
                    is well situated for trade, and has one of the finest quays in Europe; but the
                    depth of water is not sufficient for ships of great draft, and the bar at the
                    mouth of the harbour is a serious impediment. The great support of the shipping
                    of Yarmouth is the herring fishery. These fish are caught by the Yarmouth men,
                    in the months of June and July, on the shores and in the lochs of Scotland, and
                    at a later period on their own coasts. They are first cleaned, and then slightly
                    salted; after which they are hung up in large appropriate houses, where, by the
                    application of the smoke of wood fires, the preparation of curing them is
                    completed. This fishery usually yields from 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of red
                    herrings, each barrel containing about 1000 fish. This branch of industry,
                    besides the employment of the seamen, gives occupation to several thousand
                    artificers of various kinds. Besides this fishery, the exports of Yarmouth, as
                    well as Lynn, and the smaller ports of wells, Blackney, Burnham, and Clay,
                    afford great employment to shipping, by the surplus quantity of corn which the
                    county produces and sends to London and other ports. The imports at these towns
                    consist of timber, hemp, wine, spirits, and foreign fruit; which, by means of
                    the navigable rivers, are forwarded to the interior adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>The rivers are sufficiently easy of navigation to render canals unnecessary, and
                    there are consequently none in the county, though several have been commenced,
                    and, after languishing some time, have been abandoned without being completed.
                    The Great Ouse is a navigable river, which rises in Northamptonshire, enters
                    this county at Downham, and empties itself into the sea near Lynn. It has a
                    great rise of tide, and is navigable for barges twenty-four miles from its
                    mouth, and for boats as far as Bedford; thus affording water communication with
                    seven of the midland counties. The Little Ouse rises in the southern part of
                    this county; at Thetford it receives the small river Thet, and from thence is
                    navigable to its junction with the Great Ouse, on the borders of Cambridgeshire.
                    The Waveney rises within nine or ten feet of the source of the Little Ouse, and
                    takes a directly opposite course. It has many sinuosities, as its name denotes,
                    becomes navigable at Bun <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560063"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0063-0246"/>gay, receives the Yare at Burgh, and empties
                    itself into the sea at Yarmouth. The Bure rises near Aylsham, and after joining
                    the Thone near North Walsham, becomes navigable for boats. It falls into the
                    Yare previously to its meeting the sea. The Yare rises near Attleburgh, becomes
                    navigable at Norwich, and, after receiving the waters of the Tass and the
                    Wensum, merges in the Waveney. Recently a communication directly from Norwich to
                    the sea has been formed by a canal to Lowestoff. The Nar rises near Litcham, and
                    has a short course to the sea at Lynn, whence it is navigable upwards to
                    Narborough, a distance of fifteen miles.</p>
                <p>The whole of the county is within the diocese of Norwich, the bishop of which see
                    has his palace and cathedral in that city. The titles derived from the county
                    are that of duke to the family of Howard; Earl of Norwich to the Scotch Duke of
                    Gordon, and of Yarmouth to the Marquis of Hertford, Marquis and Viscount
                    Townsend; Viscount Thetford to the Duke of Grafton; Barons Walsingham,
                    Calthorpe, Wodehouse, Hobart, Walpole, and Nelson. ’Norfolk, under the reform
                    act, was divided into two portions, each returning two members. The election for
                    the eastern division is held at Swaffham, and the polling places are Downham,
                    East Deerham, Fakenham, Lynn Regis, Swaffham, and Thetford. The election for the
                    western division is held at Norwich, and the polling places are that city and
                    the towns of Long Stratton, North Walsham, Reepham, and Yarmouth. Besides the
                    four members for the county, the following places return two each, viz. Norwich,
                    Yarmouth, Thetford, and Lynn Regis. Castle Rising, which before the change
                    returned two members, has been disfranchised.</p>
                <p>This county contains few Roman antiquities, but some of Saxon date are to be seen
                    in the cathedral, the episcopal palace, the gates of Yarmouth and Lynn, and in
                    several piles of ruins of ecclesiastical edifices, as well as in some of the
                    parish churches. Amongst many distinguished natives of this county, the most
                    celebrated have been Anne Boleyn, Dr Samuel Clarke, Sir Edward Coke, Archbishops
                    Herring and Parker, Lord Nelson, Richard Porson, Sir Robert Walpole, and the
                    Right Honourable William Windham.</p>
                <p>In so large a county we may naturally expect to find many seats of noblemen and
                    gentlemen. It would far exceed the limits which the nature of this work
                    prescribes, to enumerate one half of them; but the most remarkable are the
                    following :—Bickling, Lord Suffield; Binlcy Hall, Earl of Rosebery; Bracon Ash,
                    T. F. Berney, Esq.; Buckenham House, Lord Petre; Costessey Hall, Sir William
                    Jerningham; Felbrigg, Captain Lukin; Hading, Sir John Sebright; Hethel Hall, Sir
                    Thomas Beevor; Hillington Park, Sir Martin Folkes; Houghton Hall, the Marquis of
                    Cholmondeley; Intwood Hall, Earl of Buckinghamshire; Gunton, Lord Suffield;
                    Kimberley Hall, Lord Wodehouse; Kirby Bedon, Sir John Berney; Melton Constable,
                    Sir J. H. Astley; Quiddenham, Earl of Albemarle; Rainham Hall, Marquis of
                    Townsend; Warcham, Sir Μ. B. Folkes; Wolterton Hall, Earl of Orford; Oxburgh
                    Hall, Sir Richard Boddingfield.</p>
                <p>The towns having a population exceeding 1500 inhabitants are the following:—</p>

                    >of</hi> the town is not pleasant, being low, and in some places marshy. The
                    streets are crooked and irregular, and neither the public nor the private
                    buildings are remarkable for elegance. Of the former there are above twenty,
                    including places of public worship for Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists,
                    Roman Catholics, and Methodists. The Farmer’s Bank, the Orphan Asylum, and the
                    Lancasterian School, are amongst the most conspicuous structures in Norfolk. It
                    has a spacious and commodious harbour, nearly a mile in width, defended by three
                    forts: Fort Norfolk on the north-east side of Elizabeth River, about a mile
                    below the town; Fort Nelson on the south-west side of the river, a little higher
                    than the former; and a large and strong fort upon Craney Island, five miles
                    below the town. Norfolk has more shipping and maritime commerce than any other
                    town in the state. On Washington Point, between the eastern and western branches
                    of the river, there is a marine hospital, a handsome brick edifice. Near this
                    town, also, there is an United States navy’yard. The population of Norfolk
                    amounted in 1820 to 8478, and in 1830 to 9816. Long. 76. 10. W. Lat. 36. 52.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Norfolk Island,</hi> in the Southern Pacific Ocean, is
                    fifteen miles in circumference. It was discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook, who
                    found it uninhabited. It has a remarkably fruitful soil; the whole country is
                    clothed with verdure, and presents a scene of most exuberant fertility. It is
                    described by Turnbull, who visited it in 1801, as being so uniformly fertile,
                    that, with the exception of the mountains overhanging the sea, it would be
                    difficult to find one spot less fertile than another. This island was colonized
                    shortly after that of Port Jackson, by Governor Philips, who sent thither the
                    more profligate division of the colonists; and the most abandoned convicts were
                    afterwards sent to the same place. One great objection to the island as a
                    colonial settlement is the difficulty of approaching it, in consequence of the
                    mountainous sea which constantly beats on its rocky shores, so that ships from
                    Port Jackson have often been obliged to beat off and on for upwards of a month,
                    and found themselves still as distant as ever from all communication with the
                    shore. This circumstance; and the want of any harbour or roadstead for shipping,
                    is much against the island; and hence, in 1805, it was found necessary to remove
                    the colonists and, convicts either to Port Dalrymple or to the river Derwent.
                    The population amounts to 1000. Long. 168. 10. E. Lat. 29.3. S.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Norfolk Sound,</hi> according to the account of Captain
                    Dixon, is situated in 57. 3. north latitude, and 135. 36. west longitude. It is
                    a very extensive place, but how far it stretches to the northward is not
                    known.</p>
