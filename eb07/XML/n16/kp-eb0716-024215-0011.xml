                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NORD</label>, a department of France, and, as its name
                    denotes, the most northern of the kingdom. It has been formed out of French
                    Flanders, French Hennegau, and the Cambresis, extending in north latitude from
                    49. 58. to 51. 5, and in east longitude from 2. 1. to 3. 9. Its surface is 2406
                    square miles, or 581,500 hectares, in extent. It is a level plain, with few
                    elevations; and only one of them, the hill on which Cassel stands, attains the
                    height of 400 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is generally moist and
                    heavy, but, owing to good cultivation, is highly fertile, except on some sandy
                    moors on the sea-shore near Dunkirk. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description Topographique et Statistique,</hi> the land under the plough
                    amounts to 326,430 hectares, the meadows to 138,428, the woodland to 62,129, the
                    morass and other uncultivated fields to 15,000; and the remainder is occupied by
                    rivers, roads, gardens, and the sites of cities, towns, and villages. In no
                    other part of France is agriculture practised with so much skill and assiduity
                    as in this department. The fields, by good ploughing and abundance of manure,
                    yield crops constantly without fallowing; and corn is almost generally followed
                    by green crops, which, especially the clover, is only to be matched in the
                    province of Flanders, in the Netherlands. Abundance of wheat, winter and summer
                    barley, oats, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560024" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0024-0243"
                    /><hi rend="superscript">;</hi> and the several kinds of pulse, are produced;
                    and although the land is not quite two English acres to each individual of the
                    population, the produce is more than sufficient for their consumption, and much
                    of it is exported.</p>
                <p>The department is watered by numerous streams, the greater part of which are
                    emptied into the Scheldt, which enters from the department of the Aisne, and,
                    after a course of about forty-five miles, passes through the Netherlands to the
                    sea. Some few of the rivers fall directly into the sea, and others reach it by
                    the Sambre and the Meuse. There are several canals, used either for navigation
                    or for the purpose of irrigation. The inhabitants of the department amount to
                    about 900,000, who, besides the employment connected with agriculture, are
                    occupied in the fisheries, and in manufactures. The sea-fishing consists in the
                    taking of herrings, cod, turbot, and others, and is extended also to the
                    Greenland whale-fishery; whilst that on the rivers and canals furnishes a large
                    portion of food. The chief manufacture is that of linen, including cambrics,
                    damask table-linen, lawns, and thread-lace. This is said to employ 40,000 looms,
                    and to furnish occupation for more than 160,000 persons in spinning. Some
                    woollen and cotton goods are also made, as well as hats, hosiery, and leather.
                    There are likewise many oil-mills, breweries, and distilleries of corn-spirits.
                    The chief trade is carried on at Lush, but there are also extensive works at
                    Douay, Cambray, Dunkirk, and Valenciennes. This department belongs
                    ecclesiastically to the bishopric of Cambray. The chief court of law is held at
                    Douay; and the department elects eight deputies to the legislative body. The
                    religion is that of the Roman Catholic church, though there are a few
                    Protestants, who support three chapels or churches for their worship.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nord,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cotes du,</hi> a department of
                    France, formed out of a part of the ancient province of Bretagne, and extending
                    in north latitude from 48. 16. to 48. 56. and in west longitude from 2. 12. to
                    3.49. It is bounded on the north by the sea, on the east by the department of
                    Ille Vilaine, on the south by that of Morbihan, and on the west by Finisterre.
                    It is 3022 square miles, or 736,720 hectares, in extent, and contains five
                    arrondissements, forty-seven cantons, and 376 communes, with a population of
                    540,000 persons. It is a level plain, interspersed with a few gentle elevations.
                    The shore is covered with rocks and small islands, and encircled by a belt of
                    sandy soil, but intermixed with a few rich meadows near the rivers. The streams
                    are all of but short course, and only navigable at the time of high'tides. The
                    climate is temperate, but moist and changeable. Agriculture is in a backward
                    state, as is the civilization of the inhabitants, who speak for the most part a
                    kind of Welsh, and live mostly in small villages or little farms; but,by
                    subsisting chiefly on bread made of oats or buck-wheat, they furnish grain
                    sufficient for their own consumption, and produce, besides, hemp and flax, which
                    are converted into wearing apparel in their own houses, or made into sail-cloth
                    and other articles. The fisheries give employment to some of the inhabitants;
                    and iron mines, of which there are a few, furnish occupation to others. Much
                    honey and bees’ wax is obtained from the department. It sends four deputies to
                    the legislative chamber.</p>
