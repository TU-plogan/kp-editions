                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">XENOPHON</label>, an illustrious philosopher, commander, and
                    historian, was the son of Gryllus, an Athenian, and is supposed to have been
                    born in the fourth year of the eighty-third Olympiad, 445 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi> When he was a youth, Socrates, struck with his personal appearance,
                    determined to admit him into the number of his pupils. Meeting him by accident
                    in a narrow passage, the philosopher put his staff across the path, and stopping
                    him, asked where those things were to be purchased which are necessary to human
                    life? Xenophon appearing at a loss for a reply to this unexpected salutation,
                    Socrates proceeded to ask him where honest and good men were to be found?
                    Xenophon still hesitating, Socrates said to him, “Follow me, and learn.” From
                    that time Xenophon became a disciple of Socrates, and made a rapid progress in
                    that moral wisdom for which his master was so eminent. Xenophon accompanied
                    Socrates in the Peloponnesian war, and fought courageously in defence of his
                    country. He afterwards entered into the army of Cyrus as a volunteer in his
                    expedition against his brother. This enterprise proving unfortunate, Xenophon,
                    after the death of Cyrus, advised his fellow-soldiers to attempt a retreat into
                    Greece. They listened to his advice; and having had many proofs of his wisdom as
                    well as courage, they gave him the command of the army, after the death of their
                    generals. In this command he acquired great glory by the prudence and firmness
                    with which he conducted them back, through the midst of innumerable dangers,
                    into their own country. The particulars of this memorable service are related by
                    Xenophon himself in his Anabasis, frequently called the Retreat of the ten
                    Thousand. After his return into Greece, he joined Agesilaus, king of Sparta, and
                    fought with him against the Thebans in the celebrated battle of Chaeronea. The
                    Athenians, displeased at this alliance, brought a public accusation against him
                    for his former conduct in engaging in the service of Cyrus, and condemned him to
                    exile. The Spartans upon this took Xenophon, as an injured man, under their
                    protection, and provided him a comfortable retreat at Scillus. Here, with his
                    wife and two children, he remained several years, and passed his time in the
                    society of his friends, and in writing those historical works which have
                    rendered his name immortal. A war at length arose between the Spartans and
                    Eleans; and Xenophon was obliged to retire to Lepreum, where his sons had taken
                    refuge. He afterwards removed, with his whole family, to Corinth, where he is
                    supposed to have died, about the age of ninety; but the chronology of his life
                    is involved in obscurities from which it cannot easily be extricated.</p>
                <p>Of the works of Xenophon there are many editions. The <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> was printed by Junta, Florent. 1516, fol. An edition more correct,
                    and containing some works omitted in the first, issued from the press of Aldus,
                    Venet. 1525, fol. After several intervening impressions appeared that of H.
                    Stephanus, 156), fol. Another important edition, several times reprinted, was
                    that of Leunclavius, Basil. 1569, fol. After a long interval, this was followed
                    by the edition of Wells, Oxon. 1703, 5 tom. 8vo. The editor, who is not
                    commended for his fidelity, has added Dodwell’s <hi rend="italic">Chronologia
                    Xenophontea.</hi> This edition of Dr Wells was republished with considerable
                    improvements by Thieme, Lipsiae, 1763-4, 4 tom. 8vo. A valuable edition with a
                    commentary was afterwards published by Weiske, Lips. 1798-1804, 6 tom. 8vo. We
                    shall only mention another edition, that of J. G. Schneider, Lips. 1815, 6 tom.
                    8vo. A very useful accompaniment of any edition must not be overlooked, namely
                    Sturz’s <hi rend="italic">Lexico Xenophonteum.</hi> Lips. 1801-4, 4 tom. 8vo.
                    The materials had partly been collected by Thieme. Of several works of Xenophon
                    there are many separate editions, some of them very elaborate. Several of them
                    have likewise been translated into many different languages. Gail published
                    “Oeuvres complètes de Xénophon, traduites en Français, accompagnées du texte, de
                    la version Latine, et de notes critiques.” Paris, 1797- 1804, 6 tom. 4to. A
                    supplementary volume, in three parts, containing various appendages, was
                    subsequently published. The French version is not entirely new. The translations
                    of the Cyropaedia, Anabasis, and Memorabilia, by Dacier, Larcher, and Leveque,
                    have been adopted with some slight modifications. Some of his works have been
                    repeatedly translated into English; but we shall only specify the version of the
                    Cyropaedia by the Hon. Maurice Ashley Cooper, of the Anabasis by Edward Spelman,
                    of the Memorabilia by Sarah Fielding, of the Symposium by Dr Wellwood, and of
                    the History by Dr Smith, dean of Chester.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Χενορηον,</hi> a native of Ephesus, is supposed to have
                    written towards the close of the second century. His romance, “De Anthia et
                    Habrocome Ephesiacorum libri v.” was first edited by Cocchi, Lond. 1726, 4to. An
                    Italian translation had previously been published by Salvini, Lond. 1723, 8vo.
                    The original work appears in the collection of Mitscherlich, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptores Erotici Gravi.</hi> Biponti, 1792-4, 3 tom. 8vo. It was about the
                    same time edited by Polyzoes, Viennae Aust. 1793, 8vo. A much better edition was
                    soon afterwards published by Baron Locella, Vien. Aust. 1796, 4to. Another
                    edition, regarded as the best, was published by Peerlkamp, Harlemi, 1818, 4to.
                    This romance of Xenophon the Ephesian has repeatedly been translated into French
                    and German, as well as Italian; and an English version was published by Rooke,
                    Lond. 1727, 8vo.</p>
