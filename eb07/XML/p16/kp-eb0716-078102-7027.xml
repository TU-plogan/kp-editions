                    account of this hitherto imperfectly described portion of America, from the
                    following circumstance. In November 1827, Mr Lloyd, who had served for some time
                    previously on General Bolivar’s personal staff, received from him a special
                    commission to survey the isthmus of Panama, in order to ascertain the most
                    eligible line of communication across it, whether by road or canal. The notes
                    which he made on this occasion have been published in the first volume of the
                    Journal of the Royal Geographical Society; and from the article containing these
                    our account is principally derived. The result of his operations, in so far as
                    they regarded the level of the respective seas, and the elevation of the
                    intervening isthnfus, will be found detailed at length in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1830, p. 59.</p></note> The isthmus of Panama may be considered
                    as extending from the meridian of 77° to that of 81° west of Greenwich. Its
                    breadth at the narrowest, which is opposite the city of Panama, is not less than
                    thirty miles; and it swells out at either extremity, where it becomes blended
                    with the continental portions of the western world. Its whole extent is not,
                    however, comprised within the limits of the province which bears the same name;
                    for to the north-east, the Mandingo Indians maintain a fierce, and not
                    unfrequently a turbulent independence, to the present day. The continuity of the
                    great chain of the Andes, which, for the most part, traverses the whole
                    continent of America, is twice broken within the limits above defined. The
                    Northern Cordillera exhibits the first indication of depression in the province
                    of Nicaragua; but it again elevates itself in the province of Veragua, where it
                    expands into a very fine table-land. In the eastern part of the province it
                    breaks into detached mountains of considerable elevation, and of the most abrupt
                    and rugged formation. Still farther to the east, innumerable conical mountains
                    make their appearance, only three or four hundred feet in height, and having
                    their bases skirted by plains and savannahs. These finally disappear, and the
                    country becomes almost uninterruptedly low and flat. Again the conical mountains
                    thicken, and becoming connected, form a small cordillera, which runs from about
                    opposite Portobello to the bay of Mandingo, where the second break occurs. The
                    land then continues low for a considerable distance, and abounds in rivers,
                    those on the north side flowing to the Gulf of Ura-ba or Darien, and those on
                    the south to that of St Miguel; beyond which point the cordillera again raises
                    itself on an extended scale, and enters South America. The general bearing of
                    the mountains in the vicinity of Panama is north-east and south-west. They vary
                    elsewhere, and appear to maintain some relation to the line of coast, although
                    they do not always run parallel to it. Their height is not considerable. Near
                    Panama they do not exceed 1000 or 1100 feet in elevation. East of Portobello,
                    however, they are considerably higher, and are generally covered with a dense
                    and almost impenetrable forest, which grows on a soil of great depth and
                    extraordinary fertility. Mr Webster, another traveller in this region, observes,
                    with regard to the mountains of the isthmus: “The mountains which I enumerated
                    were measured by us, and found to be less than 2000 feet high. The principal
                    ingredients of the hills are hornblende, jasper, hornstone, and trap-porphyry;
                    basalt, agate, and quartz rock. A crumbly arenaceous quartz rock prevails near
                    Chagres, containing iron, pyrites, and lead. The stones at Portobello have the
                    volcanic character; and the sand on the beach is of a black description, like
                    that of Fernando Noronha. The streets of Portobello are paved with basalt
                    nodules. Quartz rock is very abundant throughout the isthmus, in many varieties;
                    several beds of clay, boles, ochres, and fullers’ earth, are also to be found.”
                    Limestone is the prevailing rock, which is skirted on the south side with
                    indurated clay, and on the north with coral rock. The latter is impregnated with
                    a singular gelatinous matter, which imparts to it the property of firmly
                    adhering under water to whatever it comes in contact with. It is easily dug out
                    of the earth, but on exposure to the air it becomes very hard and close in the
                    texture. It thus forms an excellent building material, as does the indurated
                    clay. Besides limestone, flint, calcedony, jasper, and ironstone are found in
                    the interior; and near Gatun, on the river Chagres, there is a very fine
                    fire-stone of great utility in the construction of grates, furnaces, and other
                    things which require to stand a high degree of heat. In building materials of
                    all kinds, indeed, Panama is unusually rich; but in the precious metals it is
                    poor. In Panama proper only two mines are worked, Santa Rita and Pequeni, both
                    for gold; but their produce is insignificant. They are situated in the mountains
                    near Portobello. In Veragua and Choco, very pure gold is obtained in
                    considerable quantity by washing; copper and iron are abundant; and mercury and
                    tin are also said to have been found. But very little capital is embarked in the
                    respective works, and the total amount obtained, either by mining or by washing,
                    is comparatively small and uncertain from year to year.</p>
                <p>This province abounds in rivers, and in the rainy season every mile of land is
                    intersected by a flowing stream, which carries off the surplus water. These
                    disappear during the summer heats; but the following remain permanently, and are
                    considered by Mr Lloyd as worthy of particular description. On the northern side
                    of the isthmus, and consequently flowing into the Atlantic, are the Chagres,
                    Pequeni, Trinidad, and Gatun, which all unite and form one large river before
                    they reach the ocean; and on the south side, and falling into the Pacific, are
                    the Rio Grande, Caymito or Chorrero, Pacoro, Indio, and Ballana or Chepo. The
                    Chagres rises in the mountains which approach the Bay of Mandingo, a
                    considerable distance to the eastward of Portobello. After traversing a great
                    tract of country, when nearly opposite to Portobello it receives the Pequeni,
                    which comes from the south-east, and is of equal magnitude with itself. The
                    united streams form a noble river, but flowing so rapidly, and broken into so
                    many falls, as to render navigation very dangerous, even for canoes. Its
                    velocity abates as it approaches the sea; and at the town of Cruces, which is
                    twenty-three miles direct from the Atlantic, it seldom exceeds from three to
                    three miles and a half per hour, even in the rainy season. Still nearer to the
                    ocean, it rapidly decreases, so that in summer its current is scarcely
                    perceptible. “Few rivers of its size,” says Mr Lloyd, “present more beautiful
                    scenery on its banks than does the Chagres above Cruces. For miles together, it
                    is bounded by enormous, abrupt masses of limestone, of the most curious and
                    fantastic forms; in other parts savannahs extend to the very edge of the river,
                    covered with a particularly fine grass called grammallotti; and the noble bongo
                    tree is seen studding the banks, somewhat in the shape of a well-trimmed
                    yew-tree, but growing to a much larger size. In most places the river is shaded
                    from the sun’s rays by a large tree called jigeron, which extends its branches
                    across the river, its leaves being eagerly sought by the fish. The water
                    generally runs over a bed of variously coloured pebbles, and is in summer most
                    brilliantly clear. In many places near its source it is much wider than at its
                    mouth, occasionally breaking into distinct channels, and forming small islands;
                    but in the rainy season these are all connected, and constitute one broad
                    stream, with strong sets and eddies, caused by the abrupt turns, which render
                    its navigation peculiarly perilous.” The river Trinidad enters the Chagres about
                    twenty-four miles from its mouth, and is also a large river. It has its origin
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194567054" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7054-0783"/>very near the
                    south coast, not far from the town of Chorrera. Canoes of various descriptions
                    navigate this river as far as a large town called Capua, which lies south-west
                    of Chorrera, and bring down produce to Chagres. As high as Mr Lloyd went up,
                    which was not, however, as far as Capua, he found it about two hundred feet in
                    breadth, from twenty to twenty-eight feet in depth, and without falls or any
                    other impediment to easy navigation. The river Gatun is also of considerable
                    consequence, although neither very wide nor very deep. It rises in the mountains
                    east of Portobello; and crossing both the roads leading from that city to
                    Panama, joins the Chagres in front of the town of Gatun, about eight miles from
                    the sea. Some considerable lakes exist in the vicinity of its embouchure; and
                    although it is shallow and encumbered with trees during its course, it is very
                    useful as a shelter for shipping during tempestuous weather. With the united
                    assistance of all these rivers, the navigation of the Chagres below the junction
                    of the Trinidad is easy, and very superior to that of some streams of much
                    larger size. The depth below Gatun varies from twenty-six to thirty feet; above
                    that it is twenty-four, and nowhere falls permanently below twenty-two. The
                    banks are wooded to the very edges, and so precipitous that vessels can almost
                    everywhere be brought close to them. The Rio Grande rises to the north-west of
                    Panama, near a mountain called Pedro Miguel, and after receiving some
                    considerable tributaries, becomes navigable for large canoes two leagues above
                    its mouth, which is about two miles from the city of Panama. It is obstructed by
                    a bar, but the tide rising eighteen feet in spring floods, vessels readily enter
                    and find good anchorage within. In some places the Rio Grande very nearly
                    approaches the Obispo, one of the affluents of the Chagres; and much interest
                    was consequently at one time taken in the circumstance, from an idea that the
                    long-wished-for communication between the two oceans might thus be effected. The
                    shallowness of the stream, however, presents an insurmountable objection to this
                    plan. The Cavmito, or Chorrera, falls into the Pacific ten miles west of Panama,
                    and is formed by the union of numerous insignificant streams, which take their
                    rise in different parts of the western cordillera. The mouth of this river is
                    not obstructed by a bar, but the tide runs so strongly into and out of it, that
                    the anchorage for shipping is bad, and exposed. It is infested by a prodigious
                    number of alligators, and hence its name, Caymito. Before reaching the Pacific,
                    the Pacora and Indio unite, near the island of Chepillo, about eighteen miles
                    east of Panama, and form a broad, rapid, and winding stream for several leagues
                    above its mouth. On the banks of the Indio an English resident in Panama erected
                    a saw-mill, capable of sawing from fifteen to twenty thousand boards annually.
                    An inexhaustible supply of the finest timber is found in its immediate vicinity;
                    and so great is the fertility of the soil, that a small portion only, laboured
                    by two men, is sufficient to supply ample subsistence for the whole
                    establishment. The river Ballano or Chepo is of great extent, and, under the
                    name of Canada, rises in the province of Darien, near the source of another
                    river called Chucunaque, which falls into the Pacific in the Gulf of San Miguel.
                    The Bellano receives several streams during its course, which is nearly west,
                    and in some degree parallel to the coast for many miles, until it suddenly turns
                    to the southward, and enters the Pacific a few miles east of the Pacora. It is
                    navigable as far as this bend; and on its banks, a little higher up, is situated
                    the town of Chepo, which is of some consequence, as being the assigned place of
                    communication with the Mandingo Indians. Farther on is a fort called Fuerte
                    Terrible, built to prevent their incursions; and the line of the river generally
                    is considered the boundary.</p>
                <p>There are two seasons in Panama, namely, summer or the dry, and winter or the
                    rainy season. The former commences about the end of December, and lasts till
                    April; and the latter occupies the intervening months. The quantity of rain
                    which thus falls during the year is prodigious, but its amount varies at
                    different places. The clouds chiefly congregate over the wooded heights, in
                    consequence of a law of nature which universally prevails. At Portobello, which
                    is closely encircled by them, the rain descends in torrents, frequently
                    accompanied by storms of thunder and lightning, terrible and grand in the
                    highest degree. Where the ground, however, is level to any extent, and has been
                    cleared of its wood, a great difference is perceptible; and at Panama the
                    following alternations have been observed. “In April the weather becomes cloudy
                    about noon; but, after drizzling for half an hour, clears up. In May, from nine
                    to eleven, it is dull, with slight rain; the afternoons being still fine. In
                    June there is rain every morning and evening; but the mid-days are fair. As the
                    season advances the rain gradually increases, and is incessant throughout July,
                    August, September, and October. In November the nights are always wet and
                    cloudy, but throughout the days the sky begins to break. December brings a
                    further improvement; and in January, February, and March, a shower of rain is as
                    uncommon as a gleam of sunshine at the other season of the year.” One very
                    remarkable phenomenon occurs throughout the whole isthmus. On the 20th of June
                    the rain ceases for five or six days, when the sun shines forth with surpassing
                    splendour; nor is any instance known of irregularity in the recurrence of this
                    extraordinary phenomenon. It is accordingly reckoned on with great confidence by
                    the inhabitants, who call it El Veranito, or little summer, and celebrate the
                    occasion by a jubilee of rejoicing. The temperature and salubrity of the climate
                    also vary in different places. Portobello is one of the hottest and most
                    unhealthy places in the world. At Panama, on the contrary, the thermometer, in
                    the rainy season, does not rise higher at night than b2°, and in the day than
                    87° of Fahrenheit. The winds are variable and cool; and although the rain is
                    incessant, there is thus no stagnation in the atmosphere, and consequently no
                    epidemic sickness. In summer the temperature rises to 90°, and even as high as
                    93°; and during the day the reflection of the sun from the smooth surface of the
                    Pacific, with the heat of the winds, which blow steadily from the south-east,
                    over a tract of dry savannahs, makes it very sultry. But the land-winds, which
                    come chiefly from the neighbouring mountains at night, are cool, and the climate
                    may be pronounced generally healthy, although great mortality at times prevails.
                    It is believed, however, that this may be attributed to over-indulgence in the
                    use of some articles of diet, which are unusually abundant at certain seasons of
                    the year.</p>
                <p>It appears that a large proportion of the soil of the isthmus of Panama is
                    exceedingly fertile, and the vegetable productions are most luxuriant. In Mr
                    Lloyd’s opinion, it challenges competition with any other part of the world in
                    thevigour and variety of its woods. That gentleman gives a list of about a
                    hundred kinds of wood, of excellent or at least good quality, and which are
                    either unknown or little known in Europe. A number of these are very hard and
                    close grained; some resemble box, which must render them very valuable; and
                    others are similar to birch, beech, ash, elm, and those trees which are familiar
                    to us. There are also cotton trees, cedars, lignum-vitae, a bastard mahogany,
                    fustic, calabash, and so forth. The fruits and esculent vegetables found in the
                    isthmus are those of similar intra-tropical situations. The grains cultivated
                    are rice and Indian corn. The sugar-cane is grown, but not extensively. Coffee
                    and cocoa are cultivated as required for home consumption. The milk-tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(polo de</hi><hi rend="italic">vacca),</hi> vanilla plant, and
                    caoutchouc tree, are all abundant in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194567067"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7067-0784"/>woods. With the gum which flows from the
                    last-named production, while it is yet in a liquid state, the inhabitants
                    manufacture a sort of water-proof cloth, on the same principle as in this
                    country; but which, thus prepared, is more uniform in its texture, and never
                    cracks. The charcoal made from many of the trees is considered as excellent for
                    smelting; and as such is exported to Peru, where it is in much request. Indeed,
                    from the hardness of much of the wood, the excellence of the charcoal made from
                    it was to be inferred. The barks of some of the trees are medicinal, or abound
                    in tannin. Ink is made both from gall-nuts and from a bush resembling the caper,
                    called alsifax. Other trees yield very rich and brilliant dyes used by the
                    Indians, but, Mr Lloyd believes, as yet unknown in commerce. Many valuable
                    resins are obtained, particularly one distilled from the bark of a tree called
                    palo santo, or holy tree, which is highly fragrant, and is used not only as a
                    remedy for disorders, but is burned as incense. The styrax officinalis of
                    Linnaeus is very abundant, the gum extracted from it selling for two dollars a
                    pound.</p>
                <p>The wild animals of the woods are tigers, or rather tiger-cats, which are seldom
                    larger than small Newfoundland dogs; lions, at least so an animal resembling the
                    king of the forest is called; bears; racoons; sajinos, a species of wild boar
                    found in droves; wild hogs in herds; conejos, something like our rabbits, but
                    larger; deer in abundance on the borders of the woods; multitudes of monkeys of
                    various species; together with wild turkeys, both black and coloured; birds
                    resembling our hen-pheasants; pigeons, ducks, and other game, all excellent for
                    food. The most formidable animals are the wild dogs, which, when together in
                    droves, and fired upon, will readily attack one or two men. The tiger does not
                    attack the human species, but preys upon the smaller animals. On the banks of
                    the Pacora, at its mouth, a wild animal is found called macho, or danta, nearly
                    of the size and appearance of a jackass, which, prepared, is considered a great
                    dainty. The isthmus enjoys a bad celebrity for snakes and poisonous reptiles;
                    but the observations of Mr Lloyd do not go to confirm this report. The country
                    people, however, stand in great awe of them, and will seldom move abroad after
                    nightfall, lest they should encounter them. They even go so far as to wear
                    charms round their necks for the protection of their persons. A great pest in
                    the country are what are called ganapatas, or ticks, which, in half an hour’s
                    walk in summer, will completely cover the person, and are with difficulty
                    loosened from their hold. There are other smaller insects, very numerous and
                    annoying, amongst which mosquitos are in the usual abundance. Fire-flies are
                    common, and very brilliant; with many other insects, which Mr Lloyd apprehends
                    have not yet found their way into entomological catalogues. Amongst the domestic
                    animals, and those chiefly used for food, are oxen for draught and slaughter,
                    horses, mules, goats, pigs, fowls, and fish. The breed of cattle is of a good
                    size; and the draught-oxen, when well broken, fetch from twenty-five to thirty
                    dollars each. The best of those for slaughter may be bought at from twelve to
                    eighteen dollars each. The race of horses is small, but hardy, and their price
                    varies from fifteen to forty dollars. Mules are the animals most prized in the
                    country; for, as is well known, no other animal is ridden in mountainous
                    districts. Their price sometimes reaches as high as 120 dollars; but they can be
                    obtained for less money. Goats are not so plentiful as might have been expected;
                    but as they are in great request in the West Indies, it is to be inferred that
                    they are exported there whenever they attain the proper size, so that
                    comparatively few on an average remain at Panama. Pigs are few, and of most
                    exorbitant value. When of a good size, and well fattened, they fetch from thirty
                    to thirty-five dollars each. Fish and fowl are plentiful, cheap, and much used;
                    and in Panama market hundreds of young sharks, of the kind denominated
                    shovelnosed, and from one to two feet and a half long, are daily sold for food.
                    The guana is considered an especial dainty, as are pearl oysters, and many
                    varieties of game, which are brought in from the woods. Even the monkey tribes
                    are eaten, especially in the country bivouacs, although they are seldom offered
                    for sale in the town markets. The chief articles of farinaceous food are maize
                    and rice; yet the home growth of either &gt;seems to be rather limited for so
                    fine a region. The greater part of the sugar used in the isthmus is imported in
                    skins from Central America, or from the valley of Cauca, by way of Buenaventura,
                    on the Choco coast, and is consequently very dear. The home produce is chiefly
                    miel or molasses, and raspadura or pansugar, which the inhabitants prefer to the
                    finer preparations of the article. Great quantities of wild honey are gathered
                    in the woods, the bees collecting which do not sting, and are thus robbed
                    without precaution.</p>
                <p>The communication across the isthmus is maintained chiefly by two lines of road;
                    one from Panama to Portobello, and another equally from Panama, by way of
                    Cruces, to Gorgona, down the Chagres, to the seaport of the same name at its
                    mouth. There are some others in use, but little known, and under the Spaniards
                    their improvement and multiplication were much discouraged. Mr Lloyd strongly
                    recommends a new line to be formed, differing from them all, and beginning on
                    the Atlantic at a fine bay called Limon or Navy Bay, about five leagues east
                    from Chagres. From this he proposes it should proceed to the river Chagres, some
                    miles above its mouth, where its course approaches this bay by a canal; thence
                    up the river to a favourable situation on the south bank of the Trinidad, where
                    its shores are excellently suited for being converted into wharfs and landing
                    places, both for goods and cattle; and thence finally to Panama or Chorrera by a
                    railroad, the latter being the shorter distance, but the former the preferable
                    route, both as conducting to a better seaport, and as terminating in Panama, the
                    capital and the centre of trade. Mr Lloyd’s reasons for suggesting this
                    innovation will be found detailed at length in the article to which we have
                    already referred. The present roads are exceedingly bad, and they traverse a
                    mountainous part of the country. That between Panama and Portobello is in this
                    respect greatly the worse of the two, being in many places almost impassable in
                    the rainy season, from the steepness of the ascents and descents. But the roads
                    to Cruces and Gorgona also lead across a mountainous country, and are extremely
                    difficult in bad weather; a considerable part of the latter, indeed, being
                    merely the bed of what is in winter a large stream.</p>
                <p>The isthmus of Panama is divided into two provinces, viz. Panama which includes
                    the Darien, and Veragua. These again are divided into cantons, having a certain
                    number of parishes in each. According to a census taken in 1822, the latest
                    which we have been able to obtain, the following was the state <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the population in the two provinces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Province of Panama.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The canton of
                    Panama, which comprehended eight parishes besides the capital, contained 16,724
                    souls; the canton of Chorrera, containing four parishes and the capital
                    Chorrera, 7411 souls; the canton ofLos Santos, containing eight parishes and the
                    capital Los Santos, 21,348 souls; the canton of Nata, containing four parishes
                    and the capital, 17,108 souls; the canton of Portobello, containing four
                    parishes and the capital, 2425 souls; and the canton of Darien, containing seven
                    parishes and the capital Tavisa, 1172 souls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Province of Veragua.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The canton of
                    Santiago, containing six parishes and the capital, 14,170 souls; the canton of
                    Remedios, containing three parishes and the capital, 5010 souls; the canton de
                    la Mesa, containing three parishes<pb break="no" facs="nls:194567080"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7080-0785"/> and the capital, 8722 souls; and the canton of
                    Alange, containing six parishes and the capital, 7465 souls. The summary of the
                    province of Panama gives the total number of inhabitants as 66,188, and that of
                    Veragua as 35,367. The total population of the whole isthmus was 101,550 in the
                    year 1822, nor has it altered to any great extent since. Most of these cantons,
                    with the exception of Portobello and Darien, which are almost uncultivated, are
                    alike in their resources; but distinct reports of the produce of each were not
                    obtained by Mr Lloyd. The population is distributed into white and coloured; and
                    most of the descendants of mestizoes, and even mulattoes, are considered as
                    white, provided they be in easy circumstances. Wealth is here a powerful charm
                    in dissolving caste. One person in every five has a house, or, in other words,
                    the average 'number in a family is five. From the excess of births above .deaths
                    in one of the cantons, that of Los Santos, it appears that the rate of increase
                    is one and a half per cent., which is low when compared with that of the United
                    States, for instance, where the increase exceeds three and approaches four per
                    cent. Of the houses, almost a half are marked as belonging to the country,
                    which. indicates at once security and the prevalence of agricultural
                    occupations. Mr Lloyd thinks that the canton of Los Santos may be taken as a
                    fair specimen of the others; with the exceptions already stated, and also that
                    of Panama, the presence of the capital and the emporium of trade giving a
                    preponderance in its favour. In general, however, the western and central
                    districts, with the islands in the Bay of Panama, are the best cultivated and
                    most populous, Los Santos being one of them. Elsewhere the landlords keep their
                    estates chiefly in grass, to save trouble; and the population is nowhere
                    industrious, although strong and enduring under occasional fatigue. The extreme
                    fertility of the soil is one of the main causes of the general indolence; for
                    with a small expenditure of labour, a man can procure a respectable subsistence
                    for himself and family. They are, however, quite susceptible of steadily
                    practising habits of industry when the stimulus employed is powerful enough to
                    call forth their energies. “There are within the province,” Mr Lloyd observes,
                    “several regiments of militia, formed of the lower classes of people and
                    Indians, excellent workmen in felling timber and clearing ground, and
                    particularly apt in acquiring any mechanical art.” They are exceedingly simple
                    in their habits, and are easily maintained, so that, in the projected
                    communication between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, workmen will be obtained
                    at a cheap rate; a circumstance of very great importance to the success of the
                    undertaking.</p>
                <p>The capital of the isthmus is Panama, the site of which has been once changed.
                    The old city stood about three miles east from the present situation; and, on
                    the first arrival of the Spaniards in 1515, it was occupied by an Indian
                    population, who were attracted to the spot on account of the vast abundance of
                    fish on the coast, and gave the name of Panama to their place of residence, that
                    word in their language signifying “much fish.” The natives, however, were
                    speedily dispossessed by their ruthless invaders; and, as early as the year
                    1521, the title and privileges of a city were conferred on the Spanish town by
                    the Emperor Charles V. In the year 1670, old Panama was reduced to a heap of
                    ruins by the pirate Morgan; and it was after this catastrophe that the city was
                    built on the spot where it now stands. Panama is situated in latitude 8.57.
                    north, and longitude 79.30. west from Greenwich, on a rocky tongue of land
                    shaped nearly like a spear-head, extending a considerable way into the sea. Its
                    harbour is protected by a number of islands lying at a little distance from the
                    mainland, and some of which are of considerable size, and highly cultivated.
                    These spots upon the sea, scattered around the Bay of Panama, are the gardens of
                    the town, and afford a plentiful supply of fruit and vegetables. There is good ’
                    anchorage under the lee of all of them; and, besides the productions of the
                    soil, good water can be obtained from nearly the whole of them. The plan of the
                    city is somewhat irregular; but the principal streets extend across the
                    peninsula, which allows a current of air freely to circulate; and the rules for
                    cleanliness are here more strictly observed than is usual in Spanish American
                    towns. The fortifications which encircle the town are neither regular nor
                    strong, although the walls are high, and the bastions have been constructed from
                    time to time, as circumstances required that the place should be protected. The
                    buildings are of stone, and generally most substantial, those of a large size
                    having patios or courts. They are constructed in the old Spanish style. Amongst
                    edifices of a public nature may be mentioned a beautiful cathedral, four
                    convents, now nearly or altogether deserted, a nunnery, a college de la
                    Compania, and also the walls of another, which was begun on a magnificent scale,
                    but was never finished, and is now crumbling to ruins. Immediately around
                    Panama, eastward along the coast, and north-westward from it, the land is low
                    and flat; but westward and north-eastward, the mountains approach it closely;
                    and, from a hill in the vicinity, about six hundred feet in height, a view may
                    be obtained of the sea with its islands, and the country with its forest-mantled
                    mountains, and its green savannahs. The beach is fringed with plantain and
                    banana trees, growing amongst oranges, figs, and limes, and numberless rich
                    shrubs, shaded by the tamarind, which crowns them all, except the cocoa-nut,
                    with its feathery top and naked stem. Panama is celebrated for its gold chains,
                    in the manufacture of which the natives are remarkably expert. The hat which
                    goes by the name of this city, and is a favourite head-dress in the country, is
                    brought from Guayaquil, and costs from two to twenty dollars. This city enjoyed
                    a long period of prosperity; but it has materially declined since America cast
                    off the Spanish yoke. Yet it possesses advantages in regard to situation which
                    may yet be turned to great commercial account; and Panama may still be restored
                    to more than its former opulence and splendour. The population amounts to nearly
                    11,000.</p>
                <p>Portobello is situated in latitude 9. 34. 35. north, and longitude 77. 45. west,
                    close to the sea, at the foot of immense mountains, which surround the whole of
                    the port. It consists of one long street, which environs the bay, and from it
                    smaller ones branch off where the ground renders this practicable. There are,
                    besides, two squares, one in front of the treasury, which is built of stone; and
                    another formed on one side by the church, which is also of stone, and a
                    capacious edifice, considering the smallness of the population. It has been
                    allowed, however, to fall into ruin; and the same may be said of all the public
                    and most of the private buildings. The hospital, and even the fortifications,
                    are dilapidated; and of the houses in town only a few remain tenantable.
                    Portobello has an unhappy notoriety for the insalubrity of its climate, and has
                    acquired the title of the Sepulchre of Europeans. The heat is most oppressive,
                    and the town being closely environed by mountains, the freshness of the
                    sea-breezes is never felt. Immense forests also cover the mountains, and the
                    denseness of their foliage excluding the sun’s rays, the earth remains moist,
                    and a thick unhealthy vapour is continually exhaling, which collecting in
                    clouds, covers the town like a pall, and keeps up an almost perpetual rain. Not
                    only the human species, but even the lower animals, degenerate, and cease to
                    produce in this Golgotha; so that not a cattle-estate is to be found in its
                    vicinity, all the meat consumed being brought from Panama. The mountains and
                    forests, which abound with animals of various kinds, extend to the very
                    foundations of the houses, so that it is no uncommon thing to find wild hogs and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194567093" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7093-0786"/>small tigers
                    usurping the abodes of man. Toads of a largé size are also so abundant, that
                    after a night of rain they cover the streets like a living pavement, and it is
                    impossible to walk without crushing them. The population is now extremely
                    limited, about eleven hundred; the greater part being negroes and mulattoes,
                    with a few old Spaniards, tenacious of their property, and who are rapidly dying
                    out. Occasionally a few visitors from Panama arrive with goods, which they
                    dispose of at an exorbitant rate; and a small detachment of troops is sent from
                    the capital to do duty for a short time.</p>
                <p>Chagres is a miserable place, about thirty-two miles west from Portobello. It is
                    situated in a little sandy bay, at the mouth of the river Chagres, on its north
                    side, and consists of an assemblage of dirty, rude, ill-conditionéd huts, built
                    of reeds. From the nature of the surrounding country, it is open to no wind but
                    a westerly one, and is thus, like Portobello, extremely unhealthy. A castle, in
                    which ten guns are mounted, protects the mouth of the river and the small
                    harbour. The inhabitants are chiefly black or coloured, with the exception of a
                    few customhouse officers, and the commandant of the castle. They are said to
                    amount to about two thousand in number. Chagres and Portobello are the only
                    towns or villages on the Atlantic shore of the isthmus; and, as we have seen,
                    they are of a very inferior description. About nine miles east from Chagres is
                    Navy Bay, called also the Bay of Limon. It is large and spacious, being three
                    miles in width at the entrance. The other towns of Panama are of little
                    importance. Gatun is but a small village. Gorgona is somewhat larger, being a
                    point where passengers going to the capital frequently land. Cruces, however, is
                    the place to which goods are always conveyed. It is pleasantly situated on a
                    fine open plain, upon the left or southern bank of the river Chagres, about
                    thirty-four miles from its mouth, and eight hours’ ride from Panama. The
                    inhabitants of these placeá are nearly all owners of canoes or mules, or
                    store-keepers for taking charge of goods, or bagas, that is, persons employed in
                    working canoes. Cruces and Gorgona are also resorted to in summer as
                    watering-places by the inhabitants of Panama, being considered very healthy; and
                    the town of Chorrera, situated upon the river of that ιame, enjoys the same
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>The trade on the Atlantic shore of the isthmus is maintained with Jamaica by a
                    British man-of-war, which sails monthly for the purpose of conveying letters and
                    specie; with Carthagena by government vessels, twice a month; and with the same
                    and a few other points by independent traders, which bring freight to Chagres,
                    and there exchange it. On the Pacific side it embraces all parts of the coast,
                    both north and south, which find it their interest to communicate with Europe in
                    this way. Specie is conveyed across the isthmus to be embarked at Chagres at an
                    expense of ten dollars two reals for every five thousand dollars or ounces; arid
                    there is, besides, a transit duty of three per cent, on silver, and one per
                    cent, on gold. Return goods are brought to Panama, where they are lodged in the
                    custom-house immediately on their arrival. If for exportation, they pay a duty
                    of two per cent.; and if for home consumption, according to the nature of the
                    article. The trade of the isthmus is very limited, but it is believed to be
                    improving. The financial affairs of the government of Panama stood thus in 1827
                    :—Receipts, 241,682 dollars; expenditure, 238,929 ditto; leaving a balance in
                    the treasury of 2753 dollars. The income is not one third of what it was in
                    1812, when Panama was attached to Spain; but this arose from that exclusive
                    system of dealing which was universally practised by that power.</p>
                <p>The upper classes in the isthmus belong to the common stock of Spanish America,
                    but are by no means so far advanced in civilization as their neighbours. The
                    white people, and particularly the women, who are exceedingly retired in their
                    manners, are noted for a tinge of the European complexion, which is scarcely to
                    be looked for from their geographical position. They are very superstitious and
                    illiterate, children being brought up in the very worst manner. Hence, although
                    there is a well-conductéd college at Panama, the blessings which it would
                    otherwise diffuse are greatly counteracted by the negligence with which parents
                    superintend their offspring, allowing them to associate indiscriminately with
                    the lowest negroes of their own age. They thus acquire habits of gambling and
                    other kinds of low vice; the first being the curse of the country, and indeed of
                    almost every part of the former dominions of Spain in the western world. The
                    inhabitants display a considerable turn for commerce; and, from the highest to
                    the lowest, each keeps a shop or tienda. The lower classes also pursue different
                    handicrafts; but, with the exception of goldsmiths’ work, to which we have
                    already alluded, they are rude in all. The field for this branch of art,
                    however, as for every other which contributes to luxury, is now much
                    curtailed.</p>
                <p> But the dress of the women, on occasions of religious processions or rejoicings,
                    is still very splendid. They decorate their persons with a profusion of
                    ornaments, amongst which pearls are conspicuous for their number and brilliancy.
                    These are procured amongst the islands off the coast, by diving, which is
                    pursued as a favourite occupation, although both very laborious and
                    uncertain.</p>
                <p>By the last arrangement affecting this country, it forms the north-western
                    boundary of New Grenada, one of the three republics into which Colombia
                    separated in the year 1832.</p>
                <p>We are unwilling to enter at any length into the much agitated question of a
                    communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, because it is at present
                    only a matter of speculation, and, from all appearances, the work will be one of
                    distant and very uncertain fulfilment. There are no less than five plans by
                    which it is proposed to effect this junction. Beginning with the most northerly,
                    it has been suggested that the Gulf of Mexicomight be united to the Gulf of
                    Tehuantepec in the Pacific, by means of a canal which should join the sources of
                    the Chimilapa to those of the Rio del Passo. The distance (thirty-eight
                    leagues), and other circumstances, render this plan by no means a favourite. Its
                    realization is more important to the state of Mexicothan to the general
                    interests of the commercial world. By the second and third plans, the lines of
                    communication pass through Central America, and a notice of them will be found
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicaragua.</hi> The communication through
                    the Isthmus of Panama has occupied more attention than any of the others; and
                    although it will not answer for a ship-canal, it presents great facilities for
                    transferring merchandise from one ocean to the other, at a trifling expense, by
                    a river and canal sufficiently deep for steam-boats. Mr Lloyd’s attention was
                    chiefly dirécted to the practicability of a railroad along the level country
                    between the mouth of the Trinidad and the town or river of Chorrera; and no
                    doubt this work would be very beneficial. But many persons are of opinion, that
                    by deepening the Obispo, and the Mandingo, which flows into it, and then
                    connecting these rivers by a canal with the Rio Grande, at the point whence it
                    is navigable to the Pacific, the desired object would be attained fully as well
                    as by the plan of Mr Llyod. The distance from the Chagres, at the point where
                    the Obispo enters it, to the Rio Grande, is twelve miles; and the Obispo, at its
                    junction with the Mandingo, or nearly at that part, approaches to within four
                    miles and a half of the Rio Grande, the interval between the two rivers
                    presenting no serious obstacle, and being nearly flat. This is certainly the
                    shortest route; but whether it is practicable, or is even the best, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194567106" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7106-0787"/> remains to be
                    determined by proper surveyors and engineers. Before individuals sent out in
                    these capacities shall have examined the country and published their reports, no
                    correct judgment can be formed upon the merits of the several plans. A question
                    here arises, and it is one which ought to be deliberately discussed before
                    anything is done in the matter, namely, should the communication be of that
                    limited nature which would render it necessary for the goods to be transported
                    by smaller craft or by railroads from one vessel in the Atlantic to another in
                    the Pacific; or ought it to be a large ship-canal, capable of admitting vessels
                    of deep draught, and thus effectually uniting the two oceans at once? Such a
                    plan is said to be practicable at the isthmus of Cupica; and this is the last of
                    the five which we mentioned as having been proposed. Humboldt, who is a great
                    authority, is of opinion that Cupica Bay merits the serious attention of men of
                    science, from the great facilities it presents for solving the problem of a
                    shipeanal. The scheme is simply to connect Cupica Bay, in the Pacific, with the
                    large river Atrato, flowing into the Atlantic, by forming a canal across the
                    interval, which is ascertained to be a perfect level. The course of the river
                    Naipi, before its confluence with the Atrato, intersects this level country
                    within five leagues of the Bay of Cupica. The Atrato flows through the province
                    of Choco, in which it rises, and reaches the Atlantic at the southern end of the
                    Gulf of Darien, in the Bay of Choco.</p>
                <p>One thing is certain, that were such a communication between the two great oceans
                    effected, it would prove of incalculable utility to all nations engaged in
                    maritime commerce, and sooner or later it will unquestionably be opened.
                    Geographically, this would be nearly the shortest possible route from Europe,
                    North America, a great part of Asia, as well as from Africa to every port on the
                    western coast of the New World. With regard to the more obvious saving of space
                    to be travelled over, we need say nothing; a glance at a map of the world will
                    show at once what would be gained. Therefore, although only the smaller work
                    were carried through, there would be an immense saving in time, by the greater
                    certainty of good and safe passages in a voyage from Panama to Canton,
                    Australia, and every port and island in the Pacific Ocean, notwithstanding the
                    necessity for disembarkation and transhipment. But the advantages of a canal of
                    sufficient size to allow large vessels to proceed right across the isthmus would
                    be incomparably greater. They must, however, be so obvious to every mind, that
                    we need not enlarge upon them in this place. But by whom is either of the two
                    works to be accomplished? The question is not a British one alone, nor even an
                    European; it is more particularly an American question, though the whole
                    commercial world would be more or less remotely affected by it. It is not
                    likely, therefore, that any individual nation will be so generous as to
                    undertake the expense on its own account; and there must be either a joint-stock
                    company of governments formed, who will agree to defray so much each of the
                    expenditure, or a joint-stock company of individuals, who will accomplish some
                    one line of communication or another, and indemnify themselves for their outlay
                    by planting tolls upon it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi><hi rend="subscript
