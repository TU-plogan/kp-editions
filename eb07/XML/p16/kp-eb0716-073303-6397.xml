                <p><label type="entry">PAISLEY</label>, the principal town of Renfrewshire, and, in
                    point of manufacturing importance and population, the second in Scotland, is
                    finely situated on the banks of the White Cart, about three miles south of the
                    river Clyde. The ancient and principal part of the town occupies the summit and
                    slopes of a beautiful declivity, the eastern base of which is washed by the
                    river, which divides the burgh into two parts, that on the east side being
                    styled the New Town, from its more recent erection. Paisley is generally
                    considered as the ancient Vanduaria of Ptolemy, and as having been a Roman town
                    or station during the presence of these invaders in the northern part of
                    Scotland. As late as the beginning of the last century, considerable vestiges
                    remained of a Roman camp on the western side of the hill on which Paisley is
                    built; but these have long since been obliterated by the progressive extension
                    and improvement of the town. The latitude of Paisley is 55. 48. north, and the
                    longitude 4. 26. west. The climate is temperate, but humid. Inflammatory and
                    pulmonary complaints are prevalent, and infectious diseases have been of rather
                    frequent occurrence in its history. In 1645, a pestilence committed great
                    ravages in this place; and in 1765 dysentery prevailed to an alarming extent. In
                    1771, pleurisy carried off numbers of the inhabitants; and a virulent influenza
                    visited it in 1803, 1830, 1831, and in the beginning of 1837. Paisley is not,
                    however, considered as unhealthy, nor is its mortality above the average of
                    other large manufacturing cities. Whether the Roman town or station called
                    Vanduaria was a place of any size or importance, ancient chronicles are entirely
                    silent. A dark cloud overhangs the history of Paisley till about the year 1163,
                    when Walter, the first Stewart, founded a monastery on the eastern bank of the
                    Cart, opposite to what is now termed the Old Town of Paisley. At this period
                    there does not appear to have been a village or hamlet, however small, in
                    existence; but the protection which the monastery afforded in those rude times,
                    and the multitude of pilgrims, travellers, and persons of distinction, who
                    frequented it, gradually induced a population to assemble in its vicinity; and a
                    village of some extent made its appearance on the western bank of the river, and
                    began slowly to clamber up the gentle slope of the hill on that side. In 1220,
                    the monastery was elevated to the dignity of an abbey, and many valuable
                    privileges were subsequently conferred upon it by the pope, and by its founder
                    and successive patrons. Its jurisdiction and revenues were very extensive,
                    extending to, and being derived from, localities at a great distance; its abbots
                    were commonly men of the highest family connections, and appear frequently as
                    prominent actors on the stage of Scottish civil and ecclesiastical history.
                    After the Reformation, the revenues and privileges of this ecclesiastical
                    establishment were bestowed upon Lord Claud Hamilton, and have since become the
                    property, though greatly reduced, of the noble family of Abercorn. A
                    considerable part of the ancient abbey still remains, and is in excellent
                    preservation. The skeleton of a beautiful window, thirty-five feet in height by
                    eighteen in breadth, almost the only fragment of the more ancient part of the
                    building, has been much admired for its size, lightness, and fine proportions.
                    The external architecture of the remaining portion is perhaps scarcely equal to
                    that of some other ecclesiastical edifices in Scotland; but the appearance<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194566410" xml:id="kp-eb0716-6410-0734"/> of the nave,
                    which is occupied as a parish church, is grand and striking in no ordinary
                    degree; and some few fragmentary remains of the old monastery exhibit fine
                    specimens of the purest Gothic. Before the accession of the Stuart family to the
                    throne of Scotland, their burying-place was in the abbey; and even after that
                    event, two of its members were interred there, namely, the queen of Robert II.
                    in 1387, and Robert III. in 1406. The tomb of Marjory Bruce, the daughter of
                    Robert I. is still to be seen in the famous sounding aisle, now occupied as a
                    burial-vault by the Abercorn family.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the wealth and manufacturing importance of Paisley, it is only a
                    burgh of barony; but its privileges are so very considerable as almost to equal
                    those of a royal burgh. Previously to 1770, the burgh had a vote in the election
                    of a member of parliament for the county. Now, by the Scottish Reform Act,
                    Paisley sends a member to represent it in parliament. The constituency in 1837
                    was 1484. Formerly the government of the town was vested in a provost, three
                    bailies, and seventeen councillors; but by the. Scottish Burgh Reform Act there
                    are now a provost, four bailies, and ten councillors.</p>
                <p>In 1553, John Hamilton, the last abbot, conveyed, by a deed, the revenues and
                    privileges of the abbacy to Lord Claud Hamilton, then a child of ten years of
                    age: he was afterwards deprived of the latter, on account of his adherence to
                    the fortunes of Queen Mary, but in 1591 they were restored, with the title of
                    Lord Paisley. In 1653, the second Earl of Abercorn disposed of his interest in
                    the abbacy to the Dundonald family; and in 1658 the magistrates and council
                    purchased this superiority, and since that time Paisley has held directly of the
                    crown. The old valuation of the burgh-lands was a thousand pounds Scotch. The
                    town’s revenue, from various sources, such as lands and houses, river-dues, and
                    various other civic items, amounts to L.3843. 12s. 7d., and the supposed value
                    of the burgh property is about L.50,000; but, deducting debts and other
                    obligations, its nett amount may be L.20,000.</p>
                <p>The topography of Paisley and its vicinity is not very remarkable. Previously to
                    the year 1736, the whole of this district was included in one parish, known by
                    the name of the parish of Paisley; but since that time the burgh has been
                    divided into three parishes, the High, the Middle, and the Low. The Abbey parish
                    now comprehends the New Town, which, with a trifling exception, is separated
                    from the burgh by the river Cart, and the populous villages of Johnstone,
                    Elderslie, Thorn, Quarrelton, Nitsil, Hurlet, and Dovecote Hall, with the
                    country districts. To the north, and affording a noble view from the eminence on
                    which Old Paisley is chiefly built, extends the great plain of the lower valley
                    of the Clyde, anciently called Strathgryfte. On the south, the Gleniffer, or
                    Paisley Braes, distant about three miles, swell gently up to the height of 760
                    feet above the surface of the Cart. The soil is of a mixed character, generally
                    poor and thin, but in many places rich and fertile. From the heights just
                    mentioned descend a variety of minor streams, of great utility to the
                    agriculturist and the manufacturer, and adding to the richness and beauty of the
                    scenery. The surface of the country in the neighbourhood, with the exception of
                    that to the north, which is flat, is agreeably diversified, and broken into
                    gentle swells and soft declivities, which, with the mixture of gentlemen’s
                    seats, farm-houses, bleachingfields, and other public works, confers a
                    picturesque and animated character upon the entire vicinage. Valuable minerals
                    abound in the parish, such as coal, limestone of the coal formation, and
                    ironstone; though the latter is not smelted, at least to any extent, but is sent
                    to the Lanarkshire furnaces. There are very extensive coal-pits wrought in the
                    neighbourhood, chiefly at Johnstone; and in that vicinity, and at Hurlet, the
                    chemical works of the Messrs</p>
                <p>Wilson at Thornly are on a very large scale. Very fine freestone is also obtained
                    in the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>As it is chiefly, however, to its being one of the principal manufacturing
                    stations in the kingdom that Paisley owes its celebrity, we shall now present a
                    brief sketch of the history, progressive improvement and increase, and present
                    extent, of its principal manufactures. There is no certain account as to the
                    precise period when the art of weaving was introduced. It appears, however, that
                    the manufacture of linen was carried to a considerable extent during the last
                    century. Shortly after the union, the spirit of manufacturing enterprise sprung
                    up in the west of Scotland, and Paisley was not slow in availing itself of the
                    general impulse. Craufurd, describing the state of Paisley in 1710, observes,
                    “That which renders this place considerable, is its trade of linen and muslin,
                    where there is a great weekly sale in its markets, of those sorts of cloth; many
                    of the inhabitants being chiefly employed in that sort of manufactory.” From
                    1744 to 1784 the linen manufacture increased in amount from L.18,886. 15s. 10d.
                    to no less than L.184,385. 16s. 6½d. About the year 1722, the manufacture of
                    linen thread was introduced into Paisley, and carried on to a large extent. For
                    several years it reached the amount of L.l 00,000 annually. Cotton thread,
                    having superseded that made from linen yarn, is manufactured to a very
                    considerable extent, and forms one of the principal manufactures of the place.
                    In 1760, silk gauze began to be manufactured in Paisley; and in a short time the
                    skill and ability with which this manufacture was prosecuted caused its
                    abandonment by the manufacturers of Spitalfields, the original seat of the silk
                    manufacture in Great Britain. This manufacture flourished extensively until near
                    the close of the last century. From 1772 there existed also a considerable
                    manufacture of ribbons, and other articles in silk. It has been calculated, that
                    in 1784 the value of the manufactures of Paisley, in silk gauzes and other silk
                    goods, linen lawns, linen gauze, and sewing thread, was L.579,185.16s. 6d., and
                    that in 1769 it amounted to L.660,385.16s. sterling. In 1744, only 867 looms
                    were employed in the weaving of linen; and forty years afterwards no fewer than
                    5000 looms were engaged in the manufacture of silk, the produce of which
                    amounted to L.350,000.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the last century, from the caprice of fashion, and the gradual
                    introduction of the cotton manufacture, the making of silk goods declined
                    rapidly; but a new species of manufacture sprung up, which has since been
                    carried to a much greater extent. The manufacture of shawls, of cotton, silk,
                    and fancy woollen fabrics, was introduced, and has now become the staple trade
                    of Paisley. Although little more than forty years have elapsed since its
                    introduction, this manufacture is so extensive, that in 1834 the value was
                    calculated to be about a million sterling; and since then it is understood to
                    have increased considerably.</p>
                <p>Previously to the present century, fine shawls had been manufactured in this
                    country, chiefly at Norwich and Stockport in England, where they were made in
                    imitation of the rich India shawls. The latter, from their high price, were
                    beyond the reach of all but a few wealthy individuals, when the manufacturing
                    skill and enterprise of Paisley embarked in the manufacture, and, by successive
                    inventions and improvements in the loom, and in the kind and quality of the
                    materials, prosecuted for a long series of years, succeeded in realizing a
                    nearly perfect imitation of those oriental fabrics, in colours, texture, and
                    design, and at a mere fraction of the cost. Besides the extraordinary cheapness,
                    the variety of new and beautiful fabrics and designs which have been introduced
                    into the shawl manufacture have largely contributed to its extent and success.
                    The manufacture of shawls is almost wholly confined to Paisley; but a
                    considerable proportion of these find their way to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194566423" xml:id="kp-eb0716-6423-0735"/>Glasgow markets for home and
                    foreign sale. The kinds produced are various in quality and cost, and there is a
                    great variety in the styles and fabrics. Some are wholly made of silk, but these
                    are not now much in demand; others of silk and cotton, and a great many of
                    Persian and fancy wools mixed with both or either. Thibet-cloth shawls, a very
                    rich and fanciful fabric; Chenille shawls, a beautiful imitation of silk velvet;
                    Canton crape shawls; and various other and newer kinds, of every possible
                    variety in size, texture, pattern, and price; are produced from the looms of
                    Paisley, with a rapidity and abundance which, whilst it tends occasionally to
                    overload the market, affords satisfactory evidence of the manufacturing skill
                    and resources of Paisley. The present annual amount of the trade and
                    manufactures of Paisley has been roughly calculated at nearly two millions
                    sterling. To give any thing like a view of the various inventions and
                    improvements in the art of weaving, by means of which Paisley has attained its
                    present eminence as a chief seat of the silk and cotton manufactures in
                    Scotland, would swell this article beyond all due bounds. The hasty sketch which
                    we have supplied affords some general data to the reader, who may consult, if he
                    wishes for more minute information, Wilson’s Survey of Renfrewshire; Craufurd’s
                    Description of the Shire of Renfrew, with Robertson’s continuation; and the New
                    Statistical Account of Scotland. The spinning of cotton yarn is also extensively
                    carried on by Paisley manufacturers in the town and parish, but there are no
                    data to be relied on for ascertaining its annual amount. Bleaching and dyeing
                    are, as might be expected, prosecuted to a very considerable extent. Soap-making
                    is a trade of some antiquity and importance; and malting, the distillation of
                    raw spirits, and silk throwing, have also a considerable capital embarked in
                    them.</p>
                <p>Under the head of General Statistics we may notice the increase of the population
                    in Paisley from 1791 to 1835. In 1695 the population of the town of Paisley,
                    exclusively of the Abbey parish, where there were then very few houses, was only
                    2200. In 1755, sixty years after, it amounted in the town and Abbey parish to
                    6799; and in 1781 to 11,100 in the town alone, the population of the Abbey
                    parish not being given in the register.</p>
                <p>In 1791 the total population was 24,592 ... 1801 31,179</p>
                <p>... 1811 36,722</p>
                <p>... 1821 47,003</p>
                <p>... 1831 57,466</p>
                <p>The population may now be assumed at about 65,000, according to the ordinary
                    increment of increase. Thursday is the market-day in Paisley, and there are four
                    fairs annually, which last three days each. The races at St James’s Fair are
                    well known in the west of Scotland, and attract great numbers from the
                    surrounding districts. For the last three or four years these races have been
                    much frequented by the sporting world. Race-horses of high celebrity have made
                    their appearance on the course; and a greal deal of money, it is understood, has
                    changed hands. Paisley is abundantly supplied with the means of external
                    communication; and when the Ayrshire and Greenock railways are completed, few
                    towns in the empire will possess equal facilities for traffic or travelling. By
                    the canal betwixt Glasgow, Paisley, and Johnstone, no fewer than 423,186
                    passengers were conveyed, from the first of October 1835 to the first of October
                    1836. From the latter period, however, to the first of October 1837, the number
                    had decreased to 386,157, owing to other means and modes of locomotion being
                    opened up. After the railway to the Clyde near Renfrew, which is from two to
                    three miles in length, was opened, in the spring of 1837, about 50,000
                    passengers passed along it, going up and down the river, during the first seven
                    months; and no fewer than 100,000 persons were carried by coach to and from
                    Glasgow, from October 1836 to the same time in 1837. The carriage of goods on
                    the canal has increased from 48,991 tons in 1831, to 67,305 tons in 1836. The
                    yearly returns of the post-office afford additional evidence of the growing
                    prosperity of Paisley.</p>
                <p>In 1720 the amount was only L.28 13 0</p>

                <p>The river Cart is navigable to Paisley for vessels of from sixty to eighty tons
                    burthen; but the improvements in progress upon the river, by deepening, and
                    removing various other obstacles to the navigation, for which an act of
                    parliament has lately been obtained, are expected greatly to increase the
                    facility of external traffic. The river dues in 1835 amounted to L.260. An act
                    of parliament has also been obtained to make a cut from the Forth and Clyde
                    Canal, to enter the Clyde as near as possible to the confluence of the Cart with
                    that river; an undertaking which will be highly advantageous to the Paisley
                    manufacturers, by affording them a cheaper and more expeditious transit for
                    their goods to London and the continental markets, for which a large portion of
                    their manufactures are prepared.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of Paisley, with the exception of its abbey, of which we have
                    already spoken, are hardly worth mentioning. There are a few old castles in the
                    vicinity, in a state of lesser or greater dilapidation; but, with the exception
                    of that of Crookston, once the property of the family of the feeble and
                    worthless Darnley, and which, from its commanding situation on a richly-wooded
                    slope, about four miles to the east of Paisley, and its air of venerable
                    antiquity, forms a most picturesque feature in the general landscape, none of
                    them possesses much interest, either historically, or as agreeable accessories
                    in the general scenery.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the enterprising and intellectual character of the inhabitants of
                    Paisley, the means of education are not so abundant as might be expected. From a
                    report by the presbytery to the General Assembly in 1834, the number of schools
                    in the town and Abbey parish was only sixty-five, and the scholars amounted to
                    4776. Since then, however, considerable exertions have been made to remedy this
                    deficiency. Government lately granted L.700 to the burgh for educational
                    purposes; and this sum, aided by liberal subscriptions from the citizens, and
                    the exertions of the general session and various philanthropic individuals, has
                    provided the means of education for a large additional number.</p>
                <p>The town is well lighted with gas, and an act of parliament has lately been
                    obtained by a public company to supply it with water from the neighbouring
                    heights. The assessment for the poor for 1838 is L.3500 for the three town
                    parishes. The only public building in Paisley of any importance, with the
                    exception of the abbey, is the countyjail and public offices, an edifice of
                    considerable extent, castellated in style, and standing in a fine situation on
                    the western bank of the Cart. The news-room at the cross is also a handsome
                    building. There are three bridges over the Cart, connecting the Old and New Town
                    of Paisley, but none of them is particularly remarkable.</p>
                <p>The civil history of Paisley affords little to interest or deserve the attention
                    of the general reader. Its ecclesiastical history is curious and interesting,
                    but supplies few points sufficiently salient and compact to be entered upon in
                    so brief a sketch. The famous “Black Book of Paisley,” which was long supposed
                    to have been a history of Paisley and its monastery, has been ascertained to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scoti-chronicon</hi> of Fordun, a monk of the fourteenth
                    century. Manuscript copies of this curious old work, with continuations by
                    Bowmaker and others, are in the College Library<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194566437" xml:id="kp-eb0716-6437-0736"/> at Edinburgh, and in the
                    British Museum. The Chartulary or Register of the Monastery of Paisley, printed
                    in 1832, at the expense of the Earl of Glasgow, president of the Maitland Club,
                    is a valuable document, containing much curious information respecting those
                    primitive times. Previously to the Reformation, Paisley was a place of little
                    importance. The neighbourhood of its abbey, however, with the presence of its
                    lordly abbots and their distinguished guests, conferred upon it considerable
                    dignity even then, and drew into it the neighbouring gentry, who, down to a
                    comparatively recent period, had family mansions in the town. The inhabitants
                    early embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, notwithstanding the naturally
                    adverse influences of their great monastic establishment; and displayed their
                    attachment to these on various occasions during the civil wars and prelatical
                    persecutions of the seventeenth century. In 1715 and 1745, they showed equal
                    zeal for the house of Brunswick; and the burgh had to pay a fine of L.500 to the
                    Young Chevalier,‘at the latter period, as a composition for its anti-Jacobite
                    predilections. The magistrates afterwards memorialized government for
                    compensation, but they never obtained it. In 1597, the queen of James VI.
                    honoured the inhabitants with a visit to their town, when it would appear that
                    the royal entertainment fell so heavy on the burgh funds, that in 1617, when her
                    royal consort also visited it, the civic dignitaries prudently forbore so costly
                    a welcome, but in lieu thereof employed “a prettie boy, a son of a Sir James
                    Semple of Beltrees,” to make him a speech, which, from the extracts of it we
                    have seen, was judiciously spiced for James’s royal ear. Its modern history is
                    comprised in the progress of its manufactures, and the improvement of the town
                    in all its interests and appearances, of which we have supplied this brief
                    analysis.</p>
