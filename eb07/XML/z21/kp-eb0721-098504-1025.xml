                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ZENO <hi rend="smallcaps">Eleates</hi></label>, an eminent
                    Grecian philosopher, was born at Elea about 504 years before Christ. He was a
                    zealous friend of civil liberty, and is celebrated for his courageous and
                    successful opposition to tyrants; but the inconsistency of the stories related
                    by different writers concerning him in a great measure destroys their credit. He
                    chose to reside in his small native city of Elea rather than at Athens, because
                    it afforded freer scope to his independent and generous spirit, which could not
                    easily submit to the restraints of authority. It is related that he vindicated
                    the warmth with which he resented reproach, by saying, “If I were indifferent to
                    censure, I should also be indifferent to praise.” The invention of the dialectic
                    art has been improperly ascribed to Zeno; but there can be no doubt that this
                    philosopher, and other metaphysical disputants of the Eleatic sect, employed
                    much ingenuity and subtilty in exhibiting examples of most of the logical arts,
                    which were afterwards reduced to rule by Aristotle and others.</p>
                <p>According to Aristotle, he taught that nothing can be produced either from that
                    which is similar or dissimilar; that there is only one being, God; who is
                    eternal, homogeneous, and spherical, neither finite nor infinite, neither
                    quiescent nor moveable; that there are many worlds; that there is in nature no
                    vacuum; that all bodies are composed of four elements, heat and moisture, cold
                    and dryness; and that the body of man is from the earth, and his soul an equal
                    mixture of these four elements. He argued with great subtilty against the
                    possibility of motion. If Seneca’s account of this philosopher deserves credit,
                    he reached the highest point of scepticism, and denied the existence of external
                    objects. The truth is, that after all that has been advanced by different
                    writers, it is impossible to determine whether Zeno understood the term <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> metaphysically, logically, or physically; or whether he
                    admitted or denied a nature properly divine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ζενο,</hi> the founder of the sect of the Stoics, was born
                    about 300 years before Christ, at Citium, in the island of Cyprus. This place
                    having been originally peopled by a colony of Phoenicians, Zeno is sometimes
                    called a Phoenician. His father was by profession a merchant, but discovering in
                    the youth a strong propensity towards learning, he early devoted him to
                    philosophy. In his mercantile capacity he had frequent occasion to visit Athens,
                    where he purchased for his son several of the writings of the most eminent
                    Socratic philosophers. These he read with great avidity; and when he was about
                    thirty years of age, he determined to take a voyage to a city which was so
                    celebrated both as a mart of trade and of science. If it be true, as some
                    writers relate, that he brought with him a valuable cargo of Phoenician purple,
                    which was lost by shipwreck upon the coast of Piraeus, this circumstance will
                    account for the facility with which he at first attached himself to a sect whose
                    leading principle was the contempt of riches. Upon his first arrival in Athens,
                    going accidentally into the shop of a bookseller, he took up a volume of the
                    commentaries of Xenophon; and after reading a few passages, was so much
                    delighted with the work, and formed so high an idea of the author, that he asked
                    the bookseller where he might meet with such men. Crates, the Cynic philosopher,
                    happening at that instant to be passing by, the bookseller pointed to him, and
                    said, “Follow that man.” Zeno attended upon the instructions of Crates, and was
                    so well pleased with his doctrine that he became one of his disciples. But
                    though he admired the general principles of the Cynic school, he could not
                    easily reconcile himself to their peculiar manners. Besides, his inquisitive
                    turn of mind would not allow him to adopt that indifference to every scientific
                    inquiry which was one of the characteristic distinctions of the sect. He
                    therefore attended upon other masters, who professed to instruct their disciples
                    in the nature and causes of things. When Crates, displeased at his following
                    other philosophers, attempted to drag him by force out of the school of Stilpo,
                    Zeno said to him, “You may seize my body, but Stilpo has laid hold of my mind.”
                    After continuing to attend upon the lectures of Stilpo several years, he
                    resorted to other schools, particularly to those of Xenocrates and Diodorus
                    Cronus. By the latter he was instructed in dialectics. He was so much delighted
                    with this branch of study, that he presented to his master a large pecuniary
                    gratuity, in return for his free communication of some of his ingenious
                    subtilties. At last, after attending almost every other master, he offered
                    himself as a disciple of Polemo. This philosopher appears to have been aware
                    that Zeno’s intention, in thus removing from one school to another, was to
                    collect materials from various quarters for a new system of his own; for when he
                    came into Polemo’s school, he said to him, “I am no stranger, Zeno, to your
                    Phoenician arts; I perceive that your design is to creep slyly into my garden,
                    and steal away my fruit.” Polemo was not mistaken in his opinion. Having made
                    himself master of the tenets of others, Zeno determined to become the founder of
                    a new sect. The place which he made choice of for his school was a public
                    portico adorned with the pictures of Polygnotus, and other eminent painters. It
                    was the most famous porticoin Athens, and called, by way of eminence, ∑ <hi
                    rend="italic">τοὰ</hi> “the Porch.” It was from this circumstance that the
                    followers of Zeno were called <hi rend="italic">Stoics.</hi></p>
                <p>In his person Zeno was tall and slender; his aspect was severe, and his brow
                    contracted. His constitution was feeble, but he preserved his health by great
                    abstemiousness. The supplies of his table consisted of figs, bread, and honey;
                    notwithstanding which, he was frequently honoured with the company of great men.
                    In public company, to avoid every appearance of an assuming temper, he commonly
                    took the lowest place. Indeed so great was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1026" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1026-0986"
                    />his modesty, that he seldom chose to mingle with a crowd, or wished for the
                    company of more than two or three friends at once. He paid more attention to
                    neatness and decorum in external appearance than the Cynic philosophers. In his
                    dress indeed he was plain, and in all his expenses frugal; but this is not to be
                    imputed to avarice, but a contempt of external magnificence. Zeno lived to the
                    extreme age of ninety-eight; and at last, in consequence of an accident,
                    voluntarily put an end to his life. As he was walking out of his school he fell
                    down, and in the fall broke one of his fingers; upon which he was so affected
                    with a consciousness of infirmity, that, striking the earth, he said, “Why am I
                    thus importuned? I obey thy summons and immediately went home and strangled
                    himself. He died in the first year of the 129th Olympiad. The Athenians, at the
                    request of Antigonus, erected a monument to his memory in the Ceramicum.</p>
