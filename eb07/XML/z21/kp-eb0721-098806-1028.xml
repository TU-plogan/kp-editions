                <p><label type="entry">ZION, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sion</hi></label>, a very
                    famous mountain, standing on the north side of the city of Jerusalem (Psalm
                    xlviii. 2), containing the upper city, built by King David, where stood the
                    royal palace (Josephus. Psalm xlviii. 2). A part of Zion, situated at its
                    extremity, was called <hi rend="italic">Millo,</hi> of or in the city of David
                    (2 Chron. xxxii. 5). Modern travellers who have examined the spot say that Zion
                    is the whole of the mountain on which Jerusalem stands at this day, though not
                    to the extent in which it anciently stood on the same mountain, as appears Psal.
                    ix. 12, 15; lxv. 1; lxxxvii. 2, 3; Is. lxii. 1. It is swelled into several
                    eminences or tops, as Moriah, Acra Bezetha, and Zion, a particular eminence or
                    mount, and Zion proper, &amp;c., encompassed on three sides, east, west, and
                    south, with one continued deep and steep valley; by means of which it was
                    impregnablc on these three sides, and always attacked and taken, according to
                    Josephus, by the enemy on the north side, where Mount Zion became level, and the
                    vales of Gihon and Jehoshaphat gradually lose themselves. This deep and steep
                    valley incontestably constitutes the compass of the old Jerusalem on those three
                    sides, as plainly appears to any person who has been upon the spot. In
                    opposition to the opinion of former travellers, Dr Clarke thinks that the proper
                    Mount Zion is an eminence entirely without the city, on the south side; and in
                    the valley between this and the city he places the holy sepulchre. That part of
                    the valley which lay to the east was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jehoshaphat’s,</hi> having Mount Olivet lying beyond it; that to the south <hi
                    rend="italic">Gehin-non,</hi> and that to the west <hi rend="italic">Gihon,</hi>
                    from cognominal mountains lying beyond them. At the west end of Gihon, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1029"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-1029-0989"/> without the city, stood Golgotha or Calvary. The
                    same traveller thinks that very little credit is due to the names given to the
                    different places and objects by the monks.</p>
                <p>There is another <hi rend="italic">Zion,</hi> the same with <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hermon.</hi></p>
