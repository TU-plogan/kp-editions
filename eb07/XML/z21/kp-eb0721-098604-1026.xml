                <p><label type="entry">ZETLAND</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Shetland
                    Islands.</hi> The appellation of Zetland, given to this northern cluster of
                    islands, is a corruption of their ancient name. In the oldest northern
                    chronicles, as the Orkneyinga Saga, their denomination is Hialtland, <hi
                    rend="italic">the Land of the Hilt,</hi> either from some fancied resemblance in
                    the form of the whole group to the hilt of a sword, or from the warlike
                    propensities of the inhabitants. This name was corrupted by Scotish writers of
                    later times into Yetland or Zetland; the letters Z and Y having in the Scotish
                    dialect the same sound, as is well known, in proper names like Menzies, Monzie,
                    Cockenzie, and the like. The Zetland Islands, along with those of Orkney, form
                    one of the counties of Scotland. Exclusively of the small island called Fair
                    Isle, which lies midway between Orkney and Zetland, and is about twenty miles
                    distant from either cluster, they are situated in the North Sea, between the
                    parallels 59° 52' and 60° 50' north latitude. The meridian of Greenwich passes
                    through them almost at their extreme east, and they stretch to 2° 11' west. They
                    are distant from Norway forty-four leagues, from Aberdeenshire forty-seven, and
                    from Leith ninety-six. In number they are more than one hundred, but of these
                    only thirty-four are inhabited. The population of the islands, by the last
                    census (1831), amounted to 29,392. “The climate of the Zetland islands,” we
                    quote from the work of Dr Edmonstone, a native of the county, “is very variable
                    and damp, although by no means generally unwholesome to their inhabitants.
                    Spring can scarcely be said to commence until April, and there is but little
                    general warmth before the middle of June. The summer terminates for the most
                    part with August, though sometimes it continues through September. Autumn is a
                    very uncertain period, and winter commences with the middle of October, and
                    occupies the remaining months of the year.”</p>
                <p>Referring our readers to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Orkney</hi> for the
                    general history and present political state of the county, we shall notice what
                    appears most interesting in the principal islands.</p>
                <p>The largest island, Mainland, is about sixty miles long, and varies in breadth
                    from twenty-five miles to one hundred yards; the former is the distance from
                    Sandness to the Noup of Nesting, and the latter is the breadth of the isthmus
                    called Mavis-Grind. The bold and precipitous capes called Fitful Head and
                    Sumburgh Head (both celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in his Pirate), the castle of
                    Scalloway, the green vale of Tingwall, the remains of the chapel of the barons
                    of Burgh, Ronas Hill in the parish of Northmavine, and the town of Lerwick with
                    its harbour, fort, and shipping (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lerwick ),</hi> are
                    the most remarkable objects on the Mainland. The small islet of Moussa, on the
                    eastern coast of the Mainland, contains the most perfect remaining specimen of
                    those circular towers, with gracefully curved walls, perforated by low
                    galleries, which Scotland can boast. This is undoubtedly Scandinavian, and
                    affords a fair presumption that the similar structures in Glenbeg, Dundornadilla
                    in Sutherland, and other Highland districts, belong to the same people. To the
                    north of the Mainland lies Yell, eight miles in breadth and twenty in length. It
                    is a flat island, with much good sheep-pasture, and some arable land, lying
                    along the shores and coasts of the <hi rend="italic">vocs,</hi> or ocean inlets.
                    In Yell are the remains of no less than twenty chapels or religious houses,
                    small unadorned buildings, in all probability erected long centuries ago, as
                    votive offerings by tempest-tossed mariners, who barely escaped with life.</p>
                <p>Still farther north, and somewhat to the east, is Unst, the most northerly of the
                    British islands, ten miles long and four broad. In this island the law-tings or
                    judicial assemblies of Zetland were once held. They were afterwards removed to
                    Tingwall, on the south-west side of the Mainland. In Unst there is much good
                    grazing, and very valuable arable land. At Burness, near Balta Sound, in this
                    island, Biot, and afterwards Captain Kater, in the years 1817 and 1818,
                    instituted a series of experiments in order to determine the variation in the
                    length of the seconds pendulum. Chromate of iron has lately been found, and in
                    considerable quantity, in Unst, and is indeed its chief treasure. South of Unst,
                    and east from Yell, lies the small fertile island of Fetlar. Eight miles south
                    of Fetlar, and distant from the Mainland two or three miles, is Whalsey. The
                    arable land in this island has been cultivated at considerable expense, and
                    admirably improved; and the results shew what care and a judicious expenditure
                    will accomplish, even in this hyperborean region. Whalsey is surrounded by holms
                    or small islands, on one of which, about sixty years ago, a Russian frigate was
                    wrecked, and almost all on board perished. Bressay, five or six miles long by
                    three broad, lies to the east of the Mainland, and the channel between the
                    islands forms Lerwick harbour, or Bressay Sound, one of the safest and most
                    commodious havens in Britain. The principal entrance is a mile wide, and the
                    anchorage is about three miles long. Within the harbour, towards the north, is
                    the sunk rock called the Unicon, from the vessel of Kirkcaldy of Grange, which
                    was dashed to pieces on it when in pursuit of the infamous Bothwell. To the east
                    of Bressay is the small island of Noss; and on the south-east side of this
                    island lies the holm of Noss, a rock rising almost per <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1027" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1027-0987"
                    />pendicularly to the height of 200 feet, and having its summit covered with
                    short rich pasture. The holm is thirty yards distant from the island, and a
                    communication has been effected and is continued in the following way. A daring
                    islander climbed the perpendicular face of the holm, and drove two strong posts
                    into the ground near the edge of the side next to Noss, and a rope having been
                    conveyed from the larger islet, was fastened to these posts, and the chasm was
                    passed. The <hi rend="italic">craigsman</hi> scorned to take advantage of his
                    success, and attempting to return by the rocks, lost his footing and was dashed
                    to pieces. The rope is annually removed before winter, and the communication is
                    re-opened generally in July. The following is the mode of doing it. A stone is
                    fastened to the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bight</hi> of
                    a small cord, the ends of which are secured, the stone is flung till the thrower
                    succeeds in getting the attached string beyond the posts on the holm. When this
                    is accomplished, a stronger line is substituted, and a still stronger one, and
                    the process of substitution is repeated, till a rope of the desired strength has
                    been drawn round the posts, and secured to corresponding stakes on Noss. A
                    wooden box called “the cradle of Noss” is then slung upon the rope, and a person
                    getting into this, easily pushes himself backwards and forwards. Dangerous as
                    all this seems, accidents, it is affirmed, seldom happen. Immense numbers of
                    wild fowl frequent the holm, and their eggs, feathers, and young ones, and the
                    pasture afforded to about a dozen sheep, are deemed a recompense sufficient for
                    the trouble and risk encountered in annually erecting this aerial bridge. Almost
                    opposite to Bressay, on the west side of the Mainland, he the two islands of
                    Burra, separated by a narrow channel, which in one place is so contracted that a
                    wooden bridge is thrown across it to facilitate communication. The soil of these
                    islands is in general of the finest quality, and they produce what in Zetland is
                    regarded as a large quantity of grain. About the middle of the seventeenth
                    century a Dutch squadron was driven by stress of weather on the west side of
                    Burra. Two vessels were lost, but the rest of the fleet succeeded in making a
                    harbour. To the north and west of Burra, and separated from the Mainland by a
                    narrow but troubled strait, lies Papa Stour, an island two miles in length.
                    There are several large caves in this island, open to the sea, which are
                    frequented by numerous seals. One of these caves is lighted from above, by an
                    aperture fifty feet long by twenty broad. Here too may be seen, rising
                    perpendicularly to a great height from its ocean bed, the Stack of Snalaa, a
                    magnificent rock, on the summit of which, from time immemorial, the eagle has
                    had his eyrie. In the bay of St Magnus, tower up the magnificent Drongs, the
                    perforated rocks so finely delineated by Dr Hibbert. Placed far amid the
                    melancholy main is Foula, the most westerly of the Zetland Islands, and with
                    every probability supposed to be the <hi rend="italic">Thule</hi> of the Romans.
                    At a distance it presents the appearance of five conical hills, the loftiest of
                    which reaches a height of 1300 feet, an immense elevation in appearance, there
                    being no gradual rise, as in inland mountains. “On reaching the highest ridges
                    of the rocks,” says Dr Hibbert, “the prospect presented on every side is of the
                    sublimest description. The spectator looks down from a perpendicular height of
                    1100 or 1200 feet, and sees below the wide Atlantic roll its tide. Dense columns
                    of birds hover through the air, consisting of mews, kittywakes, lyres,
                    sea-parrots or guillemots: the cormorants occupy the lowest portions of the
                    cliffs, the kittywakes whiten the ledges of one distant cliff, gulls are found
                    on another, and lyres on a third. The welkin is darkened with their flight; nor
                    is the sea less covered with them as they search the waters in quest of food.
                    But when the winter appears the colony is fled, and the rude harmony produced by
                    their various screams is succeeded by a desert stillness. From the brink of this
                    awful precipice the adventurous fowler is, by means of a rope tied round his
                    body, let down many fathoms; he then lands on the ledges where the various
                    sea-birds nestle, being still as regardless as his ancestors of the destruction
                    that awaits the falling of some loose stones from a crag, or the untwisting of a
                    cord. It was formerly said of a Foula-man, ‘ his gutcher (grandfather) gaid
                    before, his father gaid before, and he must expect to go over the sneug too.’”
                    Twenty miles S.S.W. from Sumburgh Head, the southern extremity of the Mainland,
                    lies the Fair Isle, two miles in length, and about three-fourths of a mile in
                    breadth. On this island the duke of Medina Sidonia, the admiral of the armada,
                    was wrecked while attempting to reach home after his disastrous expedition had
                    failed. The crews of his ship reached the shore, but the islanders are said to
                    have murdered them almost to a man, from a conviction that a famine could not
                    otherwise be warded off. The duke was spared, and having wintered in Zetland, he
                    afterwards reached Spain by way of France.</p>
                <p>The natural history of Zetland differs little from that of Orkney, to which we
                    refer. The plants in both clusters of islands are, generally speaking, the same;
                    and a similar remark applies to the zoology.</p>
                <p>The geology of Zetland has been discussed at great length both by Professor
                    Jameson and Dr Hibbert; and appended to Neill’s Tour in these islands is a
                    valuable paper on the subject by Professor Traill. Owing to the variety of the
                    rocks, and the easy access to them which the ocean has thrown open, Zetland
                    presents an interesting field to the mineralogist. Primitive clay-slate,
                    intermixed with a few quartz and hornblende beds, abounds in the southern parts
                    of the Mainland. Ronas Hill, and the greater portion of Northmavine, consist of
                    a hard red granite. In Foula the rocks are all micaceous schistus. Bressay and
                    Ness are composed of sandstone, and much of the shores of Yell and Unst are of
                    serpentine.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to give any thing at all approaching to an estimate of the trade
                    of Zetland. Its exports are principally salted fish, oil, tallow, butter, skins,
                    stockings, cattle, sheep, and ponies. The imports are of a very miscellaneous
                    description; and as Zetland produces about one third less grain than its
                    inhabitants require, large quantities of meal and flour are annually
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>The fisheries, namely, the whale-fishing at Greenland and Davis Straits, and the
                    herring and haaf or deep-sea fishings at home, employ many hands, and bring much
                    wealth into the country.</p>
                <p>Of the state of agriculture in these islands it is impossible to speak in very
                    favourable terms. Shirreff in his Survey says, there is reason to believe that
                    the undivided and consequently uncultivated waste lands amount to more than
                    400,000 acres. This immense tract is pastured in common by the tenants of the
                    adjoining arable lands, which do not exceed 25,000 acres; and in many places the
                    arable land is <hi rend="italic">runrig</hi> or interrupted. Little improvement
                    can in such circumstances be expected. Still a few spirited individuals have set
                    an example. The results of their exertions have been most favourable, and are
                    visible; and it is to be hoped that others will be prompted to imitate them.
                    Till the era of the reform bill, Zetland had no representative in parliament,
                    the landholders having no vote for the county-member. This anomaly is now
                    happily removed; and though unwilling to attach undue importance to mere
                    political changes, the writer of these remarks cannot but think, that the
                    alteration produced on the relations of landlord and tenant consequent on the
                    passing of the bill, the inducements now held out to the former to grant leases
                    of some duration, and the more frequent intercourse among themselves and with
                    strangers which an extension(in this case a creation) of the franchise
                    invariably produces; all this will operate favourably both on the commerce and
                    the agriculture of the islands. Owing to their remote situation and their
                    poverty, the lower <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1028" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1028-0988"
                    />orders are more dependent on the mere will of those above them than is
                    desirable; but the great change on their political state to which we have
                    already alluded, and other causes now in operation, will, we trust, diminish, if
                    they do not remove, many of the hardships under which they have hitherto
                    laboured. By all who have visited them, the Zetlanders are found to be a
                    warm-hearted, affectionate, honest, and most hospitable people. (<hi
