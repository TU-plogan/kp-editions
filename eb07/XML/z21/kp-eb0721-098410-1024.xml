                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ZEND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Zendavesta</hi></label>, a book
                    ascribed to Zoroaster, and containing his pretended revelations, which the
                    ancient Magians and modern Parsees, called also <hi rend="italic">Gaurs,</hi>
                    observe and reverence in the same manner as the Christians do the Bible and the
                    Mahommedans the Koran, making it the sole rule both of their faith and manners.
                    The word, it is said, originally signified any instrument for kindling fire, and
                    it is applied to this book to denote its aptitude for kindling the flame of
                    religion in the hearts of those who read it.</p>
                <p>The Zend contains a reformed system of Magianism, teaching that there is a
                    Supreme Being, eternal, self-existent, and independent, who created both light
                    and darkness, out of which he made all other things; that these are in a state
                    of conflict, which will continue till the end of the world; that then there
                    shall be a general resurrection and judgment, and that just retribution shall be
                    rendered unto men according to their works; that the angel of darkness with his
                    followers shall be consigned to a place of everlasting darkness and punishment,
                    and the angel of light with his disciples introduced into a state of everlasting
                    light and happiness; after which light and darkness shall no more interfere with
                    each other. The Zend also enjoins the constant maintenance of sacred fires and
                    fire-temples for religious worship; the distinction of clean and unclean beasts;
                    the payment of tithes to priests, which are to be of one family or tribe; a
                    multitude of washings and purifications, resembling those of the Jewish law; and
                    a variety of rules and exhortations for the exercise of benevolence and
                    charity.</p>
                <p>In this book there are many passages evidently taken out of the Scriptures of the
                    Old Testament, particularly out of the Psalms of David. The author represents
                    Adam and Eve as the first parents of all mankind, gives in substance the same
                    account of the creation and deluge with Moses, differing indeed with regard to
                    the former, by converting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1025" xml:id="kp-eb0721-1025-0985"
                    />the six days of the Mosaic account into six times, comprehending in the whole
                    365 days; and speaks also of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and Solomon. Dr Baumgarten
                    moreover asserts, that this work contains doctrines, opinions, and facts,
                    actually borrowed from the Jews, Christians, and Mahommedans; whence, and from
                    other circumstances, he concludes that both the history and writings of this
                    prophet were probably invented in the later ages, when the fire-worshippers
                    under the Mahommedan government thought fit to vindicate their religion from the
                    suspicion of idolatry.</p>
                <p>At whatever period the Zend may have been written, we are assured by Dr Hyde that
                    it is in the pure old Persian language, and in the character called <hi
                    rend="italic">Peplavi.</hi> Some parts of it contain the original text, and
                    others Zoroaster’s second thoughts subjoined, for explaining more fully his
                    doctrine. These were occasioned by the opposition of adversaries, and unforeseen
                    circumstances which occurred during the progress of the imposture. About 300
                    years ago, when the old Persian language had become antiquated and little
                    understood, one of the destours or high priests among the Parsees composed the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sadda,</hi> which is a compendium, in the vulgar or modern
                    Persic tongue, of those parts of the Zend that relate to religion, or a kind of
                    code of canons and precepts, drawn from the theological writings of Zoroaster,
                    serving as an authoritative rule of faith and practice for his followers. This
                    Sadda is written in a low kind of Persic verse; and, as Dr Hyde informs us, it
                    is <hi rend="italic">bonorum et malorum farrago·,</hi> having many good and
                    pious things, and others very superstitious and trifling.</p>
