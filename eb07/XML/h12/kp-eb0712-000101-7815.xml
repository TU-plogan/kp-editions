                <p>1. HYDRODYNAMICS, from ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> ξ</hi>, “water,” and -*J- <hi
                    rend="italic">‰of,μtζ,</hi> “power,” is properly that science which treats of
                    the power of water, whether it acts by pressure or by impulse. In its more
                    enlarged acceptation, however, it treats of the pressure, equilibrium, cohesion,
                    and motion of fluids, and of the machines by which water is raised, or in which
                    that fluid is employed as the first mover. Hydrodynamics is divided into two
                    branches, <hi rend="italic">Hydrostatics</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydraulics.</hi> Hydrostatics comprehends the pressure, equilibrium, and
                    cohesion of fluids, and Hydraulics their motion, together with the machines in
                    which they are chiefly concerned.</p>
                <p> HISTORY.</p>
                <p>2. The science of hydrodynamics was cultivated with less success among the
                    ancients than any other branch of mechanical philosophy. When the human mind had
                    made considerable progress in the other departments of physical science, the
                    doctrine of fluids had not begun to occupy the attention of philosophers; and,
                    if we except a few propositions on the pressure and equilibrium of water,
                    hydrodynamics must be regarded as a modern science, which owes its existence and
                    improvement to those great men who adorned the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>3. Those general principles of hydrostatics which are to this day employed as the
                    foundation of that part of the science, were first given by Archimedes in his
                    work <hi rend="italic">∏iξi οχαμiv&lt;i)v,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Insidentibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Humido,</hi> about 250 years
                    before the birth of Christ, and were afterwards applied to experiments by
                    Marinus Ghetaldus in his <hi rend="italic">Archimedes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Promotus.</hi> Archimedes maintained that each particle of a fluid mass, when
                    in equilibrio, is equally pressed in every direction; and he inquired into the
                    conditions, according to which a solid body floating in a fluid should assume
                    and preserve a position of equilibrium. We are also indebted to the philosopher
                    of Syracuse for that ingenious hydrostatic process by which the purity of the
                    precious metals can be ascertained, and for the screw engine which goes by his
                    name, the theory of which has lately exercised the ingenuity of some of our
                    greatest mathematicians.</p>
                <p>4. In the Greek school at Alexandria which flourished under the auspices of the
                    Ptolemies, the first attempts were made at the construction of hydraulic
                    machinery. About 120 years after the birth of Christ, the fountain of
                    compression, the syphon, and the forcing pump, were invented by Ctesibius and
                    Hero; and though these machines operated by the elasticity and weight of the
                    ait, yet their inventors had no distinct notions of these preliminary branches
                    of pneumatical science. The syphon is a simple instrument which is employed to
                    empty vessels full of water or spirituous liquors, and is of great utility in
                    the arts. The forcing pump, on the contrary, is a complicated and abstruse
                    invention, which could scarcely have been expected in the infancy of hydraulics.
                    It was probably suggested to Ctesibius by the <hi rend="italic">Egyptian
                    wheel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Noria,</hi> which was common at that time, and
                    which was a kind of chain pump, consisting of a number of earthetn pots carried
                    round by a wheel. In some of these machines the pots have a valve in their
                    bottom which enables them to descend without much resistance, and diminishes
                    greatly the load upon the wheel; and if we suppose that this valve was
                    introduced so early as the time of Ctesibius, it is not difficult to perceive
                    how such a machine might have led this philosopher to the invention of the
                    forcing pump.</p>
                <p>5. Notwithstanding these inventions of the Alexandrian school, its attention does
                    not seem to have been directed to the motion of fluids. The first attempt to
                    investigate this subject was made by Sextus Julius Frontinus, inspector of the
                    public fountains at Rome in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan; and we may justly
                    suppose that his work entitled <hi rend="italic">De Aquaeductibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">urbis</hi><hi rend="italic">Rornae</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    of each inhabitant, supposing the population of Home to have been a million.
                    According to Professor Leslie, the supply in modern Rome is forty cubic feet per
                    person, in London three cubic feet, and in Paris one-half a cubic foot See <hi

                    aqueducts, to which he himself added <hi rend="italic">five</hi> more, and
                    mentioning the dates of their erection, he considers the methods which were at
                    that time employed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from
                    adjutages, and the mode of distributing the waters of an aqueduct or a fountain.
                    He justly remarks that the expense of water from an orifice, depended not only
                    on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the height of the water in
                    the reservoir; and that a pipe employed to carry off a portion of water from an
                    aqueduct, should, as circumstances required, have a position more or less
                    inclined to the original direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted
                    with the true law of the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth
                    of the orifice, we can scarcely be surprised at the want of precision which
                    appears in his results.</p>
                <p>It has generally been supposed that the Romans were ignorant of the art of
                    conducting and raising water by means of pipes; but it can scarcely be doubted,
                    from the statement of Pliny and other authors, that they not only were
                    acquainted with the hydrostatical principle, but that they actually used leaden
                    pipes for the purpose. Pliny asserts that water will always rise to the height
                    of its source, and he also adds that, in order to raise water up to an eminence,
                    leaden pipes must be employed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>6. The labours of the ancients in the science of hydrodynamics terminated with
                    the life of Frontinus. The sciences had already begun to decline, and that night
                    of ignorance and barbarism was advancing apace, which for more than a thousand
                    years brooded over the nations of Europe. During this lengthened period of
                    mental degeneracy, when less abstruse studies ceased to attract the notice, and
                    rouse the energies of men, the human mind could not be supposed capable of that
                    vigorous exertion, and patient industry, which are so indispensable in physical
                    re- ’ searches. Poetry and the fine arts, accordingly, had made considerable
                    progress under the patronage of the family of Medici, before Galileo began to
                    extend the boundaries of science. This great man, who deserves to be called the
                    father and restorer of physics, does not appear to have directed his attention
                    to the doctrine of fluids: but his discovery of the uniform acceleration of
                    gravity, laid the foundation of its future progress, and contributed in no small
                    degree to aid the exertions of genius in several branches of science.</p>
                <p>7. Castelli and Torricelli, two of the disciples of Galileo, applied the
                    discoveries of their master to the science of hydrodynamics. In 1628 Castelli
                    published a small work, <hi rend="italic">Della Misura dell’aeque correnti,</hi>
                    in which he gave a very satisfactory explanation of several phenomena in the
                    motion of fluids, in rivers and canals. But he committed a great paralogism in
                    supposing the velocity of the water proportional to the depth of the orifice
                    below the surface of the vessel. Torricelli observing that in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a jet d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">eau</hi> where the water ŗushed through a
                    small adjutage, it rose to nearly the same height with the reservoir from which
                    it was supplied, imagined that it ought to move with the same velocity as if it
                    had fallen through that height by the force of gravity. And hence he deduced
                    this beautiful and important proposition, that the velocities of fluids are as
                    the square roots of the pressures, abstracting from the resistance of the air
                    and the friction of the orifice. This theorem was published in 1643, at the end
                    of his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Gravium
                    naturaliter</hi><hi rend="italic">accclexato.</hi> It was afterwards confirmed
                    by the experiments of Raphael Magiotti, on the quantities of water discharged
                    from different adjutages under different pressures; and though it is true only
                    in small orifices, it gave a new turn to the science of hydraulics.</p>
                <p>8. After the death of the celebrated Pascal, who discovered the pressure of the
                    atmosphere, a treatise on the equilibrium of fluids <hi rend="italic">(Sur
                    l’Equilibre des Liqueurs),</hi> was found among his manuscripts, and was given
                    to the public in 1663. In the hands of Pascal, hydrostatics assumed the dignity
                    of a science. The laws of the equilibrium of fluids were demonstrated in the
                    most perspicuous and simple manner, and amply confirmed by experiments. The
                    discovery of Torricelli, it may be supposed, would have incited Pascal to the
                    study of hydraulics. But as he has not treated this subject in the work which
                    has been mentioned, it was probably composed before that discovery had been made
                    public.</p>
                <p>9∙ The theorem of Torricelli was employed by many succeeding writers, but
                    particularly by the celebrated Mariotte, whose labours in this department of
                    physics deserve to be recorded. His <hi rend="italic">Traite du Mouvement des
                    Eaux,</hi> which was published after his death in the year 1686, is founded on a
                    great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed
                    at Versailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some points he has committed
                    considerable mistakes. Others he has treated very superficially, and in none of
                    his experiments does he seem to have attended to the diminution of efflux
                    arising from the contraction of the fluid vein, when the orifice is merely a
                    perforation in a thin plate; but he appears to have been the first who attempted
                    to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of
                    the water’s velocity arising from friction. His contemporary Guglielmihi, who
                    was inspector of the rivers and canals in the Milanese, had ascribed this
                    diminution of velocity in rivers, to transverse motions arising from
                    inequalities in their bottom. But as Mariotte observed similar obstructions even
                    in glass pipes, where no transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by
                    Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore,
                    regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposes that the
                    filaments of water which graze along the sides of the pipe lose a portion of
                    their velocity; that the contiguous filaments having on this account a greater
                    velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity; and
                    that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to
                    their distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the
                    current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity of water discharged in
                    a given time, must, from the effects of friction, be considerably less than that
                    which is computed from theory.</p>
                <p>10. That part of the science of hydrodynamics which relates to the motion of
                    rivers seems to have originated in Italy. This fertile country receives from the
                    Apennines a great number of torrents, which traverse several principalities
                    before they mingle their waters with those of the Po, into which the greater
                    part of them fall. To defend themselves from the inundations with which they
                    were threatened, it became necessary for the inhabitants to change the course of
                    their rivers; and while they thus drove them from their own territories, they
                    let them loose on those of their neighbours. Hence arose the* continual quarrels
                    which once raged between the Bolognese and the inhabitants of Modena and
                    Ferrara. The attention of the Itahan engineers was necessarily directed to this
                    branch of science; and from this cause a greater number of works <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192937841" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7841-0003"/>were written on the subject
                    in Italy than in all the rest of Europe.</p>
                <p>11. Guglielmini was the first who attended to the motion of water in rivers and
                    open canals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his
                    principal work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lα Misura dell’ aeque
                    correnti.</hi></p></note> Embracing the theorem of Torricelli, which had been
                    confirmed by repeated experiments, Guglielmini concluded that each particle in
                    the perpendicular section of a current has a tendency to move with the same
                    velocity as if it issued from an orifice at the same depth from the surface. The
                    consequences deducible from this theory of running waters are in every respect
                    repugnant to experience, and it is really surprising that it should have been so
                    hastily adopted by succeeding writers. Guglielmini himself was sufficiently
                    sensible that his parabolic theory was contrary to fact, and endeavoured to
                    reconcile them by supposing the motion of rivers to be obstructed by transverse
                    currents arising from irregularities in their bed. The solution of this
                    difficulty, as given by Mariotte, was more satisfactory, and was afterwards
                    adopted by Guglielmini, who maintained also that the viscidity of water had a
                    considerable share in retarding its motion.</p>
                <p>12. The effects of friction and viscidity in diminishing the velocity of running
                    water were noticed in the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> of Sir Isaac Newton,
                    who has thrown much light upon several branches of hydrodynamics. At a time when
                    the Cartesian system of vortices universally prevailed, this great man found it
                    necessary to investigate that absurd hypothesis, and in the course of his
                    investigations he has shewn that the velocity of any stratum of the vortex is an
                    arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata which enclosed it; and
                    from this it evidently follows, that the velocity of a filament of water moving
                    in a pipe is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the filaments which
                    surround it. Taking advantage of these results, it was afterwards shewn by Μ.
                    Pitot, that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the
                    diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves. The attention of Newton was
                    also directed to the discharge of water from orifices in the bottom of vessels.
                    He supposed a cylindrical vessel full of water to be perforated in its bottom
                    with a small hole by which the water escaped, and the vessel to be supplied with
                    water in such a manner that it always remained full at the same height. He then
                    supposed this cylindrical column of water to be divided into two parts; the
                    first, which he calls the <hi rend="italic">cataract,</hi> being a hyperboloid
                    generated by the revolution of a hyperbola of the fifth degree around the axis
                    of the cylinder which should pass through the orifice; and the second the
                    remainder of the water in the cylindrical vessel. He considered the horizontal
                    strata of this hyperboloid as always in motion, while the remainder of the water
                    was in a state of rest; and imagined that there was a kind of cataract in the
                    middle of the fluid. When the results of this theory were compared with the
                    quantity of water actually discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with
                    which the water issued from the orifice was equal to that which a falling body
                    would receive by descending through half the height of water in the reservoir.
                    This conclusion, however, is absolutely irreconcilable with the known fact, that
                    jets of water rise nearly to the same height as their reservoirs, and Newton
                    seems to have been aware of this objection. In the second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> accordingly, which appeared in 1714, Sir Isaac has
                    reconsidered his theory. He had discovered a contraction in the vein of fluid
                    <hi rend="italic">(vena</hi><hi rend="italic">contracta),</hi> which issued from
                    the orifice, and found that, at the distance of about a diameter of the
                    aperture, the section of the vein was contracted in the subduplicate ratio of
                    two to one. He regarded, therefore, the section of the contracted vein as the
                    true orifice from which the discharge of water ought to be deduced, and the
                    velocity of the effluent water as due to the whole height of water in the
                    reservoir; and by this means his theory became more conformable to the results
                    of experience. This theory, however, is still liable to serious objections. The
                    formation of a <hi rend="italic">cataract</hi> is by no means agreeable to the
                    laws of hydrostatics; for when a vessel is emptied by the efflux of water
                    through an orifice in its bottom, all the particles of the fluid direct
                    themselves toward this orifice, and therefore no part of it can be considered as
                    in a state of repose.</p>
                <p>13. The subject of the oscillation of waves, one of the most difficult in the
                    science of hydrodynamics, was first investigated by Sir Isaac Newton. In the
                    forty-fourth proposition of the second book of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> he has furnished us with a method of ascertaining the velocity
                    of the waves of the sea, by observing the time in which they rise and fall. If
                    the two vertical branches of a syphon, which communicate by means of a
                    horizontal branch, be filled with a fluid of known density, the two fluid
                    columns, when in a state of rest, will be in equilibrio and their surfaces
                    horizontal. But if the one column is raised above the level of the other, and
                    left to itself, it will descend below that level, and raise the other column
                    above it, and, after a few oscillations, they will return to a state of repose.
                    Newton occupied himself in determining the duration of these oscillations, or
                    the length of a pendulum isochronous to their duration; and he found, by a
                    simple process of reasoning, that, abstracting from the effects of friction, the
                    length of a synchronous pendulum is equal to one-half of the length of the
                    syphon, that is, of the two vertical branches and the horizontal one, and hence
                    he deduced the isochronism of these oscillations. From this Newton concluded,
                    that the velocity of waves formed on the surface of water, either by the wind or
                    by means of a stone, was in the subduplicate ratio of their size. When their
                    velocity, therefore, is measured, which can be easily done, the size of the
                    waves will be determined by taking a pendulum which oscillates in the time that
                    a wave takes to rise and fall.</p>
                <p>14. In the year 1718, the Marquis Poleni published, at Padua, his work <hi
                    rend="italic">De Castellis per quae</hi><hi rend="italic">derivantur
                    Fluviorum</hi><hi rend="italic">aquoe,</hi> &amp;c. He found, from a great
                    number of experiments, that if A be the aperture of the orifice, and D its depth
                    below the surface of the reservoir, the quantity of water discharged in a given
                    time will be as 2 AD × <hi rend="strikethrough">θ ŋŋð</hi>, while it ought to be
                    as 2 AD, if the velocity of the issuing fluid was equal to that acquired by
                    falling through D. By adapting to a circular orifice through which the water
                    escaped, a cylindrical tube of the same diameter, the Marquis found that the
                    quantity discharged in a determinate time was considerably greater than when it
                    issued from the circular orifice itself; and this happened whether the water
                    descended perpendicularly or issued in a horizontal direction.</p>
                <p>15. Such was the state of hydrodynamics in 1738, when Daniel Bernouilli published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamica,</hi><hi rend="italic">seu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">viribus et motibus Fluidorum
                    Commentarii.</hi> His theory of the motion of fluids was founded on two
                    suppositions, which appeared to him conformable to experience. He supposed that
                    the surface of a fluid, contained in a vessel which was emptying itself by an
                    orifice, remains always horizontal; and if the fluid mass is conceived to be
                    divided into an infinite number of horizontal strata of the same bulk, that
                    these strata remain contiguous to each other, and that all their points descend
                    vertically, with velocities inversely proportional to their breadth, or to the
                    horizontal sections of the reservoir. In order to determine the motion of each
                    stratum, he employed the principle of the <hi rend="italic">conservatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">viri-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:192937854"

                    >vivarum,</hi> and obtained very elegant solutions. In the opinion of the Abbé
                    Bossut, his work was one of the finest productions of mathematical genius.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The germ of Daniel
                    Bernouilli’s theory was first published in his memoir entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Τheoria Nουa de Motu Aquarumper Canales</hi><hi rend="italic">quacunque
                    Fluentes,</hi> which he had communicated to the Academy of St Petersburg as
                    early as 172ß.</p></note></p>
                <p>16. The uncertainty of the principle employed by Daniel Bernouilli, which has
                    never been demonstrated in a general manner, deprived his results of that
                    confidence which they would otherwise have deserved; and rendered it desirable
                    to have a theory more certain, and depending solely on the fundamental laws of
                    mechanics. Maclaurin and John Bernouilli, who were of this opinion, resolved the
                    problem by more direct methods, the one in his Fluxions, published in 1742; and
                    the other in his <hi rend="italic">Hydraulica</hi><hi rend="italic">nunc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">primum detecta,</hi><hi rend="italic">et directe</hi><hi

                    which forms the fourth volume of his works. The method employed by Maclaurin has
                    been thought not sufficiently rigorous; and that of John Bernouilli is, in the
                    opinion of La Grange, defective in perspicuity and precision.</p>
                <p>17. The theory of Daniel Bernouilli was opposed also by the celebrated
                    D’Alembert. When generalising James Bernouilli’s Theory of Pendulums, he
                    discovered a principle of dynamics so simple and general, that it reduced the
                    laws of the motions of bodies to that of their equilibrium. , He applied this
                    principle to the motion of fluids, and gave a specimen of its application at the
                    end of his Dynamics in 1743. It was more fully developed in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluides,</hi> which was published in 1744, where he has resolved, in the most
                    simple and elegant manner, all the problems which relate to the equilibrium and
                    motion of fluids. He makes use of the very same suppositions as Daniel
                    Bernouilli, though his calculus is established in a very different manner. He
                    considers, at every instant, the actual motion of a stratum, as composed of a
                    motion which it had in the preceding instant, and of a motion which it has lost.
                    The laws of equilibrium between the motions lost, furnish him with equations
                    which represent the motion of the fluid. Although the science of hydrodynamics
                    had then made considerable progress, yet it was chiefly founded on hypothesis.
                    It remained a desideratum to express by equations the motion of a particle of
                    the fluid in any assigned direction. These equations were found by D’Alembert,
                    from two principles, that a rectangular canal, taken in a mass of fluid in
                    equilibrio, is itself in equilibrio; and that a portion of the fluid, in passing
                    from one place to another, preserves the same volume when the fluid is
                    incompressible, or dilates itself according to a given law when the fluid is
                    elastic. His very ingenious method was published in 17 52, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur la</hi><hi rend="italic">resistance</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des fluides.</hi> It was brought to perfection in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscules</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathématiques,</hi> and has been
                    adopted by the celebrated Euler.</p>
                <p>Before the time of D’Alembert, it was the great object of philosophers to submit
                    the motion of fluids to general formulae, independent of all hypothesis. Their
                    attempts, however, were altogether fruitless; for the method of fluxions, which
                    produced such important changes in the physical sciences, was but a feeble
                    auxiliary in the science of hydraulics. For the resolution of the questions
                    concerning the motion of fluids, we are indebted to the method of partial
                    differences, a new calculus, with which Euler enriched the sciences. This great
                    discovery was first applied to the motion of water by the celebrated D’Alembert,
                    and enabled both him and Euler to represent the theory of fluids in formulae
                    restricted by no particular hypothesis.</p>
                <p>18. An immense number of experiments on the motion of water in pipes and canals
                    was made by Professor Michelotti of Turin, at the expense of the sovereign. In
                    these experiments the water issued from holes of different sizes, under
                    pressures of from 5 to 22 feet, from a tower constructed of the finest masonry.
                    Basins (one of which was 289 feet square) built of masonry, and lined with
                    stucco, received the effluent water, which was conveyed in canals of brickwork,
                    lined with stucco, of various forms and declivities. The whole of Michelotti’s
                    experiments were conducted with the utmost accuracy; and his results, which are
                    in every respect entitled to our confidence, were published in 1774 in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Sperixnze Idrauliche.</hi></p>
                <p>19. The experiments of the Abbé Bossut, whose labours in this department of
                    science have been very assiduous and successful, have, in as far as they
                    coincide, afforded the same results as those of Michelotti. Though performed on
                    a smaller scale, they are equally entitled to our confidence, and have the merit
                    of being made in cases which are most likely to occur in practice. In order to
                    determine what were the motions of the fluid particles in the interior of a
                    vessel emptying itself by an orifice, Μ. Bossut employed a glass cylinder, to
                    the bottom of which different adjutages were fitted; and he found that all the
                    particles descend at first vertically, but that at a certain distance from the
                    orifice they turn from their first direction towards the aperture. In
                    consequence of these oblique motions, the fluid vein forms a kind of truncated
                    conoid, whose greatest base is the orifice itself, having its altitude equal to
                    the radius of the orifice, and its bases in the ratio of 3 to 2 It ap pears
                    also, from the experiments of Bossut, that when water issues through an orifice
                    made in a thin plate, the expense of water, as deduced from theory, is to the
                    real expense as 16 to 10, or as 8'to 5; and, when the fluid issues through an
                    additional tube, two or three inches long, and follows the sides of the tube, as
                    16 to 13—In analyzing the effects of friction, he found, 1. That small orifices
                    gave less water in proportion than great ones, on account of friction; and, 2.
                    That when the height of the reservoir was augmented, the contraction of the
                    fluid vein was also increased, and the expense of water diminished; and by means
                    of these two laws he was enabled to determine the quantity of water discharged,
                    with all the precision he could wish. In his experiments on the motion of water
                    in canals and tubes, he found that there was a sensible difference between the
                    motion of water in the former and in the latter. Under the same height of
                    reservoir, the same quantity of water always flows in a canal, whatever be its
                    length and declivity; whereas, in a tube, a difference in length and declivity
                    has a very considerable influence on the quantity of water discharged. According
                    to the theory of the resistance of fluids, the impulse upon a plane surface is
                    as the product of its area multiplied by the square of the fluid’s velocity, and
                    the square of the sine of the angle of incidence. The experiments of Bossut,
                    made in conjunction with D’Alembert and Condorcet, prove, that this is sensibly
                    true when the impulse is perpendicular; but that the aberrations from theory
                    increase with the angle of impulsion. They found, that when the angle of
                    impulsion was between 50° and 90°, the ordinary theory may be employed, that the
                    resistances thus found will be a little less than they ought to be, and the more
                    so as the angles recede from 90°. The attention of Bossut was directed to a
                    variety of other interesting points, which we cannot stop to notice, but for
                    which we must refer the reader to the works of that ingenious author.</p>
                <p>20. The oscillation of waves, which was first discussed by Sir Isaac Newton, and
                    afterwards by D’Alembert, in the article <hi rend="italic">Ondes</hi> in the
                    French Encyclopaedia, was now revived by Μ. Flaugergues, who attempted to
                    overthrow the opinions of these philosophers. He maintained, that a wave is not
                    the effect of a motion in the particles of water, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192937867" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7867-0005"/>by which they rise and fall
                    alternately, in a serpentine line, when moving from the centre where they
                    commenced; but that it is a kind of intumescence, formed by a depression at the
                    place where the impulse is first made, which propagates itself in a circular
                    manner when removing from the point of impulse. A portion of the water, thus
                    elevated, he imagines, flows from all sides into the hollow formed at the centre
                    of impulse, so that the water being, as it were, heaped up, produces another
                    intumescence, which propagates itself as formerly. From this theory Μ.
                    Flaugergues concludes, and he has confirmed the conclusion by experiment, that
                    all waves, whether great or small, have the same velocity.</p>
                <p>21. This difficult subject has also been discussed by Μ. de la Grange, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique.</hi> He found, that the velocity of waves,
                    in a canal, is equal to that which ' a heavy body would acquire by falling
                    through a height equal to half the depth of the water in the canal. If this
                    depth, therefore, be one foot, the velocity of the waves will be 5.945 feet in a
                    second; and if the depth is greater or less than this, their velocity will vary
                    in the subduplicate ratio of the depth, provided it is not very considerable. If
                    we suppose that, in the formation of waves, the water is agitated but to a very
                    small depth, the theory of La Grange may be employed, whatever be the depth of
                    the water and the figure of its bottom. This supposition, which is very
                    plausible, when we consider the tenacity and adhesion of the particles of water,
                    has also been confirmed by experience.</p>
                <p>22. The most successful labourer in the science of hydrodynamics was the
                    Chevalier Buat, engineer in ordinary to the King of France. Following in the
                    steps of the Abbé Bossut, he prosecuted the inquiries of that philosopher with
                    uncommon ingenuity; and in the year 1786, he published, ,in two volumes, his <hi

                    fluids.</p></note> which contains a satisfactory theory of the motion of fluids,
                    founded solely upon experiments. The Chevalier du Buat considered, that if water
                    were a perfect fluid, and the channels in which it flowed infinitely smooth, its
                    motion would be continually accelerated, like that of bodies descending in an
                    inclined plane. But as the motion of rivers is not continually accelerated, and
                    soon arrives at a state of uniformity, it is evident that the viscidity of the
                    water, and the friction of the channel in which it descends, must equal the
                    accelerating force. Μ. Buat, therefore, assumes it as a proposition of
                    fundamental importance, that when water flows in any channel or bed, the
                    accelerating force, which obliges it to move, is equal to the sum of all the
                    resistances which it meets with, whether they arise from its own viscidity or
                    from the friction of its bed. This principle was employed by Μ. Buat, in the
                    first edition of his work, which appeared in 1779; but the theory contained in
                    that edition was founded on the experiments of others. He soon saw, however,
                    that a theory so new, and leading to results so different from the ordinary
                    theory, should be founded on new experiments more direct than the former, and he
                    was employed in the performance of these from 1780 to 1783. The experiments of
                    Bossut having been made only on pipes of a moderate declivity, Μ. Buat found it
                    necessary to supply this defect. He used declivities of every kind, from the
                    smallest to the greatest; and made his experiments upon channels, from a line
                    and a half in diameter, to seven or eight square toises. All these experiments
                    he arranged under some circumstances of resemblance, and produced the following
                    proposition, which agrees in a most wonderful manner with the immense number of
                    facts which he has brought together, viz.</p>

                <p>23. Μ. Venturi, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Modena,
                    succeeded in bringing to light some curious facts respecting the motion of
                    water, in his work on the “Lateral Communication of Motion in Fluids.” He
                    observed, that if a current of water is introduced with a certain velocity into
                    a vessel filled with the same fluid at rest, and if this current passing through
                    a portion of the fluid is received in a curvilineal channel, the bottom of which
                    gradually rises till it'passes over the rim of the vessel itself, it will carry
                    along with it the fluid contained in the vessel; so that after a short time has
                    elapsed, there remains only the portion of the fluid which was originally below
                    the aperture at which the current entered. This phenomenon has been called by
                    Venturi, the lateral communication of motion in fluids; and, by its assistance,
                    he has explained many important facts in hydraulics. He has not attempted to
                    explain this principle; but has shewn, that the mutual action of the fluid
                    particles does not afford a satisfactory explanation of it. The work of Venturi
                    contains many other interesting discussions, which are worthy of the attention
                    of every reader.</p>
                <p>24. Although the Chevalier Buat had shown much sagacity in classifying the
                    different kinds of resistances which are exhibited in the motion of fluids, yet
                    it was reserved for Coulomb to express the sum of them by a rational function of
                    the velocity. By a series of interesting experiments on the successive
                    diminution of the oscillation of discs, arising from the resistance of the water
                    in which they oscillated, he was led to the conclusion, that the pressure
                    sustained by the moving disc is represented by two terms, one of which varies
                    with the simple velocity, and the other with its square. When the motions are
                    very slow, the part of the resistance proportional to the square of the velocity
                    is insensible, and hence the resistance is proportional to the simple velocity.
                    Μ. Coulomb found also, that the resistance is not perceptibly increased by
                    increasing the depth of the oscillating disc in the fluid; and by coating the
                    disc successively with fine and coarse sand, he found that the resistance arises
                    solely from the mutual cohesion of the fluid particles, and from their adhering
                    to the surface of the moving body,</p>
                <p>25. The law of resistance discovered by Coulomb, was first applied to the
                    determination of the velocity of running water by Μ. Girard, who considers the
                    resistance as represented by a constant quantity, multiplied by the sum of the
                    first and second powers of the velocity. He regards the water which moves over
                    the wetted sides of the channel as at first retarded by its viscidity, and he
                    concludes that the water will, from this cause, suffer a retardation
                    proportional to the simple velocity. A second retardation, analogous to that of
                    friction in solids, he ascribes to the roughness of the channel, and he
                    represents it by the second power of the velocity, as it must be in the compound
                    ratio of the force and the number of impulsions which the asperities receive in
                    a given time. He then expresses the resistance due to cohesion by a constant
                    quantity, to be determined experimentally, multiplied into*the product of the
                    velocity of the perimeter of the section of the fluid.</p>
                <p>26. The influence of heat in promoting fluidity was known to the ancients;<note

                    >Quoest. Nat.</hi></p></note> but Μ. Du Buat was the first person who
                    investigated the subject experimentally. His results, however, were far from
                    being satisfactory; and it was left to <pb break="no" facs="nls:192937880"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7880-0006"/>Μ. Girard to ascertain the exact effect of
                    temperature on the motion of water in capillary tubes. When the length of the
                    capillary tube is great, the velocity is quadrupled by an increase of heat from
                    0° to 85° centig.; but when its length is small, a change of temperature
                    exercises little or no influence on the velocity. He found also, that, in
                    ordinary conduit pipes, a variation of temperature exercises scarcely any
                    influence over the velocity.</p>
                <p>27. The theory of running water was greatly advanced by the researches of Μ.
                    Prony. From a collection of the best experiments by Couplet, Bossut, and Du
                    Buat, he selected 82, of which 51 were made on the velocity of water in conduit
                    pipes, and 31 on its velocity in open canals; and by discussing these on
                    physical and mechanical principles, he succeeded in drawing up general formulae,
                    which afford a simple expression of the velocity of running water. The following
                    is the formula for English feet, which answers both for pipes and canals :—</p>
                <p>V = 0.1541131 + √ (0.023751 + 32806.6 G)</p>
                <p>When we use this formula for canals, we must take <hi rend="italic">íti

                <p>28. Μ. Eytelwein of Berlin published, in 1801, a valuable compendium of
                    Hydraulics, entitled <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der Mechanik und der
                    Hydraulik,</hi> which contains an account of many new and valuable experiments
                    made by himself. His work is divided into 24 chapters, the most important of
                    which are the 7th, which treats of the motion of water in rivers, and the 9th,
                    which treats of the motion of water in pipes. He has shewn that the <hi
                    rend="italic">mean velocity</hi> of water in a second in a river or canal
                    flowing in an equable channel, is 16/11ths of a mean proportional between the
                    fall in two English miles, and the hydraulic mean depth; and that the <hi
                    rend="italic">superficial velocity</hi> of a river is nearly a mean proportional
                    between the hydraulic mean depth and the fall in two English miles. In treating
                    of the motion of water in pipes, he obtains the following simple formula, which
                    agrees wonderfully with experiment,</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> M⅛)</p>
                <p>in which <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is the length of the pipe, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> the hydraulic mean depth, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the height of the
                    reservoir. The following are some of the other important results which are given
                    in his work. The contraction of the fluid area is 0.64, the coefficient for
                    additional pipes 0.65, the coefficient for a conical tube similar to the curve
                    of contraction 0.98. For the whole velocity due to the height, the coefficient
                    by its square must be multiplied by 8.0458. For an orifice, the coefficient must
                    be multiplied by 7.8; for wide openings in bridges, sluices, &amp;c. by 6.9; for
                    short pipes 6.6; and for openings in sluices without side walls 5.1. Our author
                    investigates the subject of the discharge of water by compound pipes, the
                    motions of jets, and their impulses against plane and oblique surfaces, and he
                    shews theoretically, that a water-wheel will have its effect a maximum when its
                    circumference moves with half the velocity of the stream.</p>
                <p>29∙ A series of interesting hydraulic experiments was made at Rome in 1809, by
                    MM. Mallet and Vici.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Mallet, <hi rend="italic">Notices Historiques;</hi> Paris, 1830.</p></note> They
                    found that a pipe, whose gauge was <hi rend="italic">five ounces</hi> French
                    measure (or 0.03059 French kilolitres), furnished <hi rend="italic"
                    >one-seventh</hi> more water than <hi rend="italic">five</hi> pipes of <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> ounce, an effect arising from the velocity being
                    diminished by friction in the ratio of the perimeters of the orifices as
                    compared with their areas.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the investigations of Newton, D’Alembert, and Lagrange, the
                    problem of waves was still unsolved; and the Institute of France was induced to
                    propose, as the subject of its annual prize for 1816, “The Theory of Waves on
                    the surface of a heavy Fluid of indefinite depth.” Μ. Poisson had previously
                    studied this difficult subject, and he lodged his first memoir in the bureau of
                    the Institute on the 2d October 1815, at the expiration of the period allowed
                    for competition. Μ. Poisson supposes the waves to be produced in the following
                    manner. A body of the form of an elliptic paraboloid is immersed a little in the
                    fluid, with its axis vertical and its vertex downwards. After being left in this
                    position till the equilibrium of the fluid is restored, the body is suddenly
                    withdrawn, and waves are formed round the place which it occupied. This first
                    memoir contains the general formula for waves propagated with an uniformly
                    accelerated me tion; but in a second memoir, read in December, he gives the
                    theory of waves propagated with a constant velocity. This last class of waves
                    are much more sensible than the first, and arc those which are seen to spread in
                    circles round any disturbance made at the surface of water. In determining the
                    superficial as well as the internal propagation of these waves, he considers
                    only the case when the disturbance of the water is so small, that the second and
                    the higher powers of the velocity of the oscillating particles may be neglected;
                    and he assumes, that a fluid particle which is at any instant at the surface,
                    continues there during the whole of the motion, a supposition which the
                    condition of the continuity of the fluid renders necessary. He supposes the
                    depth of the water constant throughout its whole extent, the bottom being
                    considered as a fixed horizontal plane at a given distance beneath its natural
                    surface. He then treats, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the case in which the
                    motion takes place in a canal of uniform width, over which obstruction is made
                    of the horizontal dimension of the fluid; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi>
                    the case in which the fluid is considered in its true dimensions.</p>
                <p>30. The prize offered by the Institute was gained by Μ. Augustin Louis Cauchy,
                    then a young mathematician of the highest promise. In his memoir, which was
                    published in the 3d volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Sçavans,</hi> he treats only of the first kind of waves above
                    mentioned; and his investigation claims to be more complete than that in the
                    first memoir of Poisson, in so far as it leaves entirely arbitrary the form of
                    the function relative to the initial form of the fluid surface, and, therefore,
                    allows the analysis to be applied when bodies of different forms are used to
                    produce the initial disturbance. From his analysis, Μ. Cauchy concludes, “that
                    the heights and velocities of the different waves produced by the immersion of a
                    cylindrical or prismatic body, depend not only on the width and height of the
                    part immersed, but also on the form of the surface which bounds this part.” He
                    is also of opinion, that the number of the waves produced may depend on the form
                    of the immersed body, and the depth of immersion.</p>
                <p>31. The following abstract of the principal results obtained by theory,
                    respecting the nature of waves, has been given by Mr Challis :—</p>
                <p>“With respect first to the canal of uniform width, the law of the velocity of

                <p>“This must be understood to refer to a series of very’ small waves, called by Μ.
                    Poisson <hi rend="italic">dents,</hi> which perform their movements, as it were,
                    on the surface of the larger waves, which he calls ‘ <hi rend="italic">les ondes
                    dentelées’</hi> Each wave of the series is found to have its proper velocity,
                    independent of the primitive impulse.</p>
                <p>“3. At considerable distances from the place of disturbance, there are waves of
                    much more sensible magnitude than the preceding.</p>
                <p>“Their summits are propagated with a uniform velocity, which varies as the square
                    root of the breadth <hi rend="italic">à fleur d’eau</hi> of the fluid originally
                    disturbed. Yet the different waves which are formed in succession, are
                    propagated with different velocities: the foremost travels swiftest. The
                    amplitudes of oscillations of equal duration, are reciprocally proportional to
                    the square root of the distances from the point of disturbance.</p>
                <p>“4. The vertical excursions of the particles situated directly below the
                    primitive impulse, vary according to the inverse ratio of the depth below the
                    surface. This law of decrease is not so rapid but that the motion will be very
                    sensible at very considerable depths: it will not be the true law, as the theory
                    proves, when the original disturbance extends over the whole surface of the
                    water, for the decrease of motion in this case will be much more rapid.</p>
                <p>“The results of the theory, when the three dimensions of the fluid are
                    considered, are analogous to the preceding 1, 2, 3, 4, and may be stated in the
                    same terms, excepting that the amplitudes of the oscillations are inversely <hi
                    rend="italic">as the distances</hi> from the origin of disturbance, and the
                    vertical excursions of the particles situated directly below the disturbance,
                    vary inversely as the <hi rend="italic">square</hi> of the depth.”</p>
                <p>32. Several very interesting experiments on the propagation of waves, have been
                    made by Μ. Weber and by Μ. Bidone. Although Weber’s<note anchored="true"

                    experiments were not made in exact conformity with the condition which the
                    theory required, yet they, generally speaking, harmonize with it; and they
                    particularly establish the existence of the small accelerated waves near the
                    place of disturbance, and of a perceptible motion of the particles of the fluid
                    at considerable depths below the surface. When an elliptic paraboloid is used to
                    produce the waves, with its axis vertical, and its vertex downwards, and when,
                    of course, the section of the solid in the plane of the surface of the water is
                    an ellipse, the velocity of propagation is, according to the theory, greater in
                    the direction of the major axis than in that of the minor, in the ratio of the
                    square root of the one to the square root of the other; but this result is not
                    confirmed by Weber’s experiments.</p>
                <p>Μ. Bidone of Turin<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    made experiments on waves more conformable to the condition of the theory, and
                    he has in a great measure removed the obstacle arising from the adhesion of the
                    water to the immersed body; and the experiments which he has thus made, confirm
                    the laws of motion, as well as the existence of accelerated waves.</p>
                <p>33. In 1826, Μ. Bidone made a series of experiments on the velocity of running
                    water at the hydraulic establishment of the University of Turin, and he
                    published an account of them in 1829.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    method of experimenting, he gives the figures obtained from fluid veins,
                    discharged from rectilineal and curvilineal orifices with salient angles pierced
                    in vertical plates, and whose perimeters are formed of straight and curve lines,
                    varying in more than fifty different ways, with variable and invariable changes
                    from zero to 22 French feet, the area of the water being equal to one square
                    inch. The sections of the veins were taken at different distances from the
                    orifice, and the results, which are extremely curious, are illustrated by
                    diagrams.</p>
                <p>In a subsequent memoir, Μ. Bidone gives a theoretical view of his experiments. He
                    considers the greatest contraction of the fluid vein to take place at a distance
                    not more than the greatest diameter of the orifice, whatever be its shape; and
                    hence it follows, that the discharge from the orifice is equal to the sum of the
                    product of each superficial element, multiplied by the velocity of the fluid
                    vein; and since the area of the vena contracta was found to be from 0.60 to
                    0.62, the expenditure will be represented by the product of this coefficient of
                    contraction, and the velocity due to the charge.</p>
                <p>In the case of a fluid vein issuing from a small orifice relative to the section
                    of the vessel, and reduced to a state of permanence, he finds that the area of
                    the section of the vena contracta depends solely on the direction, and not on
                    the velocity, of its component filaments; a result which experiment confirms. Μ.
                    Bidone next ascertains that, in a circular orifice, the absolute diameter of the
                    vena contracta is exactly two-thirds of that of the orifice, the correction
                    which is due to the contraction depending on the adhesion and friction of the
                    fluid against the perimeter of the orifice, and the ratio of the area of the
                    vein to the area of the orifice; the same being true for all orifices.</p>
                <p>34. A series of useful experiments was made in 1827, under the sanction of the
                    French government, by General Sabatier, Commandant of the Military School at
                    Metz. The apparatus which he used consisted of <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    basins. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> had an area of 25,000 square metres:
                    the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> had an area of only 1500 square metres, and a
                    depth of 3.70 metres, and was so contrived by means of sluices, as to have a
                    complete command of the level of the water during the experiment: the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> basin, which communicated directly with the second
                    basin, was 3.68 metres long and 3 wide, to receive the water discharged by the
                    orifices: and the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> basin was a gauge capable of
                    containing 24,000 litres. In carrying on the experiments, the opening of the
                    orifices, the height or charge of the fluid in the reservoir, as well as the
                    level of the water in the gauge basin relative to each discharge of fluid, were
                    measured to the tenth of a millimetre, so that the approximation was at least
                    <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> dth of the whole
                    result.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the principal results of these experiments.</p>
                <p>1. For complete orifices of 20 centimetres square and high charges, the
                    coefficient is 0.600. When the charge is 4 or 5 times the opening of the
                    orifice, the coefficient becomes 0.605, but beyond that charge the coefficient
                    diminishes to 0.593.</p>
                <p>2. The same law takes place for 10 and 5 centimetres in height, the coefficients
                    being for 10 centimetres 0.611, 0.618, 0.611, respectively, and for 5
                    centimetres in height 0.618, 0.631, 0.623.</p>
                <p>3. With orifices of 3, 2, and 1, centimetres in height, the law changes rapidly,
                    and the coefficients increase as the opening of the orifice diminishes, being
                    for 1 centimetre, the smallest height of the orifice. 0.698 to 0∙640 for 3
                    centimetres.</p>
                <p>35. In the year 1830,Mr GeorgeRennie undertook a series <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192937906" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7906-0008"/>of experiments on the
                    friction of water against revolving cylinders and discs, on the direct
                    resistances to globes and discs revolving in air and water alternately, on the
                    coefficients of contraction, and on the expenditure of water through orifices,
                    additional tubes, and pipes of different lengths. The following are some of his
                    principal results.</p>
                <p>1. It appears from his first series of experiments, that, with slow velocities,
                    the friction varies with the surfaces; that an increase of surface did not
                    materially affect the friction ’ with increased velocities; and that, with equal
                    surfaces, the resistances approximated to the squares of the velocities.</p>
                <p>2. In the experiments on the resistances experienced by globes and discs
                    revolving in air and water alternately, it appears that the resistances in both
                    cases were as the squares of the velocities, and that the mean resistances were
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>Resist, in Air. Resist, in water.</p>

                <p>For additional tubes of glass, they were—</p>

                <p>4 feet, . 0.806 ∙</p>
                <p>4. The expenditure through orifices, additional tubes, and pipes of different
                    lengths, of equal areas, and the same kind of water, as compared with the
                    expenditure through a pipe 30 feet long, are—</p>
                <p>For orifices, . . . 3 to 1</p>
                <p>For additional tubes, . . 4 to 1</p>
                <p>For a pipe 1 foot long, . . 3.7 to 1</p>
                <p>2 feet long, . . 1.4 to 1 4 feet long, . . 2.0 to 1 8 feet long, . . 2.6 to 1</p>
                <p>ð. With bent rectangular pipes, half an inch in diameter, and 15 feet long, the
                    expenditure was diminished two-thirds; with 14 bends as compared with a straight
                    pipe, and with 24 bends, one-third; but it did not seem to follow any law.</p>
                <p>36. Many very accurate experiments on the discharge of water from long pipes,
                    were made by James Jardine, Esq. civil-engineer. In the case of the Comisfon
                    Main, which conducts the water from the reservoir at Comiston to the Castle at
                    Edinburgh, the length of the pipe is 14,930 feet, its diameter 4į inches, the
                    altitude 51 feet, and the quantity of water actually delivered 189.4 Scots
                    pints. This valuable result Mr Jardine compared with the different formulae as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>Scots pints.</p>

                <p>37∙ An improvement on the common theory of fluids was lately suggested by
                    Professor Airy, in his lectures at Cambridge. It had been usual to assume the
                    law of equal pressure as a datum of observation. Professor Airy, however, has
                    shewn that this property may be deduced from another more simple and equally
                    given by observation; namely, that the division of a perfect fluid may be
                    effected without the application of sensible force; and hence, it immediately
                    follows, that the state of equilibrium or motion of a mass of fluid, is not
                    altered by a mere separation of its parts by an indefinitely thin partition.
                    Professor Miller has given a definition of fluids founded on this principle, and
                    a proof of the law of equal pressure, at the beginning of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements of Hydrostatics,</hi> &amp;c. published at Cambridge in 1831. Dr
                    Thomas Young had employed an equivalent principle to that of Mr Airy in
                    determining the manner of the reflection of waves of water;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Nat. Phil.</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    64.</p></note> and Mr Challis considers it as necessary in the solution of some
                    hydrostatical and hydrodynamical problems.</p>
                <p>38. There are certain cases in the analytical theory of hydrodynamics which
                    require a more simple analysis than others; such, for example, as those of <hi
                    rend="italic">steady</hi> motion, or of motion which has arrived at a permanent
                    state, so that the velocity is constant in quantity and direction at the same
                    point. Equations applicable to this kind of motion seem to have been first given
                    by Professor Mosely, in his <hi rend="italic">Elementary Treatise on
                    Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics.</hi> The following is the principle from which
                    he has derived them. <hi rend="italic">When the motion is steady, each particle,
                    in passing from one point to another, passes successively through the states of
                    motion of all the particles which at any instant lie in its path.</hi> This
                    general principle is applicable to all kinds of fluids, and is true, whether or
                    not the effect of heat is taken into account, provided the condition of
                    steadiness remains. As it enables us to consider the motion of a single particle
                    in place of that of a number, it readily affords the equations of motion.</p>
                <p>39∙ As it was desirable to knowhowthe same equation might be obtained from the
                    general equations of fluid motion, Mr Challis undertook this inquiry, and
                    published the results of it in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Cambridge Philosophical Society.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vol. iii. Part iv.</p></note> In this paper, he has given a
                    method of doing this both for incompressible and elastic fluids, and he has
                    shewn that a term in the general formulae which occasions the complexity in most
                    hydrodynamical questions, disappears in cases of steady motion. Mr Challis is of
                    opinion, that these equations may be employed in very interesting researches,
                    and he mentions, as instances, the motion of the atmosphere as affected by the
                    rotation of the earth, and a given distribution of temperature due to solar
                    heat.</p>
                <p>40. The science of hydrodynamics has of late years been cultivated by Μ.
                    Eytelwein of Berlin, whose practical conclusions coincide nearly with those of
                    Bossut; by Dr Matthew Young, late Bishop of Clonfert, who has explained the
                    cause of the increased velocity of efflux through additional tubes; and by Mr
                    Vince, Dr T. Young, Coulomb, and Don George Juan; but the limits of this work
                    will not permit us to give any further account of their labours at present. We
                    must now proceed to initiate the reader into the science itself, beginning with
                    that branch of it which relates to the pressure, equilibrium, and cohesion of

                    of capillary attraction.</p>
                <p>DEFINITIONS AND PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</p>
                <p>42. A fluid is a collection of very minute particles, cohering so little among
                    themselves, that they yield to the smallest force, and are easily moved among
                    one another.</p>
                <p>43. Fluids have been divided into <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">imperfect.</hi> In perfect fluids the constituent particles are
                    supposed to be endowed with no cohesive force, and to be moved among one another
                    by a pressure infinitely small. But, in imperfect or viscous fluids, the mutual
                    cohesion of their particles is very sensible, as in oil, varnish, melted glass,
                    &amp;c.; and this tenacity prevents them from yielding to the smallest pressure.
                    Although water, mercury, alcohol, &amp;c. have been classed among perfect
                    fluids, yet it is evident that neither these nor any other liquid is possessed
                    of perfect fluidity. When a glass vessel is filled with water above the brim, it
                    assumes a convex surface; and when a quantity of it is thrown on the floor, it
                    is dispersed into a variety of little globules, which can scarcely be separated
                    from one another. Even mercury, the most perfect of all the fluids, is endowed
                    with such a cohesive force among its particles, that if a glass tube, with a
                    small bore, is immersed in a vessel full of this fluid, the mercury will be
                    lower in the tube than the surface of the surrounding fluid ;—if a small
                    quantity of it be put in a glass vessel, with a gentle rising in the middle of
                    its bottom, the mercury will desert the middle, and form itself into a ring,
                    considerably rounded at the edges; or if several drops of mercury be placed upon
                    a piece of flat glass, they will assume a spherical form; and if brought within
                    certain limits, they will conglobulate and form a single drop. Now, all these
                    phenomena concur to prove, that the particles of water have a mutual attraction
                    for each other; that the particles of mercury have a greater attraction for one
                    another, than for the particles of glass; and, consequently, that these
                    substances are not entitled to the appellation of perfect fluids.</p>
                <p>44. It was universally believed, till within the last seventy years, that water,
                    mercury, and other, fluids of a similar kind, could not be made to occupy a
                    smaller space, by the application of any external force. This opinion was
                    founded on an experiment made by Lord Bacon, who inclosed a quantity of water in
                    a leaden globe, and by applying a great force attempted to compress the water
                    into a less space than it occupied at first: The water, however, made its way
                    through the pores of the metal, and stood on its sur- . face like dew. The same
                    experiment was afterwards repeated at Florence by the Academy del Cimento, who
                    filled a silver globe with water, and hammered it with such force as to alter
                    its form, and drive the water through the pores of the metal. Though these
                    experiments were generally reckoned decisive proofs of incompressibility, yet
                    Bacon himself seems to have, drawn from his experiment a very different
                    conclusion; for after giving an account of it, he immediately adds, that <hi
                    rend="italic">he computed into how much less</hi><hi rend="italic">space the
                    water was driven by this violent pressure.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    Lord Bacon does not seem to have been noticed by any writer on hydrostatics, and
                    appears a complete proof that the compressibility of water was fairly deducible
                    from the issue of his experiment. In consequence of the reliance which was
                    universally placed on the result of the Florentine experiment, fluids have
                    generally been divided into <hi rend="italic">compressible</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">incompressible,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">elastic</hi> and <hi

                    alcohol, and mercury, being regarded as incompressible and non-elastic; and air,
                    steam, and other aeriform fluids, as compressible or elastic.</p>
                <p>45. About the year 1761, the ingenious Mr Canton began to consider this subject
                    with attention, and distrusting the result obtained by the Academy del Cimento,
                    resolved to bring the question to a decisive issue.<note anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> cured a small glass tube, about two feet long, with
                    a ball ati one end, an inch and a quarter in diameter,, he filled the ball and
                    part of the tube with mercury, and brought it to the temperature of 50° of
                    Fahrenheit. The mercury then stood six inches and a half above the ball; but
                    after it had been raised to the top' of the tube by heat, and the tube sealed
                    hermetically, then, upon bringing the mercury to its former temperature of 50°,
                    it stood ⅛⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> th of an</hi> inch higher in the tube than
                    it did before. By repeating the same experiment with water exhausted of air,
                    instead of mercury, the water stood <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 0 <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> h <hi
                    rend="superscript"> of an</hi> inch higher in the tube than it did at first.
                    Hence, it is evident, that when the weight of the atmosphere was removed, the
                    water and mercury expanded, and that the water expanded <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛⅛th <hi rend="superscript"> of an</hi> inch more than the mercury. By
                    placing the apparatus in the receiver of a condensing engine, and condensing the
                    air in the receiver, he increased the pressure upon the water, and found that it
                    descended in the tube. Having thus ascertained the fact, that water and mercury
                    are compressible, he subjected other fluids to similar, experiments, and
                    obtained the results in the following table:</p>
                <p>Millionth Parts. Specific Gravity.</p>
                <p>Compression of Mercury, 3 13.595</p>
                <p>Sea-Water, 40 1.028</p>
                <p>Rain-Water, 46 1.000</p>
                <p>Oil of Olives, 48 0.918</p>
                <p>Spirit of Wine,...66 0.846</p>
                <p>Lest it should be imagined that this small degree of compressibility arose from
                    air imprisoned in the water, Mr Canton made the experiment on some water which
                    had imbibed a considerable quantity of air, and found that its compressibility
                    was not in the least augmented. By inspecting the preceding table, it will be
                    seen that the compressibility of the different fluids is nearly in the inverse
                    ratio of their specific gravities.</p>
                <p>46. The experiments of Mr Canton have been lately confirmed by Professor
                    Zimmerman. He found that seawater was compressed jįŋth part of its bulk, when
                    inclosed in the cavity of a strong iron cylinder, and under the influence of a
                    force equal to a column of sea-water 1000 feet in height. From these facts, it
                    is obvious that fluids are susceptible of contraction and dilatation, and that
                    there is no foundation in nature for their being divided into compressible and
                    incompressible. If fluids are compressible, they will also be elastic; for when
                    the compressing force is removed, they will recover their former magnitude; and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192937932" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7932-0010"/>hence their
                    division into elastic and non-elastic is equally improper.</p>
                <p>A series of very valuable experiments on the compressibility of water has
                    recently been made by Professor Oersted of Copenhagen. At the temperature at
                    which water has a maximum density, which, according to Professor Stampfer of
                    Vienna, is at 38° 75 of Fahrenheit, Professor Oersted found the <hi
                    rend="italic">true</hi> compressibility of water by one atmosphere (or 336
                    French lines of mercury) to be 46.1 millionths of the volume, the difference
                    between the true and the apparent compressibility arising from the effect of the
                    heat developed by the compression, by which the liquid and the bottle are
                    dilated. He found also that the differences of volume in the compressed water
                    are proportional to the compressing power; and that this law holds as far as the
                    pressure of 65 atmospheres, and probably much farther; but how far he was not
                    able to determine, as his apparatus could not resist a greater pressure.</p>
                <p>A series of interesting experiments at high pressures were made by Mr Perkins,
                    who has described the instrument which he employed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1826, p. 541. The following table contains
                    the results which he obtained from 10 to 2000 atmospheres upon a column of water

                    compressions its ordinates, it will be seen that the curve approximates to a

                <p>47. The doctrines of hydrostatics have been deduced by different philosophers
                    from different properties of fluids. Euler has founded his analysis on the
                    following property, “that when fluids are subjected to any pressure, that
                    pressure is so diffused throughout the mass, that when it remains in equilibrio
                    all its parts are equally pressed in every direction.”<note anchored="true"

                    deduced the principles of hydrostatics from the property which fluids have of
                    rising to the same altitude in any number of communicating vessels; but he
                    afterwards<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    adopted the same property as Euler from the foundation which it furnishes for an
                    algebraical calculus. The same property has been employed by Bossut, Prony, and
                    other writers, and will form the first proposition of the following chapter.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER L—ON THE PRESSURE AND EQUILIBRIUM OF FLUIDS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proposition</hi> I.</p>
                <p>48. <hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> a mass of fluid, supposed without weight, is
                    subjected to any pressure, that pressure is so diffused throughout the whole,
                    that when it remains in equilibrio all its parts are equally pressed in every
                    direction.</p>
                <p>As it is the distinguishing property of fluids that their particles yield to the
                    smallest pressure, and are easily moved among themselves (26.), it necessarily
                    follows, that if any particle is more pressed towards one side than towards
                    another, it will move to that side where the pressure is least; and the
                    equilibrium of the fluid mass will be instantly destroyed. But by the hypothesis
                    the fluid is in equilibrio, consequently the particle cannot move towards one
                    side, and must therefore be equally pressed in every direction.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate this general law, let EF (fig. 1.) be a vessel full of any
                    liquid, and let <hi rend="italic">mn, op</hi> be two orifices at equal depths
                    below its surface; then, in order to prevent the water from escaping, it will be
                    necessary to apply two pistons, A and B, to the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn,
                    op</hi> with the same force, whether the orifice be horizontal or vertical, or
                    in any degree inclined to the horizon; so that the pressure to which the fluid
                    mass is subject, which in this case is its own gravity, must be distributed in
                    every direction. But if the fluid has no weight, then the pressure exerted
                    against the fluid at the orifice <hi rend="italic">op,</hi> by means of the
                    piston B, will propagate itself through every part of the circular vessel EF, so
                    that if the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi><hi rend="italic">tu</hi> are
                    shut, and <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> open, the fluid would rush through this
                    aperture, in the same manner as it would rush through <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">tu,</hi> were all the other orifices shut. This
                    proposition, however, is true only in the case of perfect fluids; for when there
                    is a sensible cohesion between the particles, as in water, an equilibrium may
                    exist even when a particle is less pressed in one direction than in another; but
                    this inequality of pressure is so exceedingly trifling, that the proposition may
                    be considered as true, even in cases of imperfect fluidity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>49. If to the equal orifices <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tu,</hi><hi rend="italic">op, rs</hi> of a vessel, containing a fluid destitute
                    of weight, be applied equal powers A, B, C, D, in a perpendicular direction, or
                    if the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> &amp;c. be unequal, and the powers A,
                    B, &amp;c. which are respectively applied to them be proportional to the
                    orifices, these powers will be in equilibro.</p>
                <p>It is evident from the last proposition, that the pressure exerted by the power B
                    is transmitted equally to the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn, rs,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tu,</hi> that the pressure of the power C is transmitted equally
                    to the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn, op,</hi><hi rend="italic">tu,</hi> and so
                    on with all other powers. Every orifice then is influenced with the same
                    pressure, and, consequently, none of the powers A, B, C, D, can yield to the
                    action of the rest. The fluid mass, therefore, will neither change its form nor
                    its situation, and the powers A, B, C, D will be in equilibro. If the powers A,
                    B, C, D are not equal to one another, nor the orifices <hi rend="italic">mn, op,
                    rs,</hi><hi rend="italic">tu;</hi> but if A: B <hi rend="italic">— mn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">op,</hi> and so on with the rest, the
                    fluid will still be in equilibrio. Let A be greater than B, then <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> will be greater than <hi rend="italic">op</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and whatever number of times B is contained in A, so many
                    times will <hi rend="italic">op</hi> be contained in <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi>
                    If A = 2 B, then <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">op,</hi> and
                    since the orifice <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> is double of <hi rend="italic"
                    >op,</hi> the pressure upon it must also be double; and, in order to resist that
                    pressure, the power A must also be double of B; <pb break="no"

                <p>50. The surface of a fluid, influenced by the force of gravity and in equilibrio
                    in any vessel, is horizontal, or at right angles to the direction of
                    gravity.</p>
                <p>Let the surface of the fluid be supposed to assume the waving form APEB. Any
                    particle P in the surface of the fluid is influenced by the force of gravity,
                    which may be represented by PS, and which may be decomposed into two forces P
                    <hi rend="italic">m, Pn</hi> in the direction of the two elementary portions of
                    the surface P <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> P <hi rend="italic">η</hi> (see Article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics).</hi> But since the particle P is in a state of
                    equilibrium, the force of gravity acting in the direction Pw, Pn must be
                    destroyed by equal and opposite forces, exerted by the neighbouring particles
                    against P in the direction <hi rend="italic">m</hi> P, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    P; therefore the forces P <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> P <hi rend="italic">η</hi>
                    are equal to the forces <hi rend="italic">m</hi> P, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> P.
                    Now the particle P being in equilibrio, must be equally pressed in every
                    direction (48). Wherefore the forces P <hi rend="italic">m, Pn</hi> are equal,
                    and by the doctrine of the composition of forces (see Article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dynamics),</hi> the angle <hi rend="italic">m Pn</hi> formed by
                    the two elementary portions P <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> P <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> of the surface of the fluid, must be bisected by PS, the line which
                    represents the direction of gravity. The same may be proved of every other point
                    of the surface of the fluid; and therefore this surface must be horizontal or
                    perpendicular to the direction of gravity.</p>
                <p>51. This proposition may be otherwise demonstrated. From the principles of
                    mechanics, it is obvious, that when the centre of gravity of any body is at
                    rest, the body itself is at rest; and that when this centre is not supported,
                    the body itself will descend, till it is prevented by some obstacle from getting
                    farther. In the same manner the centre of gravity of a fluid mass will descend
                    to the lowest point possible; and it can be shewn that this centre will be in
                    its lowest position only when the surface of the fluid mass is horizontal. For
                    let FGHI (fig. 2) be any surface, whether solid or fluid, and C its centre of
                    gravity, the point C is nearer the line HI when FGis parallel to HI and
                    rectilineal, than when it has any other form or position. When the surface FGHI
                    is suspended by the point C, or balanced upon it, it will be in equilibrio; but
                    if the line FG is made to assume any other form as F <hi rend="italic"
                    >rstop,</hi> by removing the portion <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >op</hi> of the surface to <hi rend="italic">rst,</hi> the equilibrium, will be
                    destroyed, and the side FG will preponderate. In order, therefore, to restore
                    the equilibrium, the surface must be Balanced on a point <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> farther from HI; that is, the centre of gravity of the surface Frs∕cψIH
                    is <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> In the same way it may be shewn, that whatever be
                    the form of the bounding line FG, the quantity of surface remaining the same,
                    its centre of gravity will be nearest HI, when FG is rectilineal and parallel to
                    it. On the truth contained in this proposition depends the art of levelling, and
                    the construction of the spirit level, for an account of which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Levelling.</hi></p>
                <p>52. As the direction of gravity is in lines which meet near the centre of the
                    earth; and as it appears from this’ proposition, that the surface of fluids is
                    perpendicular to that direction, their surface will be a portion of a spheroid
                    similar to the earth. When the surface has no great extent, it may be safely
                    considered as a plane; but when it is pretty large, the curvature of the earth
                    must be taken into account.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> IV.</p>
                <p>53. The surface of a fluid influenced by the force of gravity, and contained in
                    any number of communicating vessels, however different in form and position,
                    will be horizontal.</p>
                <p>Let AB, CD, EF, GH, IK, be a system of communicating vessels into which a
                    quantity of fluid is conveyed: It will rise to the same height in each vessel,
                    and have a horizontal surface. Suppose ABEF, fig. 4, a vessel full of water. By
                    the last proposition, its surface ST will be horizontal. Now, if any body be
                    plunged into this vessel, the cylinder AD for instance, the surface of the fluid
                    will still be horizontal; for no reason could be assigned for the water’s rising
                    on one side of this body any more than on another. Let us now immerge into the
                    fluid, successively, the solid bodies AD, CEŕ, GHF, &amp;c., then after each
                    immersion the surface will still be horizontal; and when all these solids are
                    immerged, the large vessel ABFE will be converted into the system of
                    communicating vessels re presented in fig. 4, in which the surface of the*fluid
                    will, of consequence, be horizontal.</p>
                <p>54. This proposition may be also demonstrated by supposing the parts AD, CEř,
                    GHF, &amp;c. converted into ice without changing their former magnitude. When
                    this happens, the equilibrium will not be disturbed; and the fluid mass AF,
                    whose surface was proved to be horizontal by the last proposition, will continue
                    in the same state after the congelation of some of its parts. That is, the
                    surface of the fluid in the communicating vessels will be horizontal.</p>
                <p>55. When the communicating vessels are so small that they may be regarded as
                    capillary tubes, the surface of the fluid will not be horizontal. From the
                    attraction which all fluids have for glass, they rise to a greater height in
                    smaller tubes than in larger ones, and the quantity of elevation is in the
                    inverse ratio of the diameters of the bores. In the case of mercury, and
                    probably of melted metals, the fluid substance is depressed in capillary tubes,
                    and the depression is subject to the same law. The subject of capillary
                    attraction will be treated at length in a subsequent part of this article.</p>
                <p>56. This proposition explains the reason why the sur face of small pools in the
                    vicinity of rivers is always on <pb break="no" facs="nls:192937958"

                    when there is any subterraneous communication between the river and the pool.
                    The river and the pool may be considered as communicating vessels.</p>

                <p>57∙ If a mass of fluid contained in a vessel be in equilibrio, any particle
                    whatever is equally pressed in every direction, with a force equal to the weight
                    of a column of particles whose height is equal to the depth of the particle
                    pressed below the surface of the fluid.</p>

                    filled with any flu d; then if the tube is not of the capillary kind, the fluid

                    the fluid in the vessel. Now it is evident, that the particle <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is pressed equally in every direction: Therefore, the

                    or, in other words, <hi rend="italic">that any quantity of fluid, however small,

                    communicating vessels AB, CD, will rise to the same level, whatever be their
                    size, the fluid in AB evidently balances the fluid in CD; and any surface <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> is pressed with the same force in the direction B<hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> by the small column A B, as it is pressed in the direction
                    D<hi rend="italic">m</hi> by the larger column CD.</p>
                <p>62. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor. i.</hi> From this proposition it follows, that the
                    whole pressure on the sides of a vessel which are perpendicular to its base, is
                    equal to the weight of a rectangular prism of the fluid, whose altitude is that
                    of the fluid, and whose base is a parallelogram, one side of which is equal to
                    the altitude of the fluid, and the other to half the perimeter of the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor. hi.</hi> In a cubical vessel the pressure against one

                    one. Hence, as the pressure against the bottom is equal to the weight of the
                    fluid in the vessel, the pressure against both the sides and bottom will be
                    equal to three times that weight.</p>

                    distributed over the whole surface: Or, it is that point to which, if a force
                    equal to the total pressure were applied in a contrary direction, the one would
                    exactly balance the other, or, in other words, the force applied and the total

                <p>64. The centre of pressure coincides with the centre of percussion.</p>
                <p>Let AB be a vessel full of water, and CE the section of a plane whose centre of
                    pressure is required. Prolong CE till it cuts the surface of the water in Μ.
                    Take any point D, and draw DO, EP, CN, perpendicular to the surface MP. Then if
                    Μ be made the axis of suspension of the plane CE, the centre of percussion of
                    the plane CE revolving round Μ will also be the centre of pressure. If MCE moves
                    round Μ as a centre, and strikes any object, the percussive force of any point C
                    is as its velocity, that is, as its distance CM from the centre of motion;
                    therefore the percussive force of the points C, D, E, are as the lines CM, DM,
                    EM. But the pressures upon the point C, D, E, are as the lines CN, DO, EP, and
                    these lines are to one another as CM, DM, EM; therefore the percussive forces of
                    the points C, D, E, are as the pressures upon these points. Consequently, the
                    centre of pressure will always coincide with the centre of percussion.</p>

                    for illustrating the Pressure of Fluids.</hi></p>
                <p>65. We have already shewn in Art 57, that the pressure upon the bottoms of
                    vessels filled with fluids does not depend upon the quantity of fluid which they
                    contain, but upon its particular altitude. This proposition has been called the
                    Hydrostatical Paradox, and is excellently illustrated by the following machine.
                    In fig. 10, AB is a box which contains about a pound of water, and <hi
                    rend="italic">abed</hi> a glass tube fixed to the end C of the beam of the
                    balance, and the other end to a moveable bottom which supports the water in the
                    box, the bottom and wire being of an equal weight with an empty scale hanging at
                    the other end of the balance. If one pound weight be put into the empty scale,
                    it will make the bottom rise a little, and the water will appear at the bottom
                    of the tube <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> consequently it will press with a force of
                    one pound upon the bottom. If another pound be put into the scale, the water
                    will rise to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> twice as high as the point <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> above the bottom of the vessel. If a third, a fourth, and
                    a fifth pound be put successively into the scale, the water wall rise at each
                    time to c, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the divisions
                    <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">be, cd, de,</hi> being all equal.
                    This will be the case, however small be the bore of the glass tube; and since,
                    when the water is at <hi rend="italic">b, c, d, e,</hi> the pressures upon the
                    bottom are successively twice, thrice, four times, and five times as great as
                    when the water was contained wdthin the box, we are entitled to conclude that
                    the pressure upon the bottom of the vessel depends altogether on the altitude of
                    the water in the glass tube, and not upon the quantity it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192937984" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7984-0014"/>contains. If a long narrow
                    tube full of water, therefore, be fixed in the top of a cask likewise full of
                    water, then though the tube be so small as not to hold a pound of the fluid, the
                    pressure of the water in the tube will be so great on the bottom of the cask, as
                    to be in danger of bursting it; for the pressure is the same as if the cask was
                    continued up in its full size to the height of the tube, and filled with water.
                    Upon this principle it has been affirmed that a certain quantity of water,
                    however small, may be rendered capable of exerting a force equal to any
                    assignable one, by increasing the height of the column, and diminishing the base
                    on which it presses. This, however, has its limits; for .when the tube becomes
                    so small as to belong to the capillary kind, the attraction of the glass will
                    support a considerable quantity of the water it contains, and therefore diminish
                    the pressure upon its base.</p>
                <p>66. The preceding machine must be so constructed, that the moveable bottom may
                    have no friction against the inside of the box, and that no water may get
                    between it and the box. The method of effecting this will be manifest from fig.
                    11, where AB CD is a section of the box, and <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> its
                    lid, which is made very light. The moveable bottom E, with a groove round its
                    edges, is put into a bladder <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> which is tied close
                    around it in the groove by a strong waxed thread. The upper part of the bladder
                    is put over the top of the box at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> all around, and is kept firm by the lid <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> so
                    that if water be poured into the box through the aperture <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll</hi> in its lid, it will be contained in the space <hi rend="italic"
                    >f~E,gh,</hi> and the bottom may be raised by pulling the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> fixed to it at E.</p>
                <p>67. The upward pressure of fluids is excellently illustrated by the hydrostatic
                    bellows. The form given to this machine by the ingenious Mr Ferguson <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lectures,</hi> vol. ii∙ p. 111) is represented in fig. 12, where
                    ABCD is an oblong square box, into one of whose sides is fixed the upright glass
                    tube <hi rend="italic">a</hi> I, which is bent into a right angle at the lower
                    end as at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> fig. 13.: To this bent extremity is tied the
                    neck of a large bladder K, which lies in the bottom of the box. Over this
                    bladder is placed the moveable board L, fig. 14, in which the upright wire Μ is
                    fixed. Leaden weights NN, with holes in their centre, to the amount of 16
                    pounds, are put upon this wire, and press with all their weight upon the board
                    L. The cross bar P is then put on, in order to keep the glass tube in an upright
                    position; and afterwards the piece EFG for keeping the weights N, N horizontal,
                    and the wire Μ vertical. Four upright pins, about an inch long, are placed in
                    the corners of the box, for the purpose of supporting the board L, and
                    preventing it from pressing together the sides of the bladder. When the machine
                    is thus fitted up, pour water into the tube I till the bladder is filled up to
                    the board L. Continue pouring in more water, and the upward pressure which it
                    will excite in the bladder will raise the board with all the weights NN, even
                    though the bore of the tube should be so small as to contain no more than an
                    ounce of water.</p>
                <p>68. That the pressure of fluids arises from their gravity, and is propagated in
                    every direction, may be proved by the following experiment. Insert into an empty
                    vessel a number of glass tubes bent into various angles. Into their lower
                    orifices introduce a quantity of mercury, which will rest in the longer legs on
                    a level with these orifices. Let the vessel be afterwards filled with water; and
                    it will be seen, while the vessel is filling, that the mercury is gradually
                    pressed from the lower orifices towards the higher, where the water is prevented
                    from entering. Now, in consequence of the various angles into which the glass
                    tubes arc bent, the lower orifices point to almost every direction; and
                    therefore it follows, that the pressure of tĥe superincumbent water is
                    propagated in every direction. When a straight tube is employed to shew the
                    upward pressure of fluids, the mercury which is introduced into its lower
                    extremity must be kept in by the finger till the height of the water above the
                    orifice is equal to fourteen times the length of the column of quicksilver: When
                    the finger is removed the mercury will ascend in the tube.</p>
                <p>69∙ The pressure of the superior strata of fluids upon the inferior strata may be
                    shewn in the following manner. Immerse two tubes of different bores, but not of
                    the capillary kind, in a vessel of mercury. The mereury will rise in the tube on
                    a level with its surface in the vessel. Let water then be poured upon the
                    mercury so as not to enter the upper orifices of the tubes, the pressure of the
                    water upon the inferior fluid will cause the mercury to ascend in the tubes
                    above the level of that in the vessel, but to the same height in both tubes. The
                    columns of quicksilver in the two tubes are evidently supported by the pressure
                    of the water on the inferior fluid. The same experiment may be made with oil and
                    tinged water, the latter being made the inferior fluid.</p>
                <p>70. The syphon is an instrument which shews the gravitation of fluids, and is
                    frequently employed for decanting liquors. It is nothing more than a bent tube
                    BAC, fig. 15, having one of its legs longer than the other. The shorter leg AC
                    is immersed in the fluid contained in the vessel Μ; and if, by applying the
                    mouth to the orifice B, the air be sucked out of the tube, the water in the
                    vessel Μ will flow off till it be completely emptied. Now, it is obvious, that
                    the atmosphere which has a tendency to raise the water in the shorter leg AC by
                    its pressure on the surface <pb break="no" facs="nls:192937997"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7997-0015"/>of the water at Μ, has the same tondency to
                    prevent the water from falling from the orifice B, by its pressure there, and
                    therefore if the syphon nad equal legs, no water could possibly issue from the
                    orifice. But when the leg AB is longer than AC, the column of fluid which it
                    contains being likewise longer, will, by its superior weight, cause the water to
                    flow from the orifice B, and the velocity of the issuing fluid will increase as
                    the difference between the two legs of the syphon is made greater.</p>
                <p>The syphon is greatly improved by fixing a stop-cock D at the end of the longer
                    branch, and plcing on the same branch a small bent tube DE, communicating with
                    the tube AB above D. When the aperture C is placed in the water to be drawn off,
                    the mouth of the stop-cock D is closed, and the air is drawn out by suction at L
                    from the longer branch. When there is no stop-cock at D, the finger may be
                    applied there, till the air is sucked out at E.</p>
                <p>An improved syphon by Μ. Bunten is shewn in fig. 16. where a bulb A is placed on
                    the long branch AB. This syphon requires neither to be blown into nor sucked.
                    When the long branch AB and bulb A are filled with fluid, and the other branch
                    plunged in the fluid, the flow will be unremitting, as the bulb A in emptying
                    itself draws off the liquid in contact with the short branch.</p>
                <p>Another improvement on the syphon is shewn in fig. 17∙ as made by Μ. Hempel of
                    Berlin. The short branch has fitted into it a vertical tube BA, terminating in a
                    funnel A. A part of the liquid to be drawn off is then poured into the funnel A,
                    and as socn as the flow commences the long branch DC, the tube AB is withdrawn,
                    and the flow continues.</p>
                <p>Another improvement on the syphon made by Mr Hunter of Thurston, is shewn in fig.
                    18. which has the peculiar advantage of retaining its charge. Two small cups or
                    boxes A, B are fixed to the ends of the unequal branches by two screws C, C.
                    When it is charged in the common way, and has been in use, it will stand
                    vertically in the boxes A, B as a base, so that, when it is lifted by the ring
                    D, it may be replaced, and will act as before. The same effect may be obtained
                    by turning up the ends of the branches, and fixing to them a plate or piece of
                    metal, upon which they may stand.</p>
                <p>À moveable branch syphon, in which there is a joint at the top D, is a most
                    valuable instrument, and the idea of it was first given by the late Mr Bryce,
                    who employed it in place cf a stomach-pump, in order to throw fluids into the
                    stomach, or to extract them from it. The two branches may be made of metal,
                    glass, or any other substance, the two parts being united by an air-tight joint.
                    In cases of exigency two glass tubes, or pieces of any tube, might be joined
                    into a syphon, by making the joint of a piece of bladder. One of the branches
                    may be raised into any position for the purpose of charging it, and the
                    instrument may be hung up charged, and ready for use, by a ring at the extremity
                    of each branch.</p>
                <p>71. In order to shew that the effect of the syphon depends upon the gravitation
                    of fluids, Μ. Pascal devised the following experiment: In the large glass vessel
                    AB, fasten by means of bees-wax two cylindrical cups α, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> containing tinged water, whose surface is about an inch higher in the
                    one ) than in the other. Into the tinged I water insert the legs of a glass iļ
                    syphon <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> having an open tube <hi rend="italic">e</hi> I
                    fixed into the middle of it, and put I a wooden cover on the vessel with I a
                    hole in its centre to receive the I tube, and keep it in a vertical po! sition.
                    Then through the funnel f, fixed in another part of the cover, ļ pour oil of
                    turpentine into the larger vessel till it flow into the cups <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b,</hi> ' and rise above the arch of the syphon. The pressure of the oil
                    upon the tinged water in the cups will cause the water to pass through the
                    syphon from the higher cup to the lower, till the surfaces of the water in both
                    the cups be reduced to a level. In order to expla n this, suppose a horizontal
                    plane <hi rend="italic">eb</hi> to pass through the legs of the syphon, and the
                    tinged water in the cups, the parts of this plane Within the legs when the

                <p>A dike is an obstacle either natural or artificial, which opposes itself to the
                    constant effort of water to spread itself in every direction.</p>
                <p>72. In discussing this important branch of hydraulic architecture, we must
                    inquire into the thickness and form which must be given to the dike in order to
                    resist the pressure of the water. In this inquiry the dike may be considered as
                    a solid body, which the water tends to overthrow, by turning it round upon its
                    posterior angle C; or it may be regarded as a solid, whose foundation is
                    immoveable, but which does not resist the pressure of the water through the
                    whole of its height, and which may be separated into horizontal sections by the
                    efforts of the fluid. A dike may considered also as a solid body which can be
                    neither broken nor overturned, but which may be pushed horizontally from its
                    base, and can preserve its stability only by the friction of its base on the
                    ground which supports it. On these conditions are founded the calculations in
                    the following proposition which contain the most useful information that theory
                    can ^∣ggest upon the construction of dikes.</p>

                    the horizontal forces are also resisted by the weight of the dike, whose
                    momentum we have called Z, therefore c-Z, &lt;r being the specific gravity of
                    the dike, will be the momentum of the dike. We have now three forces acting at
                    once, viz. the horizontal force of the water striving to overturn the dike, and
                    the vertical force of the water combined with the momentum of the dike, striving
                    to resist its overthrow, therefore we shall have an equilibrium between these
                    three forces, when the momentum of the horizontal forces is made equal to the
                    momentum of the vertical forces, added to that of the dike itself,
                    consequently</p>

                <p>75. As it is necessary, however, to give more stability to the dike than what is
                    just requisite to preserve its equilibrium, we must make its dimensions such as
                    to resist a force greater than the horizontal forces, a force, for example, <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> times the momentum of the horizontal forces.<note

                    water tending to keep the dike upon its^ base.</p></note> The equation will
                    therefore become</p>

                    σZ, which comprehends every possible case of stability; for if we wish the
                    stability of the dike to have double the stability of equilibrium, we have only
                    to make <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 2. The preceding general equation is
                    susceptible of a variety of applications according to the nature of the curves
                    which form the sides of the dike. It is at present worthy of remark, that since
                    the momentum of the horizontal forces is always the same, whatever be the
                    curvature of the sides AC, BD, and since the momentum of the vertical forces
                    increases as the angle CDH diminishes, it follows that it will always be <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi> advantageous to diminish the angle CDH, and give as
                    much slope as possible to the sides of the dike.</p>
                <p>76. Let us now consider the conditions that may be necessary to prevent the dike
                    ABCD from sliding on its base CD. Since the base of the dike is supposed
                    horizontal, the force which the dike opposes to the horizontal efforts of the
                    water arises solely from the adhesion of the dike to its base, and from the
                    resistance of friction. These two forces, therefore, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192938023" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8023-0017"/>combined with the weight of
                    the dike, form the force which resists the horizontal efforts of the water; an
                    equilibrium will consequently obtain when the three first forces are made equal
                    to the last. But the force of adhesion, and the resistance of friction, being
                    unknown, may be made equal to the weight of the dike multiplied by the constant
                    quantity <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> which must be determined by experience. Now,
                    calling A the area of the section ABCD, we shall have o-A for its weight, and
                    m&lt;rA for the resistance which is opposed to the horizontal efforts of the
                    water. But we have already seen that the horizontal forces of the water upon Μ
                    are equal to <hi rend="italic">syy,</hi> whose fluent <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛sa</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> (when <hi rend="italic">a
                    =</hi><hi rend="italic">?/)</hi> is the sum of all the horizontal forces;
                    consequently, when an equilibrium takes place between these opposing forces, we
                    shall have,</p>
                <p>£ ĆZ^</p>

                <p>We might have added to the weight of the dike the vertical pressure of the water,
                    but it has been neglected for the purpose of having the dike sufficiently strong
                    to resist an additional force.</p>
                <p>77∙ We shall now proceed to inquire into the form which the general equation
                    assumes when the sides of the dike are rectilineal. Let AC, BD, fig. 21. be two
                    lines inclined to the horizon under given angles ACD, BDC, and let AB, CD be two
                    horizontal lines. Retaining the construction and symbols in art. 73, let fall
                    AQ, BZ, perpendicular to CD, and make AQ = BZ = <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> CO.

                    time the advantage of inclining the sides of the dike, let us suppose the depth
                    of the water, and also the height of the dike, to be 18 feet, so that B will
                    coincide with H. Let us also suppose, what is generally the case in practice,
                    that the declivity of the sides is ⅞ of <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938036"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8036-0018"/>their altitude, that is DZ — CQ. = ¢ BZ. Let the
                    specific gravity of the dike be to that of water as 12 to 7; and suppose it is
                    wished to make the stability of the dike twice as great as the stability of
                    equilibrium, that is, to make it capable of resisting a force twice as great as
                    that which it really sustains. Then, upon these conditions, we shall have BZ =
                    HT, or <hi rend="italic">a =d</hi> = 18 feet; CO, = DZ = DT, or <hi
                    rend="italic">r' = τ = b</hi> = 3 feet; <hi rend="italic">s-1',</hi> σ∙ = 12;
                    and <hi rend="italic">n =</hi> 2. By substituting these numerical values in the

                <p>45 4599 <hi rend="subscript"> r i</hi> a quadratic equation, which, after
                    reduction, will give <hi rend="italic">z =</hi> 12 feet nearly. When <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> = 12, the area of the dike AB CD will be 162 square
                    feet.</p>
                <p>81. Let us now suppose the sides of the dike to be vertical, the equation No. V.
                    will give us <hi rend="italic">z—</hi> 11 feet 2 inches, which makes the area of
                    the dike more than 201 square feet. The area of the dike with inclined sides is
                    therefore to its area with vertical sides nearly as 4 to 5: and hence we may
                    conclude that a dike with inclined sides has the same stability as a dike with
                    vertical sides, while it requires 1/6 less materials.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>82. To find the dimensions of a dike which can neither slide upon its base, nor
                    turn round its posterior angle; but which is composed of horizontal sections,
                    which may be separated from each other.</p>
                <p>In solving this proposition, we must find tile curvature of the side exposed to
                    the pressure of the water, which will make all the different sections or
                    horizontal laminae equally capable of resisting the different forces which tend
                    to separate them. If the lamina NM does not resist the column PM, which partly
                    presses it in the direction MN as powerfully as the lamina <hi rend="italic"
                    >nm</hi> resists the horizontal pressure of the column <hi rend="italic"
                    >pm,</hi> the lamina NM is in danger of being separated from the lamina <hi
                    rend="italic">nm.</hi> But if all the laminae NM, <hi rend="italic">nm</hi>
                    resist with equal force the horizontal effects of the water, and if the dike
                    cannot be made to slide upon its base nor turn round its posterior angle T, it
                    cannot possibly yield to the pressure of the water; for it is &gt;mpossible to
                    separate one lamina from another, unless the one opposes a less resistance than
                    the other. To simplify the investigation as much as possible, let us suppose the
                    posterior side of the dike to be vertical, and the depth of the water to be
                    equal to the height of the dike.</p>
                <p>83. Let ABC be the section of the dike, AK the surface of the water, AC the
                    curvature required, AB its posterior side; MN <hi rend="italic">nm</hi> a
                    horizontal lamina infinitely small, in the direction of which the dike has a
                    tendency to break, in consequence of the efforts of the water upon AM.</p>
                <p>If the dike should break in the direction MN, the superior part AMN will detach
                    itself from the inferior part Μ NBC, by moving from Μ towards N; and at the
                    moment when the impulse takes place, it will have a small motion of rotation
                    round the point N. We must therefore determine the forces which act upon the
                    lamina MN <hi rend="italic">nm,</hi> and form an equation expressing their
                    equilibrium round the point N. The forces alluded to are evidently, 1. The
                    horizontal efforts of the water; 2. The vertical efforts of the water; 3. The
                    weight of the part ÃMN; and, 4. The adhesion of the two surfaces MN, <hi
                    rend="italic">mn.</hi> Of these four forces, the first is the only one which has
                    a tendency to overthrow the portion AMN of the dike; and its efforts are
                    resisted by the three other forces. In order to find the momenta of these forces
                    with regard to the point N, let us suppose</p>
                <p>AP = NM <hi rend="italic">= x</hi></p>

                <p>86. The absolute weights of different bodies of the same bulk are called their
                    <hi rend="italic">specific gravities</hi> or <hi rend="italic">densities</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and one body is said to be <hi rend="italic">specifically
                    heavier</hi> or <hi rend="italic">specifically lighter</hi> than another, when
                    under the same bulk it contains a greater or less quantity of matter. Brass, for
                    example, is said to have eight times the specific gravity of water, because one
                    cubic inch of brass contains eight times the quantity of matter, or is eight
                    times heavier than a cubic inch of water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>87∙ Fluids pressing against each other in two or more communicating vessels, will
                    be in equilibrio when the perpendicular altitudes above the level of their
                    junction are in the inverse ratio of their specific gravities.</p>
                <p>If a quantity of mercury be poured into the vessel FMN, it will be in •
                    equilibrio when it rises to the same level AHIB, in both tubes. Take away an
                    inch of mercury ACDH, and substitute in its room 13-ļ inches of water FCDG. Then
                    since mercury is 13∣ times heavier than water, 13 J inches of water will have
                    the same absolute weight as one inch of mercury, and the equilibrium will not be
                    disturbed; for the column of water FD will exert the same pressure upon the
                    surface CD of the mercury, as the smaller column of mercury did formerly. The
                    surface of the mercury, therefore, will remain at IB: now, since AB, CE, are
                    horizontal lines, AC will be equal to IK; but FC was made 13⅛ times AC,
                    therefore FC = 13∣ times IK, that is FC: IK= 13į: 1, the ratio between the
                    specific gravities of mercury and water.</p>
                <p>88. On this proposition depends the theory of the barometer. Let a quantity of
                    mercury be introduced into the tube FMN, and let the pressure of the atmosphere
                    be removed from the surface IB; the pressure of the air upon the other surface
                    CD will be the same as if the tube FD were continued to the top of the
                    atmosphere, and therefore, instead of the column of water FD we have a column of
                    air equal to the height of the atmosphere acting against the mercury CDMĨB; the
                    mercury consequently will rise towards Ñ, so that its height will be to the
                    height of the atmosphere as the specific gravity of air is to the specific
                    gravity of mercury; but as the density of the air diminishes as it recedes from
                    the earth, we must take the specific gravity of the air at a mean height in the
                    atmosphere. It is obvious from the proposition, that the altitude of the column
                    of mercury which balances the column of air, must be reckoned from CD, the level
                    of their junction; and that, when the specific gravity of the air is diminished,
                    the mercury will fall, and will again rise when it regains its former
                    density.</p>

                <p>89∙ If any body is immersed in a fluid, or floats on its surface, it is pressed

                    upwards with the difference of these forces, that is, with a force equivalent to
                    the column of fluid <hi rend="italic">m</hi> EF <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> for
                    CEFD — C <hi rend="italic">mriD</hi><hi rend="italic">— m</hi> EF??. In the same
                    way it may be shewn, that the remaining part FH is pressed upwards with a force
                    equal to the w eight of a column «FHo; and therefore it follows, that the
                    rectangle fflEHo is pressed upwards with a force equivalent to a column <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> EH o, that is, to the quantity of fluid displaced.</p>
                <p>90. If the body floats in the fluid, like CH in the vessel AB, the same
                    consequence will follow; for the body CH is evidently pressed upwards with a
                    force equivalent to the column <hi rend="italic">mEHo,</hi> that is, to the part
                    immersed or the quantity of fluid displaced. Now, as the same may be
                    demonstrated of every other section of a solid parallelepiped, we may conclude,
                    that the proportion is true with respect to every solid whose section is
                    rectangular.</p>
                <p>91. When the solid has any other form, as CD, however irregular, we may conceive
                    its section to be divided into I a number of very small rectangles <hi
                    rend="italic">no·,</hi> then (57.) the small portion of the solid at <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> is pressed downwards by a column of particles <hi
                    rend="italic">m n,</hi> and the small portion at <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is
                    pressed upwards by a column of particles equal to <hi rend="italic">n o</hi>;
                    therefore the difference of these forces, viz. the column <hi rend="italic">n
                    o,</hi> is the force with which the portion <hi rend="italic">ο</hi> is pressed
                    upwards. In the same manner it can be shewn, that every other similar portion of
                    the lower surface of the solid CD is pressed upwards with a force equal to a
                    column of particles whose height is equal to the vertical breadth of the solid;
                    but all these columns o particles must occupy the same space as the solid
                    itself, therefore any solid body immersed in a fluid, or floating on its
                    surface, is pressed upwards with a force equal to the weight of the quantity of
                    fluid displaced.</p>
                <p>92. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. When a body floats in a fluid, the weight
                    of the quantity of fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the floating solid.
                    For since the solid is in equilibrium with the fluid, the force which causes it
                    to descend must be equal to the force which presses it upwards; but the force
                    which keeps a part of the solid immerged in the fluid is the weight of the
                    solid, and the force which presses the solid upwards, and prevents it from
                    sinking, is equivalent to the weight of the quantity of fluid displaced (89∙);
                    there-tore<pb break="no" facs="nls:192938062" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8062-0020"/>
                    these forces, and the weights to which <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> they are
                    equivalent, must be equal.</p>
                <p>93. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. A solid weighed in a fluid loses as much of
                    its weight as is equal to the weight of the quantity of fluid displaced; for
                    since the body is pressed upwards with a force equal to the weight of the fluid
                    displaced (89∙), this pressure acts in direct opposition to the natural gravity
                    or absolute weight of the solid, and therefore diminishes its absolute weight by
                    a quantity equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The part of the weight
                    thus lost is not destroyed: It is only sustained by a force acting in a contrary
                    direction.</p>
                <p>94. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. A solid immersed in a fluid will sink, if
                    its specific gravity exceed that of the fluid: It will float on the surface,
                    partly immersed, if its specific gravity be less than that of the fluid; and it
                    will remain wholly immersed wherever it is placed, if the specific gravities of
                    the solid and fluid are equal. In the first case, the force with which the solid
                    is pressed downwardly exceeds the upward pressure, and therefore it must sink.
                    In the second case, the upward pressure exceeds the pressure downwards, and
                    therefore the body must float; and, in the third case, the upward and downward
                    pressures being equal, the solid will remain wherever it is placed.</p>
                <p>95. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 4. The specific gravities of two or more
                    fluids -are to one another as the losses of weight sustained by the same solid
                    body, and specifically heavier than the fluids, when weighed in each fluid
                    respectively. The solid in this case displaces equal quantities of each fluid;
                    but the losses of weight are respectively as the absolute weights of the
                    quantities displaced (Cor. 2.), therefore the specific gravities, which are as
                    the absolute weights of equal quantities of any body (86.), must be as the
                    losses of weight sustained by the immersed solid.</p>
                <p>96. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 5. The specific gravity of a solid is to that
                    of a fluid as the absolute weight of the solid is to the loss of weight which it
                    sustains when weighed in the fluid. For since the loss of weight sustained by
                    the solid is equal to the absolute weight of the quantity of fluid displaced, or
                    of a quantity of fluid of the same bulk as the solid, the specific gravities,
                    which (86.) are in the ratio of the absolute weights of equal volumes, must be
                    as the absolute weight of the solid to the loss of w eight which it
                    sustains.</p>
                <p>97∙ <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 6. The specific gravity of a solid floating in
                    a fluid, is to the specific gravity of the fluid itself, as the bulk of the part
                    immersed is to the total bulk of the solid.</p>
                <p>98. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 7∙ Bodies which sustain equal losses of weight
                    are of the same bulk. For, since the losses of weight arc as the weights of the
                    quantities of fluid displaced, and as the quantities displaced are as the bulks
                    of the solids which displace them, the bulks must be equal when the losses of
                    weight are equal.</p>
                <p>99∙ The preceding corollaries may be expressed algebraically, and may be deduced
                    from a general equation in the following manner. Let B be the total bulk of a
                    floating body, and C the part of it which is immersed; let S be the specific
                    gravity of the solid, and .s∙ that of the fluid. Then it is obvious, that the
                    absolute weight of the solid will be expressed by B × S, and the absolute weight
                    of the fluid displaced by C × .s∙; for the fluid displaced has the same bulk as
                    the part of the solid which is immersed. In order that an equilibrium may obtain
                    between the solid and fluid, we must have B × S = C × .s ’: Now, when .v^S, we
                    have B C, so that the solid will float, which is the second case of Cor. 3—When
                    S <hi rend="italic">= s</hi> we have B = C, which is the third case of Cor.
                    3.—When we have Cz&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> 'B, that is, the body will
                    sink below the surface; and it will descend to the bottom, for it cannot be
                    suspended in the fluid without some power to support it; and if such a power
                    were necessary, we should have B × S C × <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which is
                    contrary to the equation of equilibrium.</p>
                <p>100. From the equation B × S = C × v we have (Euclid VI. 16.) S: ∙s <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> = B: C, which is Cor. 6—When the body is completely
                    immersed we have B = C, in which case the equation becomes B×S = B ×.s∙; and
                    when the solid is specifically heavier than the fluid, it will require a
                    counterweight to keep the solid suspended in the fluid. Let W be the
                    counterweight necessary for keeping the solid suspended in the fluid, then in
                    the case of an equilibrium the equation will beB×s + W = B×S, or B×S — W = B×s,
                    or S × B × S — W = S × B × <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> whence (Euclid VI. 16.) S:
                    s = B×S:B×S — W, which is Cor. 5.</p>
                <p>101. If the same solid body is plunged in a second fluid of a different specific
                    gravity from the first, let &lt;r be the specific gravity of the second fluid,
                    and w the counterweight necessary to keep the solid suspended in it The equation
                    for the first fluid was B ×^+W = B×S (100.), and the equation for the second
                    fluid will beB ×σ- -į- <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = B × S; therefore we shall
                    have, by the first equation, S × B — W = .s∙ X B, and by the second S×B — w =
                    σ-×B, and consequently <hi rend="smallcaps">í×B</hi>: s∙×B=S×B—W: Sx B— <hi

                    W: S×B — <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which is Cor. 4.; for the losses of weight in
                    each fluid are evidently represented by S X B — W and S×B — <hi rend="italic"
                    >w.</hi></p>
                <p>102. If B and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> express the bulks of two solids, S and s
                    their specific gravities, &lt;r the specific gravity of the fluid, and W, <hi

                    with the solid v the equation will be ∙r X <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi

                <p>103. From the preceding proposition and its corollaries, we may deduce a method
                    of detecting adulteration in the precious metals, and of resolving the problem
                    proposed to Archimedes, by Hiero, king of Syracuse. Take a real guinea, and a
                    counterfeit one made of copper and gold. If the latter be lighter than the
                    former, when weighed in a pair of scales, the imposition is instantly detected;
                    but should their weight be the same, let the two coins be weighed in water, and
                    let the loss of weight sustained by each be carefully observed, it will then be
                    found that the counterfeit will lose more of its weight than the unadulterated
                    coin. For, since the specific gravity of copper exceeds that of gold, and since
                    the absolute weights of the coins were equal, the counterfeit guinea must be
                    greater in bulk than the real one, and will therefore displace a greater
                    quantity of water, that is (93.), it will lose a greater part of its weight.</p>
                <p>104. Hiero, king of Syracuse, having employed a goldsmith to make him a crown of
                    gold, suspected that the metal had been adulterated, and inquired at Archimedes
                    if his suspicions could be verified or disproved without injuring the crown. The
                    particular method by which Archimedes detected the fraud of the goldsmith is not
                    certainly known; but it is probable that he did it in the following manner. A
                    quantity of gold, of the same absolute weight as the crown, would evidently have
                    the same bulk also, if the crown were pure gold, and would have a greater bulk
                    if the crown were made of adulterated gold. By weighing, therefore, the quantity
                    of gold and the crown in water, and observing their respective losses of weight,
                    Archimedes found that the crown lost more of its weight than the quantity of
                    gold; and therefore concluded, that as the crown must have displaced a greater
                    portion of water than the piece of gold, its bulk must likewise have been
                    greater, and the metal adulterated of which it was composed.</p>

                <p>105. If two immiscible fluids, of different specific gravities, and a solid of an
                    intermediate specific gravity, be put into a vessel, the part of the solid in
                    the lighter fluid will be to the whole solid, as the difference between the
                    specific gravities of the solid and the heavier fluid, is to the difference
                    between the specific gravities of the two fluids.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 27.) be the vessel which contains the two fluids, suppose mercury
                    and water, and the solid CD. The mercury being heavier than water, will sink to
                    the bottom, and have <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> for its surface, and the water
                    will occupy the space AB <hi rend="italic">m n.</hi> The solid having a greater
                    specific gravity than water, will sink in the water (94.); but having a less
                    specific gravity than mercury, it will float in the mercury. It will therefore
                    be suspended in the fluids, having one portion C in the water, and the other
                    portion D in the mercury. Now let S be the specific gravity of the mercury,
                    &lt;s∙ the specific gravity of the water, <hi rend="italic">&lt;r</hi> that of
                    the solid, C the part of the solid in the water, and D the part in the mercury.
                    Then the bulk of the solid is C + D, and its weight ¢r × C + D: The quantity of
                    water displaced by the part C, or the loss of weight sustained by the part C,
                    will be C × s; and the quantity of mercury displaced, or the loss of weight
                    sustained by part D, will be D × S. But as the solid is suspended in the fluids,
                    and therefore in equilibrio with them, the whole of its weight is lost.
                    Consequently, the part of its weight which is lost in the water, added to the
                    part lost in the mercury, must be equal to its whole weight; that is, C × s + D
                    × S <hi rend="italic">~ &lt;r × C</hi> + D, or s C + SD = ¢r C + oD. Transposing

                    heavier fluid, is to the part in the lighter fluid, as the difference between
                    the specific gravities of the solid and the lighter fluid, is to the difference

                    immersed with the whole body, there is evidently a small error in the result;
                    for the body is suspended partly in water and partly in air. It is, in fact, a
                    solid of an intermediate specific gravity floating in two immisceable fluids,
                    and therefore its specific gravity should be ascertained by the present

                <p>108. If two bodies, whether solid or fluid, be mixed together so as to form a
                    compound substance, the bulk of the heavier is to the bulk of the lighter
                    ingredient, as the difference between the specific gravities of the compound,
                    and the lighter ingredient, is to the difference between the specific gravities
                    of the compound and the heavier ingredient.</p>
                <p>Let S and .$ be the specific gravities of the two ingredients, σ-the specific
                    gravity of the compound, and B, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the bulks of the

                    The weight of the ingredient B will be B × S, and that of the other ingredient

                <p>i09. In the preceding proposition, it has been taken for granted that the
                    magnitude of the compound is exactly equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the
                    two ingredients. This, however, does not obtain universally either in fluids or
                    solids; for an increase or diminution of bulk often attends the combination of
                    two different ingredients. A cubical inch of alcohol, for example, combined with
                    a cubical inch of water, will form a compound which will measure less than two
                    cubical inches; and a cubical inch of tin, when incorporated in a fluid state
                    with a cubical inch of lead, will form a compound, whose bulk will exceed two
                    cubical inches. The preceding proposition, however, is, even in these cases, of
                    great use in ascertaining the increase or decrease of bulk sustained by the
                    compound, by comparing the computed with the observed hulk.</p>

                <p>110. How to determine the specific gravities of bodies, whether solid or
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>The simplest and most natural way of finding the specific gravities of bodies
                    would be to take the absolute weights of a cubic inch, or any other determinate
                    quantity, of each substance; and the number thus found would be their specific
                    gravities. But as it is difficult to form two bodies of the very same size, and
                    often impossible, as in the case of precious stones, to give a determinate form
                    to the substance under examination, we are obliged to weigh them in a fluid, and
                    deduce their specific gravities from the losses of weight which they severally
                    sustain. Water is a fluid which is always employed for this purpose, not only
                    because it can be had without difficulty, but because it can be procured of the
                    same temperature, and of the same density, in every part of the world. The
                    specific gravity of water is always called 1.000, and with this, as a standard,
                    the specific gravity of every other substance is compared. Thus, if a certain
                    quantity of water weighed four pounds, and a similar quantity of mercury 54
                    pounds, the specific gravity of the mercury would be called 13∣, because as 4:54
                    = 1:13∣. In order, therefore, to determine the densities of bodies, we have
                    occasion for no other instrument than a common balance with a hook fixed beneath
                    one of its scales. When fitted up in this way, it has been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">hydrostatic balance,</hi> which has already been described under
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrostatical.</hi></p>
                <p>111. <hi rend="italic">When the substance is heavier than its bulk of water</hi>
                    Suspend the solid by means of a fine silver wire to the hook beneath the scale,
                    and find its weight in air.: Fill a jar with pure distilled water, of the
                    temperature of 62° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, and find the weight of the solid
                    when immersed in this fluid. The difference of these weights is the loss of
                    weight sustained by the solid. Then (96.), as the loss of weight is to the
                    weight of the solid in air, so is 1.000 the specific gravity of water to a <pb

                    proportional, which will be the specific gravity of the solid. But as the third
                    term of the preceding analogy is always 1.000, the fourth proportional, or
                    density of the solid, will always be had by dividing the weight of the solid in
                    air by its loss of weight in water. If the solid substance consists of grains of
                    platina or metallic filings, place it in a small glass bucket. Find the weight
                    of the bucket in air, when empty, and also its weight when it contains the
                    substance. The difference of these weights will be the weight of the substance
                    in air. Do the very same in water, and its weight in water will be had. Its
                    specific gravity will then be found as formerly. If the body is soluble in
                    water, or so porous as to absorb it, it should be covered with varnish or some
                    unctuous substance. When it is weighed in water, it should never touch the sides
                    of the glass jar, and it must be carefully freed from any bubbles of air that
                    happen to adhere to it.</p>

                <p>115. In order to determine, with expedition, the strength of spirituous liquors,
                    which are inversely proportional to their specific gravities, an instrument more
                    simple, though less accurate, than the hydrostatic balance, has been generally
                    employed. This instrument is called a <hi rend="italic">hydrometer,</hi>
                    sometimes an <hi rend="italic">areometer</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gravimeter,</hi> and very erroneously a <hi rend="italic">hygrometer</hi> by
                    some foreign authors. It seems to have been invented by Hypatia, the daughter of
                    Theon Alexandrinus, who flourished about the end of the fourth century; though
                    there is some foundation for the opinion that the invention is due to
                    Archimedes.</p>
                <p>116. The hydrometer of Fahrenheit, which is one of the simplest that has been
                    constructed, is represented in fig. 28, and may be formed either of glass or
                    metal. A B is a cylindrical stem, and C, D two hollow balls appended to it. Into
                    the lower ball D is introduced a quantity of mercury, sufficient to make the
                    ball C sink to F, a little below the surface of distilled water. If this
                    apparatus be plunged into a fluid lighter than water, the ball C will sink
                    farther below the surface; and, if it be immersed in a heavier fluid, it will
                    rise nearer the surface. In this way we can tell whether one fluid is more or
                    less dense than another. But in order to determine the real specific gravities
                    of the fluids, the hydrometer must either be loaded with different weights, or
                    have a scale A B engraven on its stem. The former of these methods was employed
                    by Fahrenheit. Having placed some small weights on the top A, he marked any
                    point E, to which the instrument sunk in distilled water. By weighing the
                    instrument thus loaded, he found the weight of a quantity of water equal to the
                    part immersed (92). When the hydrometer was placed in a fluid denser than water,
                    he loaded it with additional weights till it sunk to the same point E. The
                    weight of the hydrometer being again found, gave him the weight of a quantity of
                    the denser fluid equal to the part immersed; but as the part immersed was the
                    same in both Cases, the weights of the hydrometer were equal to the absolute
                    weights of equal quantities of the two fluids; and, consequently, the specific
                    gravities of the water and the other fluid were in the ratio of these weights.
                    When the fluid, whose density is required, has less specific gravity than water,
                    some of the weights are to be removed from the top A, till the instrument sinks
                    to E; and the density of the fluid to be determined as before—Instead of making
                    the weight of the hydrometer variable, it is more simple, though less accurate,
                    to have a scale of equal parts upon the stem AB. In order to graduate this
                    scale, immerse the hydrometer in distilled water, at the temperature of 60°
                    Fahrenheit, so that it may sink to B near the bottom of the stem, which may be
                    easily effected, by diminishing or increasing the quantity of mercury in the
                    ball D. At B place the number 1.000, which shews that every fluid, in which the
                    hydrometer sinks to B, has its specific gravity 1.000, or that of distilled
                    water. The hydrometer is then to be plunged in another fluid less dense than
                    water, suppose oil, whose specific gravity may be ∙900, and the point A marked,
                    to which it sinks. Every fluid, therefore, in which the hydrometer sinks to A,
                    has its specific gravity .900; and if the scale AB be divided into equal parts,
                    every intermediate degree of specific gravity between .900 and 1.000 will be
                    marked.</p>
                <p>If the scale AB be divided into four parts in the points E, F, G, the fluid in
                    which the hydrometer sinks to G will have .975 for its specific gravity; the
                    specific gravity of that in which it sinks to F will be ∙950, and so on with the
                    other points of division. If it is required to extend the range of the
                    instrument, and to make it indicate the densities of fluids specifically lighter
                    than water, we have only to load it in such a manner as to make it sink to the
                    middle of the scale F in ' distilled water; and by taking two fluids, between
                    whose densities the specific gravity of every other fluid is contained,
                    excepting mercury and metals in a fluid state, to determine, as before, the
                    extremities of the scale. —</p>

                <p>Ii9. The hydrometer invented by Mr William Jones of Holborn, is a simple and
                    accurate instrument, and requires only three weights to discover the strengths
                    of spirituous liquors from alcohol to water. Like other instruments of the same
                    kind, it is adjusted to the temperature ofβ0° of Fahrenheit; but as every change
                    of temperature produces a change in the specific gravity of the spirits, Mr
                    Jones found it necessary to attach a thermometer to the instrument, and thus
                    make a proper allowance for every variation of temperature. Almost all bodies
                    expand with heat and contract with cold; and as their volume becomes different
                    at different temperatures, their specific gravities must also (86.) be variable,
                    and will diminish with an increase of temperature. Μ. Homberg, and Μ.
                    Eisenschmed found that the absolute weight of a cubic inch of brandy was four
                    drams 42 grains in winter, and only four drams 32 grains in summer, and that the
                    difference in spirits of nitre was still greater. It has been found, indeed,
                    upon an average, that 32 gallons of spirits in winter will expand to 33 gallons
                    in summer. As the strength of spirituous liquors is inversely as their specific
                    gravities, they will appear much stronger in summer than in winter. This change
                    in their strength had been formerly estimated in a rough way; but by the
                    application of the thermometer, and by adjusting its divisions experimentally,
                    Mr Jones has reduced it to pretty accurate computation. It has already been
                    stated (109∙) that where two substances arc combined, the magnitude of the
                    compound body is sometimes greater and sometimes less than the sum of the
                    magnitudes of the two ingredients, and that this mutual penetration particularly
                    happened in the mixture of alcohol and water. In strong spirits, this
                    concentration is sometimes so great, as to produce a diminution of four gallons
                    in the 100; for if to 100 gallons of spirit of wine found by the hydrometer to
                    be 66 gallons in the 100 over proof, you add 66 gallons of water to reduce it to
                    proof, the mixture will consist only of 162 gallons instead of 166 of proof
                    spirits. This mutual penetration of the particles of alcohol and water has also
                    been considered in Mr Jones’s hydrometer, which we shall now describe with
                    greater minuteness.</p>
                <p>120. In fig. 29. the whole instrument is represented with the thermometer
                    attached to it. Its length AB is about 9⅛ inches: the ball C is made of hard
                    brass, and nearly oval, having its conjugate diameter about 1∣ inches. The stem
                    AD is a parallelopiped, on the four sides of which the different strengths of
                    spirits are engraved: the three sides which do not appear in fig. 29∙ are
                    represented in fig, 30. with the three weights numbered 1, 2, 3, corresponding
                    with the sides similarly marked at the top. If the instrument, when placed in
                    the spirits, sinks to the divisions on the stem without a weight, their strength
                    will be shewn on the side AD marked 0 at the top, and any degree of strength
                    from 74 gallons in the 100 to 47 in the 100 above proof, will thus be indicated.
                    If the hydrometer does not sink to the divisions without a weight, it must be
                    loaded with any of the weights 1, 2, 3, till the ball C is completely immersed.
                    If the weight No. 1. is necessary, the side marked 1 will shew the strength of
                    the spirits, from 46 to 13 gallons in the 100 above proof. If the weight No. 2.
                    is employed, the corresponding side will indicate the remainder of overproof to
                    <hi rend="italic">proof,</hi> marked P in the instrument, and likewise every
                    gallon in 100 under proof, down to 29∙ When the weight No. 3. is used, the side
                    similarly marked will shew any strength from 30 gallons in the 100 under proof,
                    down to water, which is marked W in the scale. The small figures as 4 at 66, 3;
                    at 61, 2∣ at 48 (fig. 29.) indicate the diminution of bulk which takes place
                    when water is mixed with spirits of wine in order to reduce it to proof: thus,
                    if the spirit be 61 gallons in the 100 over proof, and if 61 gallons of water
                    are added in order to render it proof, the magnitude of the mixture will be 3ļ
                    gallons less than the sum of the magnitudes of the ingredients, that is, instead
                    of being 161 it will be only 157⅜ gallons. The thermometer F connected with the
                    hydrometer, has four columns engraved upon it, two on one side as seen in the
                    figure, and two on the other side. When any of the scales upon the hydrometer,
                    marked 0, 1, 2, 3, are employed, the column of the thermometer similarly marked
                    must be used, and the number at which the mercury stands carefully observed. The
                    divisions commence at the middle of each column which is marked 0, and is
                    equivalent to a temperature of 60° of Fahrenheit; then, whatever number of
                    divisions the mercury stands above the zero of the scale, the same number of
                    gallons in the 100 must the spirit be reckoned weaker than the hydrometer
                    indicates, and whatever number of divisions the mercury stands below the zero,
                    so many gallons in the 100 must the spirit be reckoned stronger.</p>

                <p>121. A considerable improvement on the hydrometer has lately been made by Mr
                    Nicholson, who has rendered it capable of ascertaining the specific gravities
                    both of solids and fluids. F is a hollow ball of copper attached to the dish AA
                    by a stem B, made of hardened steel. To the lower extremity of the ball is
                    affixed a kind of iron stirrup FF, carrying another dish G of such a weight as
                    to keep the stem vertical when the instrument is afloat. The parts <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192938114" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8114-0024"/> of the hydrometer
                    are so adjusted, that when the lower dish G is empty, and the upper dish A A
                    contains 1000 grains, it will sink in distilled water at the temperature of 60°
                    of Fahrenheit, so that the surface of the fluid may cut the stem DB at the point
                    D. In order to measure the specific gravities of fluids, let the weight of the
                    instrument, when loaded, be accurately ascertained. Then, this weight is equal
                    to that of a quantity of distilled water at the temperature of 60°, having the
                    same volume as that part of the instrument which is below the point D of the
                    stem. If the hydrometer, therefore, is immersed to the point D in any other
                    fluid of the same temperature, which may be done by increasing or diminishing
                    the weights in the dish AA, the difference between this last weight and 1000
                    grains will express the difference between equal bulks of water and the other
                    fluid. Now as the weight of the mass of water is equal to the weight of the
                    instrument, which <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> may be called W, the
                    above-mentioned difference or D must be either added to or subtracted from W,
                    (according as the weight in the dish AA was increased or diminished) in order to
                    have the weight of an equal bulk of the fluid; then W -4- D will be to W as the
                    specific gravity of tire given fluid is to that of water. This ratio will be
                    expressed with considerable accuracy, as the cylindrical stem of the instrument
                    being no more than ţŋth of an inch in diameter, will be elevated or depressed
                    nearly an inch by the subtraction or addition of <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛
                    of a grain, and will, therefore, easily point out any changes of weight, not
                    less than + of a grain, or <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the whole, which will give
                    the specific gravities to five places of figures. The solid bodies whose
                    specific gravities are to be determined by this hydrometer, must not exceed 1000
                    grains in weight. For this purpose, immerse the instrument in distilled water,
                    and load the upper dish A A till the surface of the water is on a level with the
                    point D of the stem. Then, if the weights required to produce this equilibrium
                    be exactly 1000 grains, tire temperature of the water will be 60° of Fahrenheit;
                    but if they be greater or less than 1000 grains, the water will be colder or
                    warmer. After noting down the weight necessary for producing an equilibrium,
                    unload the upper dish, and place on it the body whose specific gravity is
                    required. Increase the weight in the upper dish, till the instrument sinks to
                    the point D, and the difference between this new weight and the weight formerly
                    noted down, will be the weight of the body in air. Place the body in the lower
                    dish G, and add weights in the upper dish till the hydrometer again sinks to Ď.
                    This weight will be the difference between 1000 grains and the weight of the
                    body in water; and since the weight of the body in air, and its weight in water,
                    are ascertained, its loss of weight will be known, and consequently its specific
                    gravity (96).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wilson’s Beads.</hi></p>
                <p>122. In order to determine the strength of spirits with the greatest expedition,
                    Professor Wilson of Glasgow employed a very simple method. His hydrometer
                    consists of a number of glass beads, the specific gravities of each of which
                    vary in a known ratio. When the strength of any spirit is to be tried, the glass
                    beads, which are all numbered, are to be thrown into it. Some of those whose
                    specific gravity exceeds that of the spirit will sink to the bottom, while
                    others will swim on the top, or remain suspended in the fluid. That which
                    neither sinks to the bottom nor swims on the surface, will indicate by its
                    number the specific gravity of the spirits (78). These beads have been greatly
                    improved by Mrs Lovi, and are numbered in a variety of ways, either to shew
                    specific gravities or the strength of spirits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Barometrical Areometer.</hi></p>
                <p>123. This name may be appropriately given to an instrument which is more useful
                    for the purposes of illustration than of measurement. If two immisceable liquids
                    are poured into a two-branched tube ABC, the one into the branch BC, and the
                    other into the branch AC, till they balance each other, their specific gravities
                    will be to one another inversely as the heights of each column. Thus, if we pour
                    in mercury at A, and water at B, so that when the surface of the mercury is at
                    D, that of the the water is at E, we shall find that if the column of mercury DF
                    is two inches, that of the water EG will be 27 inches, and their specific
                    gravities will be as 27 to 2, or as !3∣ to 1. If we pour in at B lintseed oil in
                    place of water, the height EF will be 29 inches, and the specific gravity Feet.

                <p>of the oil 0.931; because 27: 2 = 13∣: 0.931. By thus using mercury as the
                    balancing column, the specific gravities of all fluids that do not mix with it,
                    or act upon it, may be readily ascertained. The results thus obtained are not
                    affected by the admission of the air at the open ends A and B, because the same
                    weight of air presses upon the two balancing columns. But if we pour in mercury
                    at A till the bent tube ACB contains above thirty inches of it, and close up the
                    end A, and remove the air from above the mercury in AC, the column of mercury
                    being no longer pressed down by the air in AC, will be pressed up to near the
                    top of the tube A A by the pressure of the column of air in BC, and the
                    instrument becomes a barometer, a column of air balancing a column of mercury.
                    In this case, the tube BI becomes unnecessary, and the mercury may be enclosed
                    in a glass ball at I, with an opening to admit the air.</p>

                <p>Many years afterwards, Professor Leslie brought forward the same instrument,

                    without any variation of the principle. The following general description will
                    give our readers an idea of the very beautiful principle on which this
                    instrument is founded: Let AE be a glass tube, about three feet long, and open
                    at both ends, the upper part AB being about 4-10ths, and the lower part BE about
                    2-10ths, of an inch in diameter. The upper edge of the tube is ground smooth, so
                    that it can be shut air-tight by a piece of ground plate-glass, and the upper
                    tube AB communicates with the lower one by a very narrow slit at B, which allows
                    air to pass through it, but prevents sand or powder from passing.</p>
                <p>The powder, sand for example, is put into the tube AB, and the lower tube BE is

                    />the tube BE to the slit at B. The ground-glass cover is then placed air-tight
                    upon the mouth A. There is now no air in the tube AE, except that which is mixed
                    with the sand in the tube AB. If we now suppose that the atmospherical pressure
                    indicated by the barometer is 30 inches, and elevate the tube AE till the
                    mercury stands within it at a point C, 15 inches (one-half of 30), above its
                    surface in the open vessel F, it is manifest that the air within the tube is
                    pressed with exactly half an atmosphere, and therefore expands to twice its
                    original bulk. Owing to this expansion of the air to twice its bulk, the tube AÈ
                    contains only half the quantity of air which it did at first; and as the part BC
                    contains the other half, the quantity of air in AB and BC is equal, as the air
                    in BC is equal to the air that is mixed with the sand in AB, and fills the same
                    space which the whole occupied previous to its expansion.</p>
                <p>Let the sand be now removed from AB, and the same experiment repeated when the
                    tube AB is filled with air. The quantity of air being now greater, will, when
                    expanded to twice its bulk under ar pressure of 15 inches, fill a larger space
                    than BC, and the mercury will rise only to some point D. But as the expanded air
                    in Έ occupies exactly the very same space in BC or BD that the whole occupied in
                    AB under the ordinary atmospheric pressure of 30 inches, it follows that the
                    cavity CD = BD — BC is equal to the bulk of the solid matter in the sand or
                    powder. If we now find the number of grains of water held by the part CD of the
                    tube, we determine at once the quantity of water equal in bulk to the solid
                    matter in the sand or powder; and by comparing this with the weight of the sand,
                    we obtain its exact specific gravity.</p>

                <p>125. The Staktometer, or <hi rend="italic">drop-measurer,</hi> is shewn in fig.
                    34, where ABC is a glass vessel four or five inches long, having a hollow bulb B
                    about half an inch in diameter. The instrument is filled by suction, and the
                    fluid is discharged at C till it stands nearly at the point rn, the zero of the
                    scale. The fluid is then allowed to discharge itself at C by drops, and the
                    number of them is counted till the-surface of the fluid descends to another
                    fixed point <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The experiment is then carefully repeated
                    at different temperatures, till the number of drops of distilled water occupied

                <p>With a small instrument, the number of drops of <hi rend="italic">water</hi>
                    between <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> was 724, whereas
                    the number of drops of ordinary proof spirits was 2117 at 60° Fall. Now, as the
                    specific gravity of the spirits was .920, and that of water 1.000, we have a
                    scale of 1393 drops for measuring all specific gravities between .920 and 1000,
                    an unit in the fourth place of decimals corresponding to a variation of about
                    two drops. From this experiment it follows that the bulk of a drop of water will
                    be about 2.93 times as large as the bulk of a drop of the spirits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sikes’s Hydrometer.</hi></p>
                <p>126. This inŝtrument, which is used i the revenue of the United Kingdom, is shewn
                    in the annexed figure, where AB is a flat stem 3; inche⅛ long, divided on each
                    side into eleveħ parts, each of which is divided into two. This stem carries a
                    brass ball BC, into which is fixed the conical stem CD, terminating in a loaded
                    bulb DE. Eight circular weights, numbered as in the figure, can be placed on the
                    conical stem CD. The square weight can be placed on the top of the stem. When
                    the strength of spirits is to be measured, a weight is to be placed on CD
                    capable of sinking the ball BC till the fluid surface cuts the stem AB. The
                    number at the place where the stem is cut by the fluid, as seen from below, is
                    then added to the number on the weight employed; and with this sum at the side,
                    and the temperature of the spirits at the top, the strength per cent, is found
                    in a table which accompanies the instrument.</p>
                <p>The square weight shews the difference between the weight of proof spirit and
                    that of water, as described in the first clause of the hydrometer act; and it is
                    exactly <hi rend="italic">one-twelfth</hi> part of the total weight of the
                    hydrometer and weight 60. When this square weight is placed on the summit of the
                    stem at A, and the instrument loaded with the weight No. 6, it will sink in
                    distilled water at the temperature 51° to the proof point P, at that
                    temperature, as indicated on the narrow edge of the stem.</p>

                <p>127∙ As the knowledge of the specific gravities of bodies is of great use in all
                    the branches of mechanical philosophy, we have given the following table,
                    comprehending the greater part of Brisson’s tables, and one of the most
                    extensive that has yet been published. When the specific gravities of any
                    substance, as determined by different authors, seem to be at variance, the
                    different results are frequently given, and the names of the observers prefixed
                    by whom these results were obtained. The substances in the table have, contrary
                    to the usual practice, been disposed in an alphabetical order. This was deemed
                    more convenient for the purposes of reference, than if they had been divided
                    into classes, or arranged according to the order of their densities.</p>
                <p>The specific gravities of newly discovered minerals have been collected and
                    inserted. The numbers are given in relation to water whose specific gravity is
                    1.000, excepting in the case of the gases, whose specific gravities are given in
                    relation to that of atmospheric air, which is taken at 1.00.</p>

                <p>CHAPTER III.—ON CAPILLARY ATTRACTION, AND THE COHESION OF FLUIDS.</p>
                <p>128. <hi rend="smallcaps">"We</hi> have already seen, when discussing the
                    equilibrium of fluids, that when water or any other fluid is poured into a
                    vessel, or any number of communicating vessels, its surface will be horizontal,
                    or it will rise to the same height in each vessel, whatever be its form or
                    position. This pro- . position, however, only holds true when the diameter of
                    these vessels or tubes exceeds the fifteenth of an inch: for if a system of
                    communicating vessels be composed of tubes of various diameters, the fluid will
                    rise to a level surface in all the tubes which exceed one fifteenth of an inch
                    in diameter; but in the tubes of a smaller bore, it will rise above that level
                    to altitudes inversely proportional to the diameters of the tubes. The power by
                    which the fluid is raised above its natural level is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >capillary attraction,</hi> and the glass tubes which are employed to exhibit
                    its phenomena are named <hi rend="italic">capillary tubes.</hi> These
                    appellations derive their origin from the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >capillus,</hi> signifying a hair, either because the bores of these tubes have
                    the fineness of a hair, or because that substance is itself supposed to be of a
                    tubular structure.</p>
                <p>129- When we bring a piece of clean glass in contact with water or any other
                    fluid, except mercury and fused metals, and withdraw it gently from its surface,
                    a portion of the fluid will not only adhere to the glass, but a small force is
                    necessary to detach this glass from the fluid mass, which seems to resist any
                    separation of its parts. Hence it is obvious that there is an attraction of
                    cohesion between glass and water, and that the constituent particles of water
                    have also an attraction for each other. The suspension of a drop of water from
                    the lower side of a plate of glass is a more palpable illustration of the first
                    of these truths; and the following experiment will completely verify the second.
                    Place two large drops of water on a smooth metallic surface, their distance
                    being about the tenth of an inch. With the point of a pin unite these drops by
                    two parallel canals, and the drops will instantly rush to each other through
                    these canals, and fill the dry space that intervenes. This experiment is
                    exhibited in fig. 36, where AB is the metallic plate, C, D the drops of water,
                    and <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi> the two canals.</p>
                <p>130. Upon these principles many attempts have been made to account for the
                    elevation of water in capillary tubes; but most of the explanations which have
                    hitherto been offered, are founded upon hypothesis, and are very far from being
                    satisfactory. Without presuming to substitute a better explanation in the room
                    of those which have been already given, and so frequently repeated, we shall
                    endeavour to illustrate that explanation of the phenomena of capillary
                    attraction which seems liable to the fewest objections. For this purpose let E
                    be a drop of water laid upon a clean glass surface AB. Every particle of the
                    glass immediately below the drop E, exerts an attractive force upon the
                    particles of water. This force will produce the same effect upon the drop as a
                    pressure in the opposite direction, the pressure of a column of air, for
                    instance, on the upper surface of the drop. The effect of the attractive force,
                    therefore, tending to press the drop to the glass will be an enlargement of its
                    size, and the water will occupy the space FG; this increase of its dimensions
                    will take place when the surface AB is held downwards; and that it does not
                    arise from atmospheric pressure may be shewn by performing the experiment <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo.</hi> Now, let A B (fig. 37.) be a section of the plate
                    of glass, AB (fig. 36.) held vertically, part of the water will descend by its
                    gravity, and form a drop B, while a small film of the fluid will be supported at
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> by the attraction of the glass. Bring a similar plate
                    of glass CD, into a position parallel to AB, and make them approach <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192938309" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8309-0039"/> nearer and nearer
                    each other. When the drops B and D , come in contact, they will rush together
                    from their mutual attraction, and will fill the space <hi rend="italic">o
                    p.</hi> The gravity of the drops B and D being thus diminished, the films of
                    water at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> which were
                    prevented from rising by their gravity, will move upwards. As the plates of
                    glass continue to approximate, the space between them <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >μ</hi> ill fill with water, and the films at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> being no longer prevented from yielding to the action of
                    the glass immediately below them, (by the gravity of the water at <hi
                    rend="italic">ο p,</hi> which is diminished by the mutual action of the fluid
                    particles) will rise higher in proportion to the approach of the plates. Hence
                    it may be easily understood how the water rises in capillary tubes, and how its
                    altitude is inversely as their internal diameters. For let A, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> be the altitudes of the fluid in two tubes of different diameters D, <hi
                    rend="italic">d;</hi> and let C, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the two cylinders
                    of fluid which are raised by virtue of the attraction of the glass. Now, as the
                    force which raises the fluid must be as the number of attracting particles, that
                    is, as the surface of the tube in contact with the water, that is, as the
                    diameter of the tubes, and as this same force must be proportional to its
                    effects on the cylinder of water raised, we shall have D: <hi rend="italic"

                    as the diameters of the tubes. Since DA = <hi rend="italic">da,</hi> the product
                    of the diameter by the altitude of the water will always be a constant quantity.
                    In a tube whose diameter is 0.01, or <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of an inch, the water has been found to reach the
                    altitude of 5.3 inches; hence the constant quantity 5.3 X 0.1 = 0.053 may fitly
                    represent the attraction of glass for water. According to the experiments of
                    Muschenbroek, the constant quantity is 0.039; according to Weitbrecht 0.0428;
                    according to Monge 0.042, and according to Atwood 0.0530. When a glass tube was
                    immersed in melted lead, Gellert found the depression multiplied by the bore to
                    be 0.0054.</p>
                <p>131. Having thus attempted to explain the causes of capillary action, we shall
                    now proceed to consider some of its more interesting phenomena. In fig. 38. MN
                    is a vessel of water in which tubes of various forms are immersed. The water
                    will rise in the tubes A, B, C, to different altitudes <hi rend="italic">rn, n,
                    ο,</hi> inversely proportional to their diameters. If the tube B is broken at
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the water will not rise to the very top of it at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> but will stand at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> a little below
                    the top, whatever be the length of the tube, or the diameter of its bore. If the
                    tube be taken from the fluid and laid in a horizontal position, the water will
                    recede from the end that was immersed. These two facts seem to countenance the
                    opinion of Dr Jurin<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosopnical Transactions,</hi> No. 3G3, Art. 2.</p></note> and
                    other philosophers, that the water is elevated in the tube by the attraction of
                    the annulus, or ring of glass, <hi rend="italic">immediately above</hi> the
                    cylinder of water. This hypothesis is sufficiently plausible; but supposing it
                    to be true, the ring of glass immediately below the surface of the cylinder of
                    fluid should produce an equal and opposite effect, and therefore the water
                    instead of rising should be stationary, being influenced by two forces of an
                    equal and opposite kind.</p>
                <p>132. If a tube D composed of two cylindrical tubes of different bores be immersed
                    in water with the widest part downwards, the water will rise to the altitude <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> and if another tube E of the same size and form be plunged
                    in the fluid with the smaller end downwards, the water will rise to the same
                    height <hi rend="italic">q</hi> as it did in the tube D. This experiment seems
                    to be a complete refutation of the opinion of Dr Jurin, that the water is raised
                    by the action of the annulus of glass above the fluid column; for since the
                    annular surface is the same at <hi rend="italic">q</hi> as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> the same quantity of fluid ought to be supported in both tubes, whereas
                    the tube E evidently raises much less water than D. But if we admit the
                    supposition in art. 130, that the fluid is suported by the whole surface of
                    glass in contact with the water, the phenomenon receives a complete explanation;
                    for since the surface of glass in contact with the fluid in the tube E is much
                    less than the surface in contact with it in the tube D, the quantity of fluid
                    sustained in the former ought to be much less than the quantity supported in the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>133. When a vessel F <hi rend="italic">υu∙,</hi> fig. 38. is plunged in water,
                    and the lower part <hi rend="italic">tuvιν</hi> filled by suction till tħe fluid
                    enter the part F <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the water will rise to the same
                    height as it does in the capillary tube <hi rend="italic">G,</hi> whose bore is
                    equal to the bore of the part F <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> In this experiment the
                    portions of water <hi rend="italic">tvx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uxw</hi> on
                    each side of the column F <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> are supported by the pressure
                    of the atmosphere on the surface of the water in the vessel MN; for if this
                    vessel be placed in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, these portions of
                    water will not be sustained. Dr Jurin, indeed, maintains that these portions
                    will retain their position <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> but in his time the
                    exhausting power of the air-pump was not sufficiently great to determine a point
                    of so great nicety. The column <hi rend="italic">tux,</hi> which is net
                    sustained by atmospherical pressure, is kept in its position by the attraction
                    of the water immediately around and above it, and the column F <hi rend="italic"
                    >tu</hi> is supported by the attraction of the glass surface with which it is in
                    contact. According to Dr Jurin’s hypothesis, the column <hi rend="italic"
                    >tux</hi> is supported by the ring of glass immediately above <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> which is a very unlikely supposition.</p>
                <p>134. The preceding experiment completely overturns the hypothesis of Dr Hamilton,
                    afterwards revived by Dr Matthew Young. These philosophers maintained that the
                    fluid was sustained in the tube by the lower ring of glass contiguous to the
                    bottom of the tube, that this ring raises the portion of water immediately below
                    it, and then other portions successively till the portion of water thus raised
                    be in equilibrium with the attraction of the annulus in question. But if the
                    elevation of the fluid were produced in this way, the quantity supported would
                    be regulated by the form and magnitude of the orifice at the bottom of the tube;
                    whereas it is evident from every experiment, that the cylinder of fluid
                    sustained in capillary tubes has no reference whatever to the form of the lower
                    annulus, but depends solely upon the diameter of the tube immediately above the
                    elevated column of water.</p>
                <p>135. if the experiments which we have now explained be performed in the exhausted
                    receiver of an air-pump, the water will rise to the same height as when they are
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938322" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8322-0040"/>performed in
                    air. We may therefore conclude, that the ascent of the water is not occasioned,
                    as some have imagined, by the pressure of the atmosphere acting more freely upon
                    the surface of the water in the vessel than upon the column of fluid in the
                    capillary tube.</p>
                <p>136. Numerous experiments have been made on the ascent of water and other fluids
                    in capillary tubes. Among the earliest of these we may enumerate the experiments
                    of Μ. Louis Carré, which were made previous to 1705. He found that in a tube <hi
                    rend="italic">twelve</hi> inches long water rose 10 lines, when the diameter of
                    the tube was 1 of a line, 18 lines when its diameter was ⅜, and 30 lines when
                    its diameter was <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi

                    number for each fluid, or the product of the altitude of the liquid, and the
                    diameter of the tube (art. 130). By this number, therefore, we can find the
                    altitude to which any of the preceding fluids will rise in a tube of a given
                    bore, or the diameter of the bore when the altitude of the fluid is known; for
                    since the constant</p>
                <p>C</p>
                <p>number C = DA (art. 130.) we shall have D = — and A</p>
                <p>c</p>
                <p>= —. Since the constant number, however, as deduced from the experiments of
                    Martin, may not be perfectly correct, it would be improper to derive from it the
                    diameter of the capillary bore when great accuracy is necessary. The following
                    method, therefore, may be adopted as the most correct that can be given. Put
                    into the capillary tube a quantity of mercury, whose weight in troy grains is W,
                    and let the length L of the tube which it occupies be accurately ascertained;
                    then if the mercury be pure and at the temperature of 60° of Fahrenheit, the
                    diameter of</p>

                    gravity of JU</p>
                <p>mercury being 13.580. The weight of a cubic inch of mercury being 3438 grains,
                    and the solid contents of the mercurial column being D <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> L X 0.7854, ŵe shall have 1: 3438 = D <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> L ×
                    0.7854: W. Hence <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geometry,</hi> Sect. IV. Theor. VIII.) D
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> L× 0.7854 × 3438= W, and dividing</p>

                <p>/Ŵ</p>
                <p>or D = V — X 0.019241. If the whole tube be filled JU</p>
                <p>with mercury, and if W be the difference in troy grains between its weight when
                    empty, and when filled with mercury, the same theorem will serve for
                    ascertaining the diameter of the tube. Should the temperature of the mercury
                    happen to be 32° of Fahrenheit, its specific gravity will be 13.619, which will
                    alter a very little the constant multiplier 0.019241.</p>
                <p>139· Various experiments on the ascent of fluids in capillarytubes have been made
                    by different individuals. The most important and recent of these were made by

                    melted lead in capillary tubes of glass. For this purpose he used the thinnest
                    tubes, and heating them gradually before immersion in the lead, he obtained the
                    following measures :—</p>

                    accurate and skilful observers, induced Sir David Brewster to repeat the
                    experiments with ah instrument constructed for the purpose, and to take such
                    precautions, that he could always obtain the same results after repeated trials.
                    The following description of the instrument which he used, and of the
                    precautions which he adopted, will enable the reader to judge of the accuracy of
                    the results.</p>
                <p>Having obtained a glass tube 7∙9 inches long, and of a uniform circular bore, he
                    took a wire of a less diameter than the bore of the tube, and formed a small
                    hook at one of its ends. This hook was fastened to the middle of a worsted
                    thread, of such a size as, when doubled, to fill the bore of the tube. The wire
                    was then passed through the tube, and the worsted thread drawn after it; and
                    when the whole was plunged in an alkaline solution, the worsted thread was fixed
                    at one end, and the tube was drawn backwards and forwards, till it was
                    completely deprived, by its friction on the thread, of any grease or foreign
                    matter which might have adhered to it. The tube and thread were then taken to
                    clean water, and the same operation was repeated.</p>
                <p>When the tube was thus perfectly cleaned, it was fixed vertically, by means of a
                    level, in the axis of a piece of wood D (fig. 39∙), supported by the arm AD,
                    fixed upon a stand AB; and it was also furnished with an index <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> Which was moveable to and from the extremity <hi rend="italic">b.</hi>
                    On the arm CE, moveable in a vertical direction by the nut Ċ, was placed a glass
                    vessel F, containing the fluid, and nearly filled with it. The nut C was then
                    turríed till the extremity <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the tube touched the
                    surface of the fluid, Which was indicated by the sudden rise of the liquor round
                    its sides. The fluid then rose in the tube till it remained stationary, and the
                    index <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> was moved till its extremity <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi> pointed Out the exact position of the upper surface of the fluid. In
                    this situation, the distance <hi rend="italic">nb</hi> was a measure of the
                    ascent of the liquid above its level in the vessel E. In order to ascertain,
                    however, whether the fluid was stationary, in consequence of any obstruction in
                    the tube, or of an equilibrium of the attracting forces, the vessel with the
                    fluid was raised a little higher than its former position, by means of the nut
                    C, and then depressed below it. If the fluid now rose a little above <hi
                    rend="italic">η,</hi> and afterwards sunk a little below it, so as always to
                    rise and fall with facility and uniformity along with the surface of the fluid
                    in the vessel, it was obvious that it suffered no obstruction in the tube, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">nb</hi> was the accurate űicasure of its height. By
                    separating the extremity <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the tube from the surface
                    of the fluid, the fluid always rises above <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but upon again bringing them into contact, the fluid
                    resumes its position at n. If there should be any portion of fluid at the end
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the tube, when it is again brought in contact with
                    the fluid surface, the water would rise around it before it had reached the
                    general level, and therefore the height of the fluid obtained measuring from the
                    end of the tube would be too small.</p>

                <p>In order to avoid this source of error, the index should have a projecting arm
                    <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> Fig. 40, carrying a screw <hi rend="italic">st,</hi>
                    whose sharp point <hi rend="italic">t</hi> can be easily brought on a level with
                    the end <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the tube. When the extremity <hi

                    exactly on the same level, even though the fluid had already risen around it.
                    The tube was then cleaned, as formerly, for a subsequent observation. The
                    results which were thus obtained for a great variety of fluids, and with a tube

                    between this and the extreme measures of Newton and Atwood is so great, that
                    there must be some cause, different from an error of observation, to which it is
                    owing, The difference between the results obtained by Sir David Brewster and Μ.
                    Gay-Lussac, made, with nice instruments founded on the same principle, leads to
                    the same conclusion. La Place indeed has ascribed, and we think justly, these
                    differences to the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> or <hi rend="italic">less</hi>
                    degree of humidity on the sides of the tubes; and he informs us that Gay Lussac
                    made his experiments with tubes <hi rend="italic">very much, wetted.</hi> Here,
                    then, we have at once the cause of the difference above mentioned, because the
                    experiments of Sir David.Brewster <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938361"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8361-0043"/>were made with a tube <hi rend="italic">carefully
                    cleaned and dried after each experiment.</hi> A dry tube must necessarily raise
                    the water to a less height than a wet one, and the difference must increase as
                    the diameter of the tube employed is diminished. If we conceive a tube, indeed,
                    with an exceedingly small bore, wetted over the whole of its interior, in the
                    slightest degree, the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> inner surfaces of the film
                    would nearly meet in the axis, and the height of ascent would be infinite, or as
                    high as the tube was long.</p>
                <p>147- From these observations, the reader will be already prepared to draw the
                    conclusion, that the ascent of fluids in glass tubes is a very equivocal measure
                    of the force of capillary attraction, independent of its being applicable only
                    to the single substance of glass.</p>
                <p>With the view of removing this objection, Sir David Brewster long ago constructed
                    an instrument, the object of which was to measure, upon an optical principle,
                    the diameter of the circle of fluid which any cylindrical solid raises by
                    capillary attraction above its general level. Thus let MN (fig. 41.) be the plan
                    of a vessel filled with fluid, and A the section of a vertical cylinder of well
                    cleaned and well dried glass, or any other substance not porous. This sohd A
                    will raise the fluid to a certain height around it, elevating a circular portion
                    CD of the fluid above the general level; and it is manifest that the diameter CD
                    of this elevated portion will be proportioned to the height of the fluid round
                    the sides of the cylinder, or to the capillary force by which it is raised. In
                    order to measure the diameter of this circle of fluid, a micrometer carries a
                    small vertical frame along the edge FG of the vessel. Along this frame are
                    stretched two fine parallel wires, whose images can be seen by reflection from
                    the surface of the fluid, by an eye on the side PQ of the vessel, aided by a
                    microscope with a distant focus. When the image of these wires is seen by
                    reflection from any part of the fluid surface without the circle CD, it will
                    suffer no change of form; but when it is seen by reflection from any portion of
                    the elevated portion CD, the fibres will appear disturbed, and will indicate, by
                    their return to the rectilineal form of accurate parallelism, the apparent
                    termination of the circle CD. The same observation is made on the other side of
                    A, at the boundary D, and a measure is thus obtained of the diameter of the
                    circle CD, by means of the micrometer screw, by which the microscope on the side
                    PQ, and the wire frame on the side FG are moved (being fixed to the same frame)
                    along the sides of the vessel. In this way solids of all kinds may be used, and
                    their exterior or acting surfaces may be easily cleared from grease and other
                    adhering substances.</p>
                <p>This apparatus may be improved by using two cylinders A∕B in place of one, and by
                    moving one of them, suppose B <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>, from the other A
                    till the two elevated circular portions CD <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> DE
                    disturb the images of the wires, seen by reflexion from the intermediate point
                    at D.</p>
                <p>148. When water is made to pass through a capillary tube of such a bore that the
                    fluid is discharged only by successive drops; the tube, when electrified, will
                    furnish a constant and accelerated stream, and the acceleration is proportional
                    to the smallness of the bore. A similar effect maybe produced by employing warm
                    water. Sir John Leslie found that a jet of warm water rose to a much greater
                    height than a jet of cold water, though the water in both cases moved through
                    the same aperture, and was influenced by the same pressure. A syphon also, which
                    discharged cold water only by drops, furnished warm water in an uninterrupted
                    stream.</p>
                <p>149∙ Such are the leading phenomena of capillary tubes. The rise of fluids
                    between two plates of glass remains to be considered; and while it furnishes us
                    with a very beautiful experiment, it confirms the reasoning by which we have
                    accounted for the elevation of fluids in cylindrical canals. Let ABE1 and CDEF
                    be two places of plate glass with smooth and clean surfaces, having their sides
                    EF joined together with wax, and their sides AB, CD kept a little distance by
                    another piece of wax W, so that their interior surfaces, whose common
                    intersection is the line EF, may form a small angle. When this apparatus is
                    immersed in a vessel MN full of water, the fluid will rise in such a manner
                    between the glass planes as to form the curve <hi rend="italic">C&gt;qomV,</hi>
                    which represents the surface of the elevated water. By measuring the ordinates

                    <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> Fp, &amp;c. Mr Hawksbee found it to be the common
                    Apollonian hyperbola, having for its assymp-totes the surface DE of the fluid,
                    and EF the common intersection of the· two planes. The following are the results
                    which he obtained when the inclination of the planes was 20' :—</p>

                <p>By repeating these observations at inclinations of 40', and at various other
                    angles, Mr Hawksbee found that the curve was an exact hyperbola in all
                    directions of the planes. To the very same conclusion we are led by the
                    principles already laid down; for as the distance between the plates diminishes
                    at every point of the curve Dr/o.¶F from D towards F, the water ought to rise
                    higher at <hi rend="italic">o</hi> than at <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> still
                    higher at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and highest of all at F, where the distance
                    between the plates is a minimum. To illustrate this more clearly, let ABEF and
                    CDEF (fig. 43.) be the same plates of glass (inclined at a greater angle for the
                    sake of distinctness), and let FrøçD, and FosB be the curves which bound the
                    surface of the elevated fluid. Then, since the altitudes of the water in
                    capillary tubes are inversely<pb break="no" facs="nls:192938374"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8374-0044"/> as their diameters, or the distances of their
                    opposite sides, the altitudes of the water between two glass plates, should at
                    any given point be inversely as the distances of the plates at that point. Now,
                    the distance of the plates at the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is obviously
                    <hi rend="italic">mo,</hi> or its equal <hi rend="italic">np,</hi> and the
                    distance atç is <hi rend="italic">qs or rt;</hi> and since <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> is the altitude of the water at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">qτ</hi> its altitude at <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> we have <hi

                    >m, q,</hi> which are equal to the abscissae Fκ, Fr (fig. 42.) are proportional
                    to the ordinates <hi rend="italic">qr, mn,</hi> equal to the abscissae Fn, Fr,
                    in fig. 42. But in the Apollonian hyperbola the ordinates are inversely
                    proportional to their respective abscissae, therefore the curve DyrøF is the
                    common hyperbola. As the plates are infinitely near each other at the apex F,
                    the water will evidently rise to that point, whatever be the height of the
                    plates.</p>
                <p>150. Mr Hawksbee extended his experiments to plates of glass placed parallel to
                    each other, and separated to different distances, and he obtained the following
                    results :— Distance of plates. Height of Ascent. Constant quantity. 0.0625 of an

                <p>The following experiments on the same subject have been more recently made by M∙
                    Monge, MM. Haüy and Tremery, and Μ. Gay-Lussac.</p>
                <p>In those made by Μ. Monge, the plates were first cleaned with caustic alkali, and
                    well washed. Their degree of separation was ascertained by silver wires of
                    different thicknesses, and the fluid used was the filtered water of the Seine.

                <p>151. The phenomena which we have been considering are all referrible to one
                    simple fart, that the particles of glass have a stronger attraction for the
                    particles of water than the particles of water have for each other. This is the
                    case with almost all other fluids except mercury, the particles of which have a
                    stronger attraction for each other than for glass. When capillary tubes,
                    therefore, are plunged in this fluid, a new series of phenomena present
                    themselves to our consideration. Let MN (fig. 44) be a vessel full of mercury.
                    Plunge into the fluid the capillary tube CD; and the mercury, instead of rising
                    in the tube, will remain stationary at E, its depression below the level surface
                    AB being inversely proportional to the diameter of the bore. This was formerly
                    ascribed to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> repulsive force supposed to exist between
                    mercury and glass, but we shall presently see that it is owing to a very
                    different cause.</p>
                <p>152. That the particles of mercury have a very strong attraction for each other,
                    appears from the globular form which a small portion of that fluid assumes, and
                    from the resistance which it opposes to any separation of its parts. If a
                    quantity of mercury is separated into a number of minute parts, all these parts
                    will be spherical; and if two of these spheres be brought into contact, they
                    will instantly rush together, and form a single drop of the same form. There is
                    also a very small degree of attraction existing between glass and mercury; for a
                    globule of the latter very readily adheres to the lower surface of a plate of
                    glass. Now, suppose a drop of water laid upon a surface anointed with grease, to
                    prevent the attraction of cohesion from reducing it to a film of fluid, this
                    drop, if very small, will be spherical. If its size is considerable, the gravity
                    of its parts will make it spheroidal, and as the drop increases in magnitude, it
                    will become more and more flattened at its poles, like AB in fig.</p>
                <p>45.. The drop, however, will still retain its convexity at the circumference,
                    however oblate be the spheroid into which it is moulded by the force of gravity.
                    Let two pieces of glass <hi rend="italic">oAm, p</hi> B <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> be now brought in contact with the circumference of the drop; the
                    mutual attraction between the particles of water which enabled it to preserve
                    the convexity of its circumference; will yield to their superior attraction for
                    glass; the space <hi rend="italic">m,n,o,p,</hi> will be immediately filled; and
                    the water will rise on the sides of the glass, and the drop will have the
                    appearance of AB in fig, 46. If the drop AB (fig. 45.) be now supposed mercury
                    instead of water, it will also, by the gravity of its parts, assume the form of
                    an oblate spheroid; but when the pieces of glass <hi rend="italic">ολrn,
                    pũu</hi> are brought close to its periphery, their attractive force upon the
                    mercurial particles is not sufficient to counteract the mutual attraction of
                    these particles; the mercury, therefore, retains its convexity at the
                    circumference, and assumes the form exhibited in fig.47∙ The small· spaces <hi
                    rend="italic">op</hi> being filled by the pressure of the superincumbent fluid,
                    while the spaces below <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi> still remain between the
                    glass and the mercury. Now if the two plates of glass A, B be made to approach
                    each other, the depressions <hi rend="italic">m,</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    will still continue, and when the distance of the pΓates is so small that these
                    depressions or indentations meet, the mercury will sink between the plates, and
                    its descent will continue as the pieces of glass approach. Hence the depression
                    of the mercury in capillary tubes becomes very intelligible. If two glass planes
                    forming a small angle, as in fig. 42, be immersed in a vessel of mercury, the
                    fluid will sink below the surface of the mercury in thç vessel, and form an
                    Apollonian hyperbola like DoF, having for its asymptotes the common intersection
                    of the planes and the surface of mercury in the vessel.</p>
                <p>153. The depression of mercury in capillary tubes is evidently owing to the
                    greater attraction that subsists be <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938387"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8387-0045"/>tween the particles of mercury and those of glass.
                    The difference between these two attractions, however, arises from an imperfect
                    contact between the mercury and the capillary tube, occasioned by the
                    interposition of a thin coating of water which generally lines the interior
                    surface of the tube, and weakens the mutual action of the glass and mercury; for
                    this action always increases as the thickness of the interposed film is
                    diminished by boiling. In the experiments which were made by Laplace and
                    Lavoisier on barometers, by boiling the mercury in them for a long time, the
                    convexity of the interior surface of the mercury was often made to disappear.
                    They even succeeded in rendering it concave, but could always restore the
                    convexity by introducing a drop of water into the tube. When the ebullition of
                    the mercury is sufficiently strong to expel all foreign particles, it often
                    rises to the level of the surrounding fluid, and the depression is even
                    converted into an elevation.</p>
                <p>154. Between mercury and water there is likely to be some fluid in which the
                    attraction of the glass for its particles is nearly equal to half the attraction
                    of the fluid for itself. Sir David Brewster has observed that iodine dissolved
                    in chloride of sulphur approximates to this condition; but not having the
                    chloride by itself, he could not observe whether or not the effect is produced
                    or influenced by the iodine. If it is, then a solution may be obtained, in which
                    the above condition is perfect. The solution of the iodine already mentioned
                    scarcely rises on the sides of the glass ball which contains it. (See 162.)</p>
                <p>155. As most philosophers seem to agree in thinking that all the capillary
                    phenomena are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles
                    only of the fluid, a variety of experiments has been made in order to determine
                    the force required to raise a horizontal solid surface from the surface of a
                    fluid. Mr Achard found that a disc of glass, 1∣ French inches in diameter,
                    required a weight of 91 French grains to raise it from the surface of the water
                    at 69° of Fahrenheit, which is only 37 English grains for each square inch. At
                    44∣ of Fahrenheit the force was <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ greater, or 39∣
                    grains, the difference being <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> J <hi rend="subscript"
                    > j</hi> for each degree of Fahrenheit. From these experiments Dr Young
                    concludes that the height of ascent in a tube of a given bore, which varies in
                    the duplicate ratio of the height of adhesion, is diminished about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> for every degree of
                    Fahrenheit that the temperature is raised above 50°; and he conjectures that
                    there must have been some considerable source of error in Achard’s experiments,
                    as he never found this diminution to exceed <hi rend="subscript"> lu</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi>. According to the
                    experiments of Dutour, the force necessary to elevate the solid, or the quantity
                    of water raised, is equal to 44.1 grains for every square iικh.</p>
                <p>156. According to the experiments of Morvcau, the force necessary to elevate a
                    circular inch of gold from the surface of mercury is 446 grains; a circular inch
                    of silver, 429 grains; a circular inch of tin, 418 grains; a circular inch of
                    lead, 397 grains; a circular inch of bismuth, 372 grains; a circular inch of
                    zinc, 204 grains; a circular inch of copper, 142 grains; a circular inch of
                    metallic antimony, 126; a circular inch of iron, 115 grains; and a similar
                    surface of cobalt required 8 grains. The order in which these metals are
                    arranged is the very order in which they are most easily amalgamated with
                    mercury.</p>
                <p>The most recent experiments on the adhesion of surfaces to fluids have been made
                    by Μ. Gay-Lussac, who obtained the following results with a circular plate of
                    glass 118.366 millimetres iň diameter :—</p>

                <p>With a copper disc, 116.604 millimetres in diameter, the weight necessary to
                    raise it from water, at the temperature of 18°.5 centigrade, was 57∙945 grammes,
                    differing very little, if at all, from glass, for the diminution of weight may
                    be explained by the circumstance of the copper disc being nearly <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> millimeters less in diameter than the glass. In these
                    experiments the discs were suspended from the scale of a balance, and the
                    weights in the other scale successively increased till the force of adhesion was
                    overcome at the instant when the disc detached itself from the fluid
                    surface.</p>
                <p>157. A number of experiments on the adhesion of fluids have been lately made by
                    Count Rumford, which authorize him to conclude, that on account of the mutual
                    adhesion of the particles of fluid, a pellicle or film is formed at the superior
                    and inferior surfaces of water, and that the force of the film to resist the
                    descent of bodies specifically heavier than the fluid increases with the
                    viscidity of the water. He poured a stratum of sulphuric ether upon a quantity
                    of water, and introduced a variety of bodies specifically heavier than water
                    into this compound fluid. A sewing needle, granulated tin, and small globules of
                    mercury, descended through the ether, but floated upon the surface of the water.
                    When the eye was placed below the level of the aqueous surface, the floating
                    body, which was a spherule of mercury, seemed suspended in a kind of bag a
                    little below the surface. When a larger spherule of mercury was employed, about
                    the 40th or 50th of an inch in diameter, it broke the pellicle and descended to
                    the bottom. The same results were obtained by using essential oil of turpentine
                    or oil of olives instead of ether. When a stratum of alcohol was incumbent upon
                    the water, a quantity of very fine pow der of tin thrown upon its surface,
                    descended to the very bottom, without seeming to have met noth any resistance
                    from the film at the surface of the water. This unexpected result Count Rumford
                    endeavours to explain by supposing that the aqueous film was destroyed by the
                    chemical action of the alcohol. In order to ascertain with greater accuracy the
                    existence of a pellicle at the surface of the water, Count Rumford employed a
                    cylindrical glass vessel 10 inches high and 11 inch in diameter, and filled it
                    with water and ether as before. A number of small bodies thrown into the vessel
                    descended through the ether and floated on the surface of the water. When the
                    whole was perfectly tranquil, he turned the cylinder three or four times round
                    with considerable rapidity in a vertical position. The floating bodies turned
                    round along with the glass, and stopped when it was stopped; but the liquid
                    water below the surface did not at first begin to turn along with the glass; and
                    its motion of rotation did not cease with the motion of the vessel. From this
                    Count Rumford concludes that there was a real pellicle at the surface of the
                    water, and that this pellicle was strongly attached to the sides of the glass,
                    so as to move along with it. When this pellicle was touched by the point of a
                    needle, all the small bodies upon its surface trembled at the same time. The
                    apparatus was allowed to stand till the ether had entirely evaporated, and when
                    the pellicle was examined with a magnifier, it was in the same state as
                    formerly; and the floating bodies had the same relative positions.</p>
                <p>In order to shew that a pellicle was formed at the inferior surface of water,
                    Count Rumford poured water upon mercury, and upon that a stratum of ether. He
                    threw into the vessel a spherule of mercury about one-third of a line in
                    diameter, which being too heavy to be supported by the pellicle at the superior
                    surface of the water, broke it, and descending through that fluid, was stopped
                    at its inferior surface. When this spherule was moved, and even compressed with
                    a feather, it still preserved its spherical form, and refused to mix with the
                    mass of mercury. When the viscidity of the water was increased by the infusion
                    of gum-arabic, much larger spherules were supported by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192938400" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8400-0046"/>pellicle. From the very rapid
                    evaporation of ether, and its lability to support the lightest particles of a
                    solid upon its surface, Count Rumferd very justly concludes, that the mutual
                    adhesion of its particles is very small.</p>
                <p>158. The approach of two floating bodies has been ascribed by some to their
                    mutual attraction, and by others to the attraction of the portions of fluid that
                    are raised round each by the attraction of cohesion. Dr Young, however,
                    observes, that the approach of the two floating bodies is produced by the excess
                    of the atmospheric pressure on the remote sides of the solids, above its
                    pressure on their neighbouring sides; or, if the experiments are performed in a
                    vacuum, by the equivalent hydrostatic pressure or suction derived from the
                    weight and immediate cohesion of the intervening fluid. This torce varies
                    alternately in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance; for when the two
                    bodies approach each other, the altitude of the fluid between them is increased
                    in the simple inverse ratio of the distance; and the mean action, or the
                    negative pressure of the fluid on each particle of the surface, is also
                    increased in the same ratio. When the floating bodies are surrounded by a
                    depression, the same law prevails, and its demonstration is still more simple
                    and obvious.</p>
                <p>159∙ A different view of the subject has been given by Monge, who made a number
                    of accurate experiments on the subject, and deduced from them the following laws
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. If two floating bodies, capable of being wetted with the fluid on which they
                    float, are placed near each other, they will approach as if mutually
                    attracted.</p>
                <p>In order to explain this law, let AB, CD (fig. 48.) be two suspended plates of
                    glass, placed at such distance that the point H where the two portions of
                    elevated fluid meet, is on a level with the rest of the water, the two plates
                    will remain stationary and in perfect equilibrium. But if they are brought
                    nearer one another, as in fig. 49, the water will rise between them to a point H
                    above the level, and by a nearer approximation, to the point G. The water thus
                    elevated, acting like a curved chain hung to the two plates, attracts the sides
                    of the plates, and brings them together m a horizontal direction. The very same
                    thing takes place with the floating bodies A, B placed at such a distance that
                    the water rises between them above its level, and hence these bodies will <hi
                    rend="subscript"> g</hi> approach by the attraction I of the fluid on their
                    inner sides.</p>
                <p>2. When the two floating bodies A, B, are not capable of being wetted, they will
                    approach each other as if mutually attracted, when they are placed near one
                    another.</p>
                <p>In this case the fluid is depressed between them below its natural level H, and
                    the two bodies are pressed <hi rend="italic">inwards</hi> or towards each other,
                    which pressure being greater than the pressure <hi rend="italic">outwards</hi>
                    of the fluid between them, they will approach each other by the action of the
                    difference of these pressures.</p>
                <p>3o If one of the bodies A, is capable of being wetted, and the other B not, as
                    shewn in the figure, they will recede from each other as if mutually
                    repelled.</p>
                <p>As the fluid rises round A, and is depressed round B, the depression round B will
                    not be equal all round, and hence the body B, being placed as if on an inclined
                    plane, it will move to the right hand when the pressure is the least.</p>
                <p>In this last case, La Place was led by theory to believe that when B is placed
                    very near A, the repulsion will be converted into attraction. Μ. Haüy tried this
                    experiment with planes of ivory and talc, the former being (incapable of being
                    wetted with water and the latter .not; and he found, in conformity with La
                    Place’s prediction, that at a certain short distance the calc moved suddenly
                    into contact with the ivory.</p>
                <p>160. The phenomena of attraction and repulsion exhibited 3etween small lighted
                    wicks, swimming in a basin of oil, and the motions of floating evaporable
                    substances like camphor, and also of potassium and light substances, such as
                    cork, impregnated with ether, have been sometimes treated under this head. The
                    first of these classes of phenomena arise from an unbalanced pressure upon the
                    floating wick, arising from a difference of temperature of different parts of
                    the oil, and the movements of the second class arise from the reaction of the
                    currents of vapour which flow from the floating substances. A full account of
                    these phenomena will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh

                <p>Let ABCDEFGH (fig. 53.) be the section of a capillary tube, MNP the surface of
                    the water in the vessel, It the height of its ascent, viz. the concave surface
                    of the fluid column, and IKLM an indefinitely small column of fluid reaching to
                    the surface at Μ. Now the column ML is solicited by the force of gravity which
                    acts through the whole extent of the column, and by the reciprocal attraction of
                    the moleculae, which, though they act the same in all the points of the column,
                    only exhibit their effects towards the extremity Μ. If any particle <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> is taken at a less distance from the surface than the
                    distance at which the attraction if the liquid generally terminates, and if <hi

                <p>The column IK, on the other hand, which is in a state of equilibrium with ML, is
                    acted upon by the force of gravity through the whole extent of the column, also
                    by other forces at the upper and lower extremities of the tube. The forces
                    exerted at the upper part of the column are, the attraction of the tube upon the
                    particles of water, and the reciprocal attraction of these particles; but as
                    every particle is as much drawn upwards as downwards by the first of these
                    forces, the consideration of it may be dropped. In order to estimate the other
                    force, let a horizontal plane VX touch the concavity at I, a particle <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> situated infinitely near to I, is attracted by all the
                    particles above VX, and by all below it whose sphere of activity comprehends
                    that particle; and as the particles above <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> are fewer
                    than those below it, the result of these forces must be a force acting
                    downwards.</p>
                <p>In order to estimate the value of the forces which act at the lower end 0 of the
                    tube, let us suppose that the tube has a prolongation to the bottom of the
                    vessel, formed of matter of the same density as the water. Let a particle R be
                    situated a little above the extremity of the tube, and another Q as much below
                    that extremity, they will be equally acted upon by the water above that place,
                    and by the water between the fictitious prolongation of the tube, and therefore
                    these forces will destroy one another.</p>
                <p>By applying to the case of the particle R the same reasoning that was used for
                    the particle <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> it will appear that the result of its
                    attraction by the tube is an attraction upwards. The particle R is likewise
                    attracted downwards by the supposed prolongation of the tube, and the difference
                    between these is the real effect. The other particle Q, is also drawn upwards by
                    the tube with the same force as R, since, by the hypothesis, it is as far
                    distant from the points D, G, as the particle R is from the points <hi
                    rend="italic">cl, g,</hi> where, with respect to it, the real attraction of the
                    tube commences. The particle Q. is attracted also downwards, by the supposed
                    prolongation of the tube, and the difference of these actions is the real
                    effect. Hence the double of this force is the sum of all the forces that act at
                    the lower part of the tube. These forces, when combined with those exerted at
                    the top of the tube, and with the force of gravity, give the total expression,
                    which should be combined with that of the forces with which the column ML is
                    actuated.</p>

                <p>CΓairaut then observes, that there is an infinitude of possible laws of
                    attraction which will give a sensible quantity for the elevation of the fluid I
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> above the level MN, when the diameter of the tube is
                    very small, and a quantity next to nothing when the diameter is considerable;
                    and he remarks, that we may select the Iaw which gives the inverse ratio between
                    the diameter of the tube and the height of the liquid, conformable to
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>162. It follow s from the preceding formula, that if anv solid AB possesses half
                    the attracting power or the fluid CĎ, the surface of the fluid will remain
                    horizontal; for the attraction being represented by DA, DE, and DC, DA and DE
                    maybe combined into DB, and DB and DC into DE, which is vertical. The water will
                    therefore not be raised, since the surface of a fluid at rest must be
                    perpendicular to the resulting direction of all the forces which act upon
                    it.</p>
                <p>When the attracting power of the solid is more than half as great, the resultant
                    of the forces will be GF in fig. 55, and therefore the fluid must rise towards
                    the solid, in order to be perpendicular to GF. When the attractive power of the
                    solid is less than that of the fluid, the resultant will be HF in fig. 55; and
                    therefore, as in the case of mercury, the surface must be depressed, in order to
                    be perpendicular to the force.</p>
                <p>163. The subject of Capillary attraction has more recently occupied the attention
                    of the late Marquis de la Place, who published his first remarks on the subject
                    in 1806, In 1807 he published a ’ supplement to his theory, in which he Compares
                    his formula with the experiments of Gay-Lussac and others.</p>
                <p>In die first treatise'published’by Μ. La Place, his method of considering the
                    phenomena was founded on the íbrm of the surface of the fluid in capillary
                    spaces, and on the conditions of equilibrium of this fluid in an infinitely
                    narrow callal, resting by one of its extremities upon this surface, and by the
                    other on the horizontal surfaces of an indefinite fluid, in which the capillary
                    tube was immersed. In his supplement to that treatise, he has examined the
                    subject in a much more popular point of view, by considering directly the Forces
                    which elevate and depress the fluid in this space. By this means, he is
                    conducted easily to several general results, which it would have been difficult
                    to obtain directly by his former method. Of this method we shall endeavour to
                    give as clear a view as possible.</p>
                <p>164. Let AB, fig. 56, be a vertical tube whose sides are perpendicular to its
                    base, and which is immersed in a fluid that rises in the interior of the tube
                    above its natural level. A thin film of fluid is first raised by the action of
                    the sides of the tube; this film raises a second film, and this second film a
                    third film, till the weight of the volume of fluid raised exactly balances all
                    the forces by which it is actuated. Hence it is obvious, that the elevation of
                    the column is produced by the attraction of the tube upon the fluid, and the
                    attraction of the fluid for itself. Let us suppose that the inner -surface of
                    the tube AB is prolonged to E, and after bending itself horizontally in the
                    direction ED, that it assumes a vertical direction DC; and let us suppose the
                    sides of this tube to be sp extremely thin, or to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192938426" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8426-0048"/>formed of a film of ice, so
                    as to have no action on the fluid which it contains, and not to prevent the
                    reciprocal action which takes place between the particles of the first tube AB
                    and the particles of the fluid. Now, since the fluid in the tubes AE, CD, is in
                    equilibrio, it is obvious that the excess of pressure of the fluid in AE is
                    destroyed by the vertical attraction of the tube and of the fluid upon the fluid
                    contained in AB. In analyzing these different attractions, La Place considered
                    first those which take place under the tube AB. The fluid column BE is
                    attracted, 1. by itself; 2. by the fluid surrounding the tube BE. But these two
                    attractions are destroyed by the similar attractions experienced by the fluid
                    contained in the branch DC, so that they may be entirely neglected. The fluid in
                    BE is also attracted vertically by the fluid in AB; but this attraction is
                    destroyed by the attraction which it exercises in the opposite direction upon
                    the fluid in BE, so that these balanced attractions may likewise be neglected.
                    The fluid in BE is likewise attracted vertically upwards by the tube AB, with a
                    force which we shall call Q, and which contributes to destroy the excess of
                    pressure exerted upon it by the column BF raised in the tube above its natural
                    level.</p>
                <p>Now, the fluid in the lower part of the round tube AB is attracted, 1. By itself;
                    but as the reciprocal attractions of a body do not communicate to it any motion
                    if it is solid, we may, without disturbing the equilibrium, conceive the fluid
                    in AB frozen. 2. The fluid in the lower part of AB is attracted by the interior
                    fluid of the tube BE, but as the latter is attracted upwards by the same force,
                    these two actions may be neglected as balancing each other. 3. The fluid in the
                    lower part of BE is attracted by the fluid which surrounds the ideal tube BE,
                    and the result of this attraction is a vertical force acting downwards, which we
                    may call — Q ʹ, the contrary sign being applied, as the force is here opposite
                    to the other force Q. . As it is highly probable that the ' attractive forces
                    exercised by the glass and the water vary according to the same function of the
                    distance, so as to differ only in their intensities, we may employ the constant
                    co-efficients <hi rend="italic">g, g</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    t</hi><hi rend="italic">as</hi> measures of their intensity, so that the. forces
                    Q and — Q ʹ will be proportional to <hi rend="italic">g, g</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> f</hi>; for the interior surface of the fluid which surrounds the
                    tube BE, is the same as the interior surface of the tube AB. Consequently, the
                    two masses, viz. the glass in AB, and the fluid round BĖ differ only in their
                    thickness; but as the attraction of both these masses is insensible at sensible
                    distances, the difference of their thicknesses, provided their thicknesses be
                    sensible, will produce no difference in the attractions. 4. The fluid in the
                    tube AB is also acted upon by another force, namely, by the sides of the tube AB
                    in which it is inclosed⅛ If we conceive the column FB divided into an infinite
                    number of elementary vertical columns, and if at the upper extremity of óue of
                    these columns we draw a horizontal plane, the portion of the tube comprehended
                    between the plane and the level surface BC of the fluid will not produce any
                    vertical force upon the column; consequently, the only active vertical force is
                    that which isĵproduced by the ring of the tube immediately above the horizontal
                    plane. Now, the vertical attraction of this part of the tube upon BE, will be
                    equal to that of the entire tube upon the column BE, which is equal in diameter,
                    and similarly placed. This new force will therefore be represented by + Q. In
                    combining these different forces, it is manifest that the fluid column BF is
                    attractε d upwards by the two forces + Q, + Q, and downwards by the force — Q ʹ;
                    consequently the force with which it is raised upwards will be 2 Q ’ — Q ʹ. If
                    we represent by V the volume of the column BE, by D its intensity, and by <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> the force of gravity, then yDV will represent the weight of
                    the elevated column; but as this weight is in equilibrio with the forces by
                    which it is elevated, we have the following equation:</p>
                <p>&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> DV = 2Q-Q'.</p>
                <p>If the force 2 Q is less than Q ʹ, then V will be negative, and the fluid will
                    sink in the tube; but as long as 2 Q is greater than Q, ʹ, V will be positive,
                    and the fluid will rise above its natural level; as was long before shewn by Μ.
                    Clairaut.</p>
                <p>Since the attractive forces, both of the glass and the fluid, are insensible at
                    sensible distances, the surface of the tube AB will act sensibly only on the
                    column of fluid immediately in contact with it. We may therefore neglect the
                    consideration of the curvature, and consider the inner surface as developed upon
                    a plane. The force Q will therefore be proportional to the width of this plane,
                    or what is the same thing, to the interior circumference of the tube. Calling c,
                    therefore, the circumference of the tube, we shall have Q = <hi rend="italic">g
                    c; g</hi> being a constant quantity, representing the intensity of the
                    attraction of the tube A.B upon the fluid, in the case where the attractions of
                    different bodies are expressed by the same function of the distance. In every
                    case, however, <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> a
                    quantity dependent on the attraction of the matter of the tube, and independent
                    of its figure and magnitude. In like manner we shall have Q ʹ = g ʹ c; <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> ’ expressing the same thing with regard to the attraction
                    of the fluid for itself, that <hi rend="italic">g</hi> expressed with regard to
                    the attraction of the tube for the fluid. By substituting these values of Q Q ʹ,
                    in the preceding equation, we have</p>
                <p>#DV <hi rend="italic">= c(2g- g').</hi></p>
                <p>If we now substitute, in this general formula, the value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> in terms of the radius if it is a capillary tube, or in terms of the
                    sides if the section is a rectangle, and the value of V in terms of the radius
                    and altitude of the fluid column, we shall obtain an equation by which the
                    heights of ascent may be calculated for tubes of all diameters, after the
                    height, belonging to any given diameter, has been ascertained by direct

                <p>It will be seen from the formula No. 2, that of all tubes that have a prismatic
                    form, the hollow cylinder is the one in which the volume of fluid raised is the
                    least possible, as it has the smallest perimeter. It appears, also, that if the
                    section of the tube is a regular polygon, the altitudes of the fluid will be
                    reciprocally proportional to the homologous lines of the similar base, a result
                    which, as we have seen, Μ. Gellert obtained from direct experiment. Hence, in
                    all prismatic tubes whose sections are polygons inscribed in the same circle,
                    the fluid will rise to the same mean height. If one of the two bases is, for
                    example, a square, and the other an equilateral triangle, the altitudes will be
                    as 2: 3f, or very nearly as 7: 8.</p>
                <p>168* <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Μ. La Place has remarked, that there maybe
                    several states of equilibrium in the same tube, provided its width is not
                    uniform. If we suppose two capillary tubes communicating with one another, so
                    that the smallest is placed above the greatest, we may then conceive their
                    diameters and lengths to be such, that the fluid is at first in equilibrium
                    above its level in the widest tube, and that in pouring in some of the same
                    fluid, so as to reach the smaller tube, and fill part of it, the fluid will
                    still maintain itself in equilibrio. When the diameter of a capillary tube
                    diminishes by insensible gradations, the different states of equilibrium are
                    alternately stable and instable. At first the fluid tends to raise itself in the
                    tube, and this tendency .diminishing, becomes nothing in a state of equilibrium.
                    Beyond this it becomes negative, and consequently the fluid tends to descend.
                    Thus the first equilibrium is stable, since the fluid, being a little removed
                    from this state, tends to return to it. In continuing to raise the fluid, its
                    tendency to descend diminishes, and becomes nothing in the second state of
                    equilibrium. Beyond this it becomes positive, and the fluid tends to rise, and
                    consequently to remove from this state which is not stable. In a similar manner
                    it will be seen, that the third state is stable, the fourth instable, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>I69. Although the preceding method of considering the phenomena of capillary
                    attraction is extremely simple and accurate, yet it does not indicate the
                    connexion which subsists between the elevation and depression of the fluid, and
                    the concavity or convexity of the surface which every fluid assumes in capillary
                    spaces. The object of Μ. La Place’s first method, contained in his first
                    supplement, is to determine this connexion.</p>
                <p>By means of the methods for calculating the attraction of spheroids, he
                    determines the action of a mass of fluid terminated by a spherical surface,
                    concave or convex, upon a column of fluid contained in an infinitely narrow
                    canal, directed towards the centre of this surface. By this action La Place
                    means the pressure which the fluid contained in the canal would exercise, in
                    virtue of the attraction of its entire mass upon a plane base situated in the
                    interior of the canal, and perpendicular to its sides, at any sensible distance
                    from the surface, this base being taken for unity. He then shews that this
                    action is smaller when the surface <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938452"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8452-0050"/>is concave than when it is plane, and greater when
                    the surface is convex. The analytical expression of this action is composed of
                    two terms. The first of these terms, which is much greater than the second,
                    expresses the action of the mass terminated by a plane surface; and the second
                    term expresses the part of the action due to the sphericity of the surface, or,
                    in other words, the action of the meniscus comprehended between this surface and
                    the plane which touches it. This action is either additive to the preceding, or
                    subtractive from it, according as the surface is convex or concave. It is
                    reciprocally proportional to the radius of the spherical surface; for the
                    smaller that this radius is, the meniscus is the nearer to the point of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>From these results relative to bodies terminated by sensible segments of a
                    spherical surface, La Place deduces this general theorem. “In all the laws which
                    render the attraction insensible at sensible distances, the action of a body
                    terminated by a curve surface upon an interior canal infinitely narrow,
                    perpendicular to this surface in any point, is equal to the half sum of the
                    actions upon the same canal of two spheres, which have for their radii the
                    greatest and the smallest of the radii of the osculating circle of the surface
                    at this point.”</p>
                <p>170. By means of this theorem, and the laws of hydrostatics, La Place has
                    determined the figure which a mass of fluid ought to take when acted upon by
                    gravity, or contained in a vessel of a given figure. The nature of the surface
                    is expressed by an equation of partial differences of the second order, which
                    cannot be integrated by any known method. If the figure of the surface is one of
                    revolution, the equation is reduced to one of ordinary differences, and is
                    capable of being integrated by approximation, when the surface is very small. La
                    Place next shews, that a very narrow tube approaches the more to that of a
                    spherical segment as the diameter of the tube becomes smaller. If these segments
                    are similar in different tubes of the same substance, the radii of their
                    surfaces will be inversely as the diameter of the tubes. This similarity of the
                    spherical segments will appear evident, if we consider that the distance at
                    which the action of the tube ceases to be sensible is imperceptible; so that if,
                    by means of a very powerful microscope, this distance should be found equal to a
                    millimetre, it is probable that the same magnifying power would give to the
                    diameter of the tube an apparent diameter of several metres. The surface of the
                    tube may therefore be considered as very nearly plane, in a radius equal to that
                    of the sphere of sensible activity; the fluid in this interval will therefore
                    descend, or rise from this surface, very nearly as if it were plane. Beyond this
                    the fluid being subjected only to the action of gravity, and the mutual action
                    of its own particles, the surface will be very nearly that of a spherical
                    segment, of which the extreme planes being those of the fluid surface, at the
                    limits of the sphere of the sensible activity of the tube, will be very nearly
                    in different tubes equally inclined to their sides. Hence it follows that all
                    the segments will be similar.</p>
                <p>171. The approximation of these results gives the true cause of the ascent or
                    descent of fluids in capillary tubes in the inverse ratio of their diameter. If
                    in the axis of a glass tube we conceive a canal infinitely narrow, which bends
                    round like the tube ABEDC in fig. 56, the action of the water in the tube in
                    this narrow canal will be less, on account of the concavity of its surface, than
                    the action of the water in the vessel on the same-canal. The fluid will
                    therefore rise in the tube to compensate for this difference of action; and as
                    the concavity is inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube, the height
                    of the fluid will be also inversely proportional to that diameter. If the sur- •
                    face of the interior fluid is convex, which is the case with mercury in a glass
                    tube, the action of this fluid on the canal will be greater than that of the
                    fluid in.the vessel, and therefore the fluid will descend in the tube in the
                    ratio of their difference, and consequently in the inverse ratio of the diameter
                    of the tube.</p>
                <p>In this manner of viewing the subject, the attraction of capillary tubes has no
                    influence upon the ascent or depression of the fluids which they contain, but in
                    determining the inclination of the first planes of the surface of the interior
                    fluid extremely near the sides of the tube, and upon this inclination depends
                    the concavity or convexity of the surface, and the length of its radius. The
                    friction of the fluid against the sides of the tube may augment or diminish a
                    little the curvature of its surface, of which we see frequent examples in the
                    barometer. In this case the capillary effects will increase or diminish in the
                    same ratio.</p>
                <p>The differential equation of the surfaces of fluids inclosed in capillary spaces
                    of revolution, conducts La Place to the following general result; that if into a
                    cylindrical tube we introduce a cylinder which has the same axis as that of the
                    tube, and which is such that the space comprehended between its surface and the
                    interior surface of the tube has very little width, the fluid will rise in this
                    space to the same height as in a tube whose radius is equal to this width. If we
                    suppose the radii of the tube and of the cylinder infinite, we have the case of
                    a tube included between two parallel and vertical planes, very near each other.
                    This result has been confirmed, as we have already seen, by the experiments of
                    Newton, Haüy, and Gay-Lussac. La Place then applies his theory to the phenomena
                    presented by a drop of fluid, either in motion or suspended in equilibrio,
                    either in a conical capillary tube, or between two plates, and inclined to each
                    other, as discovered by Mr Hawksbee; to the mutual approximation of two parallel
                    and vertical discs immersed in a fluid; to the phenomena which take place when
                    two plates of glass are inclined to each other at a small angle; and to the
                    determination of the figure of a large drop of mercury laid upon a horizontal
                    plate of glass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Form of Drops.</hi></p>
                <p>172. It was observed by Μ. Monge, that when drops of alcohol fall upon a surface
                    of the same fluid, they do not at first mix with it, but roll over its surfaces
                    with great facility, impinge against each other, and are reflected like billiard
                    balls. Μ. Monge observed an analogous phenomenon in the drops of water which
                    fall from the oars during the rowing of a boat, and during the condensation of
                    the vapour of warm fluids.</p>
                <p>In repeating the experiments of Monge, Sir David Brewster found that the
                    phenomena were most beautiful when the capillary tube discharged the drops upon
                    the inclined plane of fluid, which is elevated by the attraction of the edge of
                    the cup. They ran down the inclined plane with great velocity, and sometimes
                    even ascended the similar plane on the opposite side of the vessel. When the
                    drop was discharged at the distance of one or two-tenths of an inch from the
                    surface of the water, they had always the same magnitude when the tube was held
                    in the same position; but when the point of the tube was brought within a tenth
                    of an inch of the surface of the spirit of wine, this surface, instead of
                    attracting the drop to it instantly, as Saussure would have predicted, actually
                    resisted the gravity or weight of drop, and allowed it to attain a diameter
                    nearly twice as great as it would have had, if it had been discharged in the
                    ordinary manner. This swoln globule floated upon the surface in the same manner
                    as the smaller drops, surrounded with a depression of the fluid surface similar
                    to what is produced by a glass globule floating on mercury, or by the feet of
                    particular insects, that have the power of running upon the surface of water.
                    The floating <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938465" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8465-0051"
                    />globules are often produced even when they are discharged from a height of
                    three or four inches; and by letting them fall upon the inclined plane of fluid
                    formerly mentioned, they will often rebound from the surface, and fall over the
                    sides of the cup.</p>
                <p>173. In a phenomenon the very reverse of the formation of a drop, which was first
                    noticed by Sir David Brewster, the cohesion of fluids is shewn in a very
                    interesting manner. If we take a phial, with a wide month, half filled with
                    Canada balsam, and allow the balsam to flow to the mouth of the phial and fill
                    it up, then when the phial is placed on its bottom, a fine transparent film of
                    balsam will be seen extending over the mouth of the phial. If we now take a
                    piece of slender wire, and touch the film near the middle, so as to tear away a
                    little part of it, the remaining part of the film which has been elevated by
                    this force will descend to its level position, and the ragged aperture from
                    which the balsam has been torn will be seen to assume a form perfectly circular,
                    having its edge in a slight degree thickened, like a circle with a raised margin
                    turned out of a piece of wood. This fine circular aperture grows wider and
                    wider, and continues to preserve its circular form till the mouth of the phial
                    is again opened.</p>
                <p>174. We shall now conclude the subject of capillary attraction with an account of
                    an experiment made by Sir David Brewster, and intimately connected with the
                    subject. Above a vessel MNOP, Fig. 57, nearly filled with water, a convex lens
                    LL was placed at the distance of the 10th of an inch, and rays R, R, R, were
                    incident upon its upper surface. The focus of these rays was at F, a little
                    beyond the bottom of the vessel, so that a circular image of the luminous object
                    was seen on the bottom of the vessel, having AB for its diameter. If the lens is
                    now made to descend gradually towards the surface of the water, and the eye kept
                    steadily upon the luminous image AB, a dark spot will be seen at D in the centre
                    of AB, a little while before the lens attracts and elevates the water MN.
                    Sometimes this spot may be Sv m playing backwards and forwards by the slight
                    motion of the hand, so that the lens can even be withdrawn from the fluid
                    surface without having actually touched it. In general, however, the sudden rise
                    of the water to the lens follows the appearance of the black spot. W'hen the
                    water is in contact with the glass, the focus of the rays R, R, is now
                    transferred to <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and the circular image on the bottom is
                    now <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and the intensity of the light in this circle is
                    to that in the circle AB, as AB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: α6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Now it is obvious, that the darkish spot at D is
                    just the commencement of the transference of the focus from F to <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or when the dark spot is produced,
                    the progress of the rays is the same as if the focus were transferred to <hi
                    rend="italic">f.</hi> This remarkable effect may arise from two causes. 1. The
                    approach of the lens to the surface MN, may occasion a depression <hi
                    rend="italic">mon</hi> in the surface of the fluid of the same curvature as <hi
                    rend="italic">LlL,</hi> which would have the effect of transferring the focus
                    from F to <hi rend="italic">f</hi> 2. The transference of the focus from F to
                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi> may arise from the optical contact of the glass of
                    water taking place at a greater distance from the lens than that at which
                    capillary attraction commences.</p>
                <p>PART II.—HYDRAULICS.</p>
                <p>i75. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydraulics</hi> is that branch of the science of
                    Hydrodynamics which relates to fluids in motion. It comprehends the theory of
                    running water, whether issuing from orifices in reservoirs by the pressure of
                    the superincumbent mass, or rising perpendicularly in <hi rend="italic">jets
                    d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">caux</hi> from the pressure of the atmosphere;
                    whether moving in pipes and canals, or rolling in the beds of rivers. It
                    comprehends also the resistance or the percussion of fluids, and the oscillation
                    of waves.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I.—THEORY OF FLUIDS ISSUING FROM ORIFICES IN RESERVOIRS, EITHER IN A
                    LATERAL OR A VERTICAL DIRECTION.</p>
                <p>176. If water issues from an orifice either in the bottom or side of a reservoir,
                    the surface of the fluid in the reservoir is always horizontal till it reaches
                    Within a little of the bottom. When a vessel, therefore, is emptying itself, the
                    particles of the fluid descend in vertical lines, as is represented in fig. 58.;
                    but when they have reached within three or four inches of the orifice <hi
                    rend="italic">run.</hi> the particles which are not immediately above it change
                    the direction of their motion, ’ and make for the orifice in directions of
                    different degrees of obliquity. The velcities of these particles may be
                    decomposed into two others, one in a horizontal direction, by which they move
                    parallel to the orifice, and the other in a vertical direction, by which they
                    approach that ori- &gt;fice. Now, as the particles about C and D move with
                    greater obliquity than those nearer E, their horizontal velocities must also be
                    greater, and their vertical velocities less. But the particles near E move with
                    so little obliquity that their vertical are much greater than their horizontal
                    velocities, and very little less than their absolute ones. The different
                    particles of the fluid, therefore, will rush through the orifice <hi
                    rend="italic">nin</hi> with very different velocities, and in various
                    directions, and will arrive at a certain distance from the orifice in different
                    times. On account of the mutual adhesion of the fluid particles, however, those
                    which have the greatest velocity drag the rest along with them; and as the
                    former move through the centre of the orifice, the breadth of the issuing column
                    of fluid will be less at <hi rend="italic">op</hi> than the width of the orifice
                    <hi rend="italic">inn.</hi> i77. That the preceding phenomena really exist when
                    a vessel of water is discharging its contents through an aperture, experience
                    sufficiently testifies. If some small substances specifically heavier than water
                    be thrown into the fluid when the vessel is emptying itself, they will at first
                    descend vertically, and when they come within a few inches of the bottom they
                    will deviate from this direction, and describe oblique curves similar to those
                    in the figure.</p>

                <p>The contraction of the vein or column of fluid at <hi rend="italic">op</hi> is
                    also manifest from observation. It was first discovered by Sir Isaac Newton, and
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">contracta.</hi> The
                    greatest contraction takes place at a point <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> whose
                    distance from the orifice is equal to half its diameter, so that <hi
                    rend="italic">77171</hi><hi rend="italic">om~--</hi> —; and the breadth of the
                    vein or column of fluid at o is to the width of the orifice as 5 to 8 according
                    to Bossut, or as 5.197 to 8 according to the experiments of Michelotti, the
                    orifice being perforated in a thin plate. But when the water is made to issue
                    through a short cylindrical tube, the same contraction, though not obvious to
                    the eye, is so considerable, that the diameter of the contracted vein is to that
                    of the orifice as 6.5 to 8. If A therefore be the real size of the orifice in a
                    thin plate, its corrected size, or the breadth of the contracted vein,</p>
                <p>5.197 × A</p>
                <p>will be ——- , and when a cylindrical tube is employed</p>

                <p>in the reservoir must be reckoned from the surface of the fluid to the point o,
                    where the vein ceases to contract; and when a cylindrical tube is employed, it
                    must be reckoned from the same surface to the exterior aperture of the tube.</p>
                <p>178. Suppose the fluid ABCD (fig. 58) divided into an infinite number of equal
                    <hi rend="italic">strata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">laminae</hi> by the
                    horizontal surfaces MN, <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> infinitely near each other;
                    and let <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">n op</hi> be a small column of
                    fluid which issues from the orifice in the same time that the surface MN
                    descends to <hi rend="italic">gh.</hi> The column <hi rend="italic">mnop</hi> is
                    evidently equal to the lamina MN <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> for the quantity of

                    >gh,</hi> is evidently MN <hi rend="italic">hg</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    to the quantity discharged in that time, the column <hi rend="italic">mnop</hi>
                    was equal by hypothesis. Let A be the area of the base MN, and B the area of the
                    base <hi rend="italic">mn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> let <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> be the height of a column equal to MN <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> and

                    the’column <hi rend="italic">mnop.</hi> Then, since the column <hi rend="italic"
                    >mnop</hi> is equal to the lamina MN <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> we shall have
                    A∙r = By, and <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geometry,</hi> Sect. IV. Theor. IX.) <hi
                    rend="italic">x:y</hi> = A: B; but as the surface MN descends to <hi
                    rend="italic">gh</hi> in the same time that <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> descends
                    to <hi rend="italic">op, x</hi> will represent the mean velocity of the lamina
                    MN <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the mean velocity of
                    the column <hi rend="italic">mnop.</hi> The preceding analogy, therefore,
                    informs us, that the mean velocity of any lamina is to the velocity of the fluid
                    issuing from the orifice reciprocally as the area of the orifice is to the area
                    of the base of the lamina MN <hi rend="italic">gh.</hi> Hence it follows, that,
                    if the area of the orifice is infinitely small, with regard to the area of the
                    base of the lamina into which the fluid is supposed to be divided, the mean
                    velocity of the fluid at the orifice will be infinitely greater than that of the
                    laminae; that is, while the velocity at the orifice is finite, that of the
                    laminae will be infinitely small.</p>
                <p>179. Before applying these principles to the theory of hydraulics, it may be
                    proper to ' observe, that several distinguished philosophers have founded the
                    science upon the same general law from which we have deduced the principles of
                    hydrostatics (48). In this way they have represented the motion of fluids in
                    general formulae; but these formulae are so complicated from the very nature of
                    the theory, and the calculations are so intricate, and sometimes impracticable
                    from their length, that they can afford no assistance to the practical
                    engineer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definition.</hi></p>
                <p>180. If the water issues at <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> with the same velocity V
                    that a heavy body would acquire by falling freely through a given height H, this
                    velocity is said to be due to the height. H, and inversely the height H is said
                    to be due to the velocity V.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>181. The velocity of a fluid issuing from an infinitely small orifice in the
                    bottom or side of a vessel, is equal to that which is due to the height of the
                    surface of the fluid above that orifice, the vessel being supposed constantly
                    full.</p>
                <p>Let AB, fig. 59, be the vessel containing the fluid, its velocity when issuing
                    from the aperture <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be that which is due to the
                    height Dm, or equal to that which a heavy body would acquire by falling through
                    that height. Because the orifice <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> is infinitely small, the velocity of the laminae into which the fluid
                    may be supposed to be divided, will also be infinitely small. But since all the
                    fluid particles, by virtue of their gravity, have a tendency to descend with the
                    same velocity; and since the different laminae of the fluid lose this velocity,
                    the column <hi rend="italic">must</hi> must be pressed by the superincumbent
                    column D <hi rend="italic">mn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and calling S the
                    specific gravity of the fluid, the mo <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ving force
                    which pushes out the column <hi rend="italic">must</hi> will be S × Dm × <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> (art. 58). Now, let us suppose, that, when this moving
                    force is pushing out the column <hi rend="italic">mnst,</hi> the absolute weight
                    of the column <hi rend="italic">mnop,</hi> which may be represented by S × <hi

                    rend="italic">half</hi> the height of the fluid above the orifice. This was
                    first maintained by Sir Isaac Newton, who found that the diameter of the <hi

                    orifice as 21 to 25. The area therefore of the one was to the area of the other
                    as 21 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to 25 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, which
                    is nearly the ratio of 1 to <hi rend="italic">V</hi> 2. But by measuring the
                    quantity of water discharged in a given time, and also the area of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">contracta,</hi> Sir Isaac found that

                    was that which was due to the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> altitude of the fluid
                    above the orifice. He therefore concluded, that since the velocity at the
                    orifice was to that at the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    as the same quantity of fluid runs through every section in the same time, it is
                    evident that the velocity must be greater in a smaller section, and as much
                    greater as the section is smaller, otherwise the same quantity of water would
                    not pass through each section in the same time. Now the area of the <hi

                    heights.' Now the difference between this theory and that contained in the
                    preceding proposition may be thus explained. The velocity found by the preceding
                    proposition is evidently the vertical velocity of the filaments at E (fig. 59),
                    which being immediately above the centre of the aperture <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> are not diverted from their course, and have therefore their vertical
                    equal to their absolute velocity. But the vertical velocity of the particles
                    between C and E, and E and D, is much less than their absolute velocity, on
                    account of the obliquity of their motion, and also on account of their friction
                    on the sides of the orifice. The mean vertical velocity, consequently, of the
                    issuing fluid will be much less than the vertical velocity of the particles at
                    E, that is, than the velocity found by the above proposition, or that due to the
                    height D <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Now the velocity found by Sir Isaac Newton
                    from measuring the quantity of water discharged, was evidently the mean
                    velocity, ∖vhich ought to be less than the velocity given by the preceding

                    1: 1.414. The theorem of Newton therefore may be considered as giving the mean
                    velocity at the orifice, while the proposition gives the velocity of the

                    the vessel is so small, that every part of it is equally distant from the
                    surface of the fluid. But when the orifice is large like Μ (fig. 60.), the
                    depths of different parts of the orifice below the surface of the fluid arc very
                    different, and consequently the preceding formulae will not give very accurate
                    results. If we suppose the orifice Μ divided into a number of smaller orifices
                    <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> it is evident that the water will issue at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> with a velocity due to the height Dα, the water at <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> with a velocity due to the height Eó, and the water at c,
                    with a velocity due to the height F <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> When the whole
                    orifice, therefore, is opened, the fluid will issue with different velocities at
                    different parts of its section. Consequently, in order to find new formulae
                    expressing the quantity of water discharged, we must conceive the orifice to be
                    divided into an infinite number of areas or portions by horizontal planes; and

                    rectangular orifice, into which the whole orifice GL is supposed to be divided,
                    we must find the sum of all the quantities discharged in the time T, in order to
                    have the total quantity afforded, by the finite orifice in the same time. Upon
                    DC as the principal axis, describe the parabola CHE, having its parameter P

                <p>This property of fluids in motion was discovered by Μ. Venturi, Professor of
                    Natural Philosophy in the University of Modena, who has illustrated it by a
                    variety of experiments in his work on the lateral communication of motion in
                    fluids. Let a pipe AC, about half an inch in diameter and a foot long,
                    proceeding from the reservoir AB, and having its extremity bent into the form
                    CD, be inserted into the vessel CDG, whose side DG gradually rises till it
                    passes over the rim of the vessel. Fill this vessel with water, and pour the
                    same fluid into the reservoir AB, till, running down the pipe AC, it forms the
                    stream EGH. In a short while, the water in the vessel CDG will be carried off by
                    the current EG, which communicates its motion to i97. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cor.</hi> Hence the time in which two cylindrical vessels full of water will
                    empty themselves, will be in the compound ratio of their bases and the square

                <p>I</p>
                <p>A clepsydra, or water-clock, is a machine which, filled <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> with water, measures time by the descent of the fluid surface. See Part
                    III. on <hi rend="italic">Hydraulic Machinery.</hi></p>
                <p>It has already been demonstrated in Prop. IV. that the times in which the surface
                    AB descends to DE and RT, &amp;c. are as the areas GM <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    H, GM <hi rend="italic">t</hi> U, &amp;c. If such a form therefore is given to
                    the vessel that the areas GM <hi rend="italic">r</hi> H, GM <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> U, &amp;c. increase uniformly as the times, or are to one another as the
                    numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. the times in which the surface AB descends to DE,
                    and RT, &amp;c. will be in the same ratio, and the vessel will form a machine
                    for measuring time. If the vessel is cylindrical and empties itself in 12 hours,
                    its altitude may be divided in such a manner that the fluid surface may take
                    exactly an hour to descend through each division. Let the cylindrical vessel,
                    for example, be divided into 144 equal parts, then the surface of the water,
                    when the twelve hours begin to run, will be 144 parts above the bottom of the
                    vessel; when one hour is completed, the surface will be 121 parts above the
                    bottom and so on in the following manner:</p>
                <p>4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</p>
                <p>64 49 36 25 16 9 4 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> l 0</p>

                <p>the adjacent fluid. In the same way, when a stream of water runs through air, it
                    drags the air along with it, and produces wind. Hence, we have the water blowing
                    machine, which conveys a blast to furnaces, and which will be described in a
                    future part of this article. The lateral· communication of motion, whether the
                    surrounding fluid be air or water, is well illustrated by the following
                    beautiful experiments of Venturi’s. In the side of the reservoir AB (fig. 65),
                    insert the horizontal pipe P about an inch <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938556"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8556-0058"/>and a half in diameter, and five inches long. At
                    the point <hi rend="italic">o</hi> of this pipe, about seven-tenths of an inch
                    from the reservoir, fasten the bent glass tube <hi rend="italic">o n m,</hi>
                    whose cavity corn - ⅛nunicates with that of the pipe, whilst its other extremity
                    is immersed in coloured water contained in the small vessel F. When water is
                    poured into the reservoir AB, having no connection with the pipe C, so that it
                    may issue from the horizontal pipe, the red liquor will rise towards <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> in the incurvated tube <hi rend="italic">onm.</hi> If the
                    descending leg of this glass syphon be six inches and a half longer than the
                    other, the red liquor will rise to the very top of the syphon, enter the pipe P,
                    and running out with the other water, will in a short time leave the vessel F
                    empty. Now, the cause of this phenomenon is evidently this: When the water
                    begins to flow from the pipe P, it communicates with the air in the syphon <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi><hi rend="italic">n m,</hi> and drags a portion along with
                    it. The air in the syphon is therefore rarefied, and this process of rarefaction
                    is constantly going on as long as the water runs through the horizontal pipe.

                    perforated in the side of a vessel, and the curve which it will describe.</p>
                <p>Let AB be a vessel filled with water, and C an orifice in its side, so inclined
                    to the horizon as to discharge the fluid in the direction CP. If the issuing
                    fluid were influenced by no other force except that which impels it out of the
                    orifice, it would move with an uniform motion in the direction CP. But
                    immediately upon its exit from the orifice C, it is subject to the force of
                    gravity, and is therefore influenced by two forces, one of which impels it in
                    the direction CP, and the other draws it downwards in vertical lines. Make CE
                    equal to EG, and CP double of CS, the altitude of the fluid. Draw PL parallel to
                    CK, and join SL. Draw also EF, GH parallel to CN, and FM, HN parallel to CG, and
                    let CM, CN represent the force of gravity, or the spaces through which it would
                    cause· a portion of fluid to descend in the time that this portion would move
                    through CE, CG respectively, by virtue of the impulsive force. Now, it follows
                    from the composition of forces <hi rend="smallcaps">(Dynamics,</hi> 135), that
                    the fluid at C, being solicited in the direction CE by a force which would carry
                    it through CE in the same time that the force of gravity would make it fall
                    through CM, will describe the diagonal CF of the parallelogram CEFM, and will
                    arrive at F in the same time that it would have reached E by its impulsive
                    force, or Μ by the force of gravity; and for the same reason the portion of the
                    fluid will arrive at H in the same time that it would have reached G by the one
                    force, and N by the other. The fluid therefore being continually deflected from
                    its rectilineal direction CP by the force of gravity, will describe a curve line
                    CFHK, which will be a parabola; for since the motion along CP must be uniform,
                    CE, CG wall be to one another as the times in which they are described, and may
                    therefore represent the times in which the fluid would arrive at E and G, if
                    influenced by no other force. But in the time that the fluid has described CE
                    gravity has made it fall through EF, and in the time that it would have
                    described CG, gravity has caused it to fall through GH. Now, since the spaces
                    are as the squares of the times in which they are described <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the fluid would move through 2 CS or CP, in the same time that a heavy body

                    ratio, however, is by no means constant. It varies with the form and position of
                    the orifice, with the thickness of the plate in which the orifice is made, and
                    likewise with the form of the vessel and the weight of the superincumbent fluid.
                    But these variations are too trifling to be regarded in practice.—We shall now
                    lay before the reader an account of the results of the experiments of different
                    philosophers, but particularly those of the Abbé Bossut, to whom the science is

                    maintained, that when a lateral orifice is pierced in the side of a pipe, the
                    water will rise to a height due to the velocity of the included water.</p>

                    discharged by a lateral orifice may be easily found. Let W be the quantity of

                <p>212. Messrs Brindley and Smeaton found that 20 cubic feet of water were
                    discharged from orifices 1 inch square, in the following times, varying with the
                    height of the water.</p>

                <p>When the height of the water was 6 feet, and the orifice</p>
                <p>∣ an inch square, 20 cubic feet were discharged in 17 minutes 33 seconds. The
                    coefficient obtained from these experiments is 0.63.</p>
                <p>213. When the water stands always at the upper surface of a rectangular aperture,
                    without the upper edge, the aperture is called a <hi rend="italic">notch.</hi>

                <p>214. In the following experiments by the Abbé Bossut which were frequently
                    repeated in various ways, the orifice was pierced in a plate of copper about
                    half a line thick. When the orifice is in the bottom of the vessel, it is called
                    a <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> orifice; and when it is in the side of it,
                    it is called a <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> orifice.</p>
                <p>215. From the results contained in the preceding table, we may draw the following
                    conclusions.</p>
                <p>1. That the quantities of water discharged in equal times <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> by different apertures, the altitudes of the fluid being the . same, are
                    very nearly as the areas of the orifices. That is, if A or <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> represent the areas of the orifices, and W, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the
                    quantities of water discharged,</p>
                <p>W: <hi rend="italic">w = A</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The quantities discharged in equal times by the same aperture, the altitude of
                    the fluid being different, are to one another very nearly as the square roots of
                    the altitudes of the water in the reservoir, reckoning from the centres of the
                    orifices. That is, if H, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the different altitudes of
                    the fluid, we shall have W: <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = *∕H: <hi rend="italic"
                    >y∕h.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Hence we may conclude in general, that the quantities discharged in the same
                    time by different apertures, and under different altitudes in the reservoir, are
                    in the compound ratio of the areas of the orifices, and the square roots of the
                    altitudes. Thus, if W, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> be the quantities discharged in
                    the same time from the orifices A, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> under the same
                    altitude of water; and if W ’, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> be the quantities
                    discharged in the same time by the same aperture <hi rend="italic">a</hi> under
                    different altitudes, H, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>: then by the first of the two
                    preceding articles ,</p>
                <p>W: <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = A: <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and by the second <hi
                    rend="italic">w ∙.</hi> W=√H: <hi rend="smallcaps">λ∕</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >'h.</hi> Multiplying these analogies together, gives us</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="italic">w</hi>: W ’ w = A √H: α√A, and by dividing by <hi
                    rend="italic">u∙,</hi> W: W ’ = A√Hta√A,</p>
                <p>This rule is sufficiently correct in practice; but when great accuracy is
                    required, the following remarks must be attended to.</p>
                <p>4. Small orifices discharge less water in proportion than great ones, the
                    altitude of the fluid being the same. The circumferences of .the small orifices
                    being greater in proportion to the issuing column of fluid than the
                    circumferences of greater ones, the friction, which increases with the area of
                    the rubbing surfaces, will also be greater, and will therefore diminish the
                    velocity, and consequently the quantity discharged.</p>
                <p>5. Hence of several orifices whose areas are equal, that which has the smallest
                    circumference will discharge more water than the rest under the same altitude of
                    fluid in the reservoir, because in this case the friction will be least.
                    Circular orifices, therefore, are the most advantageous of all, for the
                    circumference of a circle is the shortest of all lines that can be employed to
                    inclose a given space.</p>
                <p>6. In consequence of a small increase which the contraction of the vein of fluid
                    undergoes, in proportion as the altitude of the water in the reservoir augments,
                    the quantity discharged ought also to diminish a little as that altitude
                    increases.</p>
                <p>By attending to the preceding observations, the results of theory may be so
                    corrected, that the quantities of water discharged in a given time may be
                    determined with the greatest accuracy possible.</p>
                <p>216. The Abbé Bossut has given the following table containing a comparison of the
                    theoretical with the real discharges, for an orifice one inch in diameter, and
                    for different altitudes of the fluid in the reservoir. The real discharges were
                    not found immediately by experiment, but were determined by the precautions
                    pointed out in the preceding articles, and may be regarded to be as accurate as
                    if direct experiments had been employed. The fourth column was computed by Μ.

                </table>
                <p>217. It is evident from the preceding table, that the theoretical, as well as the
                    real discharges, are nearly proportional to the square roots of the altitudes of
                    the fluid in the reservoir. Thus, if we take the altitudes 1 and 4, whose square
                    roots are as 1 to 2, the real discharges taken from the table are 2722, 5436,
                    which are to one another very nearly as 1 to 2, their real ratio being as 1 to
                    1.997∙</p>
                <p>The fourth column of the preceding table also shews us that the theoretical are
                    to the real discharges nearly in the ratio of 1 to 0.62, or more accurately, as
                    1 to 0.61938; therefore 0.62 is the number by which we must multiply the
                    discharges as found by the formulae in the preceding chapter, in order to have
                    the quantities of water actually discharged.</p>
                <p>218. In order to find the quantities of fluid discharged by orifices of different
                    sizes, and under different altitudes of water in the reservoir, we must use the
                    table in the following manner. Let it be required, for example, to find the
                    quantity of water furnished by an orifice three inches in diameter, the altitude
                    of the water in the reservoir being 30 feet. As the real discharges are in the
                    compound ratio of the area of the orifices, and the square roots of the
                    altitudes of the fluid (art. 215, No. 3), and as the theoretical quantity of
                    water discharged by an orifice one inch in diameter, is by the second column of
                    the table 16918 cubic inches in a minute, we shall have this analogy, 1 √ 15: 9
                    √30 = 16968: 215961 cubic inches, the quantity required. This quantity being
                    diminished in the ratio of 1 to .62, being the ratio of the theoretical to the
                    actual discharges, gives 133896 for the real quantity of water discharged by the
                    given orifice. But (by No. 5 of art. 215), the quantity discharged ought to be a
                    little greater than 133896, because greater orifices discharge more than small
                    ones; and by No. 6 the quantity ought to be less than 133896, because the
                    altitude of the fluid is double that in the table. These two causes therefore
                    having a tendency to increase and diminish the quantity deduced from the
                    preceding table, we may regard 133896 as very near the truth. Had the orifice
                    been less than one inch, or the altitude less than 15 feet, it would have been
                    necessary to diminish the preceding answer by a few cubic inches. Since the
                    velocities of the issuing fluid are as the quantities discharged, the preceding
                    results may be employed also to find the real velocities from those which are
                    deduced from theory.</p>
                <p>219. As the velocity of falling bodies is 16.087 feet per second, the velocity
                    due to 16.087 fθθt will be 32.174 feet per second, and as the velocities are as
                    the square roots of the height, we shall have √ 16.087: √H = 32.174 :V the
                    velocity due to any other height, conse-</p>

                <p>221. The difference between the actual discharges, and those deduced from theory,
                    arises from the contraction of the fluid vein, and from the friction of the
                    water against the circumference of the orifice. If the operation of any of these
                    causes could be prevented, the quantities of water actually discharged would
                    approach nearer the theoretical discharges. There is no probability of
                    diminishing friction in the present case by the application of unguents; but if
                    a short cylindrical tube be inserted in the orifice of the vessel, the water
                    will follow the sides of the tube, the contraction of the fluid vein will be in
                    a great measure prevented, and the actual discharges will approximate much
                    nearer to those deduced from theory, than when the fluid issues through a simple
                    orifice.</p>
                <p>222. If a cylindrical tube two inches long, and two inches in diameter, be
                    inserted in the reservoir, and if this orifice is stopped by a piston till the
                    reservoir is filled with water, the fluid, when permitted to escape, will not
                    follow the sides of the tube, that is, the tube will not be filled with water,
                    and the contraction in the vein of fluid will take place in the same manner as
                    if the orifice were pierced in a thin plate. When the cylindrical tube was one
                    inch in diameter, and two inches long, the water followed the sides of the tube,
                    and the vein of fluid ceased to contract. While Μ. Bossut was repeating this
                    experiment, he prevented the escape of the fluid by placing the instrument <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192938621" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8621-0063"/> MN (see fig.
                    69∙), consisting of a handle and a circular head, upon the interior extremity of
                    the tube, and found, <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> to his great surprise, that
                    when he withdrew the instrument MN, to give passage to the -water, it sometimes
                    followed the sides of the tube, and sometimes detached itself from them, and
                    produced a contraction in the fluid vein similar to that which took place when
                    the first tube was employed. After a little practice, he could produce either of
                    these effects at pleasure. The same phenomenon was exhibited when the length of
                    the tube was diminished to one inch six lines; only it was more difficult to
                    make the fluid follow the circumference of the tube. This effect was still more
                    difficult to produce when its length was reduced to one inch; and when it was so
                    small as half an inch, the water uniformly detached itself from its
                    circumference, and formed the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The experiments in the preceding table were made with tubes inserted in the
                    bottom of the vessel. When the tubes were fixed horizontally in the side of the
                    reservoir, they furnished the very same quantities of fluid, their dimensions
                    and the altitude of the fluid remaining the same.</p>
                <p>It appears from the preceding results, that the quantities of water discharged
                    increase with the length of the tube, and that these quantities are very nearly
                    as the square roots of the altitudes of the fluid above the interior orifice of
                    the vertical tube.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the theoretical are to the real discharges, as 1 to
                    0.62, or nearly as 16.1 to 10. But by comparing the two last experiments in the
                    preceding table, it appears that the quantity of fluid discharged by a
                    cylindrical tube where the water follows its sides, is to the quantity
                    discharged by the same tube when the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">contracta</hi> is formed, as 13 to 10; and since the same quantity
                    must be discharged by the latter method as by a simple orifice, we may conclude
                    that the quantity discharged according to theory, and that which is discharged
                    by a cylindrical tube and by a simple orifice, are to one another very nearly as
                    the numbers 16, 13, 10. Though the water therefore follows the sides of the
                    cylindrical tube, the contraction of the fluid vein is not wholly destroyed; for
                    the difference between the quantity discharged in this case, and that deduced
                    from theory, is too great to be ascribed to the increase of friction which
                    arises from the water following the circumference of the tube.</p>
                <p>224. In order to determine the effect of tubes of different diameters, under
                    different altitudes of water in the reservoir, Μ. Bossut instituted the
                    experiments, the results of which are exhibited in the following table.</p>

                <p>225. By comparing the different numbers in this table, we may conclude,</p>
                <p>1. That the quantities of water discharged by different cylindrical tubes of the
                    same length, the altitude of the fluid remaining the same, are nearly as the
                    areas of the orifices, or the squares of their diameters.</p>
                <p>2. That the quantities discharged by cylindrical tubes of the same diameter and
                    length, are nearly as the square roots of the altitude of the fluid in the
                    reservoir.</p>
                <p>3. Hence the quantities discharged during the same time, by tubes of different
                    diameters, under different altitudes of fluid in the reservoir, are nearly in
                    the compound ratio of the squares of the diameters of the tube, and the square
                    roots of the altitudes of the water in the reservoir.</p>
                <p>4. By comparing these results with those which were deduced from the experiments
                    with simple orifices, it will be seen that the discharges follow the same laws
                    in cylindrical tubes as in simple orifices.</p>

                <p>The above table is deduced from the foregoing experiments, and contains a
                    comparative view of the quantities of ' water discharged by a simple orifice,
                    according to theory, and those discharged by a cylindrical tube of the same
                    diameter under different altitudes of water. The numbers might have been more
                    accurate by attending to some of the preceding remarks; but they are
                    sufficiently exact for any practical purpose. The fourth column, containing the
                    ratio between the theoretical and actual discharges, was computed by Μ.
                    Prony.</p>
                <p>By comparing the preceding table with that in art. 216, we shall find that
                    cylindrical tubes discharge a much greater quantity of water than simple
                    orifices of the same diameter, and that the quantities discharged are as 81 to
                    62 nearly. This is a curious phenomenon, and will be afterwards explained.</p>
                <p>227. The application of this table to other additional tubes under different
                    altitudes of the fluid, not contained in the first column, is very simple. Let
                    it be required, for example, to find the quantity of water discharged by a
                    cylindrical tube, 4 inches in diameter, and 8 inches long, the altitude of the
                    fluid in the reservoir being 25 feet. In order to resolve this question, find
                    (by art. 218) the theoretical quantity discharged, which in the present instance
                    will be 350490 cubic inches, and this number diminished in the ratio of 1 to
                    0.81 will give 284773 for the quantity required. The length of the tube in this
                    example was made 8 inches, because, when the length of the tube is less than
                    twice its diameter, the water does not easily follow its interior circumference.
                    If the tube were longer than 8 inches, the quantity of fluid discharged would
                    have been greater, because it uniformly increases with the length of the tube;
                    the greatest length of the tube being always small, in comparison with the
                    altitude of the fluid in the reservoir.</p>
                <p>228. Hitherto we have supposed the tube to be exactly cylindrical. When its
                    interior surface, however, is conical, the quantities discharged undergo a
                    considerable variation, which may be estimated from the following experiments of
                    the Marquis Poleni, published in his work, <hi rend="italic">De Castellis per

                <p>From these experiments we are authorized to conclude, 1. That the real discharges
                    are less than those deduced from theory, which in the present case is 27425
                    cubic inches in a minute; and, 2. That when the interior orifice of the tube is
                    enlarged to a certain degree, the quantity discharged is increased; but that
                    when this enlargement is too great, a contraction takes place without the
                    exterior orifice, and the quantity discharged suffers a diminution. If the
                    smallest base of the conical tube be inserted in the side of the reservoir, it
                    will furnish more water than a cylindrical tube whose diameter is equal to the
                    smallest diameter of the conical tube; for the divergency of its sides changes
                    the oblique motion which the particles would otherwise have had, when passing
                    from the reservoir into the tube.</p>
                <p>229. The experiments of Poleni and Bossut having been made only with tubes of a
                    conical and cylindrical form, Μ. Venturi was induced to institute a set of
                    experiments, in which he employed tubes of the various forms exhibited in fig.
                    69∙ The results of his researches are contained in the following table,"for
                    which we have computed the column containing tħe number of cubic inches
                    discharged in one minute, in order that the experiments of the Italian
                    philosopher may be more easily compared with those which are exhibited in the
                    preceding tables. The constant altitude of the water in the reservoir was 32.5
                    French inches, or 34.642 English inches. The quantity of water which flowed out
                    of the vessel in the times contained in the first column was 4 French cubic
                    feet, or 4.845 English cubic feet. The measures in the table are all English,
                    unless the contrary be expressed.</p>

                <p>230. Theśe experiments of Venturi inform us of a curious fact, extremely useful
                    to the practical hydraulist. They incontestably prove, that when water is
                    conveyed through a straight cylindrical pipe of an unlimited length, the
                    discharge of water may be increased only by altering the form of the
                    terminations of the pipe; that is, by making the end of the pipe A, fig. 70, of
                    the same form as the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >contracta,</hi> and by forming the other extremity BC into a truncated cone,
                    having its length BC about nine times the diamete ’ ∙ of the cylindrical tube
                    AB, and the aperture at C to that at B, as 18 to 10. By giving this form to the
                    pipe, it will discharge more than twice as much water in a given time, the
                    quantity discharged by the cylindrical pipe being to the quantity discharged by
                    the pipe of the forriι ABC, as 10 to 24.</p>
                <p>231. Μ. Venturi also found, that the quantities of water discharged out of a
                    straight tube, a curved tube forming a quadrantal arc, and an elbowed tube with
                    an angle of 90°, each branch having a horizontal position, are to one another
                    nearly as the numbers 70, 50, 45. Hence we see the disadvantages of sinuosities
                    and bendings in conduit pipes. In the construction of hydraulic machines, any
                    variation in the internal diameter of the pipe ought to be carefully avoided,
                    excepting those alterations at the extremities which we have recommended in the
                    preceding paragraph.</p>
                <p>232. It appears from the researches of Eytelwein, that when the shortest tube
                    that will make the water follow its sides is applied to the reservoir, the
                    quantity discharged will be to that deduced from theory, as 0.810 to 1.000, and
                    the multiplier for finding the velocity will be 6.5. When the lengths of the
                    tubes are increased from <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> times their diameter, the ratio of the actual and theoretical
                    discharge will be 0.822 to 1.000, and the constant multiplier for finding the
                    velocity will be 6.6. In employing a conical tube approaching to the figure of
                    the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">contracta,</hi> the ratio of
                    the discharges was as 0.92 to 1.00, and when its edges were rounded off, as 0∙98
                    to 1.00 computing from its least section. He found also that the smallest
                    quantity of water was discharged, when the interior extremity of the tube
                    projected within the reservoir, the quantity furnished in this case being
                    reduced to one half of what was discharged when the tube had, its proper
                    position.</p>
                <p>233. When a cylindrical tube is applied to an orifice, the oblique motion of the
                    particles which enter it is diminished; the vertical velocity of the particles,
                    therefore, is increased, and consequently the quantity of water discharged. Μ.
                    Venturi maintains that the pressure of the atmosphere increases the expense of
                    water through a simple cylindrical tube, and that in conical tubes, the pressure
                    of the atmosphere increases the expenditure in the ratio of the exterior section
                    of the tube to the section of the contracted vein, whatever be the position of
                    the tube.</p>
                <p>234. Of all the tubes that can be employed for discharging water, that is the
                    most advantageous which has the form of a contracted vein. Hence, it will be a
                    truncated cone with its greatest base next the reservoir, having its length
                    equal to half the diameter of that base, and the area of the two orifices as 8
                    to 5, or their diameters in the subduplicate ratio of these numbers, viz. as √8:
                    √5.</p>

                <p>235. It is almost impossible to determine the exact time in which any vessel of
                    water is completely exhausted. When the surface of the fluid has descended
                    within a few inches of the orifice, a kind of conoidal funnel is formed
                    immediately above the orifice. The pressure of the superincumbent column being
                    therefore removed, the time of exhaustion is prolonged. The water falls in
                    drops; and it is next to impossible to determine the moment when the vessel is
                    empty. Instead, therefore, of endeavouring to ascertain the time in which
                    vessels are completely exhausted, the Abbé Bossut has determined the times in
                    which the superior surface of the fluid descends through a certain vertical
                    height, and his results will be found in the following table :—</p>

                <p>It appears from this table that the times of discharge, by experiment, differ
                    very little from those deduced from the corrected formula; and that the latter
                    always err in defect. This may arise from 0.62 being too great a multiplier for
                    finding the corrected diameter of the orifice. When the orifices are in the
                    sides of the reservoir, the altitude PG, PU of the surface may be reckoned from
                    the centre of gravity of the orifice, unless when it is very large.</p>

                    will appear, however, from the following experiments of Bossut, that jets do not
                    rise exactly to this height. This arises from the friction at the orifice, the
                    resistance of the air, and other causes which shall afterwards be explained.</p>

                    of the horizontal tube ought to be 28 lines and a half. By taking this as a
                    standard, therefore, the diameters of the horizontal tube may be easily found by
                    the preceding rule, whatever be the altitude of the reservoir and the diameter
                    of the adjutage.</p>
                <p>It results from the three last experiments, that the jets rise to the smaller
                    height when the adjutage is a cylindrical tube (see D, fig. 71∙), that a conical
                    adjutage throws the fluid very much higher, and that when the adjutage is a
                    simple orifice the jet rises highest of all.</p>
                <p>239. By comparing the preceding experiments with those of Mariotte, it appears,

                    small inclination of the jet, to a vertical line, makes it rise higher than when
                    it ascends exactly vertical;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was also observed by Wolfius, <hi rend="italic"

                    iv.</p></note> but even then it still falls short of the' height of the
                    reservoir. When the water first escapes from the adjutage, it generally springs
                    higher than the reservoir; but this effect is merely momentary, as the jet
                    instantly subsides, and continues at the altitudes exhibited in the foregoing
                    tables. The great size of the jet at its first formation, and its subsequent
                    diminution, have been ascribed by some philosophers to the elasticity of the air
                    which follows the water in its passage through the orifice; but it is obvious,
                    that this air, which moves along with the fluid,' can never give it an impulsive
                    force. In order to explain this phenomenon, let us suppose the adjutage to be
                    stopped; then the air which the water drags along with it, will lodge itself at
                    the extremity of the adjutage, so that there will be no water contiguous to the
                    body which covers the orifice. As soon as the cover is removed from the
                    adjutage, the imprisoned air escapes; the water immediately behind it rushes
                    into the space which it leaves, and thus acquires in the tube a certain velocity
                    which increases at the orifice in the ratio of the area of the section of the
                    tube to the area of the section of the orifice (art. 189, note). When the
                    orifice is small in comparison with the tube, the velocity of the issuing fluid
                    must be considerable, and will raise it higher than the reservoir. But as the
                    jet is resisted by the air, and retarded by the descending fluid, its altitude
                    diminishes, and the simple pressure of the fluid becomes the only permanent
                    source of its velocity. The preceding phenomenon was first noticed by
                    Toricellius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    ascribe the diminution in the altitude of the jet to the gravity of the
                    descending particles.</p>
                <p>241. The following table exhibits all that is necessary in the formation of jets.
                    The two first columns are taken from Mariotte,<note anchored="true"

                    shew the altitude of the reservoir requisite to producing a jet of a certain
                    height. The third column contains, in Paris pints, 36 of which are equal to a
                    cubie foot, the quantity of water discharged in a minute by an orifice six lines
                    in diameter. The fourth column, computed from the hypothesis in art. 238
                    contains the diameters of the horizontal tubes for an adjutage six lines in
                    diameter, relative to the altitudes in the second column. The thickness of the
                    horizontal tubes will be determined in a subsequent section.</p>

                <p>242. We have already seen that jets do not rise to the heights of their
                    reservoirs; and have remarked that the difference between theory and experiment
                    arises from the friction at the orifice, and the resistance of the air. The
                    diminution of velocity produced by friction is very small, and the resistance of
                    the air is a very inconsiderable source of retardation, unless when the jet
                    rises to a great altitude. We must seek, therefore, for another cause of
                    obstruction to the rising jet, which, when combined with these, may be adequate
                    to the effect produced. Wolfius<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Wotfii Opera Mathema(.</hi> tom. i. p.
                    802, schol. 4.</p></note> has very properly ascribed the diminution in the
                    altitude of the jet to the gravity of the falling water. When the velocity of
                    the foremost particles is completely spent, those immediately behind, by
                    impinging against them, lose their velocity, and, in consequence of this
                    constant struggle between the ascending and descending fluid, the jet continues
                    at an altitude less than that of the reservoir. Hence we may discover the reason
                    why an inclination of the jet increases its altitude; for the descending fluid
                    falling a little to one side does not encounter the rising particles, and
                    therefore permits them to reach a greater altitude than when their ascension is
                    in a vertical line. Wolfius observes, in proof of his remark that the diminution
                    is occasioned also by the weight of the <hi rend="italic">ascending</hi> fluid,
                    that mercury rises to a less height than water: but this cannot be owing to the
                    greater specific gravity of mercury; for though the weight of t∙he mercurial
                    particles is greater than that of water, yet the momentum with which they ascend
                    is proportionally greater, and therefore the resistance which opposes their
                    tendency downwards, has the same relation to their gravity, as the resistance in
                    the case of water has to the weight of the aqueous particles.</p>
                <p>243. The theory of oblique jets has already been discussed in Prop. IX. art. 200.
                    The two following experiments are given by Bossut. When the height NS of the
                    reservoir AB (fig· 72) was 9 feet, and the diameter of the adjutage at N, 6
                    lines, a vertical abscissa CN of 4 feet 3 inches and 7 lines, answered to a
                    horizontal ordinate CT of 11 feet 3 inches and 3 lines. When the altitude NS of
                    the reservoir was 4 feet, the adjutage remaining the same, a vertical abscissa
                    CN of 4 feet 3 inches and 7 lines, corresponded with a horizontal ordinate CT of
                    8 feet 2 inches and 8 lines. The real amplitudes, therefore, are less than those
                    deduced from theory; and both are very nearly as the square roots of the
                    altitudes of the reservoirs. Hence, to find the amplitude of a jet when the
                    height of the reservoir is 10 feet, and the vertical abscissa the same, we have
                    √9 feet: √16≈feet — 11 feet 3 inches 3 lines: 15 feet 4 lines, the amplitude of
                    the jet required. This rule, however, will apply only to small reservoirs; for
                    when the jets enlarge, the curve which they describe cannot be determined by
                    theory, and therefore the relation between the amplitudes and the heights of the
                    reservoirs must be uncertain.</p>
                <p>244. The following experiments on oblique jets were performed by MM. Michelotti
                    and Venturi. When the height of the adjutage above a horizontal plane was 19∙33
                    inches, the amplitude of projection, according to Michelotti, was 23.2 inches,
                    with a simple orifice, and 20 inches with an additional tube. Venturi found,
                    that when the height of the water in the reservoir was 32⅛ inches, and that of
                    the adjutage above a horizontal plane 54 inches, the amplitude of projection was
                    81 ⅜ inches with a simple orifice, and 69 inches with an additional tube.</p>

                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Water-Works.</hi> That the reader, however, may
                    be in possession of every thing valuable on a subject of such public importance,
                    we shall at present give a concise view of the experiments of Couplet, Bι*sut,
                    and Prony, and of the practical conclusions which they authorize us to form.</p>
                <p>246. It must be evident to every reader, that, when water is conducted from a
                    reservoir by means of a long horizontal pipe, the velocity with which the water
                    enters the pipe will be much greater than the velocity with which it issues from
                    its farther extremity; and that, if the pipe has. various flexures or bendings,
                    the velocity with which the water leaves the pipe will be still farther
                    diminished. The difference, therefore, between the initial velocity of the.
                    water, and the velocity with which it issues, will increase with the length of
                    the pipe and the number of its flexures, By means of the theory, corrected by
                    the preceding experiments, it is easy to determine with great accuracy the
                    initial velocity of the water, or that with which it enters the pipe; but on the
                    obstructions which the fluid experiences in its progress through the pipe, and
                    on the causes of these obstructions, theory throws but a feeble light. The
                    experiments of Bossut afford much instruction <pb break="no"

                </table>
                <p>247. The third column of the preceding table contains the quantity of water
                    discharged through an additional cylindrical tube 16 lines in diameter, or the
                    quantity discharged from the reservoir into a conduit pipe of the same diameter;
                    and the fourth column contains the quantity discharged by the conduit pipe. The
                    fifth column, therefore, which contains the ratio between these quantities, will
                    also contain the ratio between the velocity of the water at its entrance into
                    the conduit pipe, which we shall afterwards call its initial velocity, and its
                    velocity when it issues from the pipe, which shall be denominated its final
                    velocity; for the velocities are as the quantities discharged, when the orifices
                    are the same. The same may be said of the 6th, 7th, and 8th columns, with this
                    difference only, that they apply to a cylindrical tube and a conduit pipe 24
                    lines in diameter.</p>
                <p>248. By examining some of the experiments in the foregoing table, it will appear
                    that the water sometimes loses 8/10ths of its initial velocity. The velocity
                    thus lost is consumed by the friction of the water on the sides of the pipe, as
                    the quantities discharged, and consequently the velocities diminish when the
                    length of the pipe is increased. In simple orifices, the friction is in the
                    inverse ratio of their diameter; and it appears from the table, that the
                    velocity of the water is more retarded in the pipe 16 lines in diameter, than in
                    the other, which has a diameter of 24 lines. But though the velocity decreases
                    when the length of the tube is increased, it by no means decreases in a regular
                    arithmetical progression, as some authors have maintained. This is obvious from
                    the table, from which it appears, that the differences between the quantities
                    discharged, which represent also the differences between the velocities, always
                    <hi rend="italic">decrease,</hi> whereas the differences would have been <hi
                    rend="italic">equal,</hi> had the velocities decreased in an arithmetical
                    progression. The same truth is capable of a physical explanation. If every
                    filament of the fluid rubbed against the sides of the conduit pipe, then, since
                    in equal times they all experience the same degree of friction, the velocities
                    must diminish in the direct ratio of the lengths of the tubes, and will form a
                    regular arithmetical progression, of which the first term will be the final, and
                    the last the initial velocity of the water. But it is only the lateral filaments
                    that are exposed to friction. This retards their motion; and the adjacent
                    filaments which do not touch the pipe, by the adhesion to those which do touch
                    it, experience also a retardation, but ip a less degree, and go on with the
                    rest, each filament sustaining a diminution of velocity inversely proportional
                    to its distance from the sides of the pipe. The lateral filaments alone,
                    therefore, provided they always remain in contact with the sides of the pipe,
                    will have their velocities diminished in arithmetical progression, while the
                    velocities of the central filaments will not decrease in a much slower
                    progression; consequently, the mean velocity of the fluid, or that to which the
                    quantities discharged are proportional, will decrease <hi rend="italic"
                    >less</hi> rapidly than the terms of an arithmetical progression.</p>
                <p>249∙ When the altitude of the reservoir was two feet, the diminution of
                    discharge, and consequently of velocity, was greater than when the height of the
                    reservoir was only one foot. The cause of this is manifest. Friction increases
                    with the velocity, because a greater number of obstructions are encountered in a
                    certain time, and the velocities are as the square roots of the altitudes;
                    therefore friction must also be as the square roots of the altitudes of the
                    reservoir. On some occasions Coulomb found that the friction of solid bodies
                    diminished with an augmentation of velocity, but there is no ground for
                    supposing that this takes place in the case of fluids.</p>
                <p>250. When the pipe is inclined to the horizon, as CGF, the water will move with a
                    greater velocity than in the horizontal tube CG <hi rend="italic">hf</hi> In the
                    former case, the relative gravity of the water, which is to its absolute gravity
                    as F∕ to C <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> or as the height of the inclined plane to
                    its length, accelerates its motion along the tube. But this acceleration takes
                    place only when the inclination is considerable; for if the angle which the
                    direction of the pipe forms with the horizon were no more than one degree, the
                    retardation of friction would completely counterbalance the accel-leration<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192938712" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8712-0070"/> of gravity. Thus
                    when the pipe CF, 16 lines in diameter, was 177 feet, and was divided into three
                    equal parts in the points D and E, so that CD was 59 feet, CE 118 feet; and when
                    CF was to F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as 2124 to 241, the quantity of water
                    discharged at F was 5795 cubic inches in a minute, the quantity discharged at E
                    was 5801 cubic inches in a minute, and the quantity at D 5808 cubic inches. The
                    quantities discharged therefore, and consequently the velocities, decreased from
                    C to F; whereas if there had been no friction, and no adhesion between the
                    aqueous, particles, the velocities would have increased along the line CF in the
                    subduplicate ratio of the altitudes CB, D <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> E <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> and F <hi rend="italic">o</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> AB
                    being the surface of the water in the reservoir. The preceding numbers,
                    representing the quantities discharged at FE and D, decrease very slowly;
                    consequently, by increasing the relative gravity of the water, that is, by
                    inclining the tube more to the horizon, the effects of friction may be exactly
                    counterbalanced. This happens when the angle/ CF is about 6° 31', or when F∕ is
                    the eighth or ninth part of CF. The quantities dis-’ charged at CDE and F will
                    be then equal, and friction will have consumed the velocity arising from the
                    relative gravity of the included water.</p>
                <p>251. In order to determine the effects produced by flexures or sinuosities in
                    conduit pipes, Μ. Bossut made the following experiments.</p>

                <p>252. 1. The two first experiments of the preceding table shew, that the
                    quantities of water discharged diminish as the altitude of the reservoir. This
                    arises from an increase of velocity, which produces an increase of friction.</p>
                <p>2. The four first experiments shew, that a curvilineal pipe, in which the
                    flexures lie horizontally, discharges less water than a rectilineal pipe of the
                    same length. The friction being the same in both cases, this difference must
                    arise from the impulse of the fluid against the angles of the tube; for if the
                    tube formed an accurate curve, it is demonstrable that the curvature would not
                    diminish the velocity of the water.</p>
                <p>3. By comparing the 1st and 5th, and the 2d and 6th, experiments, it appears
                    that, when the flexures are vertical, the quantity discharged is diminished.
                    This also arises from the imperfection of curvature.</p>
                <p>4. It appears, from a comparison of the 3d and 5th, with the 4th and 6th
                    experiments, that when the flexures are vertical, the quantity discharged is
                    less than when they are horizontal. In the former case, the motion of the fluid
                    arises from the central impulsion of the water, retarded by its gravity in the
                    ascending parts of the pipe, and accelerated in the descending parts; whereas
                    the motion, in the latter case, arises wholly from the central impulsion of the
                    fluid. To these points of difference the diminution of velocity may somehow or
                    other be owing.</p>
                <p>When a large pipe has a number of contrary flexures, the air sometimes mixes with
                    the water, and occupies the highest parts of each flexure, as at B and C, fig.
                    75. By this means the velocity of the fluid is greatly retarded, and the
                    quantities discharged much diminished. This ought to be prevented by placing
                    small tubes at B and C, having a small valve at their top.</p>
                <p>253. A set of valuable experiments, on a large scale, were made by Μ. Couplet
                    upon the motion of water in conduit pipes, and a detailed account of them is
                    given in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1732, in his paper entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Des Recherches sur le Mouvement des Eaux dans les Tuyaux de
                    conduite.</hi> These experiments ate combined with those of the Abbé Bossut in
                    the following table, which gives a distinct view of all that they have done on
                    this subject, and will be of great use to the practical engineer.</p>

                <p>254. In order to shew the application of the preceding results, let us suppose
                    that a spring, or a number of springs combined, furnishes 40,000 cubic inches of
                    water in one minute; and that it is required to conduct it to a given place 4
                    feet below the level of the spring, and so situated that the length of the pipe
                    must be 2400 feet. It appears from Table VI. art. 226, that the quantity of
                    water furnished in a minute by a short cylindrical tube, when the altitude of
                    the fluid in the reservoir is 4 feet, is 7070 cubic inches; and since the
                    quantities furnished by two cylindrical pipes under the same altitude of water
                    are as the squares of their diameters, we shall have by the following analogy
                    the diameter of the tube necessary for discharging 40,000 cubic inches in a
                    minute; √ 70720: √ 40000 = 12 lines or 1 inch: 28.∣ lines, the diameter
                    required. But by comparing some of the experiments in the preceding table, it
                    appears that, when the length of the pipe is nearly 2400 feet, it will admit
                    only about one-eighth of the water, that is, about 5000 cubic inches. That the
                    pipe, however, may transmit the whole 40,000 cubic inches, its diameter must be
                    increased. The following analogy, therefore, will furnish us with this new
                    diameter; √ 5000: √ 40000 = 28.54 lines: 80.73 lines, or 6 inches 8 <hi

                    1779; and they are highly interesting, as they were made on the water discharged
                    from the public and private fountains of that city.</p>

                    >256.</hi> The pressure exerted upon the sides of conduit pipes by the included
                    water has been already investigated theoretically in Prop. X. Part II. The only
                    way of ascertaining by experiment the magnitude of this lateral pressure is to
                    make an orifice in the side of the pipe, and find the quantity of water which it
                    discharges in a given time. This lateral pressure is the force which impels the
                    ⅛ater through the orifice; and therefore the quantity discharged, or the effect
                    produced, must be always proportional to that pressure as its producing cause,
                    and may be employed to represent it. The following table, founded on the
                    experiments of Bossut, contains the quantities of water discharged from a
                    lateral orifice about 3į lines in diameter, according to theory and
                    experiment.</p>

                <p>It appears from the preceding table, that the real lateral pressure in conduit
                    pipes differs very little from that which is computed from the fonŉula; but in
                    order that this accordance may take place, the orifice must be so perforated,
                    that its circumference is exactly perpendicular to the direction of the water,
                    otherwise a portion of the water dis <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938751"

                    included fluid.</p>
                <p>257. As pipes are exposed to forces besides those arising from the included
                    water, they must be made much stronger than the preceding experiments would seem
                    to require. The thicknesses of iron and leaden pipes usedin France ih the time

                <p>258. Among the numerous experiments which have been made on this important
                    subject, those of the Abbé Bossut seem entitled to the greatest confidence. His
                    experiments were made on a rectangular canal 105 feet long, 5 inches broad at
                    the bottom, and from 8 to 9 inches deep. The orifice which transmitted the water
                    from the reservoir into the canal was rectangular, having its horizontal base
                    constantly five inches, and its vertical height sometimes half an inch, and at
                    other times an inch. The sides of this orifice were made of copper, and rising
                    perpendicularly from the side of the reservoir, they formed two vertical planes
                    parallel to each other. This projecting orifice was fitted into the canal, which
                    was divided into 5 equal parts of 21 feet each, and also into 3 equal parts of
                    35, and the time was noted which the water employed in reaching these points of
                    division. The arrival of the water at these points was indicated by the motion
                    of a very small water whee placed at each, and impelled by the stream. When the
                    canal was horizontal, the following results were obtained.</p>

                <p>259∙ It appears from column 1st, that the times successively employed to run
                    through spaces of 21 feet each, are as the numbers 2, 3—, 5, 6, 7+, which form
                    nearly an arithmetical progression, whose terms differ nearly by 1, so that by
                    continuing the progression we may determine very nearly the time in which the
                    fluid would run through any number of feet not contained in the 7th column. The
                    same may be done with the other columns of the table.</p>
                <p>If we compute theoretically the time which the water should employ in running
                    through the whole length of the canal, or 105 feet, we shall find, that under
                    the circumstances for each column of the preceding table the times, reckoning
                    from the first column, are 6 <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>.350,7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> ∙834,11 <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>.330, 6".350,
                    7"∙834, 11 <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>.330. It appears, therefore, by
                    comparing these times with those found by experiment, that the velocity of the
                    stream is very much retarded by friction, and that this retardation is less as
                    the breadth of the orifice is increased; for since a greater quantity of water
                    issues in this case from the reservoir, it has more power to overcome the
                    obstacles which obstruct its progress. The signs + and — affixed to the numbers
                    in the preceding table, indicate that these numbers are a little too great or
                    too small.</p>
                <p>260. The following experiments were made on inclined canals with different
                    declivities, and will be of great use to the engineer. The inclination of the
                    canal is the vertical distance of one of its extremities from a horizontal line
                    which passes through its other extremity.</p>

                <p>261. In the preceding experiments, the velocity of the first portion of water
                    that issues from the reservoir was only observed; but when the current is once
                    established, and its velocity permanent, it moves with greater rapidity, and
                    there is always a fixed proportion between the velocity of the first portion of
                    water and the permanent velocity of the established current. The cause of this
                    difference Bossut does not seem to have thoroughly comprehended, when he
                    ascribes it to a diminution of friction when the velocity becomes permanent. The
                    velocity of the first portion of water that issues from the reservoir was
                    measured by its arrival at certain divisions of the canal, consequently the
                    velocity thus determined was the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> velocity of the
                    water. The velocity of the established current, on the contrary, was measured by
                    light bodies floating upon its surface, at the centre of the canal, therefore
                    the velocity thus determined was the <hi rend="italic">superficial</hi> velocity
                    of the stream. But the velocity of the superficial central filaments must be
                    greatest of all, because, being at the greatest distance from the sides and
                    bottom of the canal, they are less affected by friction than any of the adjacent
                    or inferior filaments, and are not retarded by the weight of any superincumbent
                    fluid. The <hi rend="italic">superficial</hi> velocity of the current must, of
                    consequence, be greater than its <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> velocity, or, in
                    other words, the velocity of the established current must exceed the velocity of
                    the first portion of water. The following table contains the experiments of
                    Bossut on this subject, the canal being of the same size as in the former
                    experiments, but 600 feet long, and its inclination one-tenth of the whole, or
                    59.702 feet.</p>

                <p>262. In all the experiments related in this chapter, and in those of the
                    Chevalier Buat, which are given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Water·</hi><hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> the temperature of the water employed
                    has never been taken into consideration. That the fluidity of water is increased
                    by heat can scarcely admit of a doubt. Professor Leslie, in his ingenious paper
                    on Capillary Action, has proved by experiment that a jet of warm water will
                    spring much higher than a jet of cold water, and that a syphon which discharges
                    cold water only by drops, will discharge water of a high temperature in a
                    continued stream. A similar fact was observed by the ancients. Plutarch<note

                    the clepsydrae or water clocks went slower in winter than in summer, and he
                    seems to attribute this retardation to a diminution of fluidity. It is therefore
                    obvious, that warm water will issue from an aperture with greater velocity than
                    cold water, and that the quantities of fluid discharged from the same orifice,
                    and under the same pressure, will increase with the temperature of the fluid.
                    Hence we may discover the cause of the great discrepancy between the experiments
                    of different philosophers on the motion of fluids. Their experiments were
                    performed in different climates and at different seasons of the year; and, as
                    the temperature of the water would be variable from these and from other causes,
                    a variation in their results was the inevitable consequence.</p>

                    this interesting subject. Μ. de Buat employed in his experiments tubes of a

                <p>Hence our author concludes that the velocity of water diminishes as its

                <p>264. The general result of Μ. Girard’s experiments has been already given in the
                    History of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrodynamics.</hi> His experiments were made
                    with copper tubes of exactly the same internal diameter, and drawn upon steel
                    maundrils; and he employed two sets of these tubes of different diameters. The
                    first set consisted of tubes, whose length was <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    decimeters, and diameter 2.96 millimetres, and they screwed into each other so
                    as to form tubes of various lengths, from 20 to 222 centimetres. The second set
                    consisted of smaller tubes, whose diameter was 1.83 millimetres. These tubes
                    were then fixed horizontally in the sides of a reservoir, which was a cylinder
                    of white iron 25 centimetres in diameter, and 5 decimetres high. The reservoir
                    was kept full by the usual contrivances; and the water discharged by the tube
                    subjected to trial, was received into a copper vessel horizontally, whose
                    capacity had been accurately ascertained. The filling of the vessel was
                    indicated by the instant when the water which it contained had wetted equally a
                    plate of glass which covered almost the whole of its surface, and the time
                    employed to fill this vessel was measured with great accuracy. The temperature
                    of the water was also carefully noted. The results thus obtained amounted to
                    1200, and were arranged by Μ. Girard into thirty-four tables, according to the
                    different circumstances of the experiment. When the capillary tube has such a
                    length, that the term proportional to the square of the velocity disappears in
                    the general formula, the velocity with which the fluid is discharged, is
                    affected in a very singular manner by a variation of temperature. If the
                    velocity is expressed by 10, when the temperature is 0° of the centigrade
                    thermometer, the velocity will be so great as 42; or increased more than four
                    times when the temperature amounts to 85° centigrade. When the length of the
                    capillary tube is below the above mentioned limit, a variation of temperature
                    exercises but a slight influence upon the velocity of the issuing fluid. If the
                    length of the adjutage, for example, is 55 millimetres, and if the velocity is
                    represented by 10 at 5° of the centigrade thermometer, it will be represented
                    only by 12 at a temperature of 87°. In conduit pipes of the ordinary diameter, a
                    change of temperature produces almost no perceptible change in the velocity of
                    efflux. Μ. Girard also found, that the quantity of water discharged by capillary
                    tubes, varied not only with the fluids which were used, but with the nature of
                    the solid substance of which the tubes were composed.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER III.—ON THE RESISTANCE OF FLUIDS.</p>
                <p>265. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Fluids,</hi> the reader will find that important subject treated at great
                    length. The researches of preceding philosophers are there given in full detail;
                    their different theories are compared with experiments, and the defects of these
                    minutely considered. Since that article was composed, this intricate subject has
                    been investigated by other writers, and though they have not enriched the
                    science of hydraulics with a legitimate theory of the resistance of fluids, the
                    results of their labours cannot fail to be interesting to every philosopher.;
                    266. The celebrated Coulomb has very successfully employed the principle of
                    torsion, to determine the cohesion of fluids, and the laws of their resistance
                    in very slow motions. His experiments are new, and were performed with the
                    greatest accuracy; and the results which he obtained were perfectly conformable
                    to the deductions of theory. We shall therefore endeavour 1o give the reader
                    some idea of the discoveries which he has made.</p>
                <p>267∙ When a body is struck by a fluid with a velocity exceeding eight or nine
                    inches per second, the resistance has been found proportional to the square of
                    the velocity, whether the body in motion strikes the fluid at rest, or the body
                    is struck by the moving fluid. But when the velocity is so slow as not to exceed
                    four-tenths of an inch in a second, the resistance is represented by two terms,
                    one of which is proportional to the simple velocity, and the other to the square
                    of the velocity. The first of these sources of resistance arises from the
                    cohesion of the fluid particles which separate from one another, the number of
                    particles thus separated being proportional to the velocity of the body. The
                    other cause of resistance is the inertia of the particles, which, when struck by
                    the fluid, acquire a certain degree of velocity proportional to the velocity of
                    the body; and as the number of these particles is also proportional to that
                    velocity, the resistance generated by their inertia must be proportional to the
                    square of the velocity.</p>
                <p>268. When Sir Isaac Newton<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> lib. ii. prop. xl.</p></note> was
                    determining the resistance which the air opposed to the oscillatory motion of a
                    globe in small oscillations, he employed a formula of three terms, one of them
                    varying as the quare of the velocity, the second as the f power of the velocity,
                    and the third as the simple velocity; and in another part of the work he reduces
                    the formula to two terms, one of which is as the square of the velocity, and the
                    other constant. D. Bernoulli<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Elements of Natural Philosophy,</hi> art
                    1911.</p></note> also supposes the resistance to be represented by two terms,
                    one as the square of the velocity, and the other constant. Μ. Gravesende<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Comment.
                    Pretropol.</hi> tom. iìí and V.</p></note> has found that the pressure of a
                    fluid in motion against a body at rest, is partly proportional to the simple
                    velocity, and partly to the square of the velocity. But when the body moves in a
                    fluid at rest, he found<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> art 1975.</p></note> the resistance proportional
                    to the square of the velocity, and to a constant quantity. When the <hi
                    rend="italic">body in motion, therefore, meets the βuid at rest,</hi> these
                    three philosophers have agreed, that the formula which represents the resistance
                    of fluids consists of two terms, one of which is as the square of the velocity,
                    and the other constant. The experiments of Coulomb, however, incontestably
                    prove, that the pressure which the moving body in this case sustains, is
                    represented by two terms, one proportional to the simple velocity, and the other
                    to its square, and that if there is a constant quantity, it is so very small as
                    to escape detection.</p>
                <p>269∙ In order to apply the principle of torsion to the resistance of fluids, Μ.
                    Coulomb made use of the apparatus represented in fig. 76. On the horizontal arm

                    rend="italic">fe,</hi> perforated in the centre, so as to admit the cylindrical
                    pin <hi rend="italic">ba.</hi> Into <hi rend="italic">a</hi> slit in the
                    extremity of this pin is fastened, by means of a screw, the brass wire <hi
                    rend="italic">ag,</hi> whose force of torsion is to be compared with the
                    resistance of the fluid; and its lower extremity is fixed in the same way into a
                    cylinder of copper <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> whose diameter is about four
                    tenths of an inch. The cylinder <hi rend="italic">gd</hi> is perpendicular to
                    the disc DS, whose circumference is divided into 480 equal <pb break="no"

                    disc is at rest, which happens when the torsion of the brass wire is nothing,
                    the fixed index</p>
                <p>RS is placed upon the point 0, the zero of the circular scale. The small rule R∞
                    may be elevated or depressed at pleasure round its axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> and the stand GH which supports it may be brought into any position
                    round the horizontal disc. The lower extremity of the cylinder <hi rend="italic"
                    >gd</hi> is immersed about two inches in the vessel of water MNOP, and to the
                    extremity <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is attached the planes, or the bodies whose
                    resistance is to be determined when they oscillate in the fluid by the torsion
                    <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> brass wire. In order to produce these
                    oscillations, the disc DS, supported by both hands, must be turned gently round
                    to a certain distance from the index, without deranging the vertical position of
                    the suspended wire. The disc is then left to itself; the force of torsion causes
                    it to oscillate, and the successive diminutions of these oscillations arc
                    carefully observed. A simple formula gives in weights the force of torsion that
                    produces the oscillations; and another formula well known to geometers,
                    determines (by an approximation sufficiently accurate in practice), by means of
                    the successive diminution of the oscillations compared with their amplitude,
                    what is the law of the resistance, relative to the velocity, which produces
                    these diminutions.</p>
                <p>270. The method employed by Coulomb, in reducing his experiments, is similar to
                    that adopted by Newton and other mathematicians, when they wished to determine
                    the resistance of fluids, from the successive diminutions of the oscillations of
                    a pendulum moving in a resisting medium; but is much better fitted for detecting
                    the small quantities which are to be estimated in such researches. When the
                    pendulum is employed, the specific gravity of the body, relative to that of the
                    fluid, must be determined; and the least error in this point leads to very
                    uncertain results. When the pendulum is in different points of the arc in which
                    it oscillates, the wire or pendulum rod is plunged more or less in the. fluid;
                    and the alterations which may result from this are frequently more considerable
                    than the small quantities which are the object of research. It is only in small
                    oscillations, too, that the force which brings the pendulum from the vertical,
                    is proportional to the angle which the pendulum rod, in different positions,
                    forms with this vertical line; a condition which is necessary before the
                    formulae can be applied. But small oscillations are attended with great
                    disadvantages; and their successive diminutions cannot be determined but by
                    quantities which it is difficult to estimate exactly, and which are changed by
                    the smallest motion either of the fluid in the vessel, or of the air in the
                    chamber. In small velocities, the pendulum rod experiences a greater resistance
                    at the point of floatation than at any other part. This resistance, too, is very
                    changeable; for the water rises from its level along the pendulum rod to greater
                    or less heights, according to the velocity of the pendulum.</p>
                <p>271∙ These and other inconveniences which might be mentioned, are so inseparable
                    from the use of the pendulum, that Newton and Bernoulli have not been able to
                    determine the laws of the resistance of fluids in very slow motions. When the
                    resistance of fluids is compared with the force of torsion, these disadvantages
                    do not exist. The body is in this case entirely immersed in the fluid; and as
                    every point of its surface oscillates in a horizontal plane, the relation
                    between the densities of the fluid and the oscillating body has no influence
                    whatever on the moving force. One or two circles of amplitude may be given to
                    the oscillations; and their duration may be increased at pleasure, either by
                    diminishing the diameter of the wire, or increasing its length; or, which may be
                    more convenient, by augmenting the momentum of the horizontal disc. Coulomb,
                    however, found that when each oscillation was so Jong as to continue about 100
                    seconds, the least motion of the fluid, or the tremor occasioned by the passing
                    of a carriage, produced a sensible alteration on the results. The oscillations
                    best fitted for experiments of this kind, continued from 20 to 30 seconds, and
                    the amplitude of those that gave the most regular results, was comprehended
                    between 480 degrees, the entire division of the disc, and 8 or 10 divisions
                    reckoned from the zero of the scale. From these observations, it will be readily
                    seen, that it is only in very slow motions that an oscillating body can be
                    employed for determining the resistance of fluids. In small oscillations, or in
                    quick circular motions, the fluid struck by the body is continually in motion;
                    and when the oscillating body returns to its former position, its velocity is
                    either increased or retarded by the motion communicated to the fluid, and not
                    extinguished.</p>
                <p>272. In the first set of experiments made by Coulomb, he attached to the lower
                    extremity of the cylinder <hi rend="italic">gd a</hi> circular plate of white
                    iron, about 195 millimetres in diameter, and made it move so slowly, that the
                    part of the resistance proportional to the square of the velocity wholly
                    disappeared· For if, in any particular case, the portion of the resistance
                    proportional to the simple velocity should be equal to the portion that is
                    proportional to the square of the velocity when the body has a velocity of
                    one-tenth of an inch per second, then, when the velocity is 100-tenths of an
                    inch per second, the part proportional to the square of the velocity will be a
                    hundred times greater than that proportional to the simple velocity; but if the
                    velocity is only the hundredth part of the tenth of an inch per second, then the
                    part proportional to the simple velocity will be 100 times greater than the part
                    proportional to the square of the velocity.</p>
                <p>273. When the oscillations of the white iron plate were so slow, that the part of
                    the resistance which varies with the second power of the velocity was greatly
                    inferior to the other part, he found, from a variety of experiments, that the
                    resistance which diminished the oscillations of the horizontal plate was
                    uniformly proportional to the simple velocity, and that the other part of the
                    resistance, which follows the ratio of the square of the velocity, produced no
                    sensible change upon the motion of the white iron disc. He also found, in
                    çonformity with theory, that the momenta of resistance in different circular
                    plates moving round their centre in a fluid, are as the fourth power of the
                    diameters of these circles; and that, when a circle of 195 millimetres (6.677
                    English inches) in diameter, moved round its centre in water, so that its
                    circumference had a velocity of 140 millimetres (5.512 English inches) per
                    second, the momentum of resistance which the fluid opposed to its circular
                    motion was equal to one-tenth of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938816"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8816-0078"/>gramme (1.544 English troy grains) placed at the
                    end of a lever 143 millimetres (5.63 English inches) in length.</p>
                <p>274. Μ. Coulomb repeated the same experiments in a vessel of clarified oil, at
                    the temperature of 16 degrees of Reaumur. He found, as before, that the momenta
                    of the resistance of different circular discs, moving round their centre in the
                    plane of their superficies, were as the fourth power of their diameters; and
                    that the difficulty with which the same horizontal plate, moving with the same
                    velocity, separated the particles of oil, was to the difficulty with which it
                    separated the particles of water, as 17.5 to 1, which is therefore the ratio
                    that the mutual cohesion of the particles of oil has to the mutual cohesion of
                    the particles of water.</p>
                <p>275. In order to ascertain whether or not the resistance of a body moving in a
                    fluid was influenced by the nature of its surface, Μ. Coulomb anointed the
                    surface of the white iron plate with tallow, and wiped it partly away, so that
                    the thickness of the plate might not be sensibly increased. The plate was then
                    made to oscillate in water, and the oscillations were found to diminish in the
                    same manner as before the application of the unguent. Over the surface of the
                    tallow upon the plate, he afterwards scattered, by means of a sieve, a quantity
                    of coarse sand which adhered to the greasy surface; but when the plate, thus
                    prepared, was caused to oscillate, the augmentation of resistance was so small,
                    that it could scarcely be appreciated. We may therefore conclude, that the part
                    of the resistance which is proportional to the simple velocity, is owing to the
                    mutual adhesion of the particles of the fluid, and not to the adhesion of these
                    particles to the surface of the body.</p>
                <p>276. If the part of the resistance varying with the simple velocity were
                    increased when the white iron plate was immersed at greater depths in the water,
                    we might suppose it to be owing to the friction of the water on the horizontal
                    surface, which, like the friction of solid bodies, should be proportional to the
                    superincumbent pressure. In order to settle this point, Μ. Coulomb made the
                    white iron plate oscillate at the depth of two centimetres (.787 English
                    inches), and also at the depth of 50 centimetres (19∙6855 English inches), and
                    found no difference in the resistance; but as the surface of the water was
                    loaded with the whole weight of the atmosphere, and as an additional load of 50
                    centimetres of water could scarcely produce a perceptible augmentation of the
                    resistance, Μ. Coulomb employed another method of deciding the question. Having
                    placed a vessel full of water under the receiver of an air-pump, the receiver
                    being furnished with a rod and collar of leather at its top, he fixed to the
                    hook, at the end of the rod, a harpsichord wire, number 7 in commerce, and
                    suspended to it a cylinder of copper, like <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> fig. 76,
                    which plunged in the water of the vessel, and under this cylinder he fixed a
                    circular plane, whose diameter was 101 millimetres (3.976 English inches). When
                    the oscillations were finished, and consequently the force of torsion nothing,
                    the zero of torsion was marked by the aid of an index fixed to the cylinder. The
                    rod was then made to turn quickly round through a complete circle, which gave to
                    the wire a complete circle of torsion, and the successive diminutions of the
                    oscillations were carefully observed. The diminution for a complete circle of
                    torsion was found to be nearly a fourth part of the circle for the first
                    oscillation, but always the same whether the experiment was made in a vacuum or
                    in the atmosphere. A small pallet 50 millimetres long (1.969 English inches),
                    and 10 millimetres broad (0.3937 English inches), which struck the water
                    perpendicular to its plane, furnished a similar result. We may therefore
                    conclude, that when a submerged body moves in a fluid, the pressure which it
                    sustains, measured by the altitude of the superior fluid, does not perceptibly
                    increase the resistance; and consequently, that the part of this resistance
                    proportional to the simple velocity, can in no respect be compared with the
                    friction of solid bodies, which is always proportional to die pressure.</p>
                <p>277∙ The next object of Μ. Coulomb was to ascertain the resistance experienced by
                    cylinders that moved very slowly, and perpendicular to their axes; but as the
                    particles of fluid struck by the cylinder necessarily partook of its motion, it
                    was impossible to neglect the part of the resistance proportional to the square
                    of the velocity, and therefore he was obliged to perform the experiments in such
                    a manner that both parts of the resistance might be computed. The three
                    cylinders which he employed were 249 millimetres (.9803 English inches) long.
                    The first cylinder was 0.87 millimetres (0.0342 English inches or <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛ of an inch) in circumference, die second 11.2
                    millimetres (0.4409 English inches), and the third 21.1 millimetres (.88307
                    English inches). They were fixed by their middle under the cylindrical piece <hi
                    rend="italic">dg,</hi> so as to form two horizontal radii, whose length was
                    124.5 millimètres (.4901 English inches) or half the length of each cylinder.
                    After making the necessary experiments and computations, he found that the part
                    of the resistance proportional to the simple velocity, which, to avoid
                    circumlocution, we shall call <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> did not vary with the
                    circumferences of the cylinders. The circumferences of the first and third
                    cylinders were to one another as 24: 1, whereas the resistances were in the
                    ratio of 3: 1. The same conclusion was deduced by comparing the experiments made
                    with the first and second cylinder.</p>
                <p>278. In order to explain these results, Μ. Coulomb very justly supposes, that, in
                    consequence of the mutual adhesion of tĥe particles of water, the motion of the
                    cylinder is communicated to the particles at a small distance from it. The
                    particles which touch the cylinder have the same velocity as the cylinder, those
                    at a greater distance have a less velocity, and at the distance of about
                    one-tenth of an inch the velocity ceases entirely, so that it is only at that
                    distance from the cylinder that the mutual adhesion of the fluid molecules
                    ceases to influence the resistance. The resistance <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    therefore should not be proportional to the circumference of the real cylinder,
                    but to the circumference of a cylinder whose radius is greater than the real
                    cylinder by one-tenth of an inch. It consequently becomes a matter of importance
                    to determine with accuracy the quantity which must be added to the real cylinder
                    in order to have the radius of the cylinder to which the resistance <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> is proportional, and from which it must be computed.
                    Coulomb found the quantity by which the radius should be increased to be 1.5
                    millimetres (<hi rend="subscript"> T</hi> ĝ§ņ of an English inch), so that the
                    diameter of the augmented cylinder will exceed the diameter of the real cylinder
                    by double that quantity, or 1⅛⅛⅜ of an inch.</p>
                <p>279∙ The part of the resistance varying with the square of the velocity, or that
                    arising from the inertia of the fluid, which we shall call R, was likewise not
                    proportional to the circumferences of the cylinder; but the augmentation of the
                    radii amounts in this case only to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅞⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τf</hi> of an inch, which is only one-fifth of the
                    augmentation necessary for finding the resistance <hi rend="italic">τ.</hi> The
                    reason of this difference is obvious; all the particles of the fluid when they
                    are separated from each other oppose the same resistance, whatever be their
                    velocity; consequently as the value of <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> depends only on
                    the adhesion of the particles, the resistances due to this adhesion will reach
                    to the distance from the cylinder where the velocity of the particles is 0. In
                    comparing the different values of R, the part of the resistance which varies as
                    the square of the velocity, all the particles are supposed to have a velocity
                    equal to that of the cylinder; but as it is only the particles which touch the
                    cylinder that have this velocity, it follows that the augmentation of the
                    diameter necessary for finding R must be less than the augmentation necessary
                    for finding <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>

                    proportional to the velocity, by two cylinders of the same diameter, but of
                    different lengths, Μ. Coulomb found that this momentum was proportional to the
                    third power of their lengths. The same result may be deduced from theory; for
                    supposing each cylinder divided into any number of parts, the length of each
                    part will be proportional to the whole length. The velocity of the corresponding
                    parts will be as these lengths, and also as the distance of the same parts from
                    the centre of rotation. The theory likewise proves, that the momentum of
                    resistance depending on the square of the velocity, in two cylinders of the same
                    diameter but of different lengths, is proportional to the fourth power of the
                    length of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>281. When the cylinder 0.9803 inches in length, and 0.04409 inches in
                    circumference, was made to oscillate in the fluid with a velocity of 5.51 inches
                    per second, the part of the resistance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> was equal to 58
                    milligrammes, or .8932 troy grains. And when the velocity was 0.3937 inches per
                    second, the resistance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> was 0.00414 grammes, or 0.637
                    troy grains. ∙ ∙</p>
                <p>282. The preceding experiments were also made in the oil formerly mentioned; and
                    it likewise appeared, from their results, that the mutual adhesion of the
                    particles of oil was to the mutual adhesion of the particles of water as 17 to
                    1. But though this be the case, Μ. Coulomb discovered that the quantity by which
                    the radii of the cylinder must be augmented in order to have the resistance r,
                    is the very same as when the cylinder oscillated in water. This result was very
                    unexpected, as the greater adhesion between the particles of oil might have led
                    us to anticipate a much greater augmentation. When the cylinders oscillated both
                    in oil and water with the same velocity, the part of the resistance R produced
                    by the inertia of the fluid particles which the cylinder put in motion, was
                    almost the same in both. As this part of the resistance depends on the quantity
                    of particles put in motion, and not on their adhesion, the resistances due to
                    the inertia of the particles will be in different fluids as their densities.</p>
                <p>283. In a subsequent memoir, Coulomb proposes to determine numerically the part
                    of the resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, and to ascertain
                    the resistance of globes with plain, convex, and concave surfaces. He has found
                    in general that the resistance of bodies not entirely immersed in the fluid is
                    much greater than that of bodies which are wholly immersed; and he promises to
                    make further experiments upon this point. We intended on the present occasion to
                    have given the reader a more complete view of the researches of this ingenious
                    philosopher; but these could not well be understood without a knowledge of his
                    investigations respecting the force of torsion, which we have not yet had an
                    opportunity of communicating. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mechanics,</hi> however, we shall introduce the reader to this interesting
                    subject; and may afterwards have an opportunity of making him farther acquainted
                    with those researches of Coulomb, of which we have at present given only a
                    general view.</p>
                <p>284. The subject of the resistance of fluids has been recently treated by the
                    learned Dr Hutton of Woolwich. His experiments were made in air with bodies of
                    various forms, moving with different velocities, and inclined at various angles
                    to the direction of their motion. The following table contains the results of
                    many interesting experiments. The numbers in the ninth column represent the
                    exponents of the power of the velocity which the resistances in the 8th column
                    bear to each other.</p>

                <p>285. From the preceding experiments we may draw the allowing conclusions: 1. That
                    the resistance is nearly proportional to the surfaces, a small increase taking
                    place when the surfaces and the velocities are great. 2. The resistance to the
                    same surface moving with different velocities, is nearly as the square or the
                    velocity; but it appears from <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938842"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8842-0080"/>the 9th column that the exponent increases with
                    the velocity. 3. The round and sharp ends of solids sustain a greater resistance
                    than the flat ends of the same diameter. 4. The resistance to the base of the
                    hemisphere is to the resistance on the convex side, or the whole sphere, as 2⅜,
                    to 1, instead of 2 to 1, as given by theory. 5. The resistance on the base of
                    the cone is to the resistance on the vertex nearly as 2 <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> ¾ to 1; and in the same ratio is radius to the sine of half the angle at
                    the vertex. Hence in this case the resistance is directly as the sine of the
                    angle of incidence, the transverse section being the same. 6. The resistance of
                    the base of a hemisphere, the base of a cone, and the base of a cylinder, are
                    all different, though these bases be exactly equal and similar.</p>

                <p>287 ∙ It appears from a comparison of the 2d, 3d, and 4th columns, that when the
                    velocity is small, the resistance by experiment is nearly equal to that deduced
                    from theory: but that as the velocity increases, the former gradually exceeds
                    the latter till the velocity is 1300 feet per second, when it becomes twice as
                    great. The difference between the two resistances then increases, and reaches
                    its maximum between the velocities of 1600 and 1700 feet. It afterwards
                    decreases gradually as the velocity increases, and at the velocity of 2000 the
                    resistance by experiment is again double of the theoretical resistance. By
                    considering the numbers in column 5th, it will be seen, that in slow motions the
                    resistances are nearly as the square of the velocities; that this ratio
                    increases gradually, though not regularly, till at the velocity of 1500 or 1600
                    feet it arrives at its maximum. It then gradually diminishes as the velocity
                    increases.</p>
                <p>Conclusions similar to these were deduced from experi ments made with globes of a
                    larger size.</p>

                <p>289∙ The plane with which the preceding experiments were performed was 32 square
                    inches, and always moved with a velocity of 12 feet per second. The resistances
                    which this plane experienced are contained in column 2d. From the numbers in
                    that column Dr Hutton deduced the formula .84s <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∙
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 84 z</hi> c, where <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is the sine,
                    and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the cosine of the angles of inclination in the
                    first column. The resistances computed from this formula are contained in column
                    3d, and agree very nearly with the resistances deduced from experiment. The 4th
                    column contains the sines of the angles in the first column to a radius .84, in
                    order to compare them with the resistances which have obviously no relation
                    either to the sines of the angles or to any power of the sines. From the angle
                    of 0 to about 60° the resistances are less than the sines; but from 60° to 90°
                    they are somewhat greater.</p>
                <p>290. The experiments of Mr Vince were made with bodies at a considerable depth
                    below the surface of water; and he determined the resistance which they
                    experienced, both when they moved in the fluid at rest, and when they received

                <p>291. According to the theory the resistance should vary as the cube of the sine,
                    whereas from an angle of 90° it decreases in a less ratio, but not as any
                    constant power, nor as any function of the sine and cosine. Hence the actual
                    resistance always exceeds that which is deduced from theory, assuming the
                    perpendicular resistance to be the same. The cause of this difference is partly
                    owing to our theory neglecting that part of the force which after resolution
                    acts parallel to the plane, but which, according to experiments, is really a
                    part of the force which acts upon the plane.</p>
                <p>292. Mr Vinċe made also a number of experiments on the resistance of hemispheres,
                    globes, and cylinders, which moved with a velocity of 0.542 feet per second. He
                    found that the resistance to the spherical side of a hemisphere was to the
                    resistance on its base as 0.034 is to 0.08339; that the resistance of the flat
                    side of a hemisphere was to the resistance of a cylinder of the same diameter,
                    and moving with the same velocity, as 0.08339 is to 0.07998; and that the
                    resistance to a complete globe is to the resistance of a cylinder of the same
                    diameter, and with the same velocity, as 1: 2.23.</p>

                <p>294. It appears from the preceding results, that the resistance varies as the
                    sine of the angle at which the fluid strikes the plane, the difference between
                    theory and experiment being such as might be expected from the necessary
                    inaccuracy of the experiments.</p>
                <p>By comparing the preceding table with Table IV., it will be found that the
                    resistance of a plane moving in a fluid is to the resistance of the same plane
                    when struck by the fluid in motion as 5 to 6. In both these cases the actual
                    effect on the plane must be the same, and therefore, the difference in the
                    resistance can arise only from the action of the fluid behind the body in the
                    former case.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER IV. ON THE OSCILLATION OF FLUIDS, AND THE UNDULATION OF WAVES.</p>

                <p>295. The oscillations of water in a syphon, consisting of two vertical branches
                    and a horizontal one, are isochronous, and have the same duration as the
                    oscillations of a penduliim, whose length is equal to half the length of the
                    oscillating column of water.</p>
                <p>Into the tube MNOP, having its internal diameter every where the same, introduce
                    a quantity of water. When the water is in equilibrio, the two surfaces AB, CD
                    will be in the same horizontal line AD. If this equilibrium be disturbed by
                    making the syphon oscillate round the point 7/, the water will rise and fall
                    alternately in the vertical branches after the syphon is at rest. Suppose the
                    water to rise to EF in the branch MO, it will evidently fall to GH m the other
                    branch, so that CG is equal to AE. Then it is evident, that the force which
                    makes the water oscillate, is the weight õf the colurrſn EFKL, which is double
                    the column L’ABF; and that this force is to the whole weight of the water, as 2
                    AE is to AOPD. Now, let P be a pendulum, whose length is equal to half the
                    length of the oscillating column AOPD, and which describes to the lowest point S
                    arches PS, equal to AE; then 2 AE: AOPD = AE: QP, because AE is one-half of 2
                    AE, and QP one half of A O P D. Consequently, since AOPD is a constant quantity,
                    the force which makes the water oscillate is always proportional to the space
                    which it tuns through, and its oscillations are therefore isochronous. The force
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938868" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8868-0082"/>which makes
                    the pendulum describe the arch PS, is to the weight of the pendulum as PS-is to
                    PQ, or as AE is to PQ, since AE = PS; but the force which makes the water
                    oscillate, is to the weight of the whole water in the same ratio; consequently,
                    since the pendulum P, and the column AOPD, are influenced by the very same
                    force, their oscillations must be performed in the same time. Q,. E. D.</p>

                <p>298. The undulations of waves are performed in the same time as the oscillations
                    of a pendulum whose length is equal to the breadth of a wave, or to the distance
                    between two neighbouring cavities or eminences.</p>
                <p>In the waves ABCDEF, the undulations are performed in such a manner, that the
                    highest parts ACE become the lowest; and as the force which depresses the
                    eminences ACE is always the weight of water contained in these eminences, it is
                    obvious, that the undulations of waves are of the same kind as the undulations
                    or oscillations of water in a syphon. It follows, therefore, from Prop. I. that
                    if we take a pendulum, whose length is one-half BM, or half the distance between
                    the highest and lowest parts of the wave, the highest parts of each wave will
                    descend to the lowest parts during one oscillation of the pendulum, and in the
                    time of another oscillation will again become the highest parts. The pendulum,
                    therefore, will perform two oscillations in the time that each wave performs one
                    undulation, that is, in the time that each wave describes the space A C or BD,
                    between two neighbouring eminences or cavities, which is called <hi
                    rend="italic">the breadth of the wave.</hi> Now, if a pendulum, whose length is
                    one-half BM, performs two oscillations in the above time, it will require a
                    pendulum four times that length to perform only one oscillation in the same
                    time, that is, a pendulum whose length is AC or BD, since 4 χ ⅜ BM = 2 BM = AC
                    or BD. Q. E. D.</p>

                <p>299. The explanation of the oscillation of waves contained in the two preceding
                    propositions, was first given by Sir Isaac Newton, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> lib. ii. Prop. 44. He considered it only as an approximation to
                    the truth, since it supposes the waves to rise and fall perpendicularly like the
                    water in the vertical branches of the syphon, while their real motion is partly
                    circular. The theory of Newton was, nevertheless, adopted by succeeding
                    philosophers, and gave rise to many analogous discussions respecting the
                    undulation of waves. Very lately, however, an attempt has been made by Μ.
                    Flaugergues, to overturn the theory of Newton. From a number of experiments on
                    the motion and figure of waves, an account of which may be seen in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal des Sçavans,</hi> for October 1789, Μ. Flaugergues
                    concludes, that a wave is not the result of a motion in the particles of water,
                    by which they ascend and descend alternately in a serpentine line, when moving
                    from the place where the water received the shock; but that it is an
                    intumescence which this shock occasions around the place where it is received,
                    by the depression that is there produced. This intumescence afterwards
                    propagates itself circularly, while it removes from the place, where the shock
                    first raised it above the level of the stagnant water. A portion of the stagnant
                    water then flows from all sides into the hollow formed at the place where the
                    shock was received; this hollow is thus heaped with fluid, and the water is
                    elevated so as to produce all around another intumescence, or a new wave, which
                    propagates itself circularly as before. The repetition of this effect produces
                    on the surface of the water a number of concentric rings, successively elevated
                    and’depressed, which have the appearance of an undulatory motion. This
                    interesting subject has also been discussed by Μ. La Grange, in his <hi

                <p>300. To describe the various machines in which water is the impelling power,
                    would be an endless and unprofitable task. Those machines which can be driven by
                    wind, steam, and the force of men or horses, as well as they can be driven by
                    water, do not properly belong to the science of hydraulics. By hydraulic
                    machinery, therefore, we are to understand those various contrivances by which
                    water can be employed as the impelling power of machinery; and those machines
                    which are employed to raise water, or which could not operate without the
                    assistance of that fluid.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER I. ON WATER-WHEELS.</p>
                <p>301. <hi rend="smallcaps">Water-wheels</hi> are divided into three kinds,
                    Overshot-wheels, Breast-wheels, and Undershot-wheels, which derive their names
                    from the manner in which the water is delivered upon their circumferences.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">On Overshot-Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p>302. An overshot-wheel is a wheel driven by the weight of water, conveyed into
                    buckets disposed on its circumfe <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938881"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8881-0083"/>rence. It is represented m fig. 80, where ABC is
                    the circumference of the wheel furnished with a number of buckets. The canal MN
                    conveys the water into the second bucket from the top A«. The equilibrium of the
                    wheel is therefore destroyed; and the power of the bucket A«, to turn the wheel
                    round its centre of motion 0, is the same as if the weight of the water in the
                    bucket were suspended at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the extremity of the lever O
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> being the centre of gravity of
                    the bucket, and O <hi rend="italic">m</hi> a perpendicular let fall from the
                    fulcrum 0 to the direction <hi rend="italic">cm,</hi> in which the force is
                    exerted. In consequence of this destruction of equilibrium, the wheel will move
                    round in the direction AB, the bucket Aα will be at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    and the empty bucket <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will take the place of A <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and receive water from the spout N. The force acting on
                    the wheel is now the water in the bucket <hi rend="italic">d</hi> acting with a
                    lever <hi rend="smallcaps">mO,</hi> and the water in the bucket A« acting with a
                    lever røO. The velocity of the wheel will therefore increase with the number of
                    loaded buckets, and with their distance from the vertex of the wheel; for the
                    lever by which they tend to turn the wheel about its axis, increases as the
                    buckets approach to <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> where their power, represented by
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> 0, is a maximum. After the buckets have passed <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> the lever by which they act gradually diminishes, they
                    lose by degrees a small portion of their water; and as soon as they reach B it
                    is completely discharged. When the wheel begins to move, its velocity will
                    increase rapidly till the quadrant of buckets <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> is completely filled. While these buckets are descending
                    through the inferior quadrant <hi rend="italic">e</hi> P, and the buckets on the
                    left hand of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are receiving water from the spout, the
                    velocity of the wheel will still increase; but the increments of velocity will
                    be smaller and smaller, since the levers by which the inferior buckets act are
                    gradually diminishing. As soon as the highest bucket A <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    has reached the point B, where it is emptied, the whole semicircumference nearly
                    of the wheel is loaded with water; and when the bucket at B is discharging its
                    contents, the bucket at A is filling, so that the load in the buckets, by which
                    the wheel is impelled, will be always the same, and the velocity of the wheel
                    will become uniform.</p>
                <p>303. In order to find the power of the loaded arch to turn the wheel, or, which
                    is the same thing, to find a weight .which, suspended at the opposite extremity
                    C, will balance the loaded arch or keep it in equilibrio, we must multiply .the
                    weight of water in each bucket by the length of the virtual lever by which it
                    acts, and take the sum of all these momenta for the momentum of the loaded arch.
                    It will be much easier, however, and the result will be the same, if we multiply
                    the weight of all the water on the arch AB, by the distance of its centre of
                    gravity G, from the fulcrum or centre of motion 0. Now, by the property of the
                    centre of gravity (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics),</hi> the distance of the
                    centre of gravity of a circular arch from its centre, is a fourth proportional
                    to half the arch, the radius, and the sine of half the arch. Since the vertical
                    bucket <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has no power to turn the wheel if it were
                    filled, and since two or three buckets between B and P are always empty, we may
                    safely suppose that the loaded arch never exceeds 160°, so that if R = radius of
                    the wheel in feet, we shall have the length of half the loaded arch, or 80° = 2
                    R × 3.1416 × <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅞% = R × 1.396; and the distance of

                <p>fore, in the loaded arch, will be ——— × 102 G, and consequentìy the momentum of

                <p>4 N</p>
                <p>= -θ-X 6.465 G pounds avoirdupois. Hence, we have the following rule: Multiply
                    the constant number 6.465 by ∣ of the number of buckets in the wheel, and this
                    product by the number of ale gallons in each bucket; and the result will be the
                    effective weight, or momentum of the water in the loaded arch. For a description
                    of the best form that can be given to the buckets, see the article <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Water-</hi><hi rend="italic">Works.</hi> Dr Robison has
                    there recommended a mode of constructing the buckets invented by Mr Burns, who
                    divided each bucket into two by means of a partition; but the writer of this
                    article is assured, on the authority of an ingenious mill-wright, who wrought
                    with Mr Burns at the time when wheels of this kind were constructed, that the
                    inner bucket is never filled with water, and that much of the power is thus
                    lost. The partition prevents the introduction of the fluid, and the water is
                    driven backwards by the escape of the included air.</p>
                <p>304. In order to determine the best form of the buckets, we must consider that
                    the power of the wheel would be a maximum, if the whole of its
                    semi-circumference were loaded with water. This effect would be obtained if the
                    buckets had the shape shewn in fig. 81., where ABC is the form of the bucket, AB
                    being a continuation of the radius, and BC part of the circumference of the
                    wheel, and nearly equal to AD. But as a small aperture at CE will neither admit
                    nor discharge the water, the form shewn in fig. 82. has been proposed by Sir
                    David Brewster as the best. In this construction, BC is made a little larger
                    than BE, and AB is diminished so as to make the angle ABC a little greater than
                    90°. The angles AB should be rounded off, so as to make ABC a curve, as
                    indicated by the dotted line. The aperture at &lt;7E must be sufficient for the
                    introduction and. discharge of the water, and the side BE of the bucket should
                    be as smooth and even as possible.</p>
                <p>305. The construction of an overshot-wheel, and the mode of admitting the water
                    into the buckets from the mill-course MN, is shewn in the following figure. In
                    an overshot- <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938894" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8894-0084"/>.
                    wheel constructed by Mr Smeaton, the wheel is exactly the height of the fall,
                    and in another it exceeds that height, so as to be intermediate between an
                    overshot and a breast wheel.</p>
                <p>306. In the construction of overshot-wheels, it is of great importance, to
                    determine what should be the diameter of the wheel relatively to the height of
                    the fall. It is evident that, its diameter cannot exceed the height of the fall.
                    Some mechanical writers have demonstrated that, in theory, an overshot· wheel
                    will produce a maximum effect when its diameter is two-thirds of that height,
                    the water being supposed to fall into the buckets with the velocity of the
                    wheel. But this rule is palpably erroneous, and directly repugnant to the
                    results of experiment. For if the heighţ of the fall be 48 feet, the diameter of
                    the wheel will, according to this rule, be 32 feet; and the water having to fall
                    through 16 feet before it reaches the buckets, will have a velocity of 32 feet
                    per second, which, according to the hypothesis, must also be the velocity of the
                    wheel’s circumference. But Smeaton has proved, that a maximum effect is produced
                    by an overshot-wheel of any diameter, when its velocity is only <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> feet per second. The Çhevalieŗ de Borda has shewn, that
                    overshot-wheels will produce a maximum effect when their diameter is equal to
                    the heighţ of the fall; and this is completely confirmed by Mr Smeaton’s
                    experiments. From a great number of trials, Mi Smeaton has concluded, “that the
                    higher the wheel is in proportion to the whole descent, the greater will be the
                    effect.” Nor is it difficult to assign the reason of this. The water which is
                    conveyed into the buckets can produce very little effect by its impulse, even if
                    its velocity be great; both on account of the obliquity with which it strikes
                    the buckets, and in consequence of the loss of water occasioned by a
                    considerable quantity of the fluid being dashed over their sides. Instead,
                    therefore, of expecting ar increase of effect from the impulse of tìie water
                    occasioned by its fall through one-third of the whole height, we should allow it
                    to act through this height by its gravity, and therefore make the diameter of
                    the wheel as great as possible. But a disadvantage attends even this rule; for
                    if the water is con <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> veyed into the buckets without
                    any velocity, which must be the case when the diameter of the wheel equals the
                    height of the fall, the velocity of the wheel will be retarded by the impulşę of
                    the buckets against the water, and much power would be lost by the water dashing
                    over them. In order, therefore, to avoid all inconveniences, the distance of the
                    spout from the receiving bucket should, in general, be about two or three
                    inches, that the water may be delivered with a velocity a little greater than
                    that of the wheel; or, in other words, the diameter of an overshot-wheel should
                    be two or three indies less than the greatest height of the fall; and yet it is
                    no uncommon thing to see the diameters of these wheels scarcely one-half of that
                    height. In such a construction the loss of power is prodigious.</p>
                <p>307. The proper velocity of overshot-wheels is a subject on which mechanical
                    writers have entertained different sentiments. While some have maintained that
                    there is a certain velocity which produces a maximum effect^ Deparcieux has
                    endeavoured to prove, by a set of ingenious experiments, that most work is
                    performed by an overshotwheel when it moves slowly, and that the more its motion
                    is retarded by increasing the work to be performed, the greater will be the
                    performance of the wheel, In these experiments he employed a small wheel, 20
                    inches in diameter, having its circumference furnished with 48 buckets. On the
                    centre or axle of this wheel were placed 4 cylinders of different diameters, the
                    first being 1 inch in diameter, the second 2 inches, the third 3 inches, and the
                    fourth 4 inches. When the experiments are made, a cord is attached to one of the
                    cylinders, and after passing over a pulley, a weight is suspended at its other
                    extremity. By moving the wheel upon its axis, the cord winds round the cylinder
                    and raises the weight. In order to diminish the friction, the gudgeons of the
                    wheel are supported by two friction rollers, and before the wheel, a little
                    higher than its axis, is placed a small table which supports a vessel filled
                    with water, having an orifice in the side next the wheel. Above this vessel is
                    placed a large bottle full of water and inverted, having its mouth immersed a
                    few lines in the water, so that it empties itself in proportion as the water in
                    the vessel is dischargeci from the orifice. The quantity of water thus
                    discharged is always the same, and is conveyed from the orifice by means of a
                    canal to the buckets of the wheel. With this apparatus he obtained the following
                    results.</p>

                <p>308. When the large cylinders were used, the velocity of the wheel was smaller,
                    because the resistances are proportional to their diameter, the weight being the
                    same. Hence it appears, by comparing the four results in column 2d with one
                    another, and also the four results in column 3d, that when the wheel turns more
                    slowly, the effect, which is in this case measured by the elevation of the
                    weight always increases. When the weight of 24 ounces., was used, the resistance
                    was twice as great, and the velocity tw ice as slow, as when the 12 ounce weight
                    was employed. But by comparing the results in column 2d with the corresponding
                    results in column 3d, it appears, that when the 24 ounce weight was employed,
                    and the velocity was only one-half of what it was when the 12 ounce weight was
                    used, the effect was <hi rend="italic">more than one-half,</hi> the numbers in
                    the 3d column being more than one-half the numbers in the 2d. Hence we may
                    conclude, that the slower an overshot-wheel moves, the greater will be its
                    performance.</p>
                <p>309. These experiments of Deparcicux presented such unexpected results, as to
                    induce other philosophers, to examine them with care. The Chevalier D’Arcy, in
                    particular, considered them attentively. He maintained that there was a
                    determinate velocity when the effect of the wheel reached its maximum; and he
                    has shewn, by comparing the experiments of Deparcieux with his own formulae,
                    that the overshot-wheel which Deparcieux employed never <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192938907" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8907-0085"/>moved with such a small
                    velocity as corresponded with the maximum effect, and that if he had increased
                    the diameter of his cylinders, or the magnitude of the weights, his own
                    experiments would have exhibited the degree of velocity, when the effect was the
                    greatest possible.</p>
                <p>310. The reasoning of the Chevalier D’Arcy is completely confirmed by the
                    experiments of Smeaton. This celebrated engineer concludes with Deparcieux,
                    that, <hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> the less the velocity of the
                    wheel, the greater will be its effect. But he observes, on the contrary, that
                    when the wheel of his model made about 30 turns in a minute, the effect tvas
                    nearly the greatest; when it made 30 turns, the effect was diminished about
                    one-twentieth part; and that when it made 40 it was diminished about one-fourth;
                    when it made less than 18į turns, its motion was irregular, and when it was
                    loaded so that it could not make 18 turns, the wheel was overpowered by its
                    load. Mr Smeaton likewise observes, that when the circumferences of
                    overshot-wheels, whether high or low, move with the velocity of three feet per
                    second, and when the other parts of the work are properly adapted to it, they
                    will produce the greatest possible effect. He allows, however, that high wheels
                    may deviate farther from this rule before losing their power than low ones can
                    be permitted to do; and assures us that he has seen a wheel 24 feet high moving
                    at the rate of six feet per second, without losing any considerable part of its
                    power, and likewise a wheel 33 feet high moving very steadily and well with a
                    velocity but little exceeding two feet.</p>
                <p>311. The experiments of the Abbé Bossut may also be adduced in support of the
                    same reasoning. He employed a wheel 3 feet in diameter, furnished with 48
                    buckets, ha ving each three inches of depth, and four inches of width. The canal
                    which conveyed the water into the buckets was perfectly horizontal, and was five
                    inches wide. It furnished uniformly 1194 cubic inches of water in a minute. The
                    resistance to be overcome was a variety of weights fixed to the extremity of a
                    cord, which, after passing over a pulley as in Deparcieux’s experiments, winded
                    round the cylindrical axle of the wheel. The diameter of this cylinder was two
                    inches and seven lines, and that of the gudgeons or pivots of the wheel two
                    lines and a half. The number of turns which the wheel made in a minute was not
                    reckoned till its motion became uniform, which always happened when it had
                    performed five or six revolutions. When the wheel was unloaded it made 40į turns
                    in a minute.</p>

                <p>312. It appears evidently from the last column, which we have computed on
                    purpose, that the effect increases as the velocity diminishes; but that the
                    effect is a maximum when the number of turns is 8 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛
                    in a minute, being then 1391⅞. When the velocity was farther diminished by
                    adding an additional pound to the resistance, the effect was diminished to 138,
                    and when the velocity was still less, the wheel ceased to move.</p>
                <p>Now since the wheel was three feet in diameter, and 9.42 feet in circumference,
                    the velocity of its circumference w ill be about one foot four inches per
                    second, when it performs 8 <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    9</hi><hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> turns in a minute, or when the maximum effect
                    is produced. With Mr Smeaton’s model, the maximum effect was produced when the
                    velocity of the wheel’s circumference was t w o feet per second. So that the
                    experiments both of Smeaton and Bossut concur to prove, that the power of
                    overshot wheels increases as the velocity diminishes; but that there is a
                    certain velocity, between one and two feet per second, when the wheel produces a
                    maximum effect. Since when the wheel was unloaded it turned 40∣ times, in a
                    minute, and performed only 8y ’- <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> ∙ revolutions when
                    its power was a maximum, the velocity of the wheel when unloaded will be to its
                    velocity when the effect is the greatest, as five to one, nearly.</p>
                <p>313. The Chevalier de Borda maintains that an overshot wheel will raise through
                    the height of the fall a quantity of water equal to that by which it is driven,
                    and Albert Euler has shewn that the effect of these wheels is very much inferior
                    to the momentum or force which impels them. It appears, however, from Sir
                    Smeaton’s experiments, that when the work performed was a maximum, the ratio of
                    the power to the effect was as four to three, when the height of the fall and
                    the quantities of water expended were the least; but that it was as four to two
                    when the heights of the fall and the quantities discharged were the greatest. By
                    taking a mean between these ratios, we may conclude, in general, that in over
                    shot-wheels the power is to the effect as three to one. In this case the power
                    is supposed to be computed from the whole height of the fall; because the water
                    must be raised to that height in order to be in a condition of producing the
                    same effect a second time. When the power of the water is estimated only from
                    the height of the wheel, the ratio of the power to the effect was more constant,
                    being nearly as five to four.</p>
                <p>314. The theory of overshot-wheels has been ably discussed by Albert Euler and
                    Lambert. The former of these philosophers has shewn that the altitude of the
                    wheel should be made as great as possible; that the buckets should be made as
                    capacious as other circumstances will permit; that theiŗ form should be such as
                    to convey the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938920" xml:id="kp-eb0712-8920-0086"
                    />water as near the lowest point of the wheel as can be conveniently done; and
                    that the motion of the wheel should be slow, that the buckets may be completely
                    filled. He has likewise shewn that the effect of the wheel increases as its
                    velocity is diminished; and that overshot-wheels should be used only when there
                    is a sufficient height of fall. The results of Lambert’s investigations are less
                    consonant with the experiments of Smeaton. By examining the following table,
                    which contains these results, it will appear at once that he makes the diameter
                    of the wheel much smaller than it ought to be.</p>

                <p>315. A breast-wheel partakes of the nature both of an overshot ana an undershot
                    wheel, and is driven partly by the impulse, but chiefly by the weight, of the
                    water. The mill-course (fig. 84), is made concentric with the wheel, which is
                    fitted to it in such a manner that no water is allowed to escape at the sides
                    and extremities of the floatboards. The water is delivered into the openings of
                    the wheel through an iron grating <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and its admission
                    is regulated by two shutters c, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the lowest of which is
                    adjusted till a sufficient quantity of water passes over it; and the other
                    shutter <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is made to descend by machinery when the wheel
                    is to be stopped, and the water retained in the reservoir R. According to Mr
                    Smeaton, the effect of a wheel driven in this manner is equal “to the effect of
                    an undershot-wheel whose head of water is equal to the difference of level
                    between the surface of water in the reservoir, and the point where it strikes
                    the wheel, added to that of an overshot whose height is equal to the difference
                    of level between the point where it strikes the wheel and the level of the tail
                    water.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>317∙ R appears from the preceding table, that when the altitude of the fall of
                    water is below three feet, there is such an unsuitable proportion between the
                    depth and width of the floatboards, that a breast wheel cannot well be employed.
                    It is also evident, on the other hand, that when the height of the fall
                    approaches to ten feet, the depth of the floatboards is too small in relation to
                    their width. These two extremes, therefore, ought to be avoided in practice. The
                    eleventh column of the table contains the quantity of water necessary to drive
                    the wheel; but the total quantity of water should always exceed this, by the
                    quantity, at least, that escapes between the mill-course and the sides and
                    extremities of the floatboards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">On Undershot-Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p>318. An undershot-wheel is a wheel with a number of floatboards disposed on its
                    circumference, which receive the impulse of the water conveyed to the lowest
                    point of the wheel by an inclined canal. It is represented in fig. 85, where WW
                    is the water-wheel, and ABDFHKMV the canal or mill-course, which conveys the
                    water to K, where it strikes the plane floatboards <hi rend="italic">η o,</hi>
                    &amp;c. and makes the wheel revolve about its axis.</p>
                <p>319- In order to construct the mill-course to the greatest advantage, we must
                    give but a very small declivity to ’ the canal which conducts the water from the
                    river. It will be sufficient to make AB slope about one inch in 200 yards,
                    making the declivity, however, about half an inch for the first 48 yards, in
                    order that the water may have sufficient velocity to prevent it from falling
                    back into the river. The inclination of the fall, represented by the angle GCR,
                    should be 25° 50′, or CR, the radius, should be to GR, the tangent of this
                    angle, as 100 to 28, or as 25 to 12; and since the surface of the water Sδ is
                    bent from <hi rend="italic">ah</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> before it is
                    precipitated down the fall, it will be necessary to incurvate the upper part BCD
                    of the course into BD, that the water in the bottom may move parallel to the
                    water at the surface of the stream. For this purpose take the points B, D about
                    12 inches distance from C, and raise the perpendiculars BE, DE. The point of
                    intersection E will be the centre from which the arch BD is to be described; the
                    radius being about 10 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    θ inches. Now, in order that the water may act more advantageously upon the
                    floatboards of the wheel WW, it must assume a horizontal direction, with the
                    same velocity which it would have acquired when it came to the point G. But, if
                    the water were allowed to fall from C to G, it would dash upon the horizontal
                    part HG, and thus lose a great part of its velocity. It will be necessary,
                    therefore, to make it move along FH, an arch of a circle to which DF and KH are
                    tangents in the points F and II. For this purpose make GF and GH each equal to
                    three feet; and raise the perpendiculars HI, FI which will intersect one another
                    in the point I, distant about four feet nine inches from the points F and H, and
                    the centre of the arch FH will be determined. The distance HK, through which the
                    water runs before it acts upon the wheel, should not be less than two or three
                    feet, in order that the different filaments of the fluid may have attained a
                    horizontal direction. If HK were too large, the stream would suffer a diminution
                    of velocity by its friction on the bottom of the course. That no water may
                    escape between the bottom of the course KH and the extremities of the
                    floatboards, KL should be about three inches, and the extremity o of the
                    floatboard <hi rend="italic">no</hi> ought to reach below the line HKX,
                    sufficient room being left between <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and Μ for the play
                    of the wheel; or KLM may be formed into the arch of a circle KM concentric with
                    the wheel. The line LMV, which has been called the course of impulsion, should
                    be prolonged so as to support the water as long as it can act upon the
                    floatboards, and should be about nine inches distant from OP, a horizontal line
                    passing through 0 the lowest point of the fall; for if OL were much less than
                    nine inches, the water having spent the greatest part of its force in impelling
                    the floatboard, would accumulate below the wheel, and retard its motion. For the
                    same reason another course, which has been called the course of discharge,
                    should be connected with LMV by the curve VN, to preserve the remaining velocity
                    of the water, which would otherwise be discharged by falling perpendicularly
                    from V to N. The course of discharge, which is represented by the line VZ,
                    sloping from the point 0, should be about 16 yards long, having an inch of
                    declivity for every two yards. The canal which reconducts the water from the
                    course of discharge to the river should slope about four inches in the first 200
                    yards, three inches in the second 200 yards, decreasing gradually till it
                    terminates in the river. But if the river to which the water is conveyed should,
                    when swelled by the rains, force the water back upon the wheel, the canal must
                    have a greater declivity to prevent this from taking place. Hence it is evident
                    that very accurate levelling is requisite to the proper formation of the
                    mill-course.</p>
                <p>As it is of great importance that none of the water should escape, either below
                    the floatboards or at their sides, without contributing to turn the wheel, the
                    course of impulsion KV should be wider than the course at K, as represented in
                    fig. 86, where CD the course of impulsion corresponds with LV in fig. 85, AB
                    corresponds with HK, and BC with KL. The breadth of the floatboards, therefore,
                    should be wider than <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and their extremities should
                    reach a little below B, like <hi rend="italic">no</hi> in fig. 85. When these
                    precautions are'properly taken, no water can escape without exerting its force
                    upon the floatboards.</p>
                <p>320. It has been disputed among philosophers, whether the wheel should be
                    furnished with a small or a great number of floatboards. Μ. Pitot has shewn,
                    that when the floatboards have different degrees of obliquity, the force of
                    impulsion upon the different surfaces will be reciprocally as their breadths:
                    Thus in fig. 87, the force of impulsion upon <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be
                    to the force upon DO, as DO to <hi rend="italic">he.“</hi><note anchored="true"

                    he concludes that the distance between the floatboards should be equal to
                    one-half of the immersed arch, or that when one floatboard is at the bottom of
                    the wheel, and perpendicular<pb break="no" facs="nls:192938946"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8946-0088"/> to the current, as DE, the preceding floatboard
                    BC should be just leaving the stream, and the succeeding one FG just immerging
                    into it. For when the three floatboards FG, DE, BC have the same position as in
                    the figure, the whole force of the current NM will act upon DE when it is in the
                    most advantageous position for receiving it, whereas, if another floatboard <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi> were inserted between F G and DE, the part <hi
                    rend="italic">ig</hi> would cover DO, and by thus substituting an oblique for a
                    perpendicular surface, the effect would be diminished in the proportion of DO to
                    <hi rend="italic">ig.</hi> Hence it is evident, that, upon this principle, the
                    depth of the floatboard DE should be always equal to the versed sine of the arch
                    EG.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A table containing
                    the numbér of floatboards for wheels of different diameters, and founded on this
                    principle, has been given in the <hi rend="italic">Appendix to Ferguson’s
                    Lectures,</hi> vol. ii. p. 149, 2d edit.</p></note></p>
                <p>321. Notwithstanding the plausibility of this reasoning, it will not be difficult
                    to shew that it is destitute of foundation. It is evident from fig 87, that when
                    one of the floatboards DE is perpendicular to the stream, it receives the whole
                    impulse of the water in the most advantageous manner. But when it arrives at the
                    position <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> and the succeeding one FG at the position/^,
                    so that the angle <hi rend="italic">e A</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi> may be
                    bisected by the perpendicular AE, the situation of these floatboards will be the
                    most disadvantageous, for a great part of the water will escape between the
                    extremities <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of the
                    floatboards without striking them, and the part <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> of the floatboards, which is really impelled, is less than
                    DE, and oblique to the current. The wheel, therefore, must move irregularly,
                    sometimes quick and sometimes slow, according to the position of the floatboards
                    with respect to the stream; and this inequality will increase with the arch
                    plunged in the wafer. The reasoning of Μ. Pitot, indeed, is founded on the
                    supposition, that if another floatboard/)/ were placed between FG and DF, it
                    would annihilate the force of the water that impels it, and prevent any of the
                    fluid from striking the corresponding part DO of the preceding floatboard. But
                    this is not the case. For when the water has acted upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >fg,</hi> it still retains a part of its motion, âńd after bending round the
                    extremity <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> strikes DE with its remaining force. We are
                    entitled, therefore, to conclude that advantage must be gained by using more
                    floatboards than are recommended by Pitot.</p>
                <p>322. It is evident from the preceding remarks, that in order to remove any
                    inequality of motion in the wheel, and prevent the water from escaping below the
                    extremities of the floatboards, the wheel should be furnished with the greatest
                    possible nnmber of floatboards, without loading it too much, or enfeebling the
                    rim on which they are fixed. This rule was first given by Μ. Dupetit
                    Vandin;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires des</hi><hi rend="italic">Sçavans</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Etrangers,</hi> tom. i.</p></note> and it is easily perceived, that if the
                    mill-wright should err in using ∣ too many floatboards, this error in excess
                    will be perfectly trifling, and that a much greater loss of power would be
                    occasioned by an error in defect.</p>
                <p>323. The section of the floatboards ought not to be rectangular, like <hi
                    rend="italic">abnc</hi> in fig. 87, but should be bevelled like <hi
                    rend="italic">abmc.</hi> For if they were rectangular, the extremity <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> would interrupt a portion of the
                    water which would otherwise fall on the corresponding part of the preceding
                    floatboard. In order to find the angle <hi rend="italic">αl&gt;rn,</hi> subtract
                    from 180 degrees the number of degrees contained in the immersed arch CEG, and
                    the half of the remainder will be the angle required.</p>
                <p>324. It has been maintained by Μ. Pitot and other philosophers, that the
                    floatboards should be a continuation of the radius, or perpendicular to the rim,
                    as in fig. 85. This, indeed, is true in theory, but it appears from the most
                    unquestionable experiments, that they should be inclined to the radius. This
                    important fact was discovered by Deparcieux in 1753, and proved by several
                    experiments. When the floatboards are inclined, the water heaps up on their
                    surface, and acts not only by its impulse, but also by its weight. The same
                    truth has also been confirmed by the Abbé Bossut, the most accurate of whose
                    experiments are contained in the following table. The wheel that was employed
                    was immersed four inches vertically in the water, and it was furnished with 12
                    floatboards.</p>

                <p>325. It is obvious, from the preceding table, that the wheel made the greatest
                    number of turns, or moved with the greatest velocity, when the number of
                    floatboards was between 15 and 30. When the water-wheels are placed on canals
                    that have little declivity, and in which the water can escape freely after its
                    impulse upon the floatboards, it would be proper to make the floatboards a
                    continuation of the radius. But when they move in an inclined millcourse, an
                    augmentation of velocity may be expected from an inclination of the
                    floatboards.</p>
                <p>326. Having thus pointed out the most scientific method of constructing the
                    wheel, and delivering the water upon its floatboards, we have now to determine
                    the velocity with which it should move. It is evident that the velocity of the
                    wheel must be always less than that of the water which impels it, even when
                    there is no work to be performed; for a part of the impelling power is
                    necessarily spent in overcoming the inertia of the wheel, and the resistance of
                    friction. It is likewise obvious, that when the wheel has little or no velocity,
                    its performance will be very trifling. There is, consequently, a certain
                    proportion between the velocity of the water and the wheel, when its effect is a
                    maximum. By the reasoning which is employed in the section on undershot-wheels
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Water· Works,</hi> Parent and Pitot found,
                    that a maximum effect was produced when the velocity of the wheel was one-third
                    of the velocity of the water; and Desaguliers,<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the calculŭs from which this result was deduced, it was taken for granted that
                    the momentum or force of water upon the wheel is in the duplicate ratio of the
                    relative velocity, or as the square of the difference between the velocity of
                    the water and that of the wheel. This supposition, indeed, is perfectly correct
                    when the water impels a single floatboard; for as the number of particles which
                    strike the floatboard in a given time, and also the momentum of these, are each
                    as the relative velocity of the floatboards, the momentum must be as the square
                    of the relative velocity, that is, Μ === R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, Μ
                    being the momentum, and R the relative velocity. But we have seen, in some of
                    the preceding paragraphs, that the water acts on more than one floatboard at a
                    time. Now, the number of floatboards acted upon in a given time will be as the
                    velocity of the wheel, or inversely as the relative velocity; for if you
                    increase the relative velocity, the velocity of the water remaining the same,
                    you must diminish the velocity of the wheel.</p>
                <p>R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Consequently, we shall have Μ == por Μ == R; that is, the momentum of the water
                    acting upon the wheel is directly as the relative velocity.</p>
                <p>327∙ Let V be now the velocity of the stream, and F the force with which it would
                    strike the floatboard at rest, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> the velocity of the
                    wheel. Then the relative velocity will be V— <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and since the velocity of the water will be to its
                    momentum, or the force with which it would strike the floatboard at rest, as the
                    relative velocity is to the real force which the water exerts against the moving
                    float-</p>
                <p>V <hi rend="italic">v</hi> F</p>

                    rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>But the effect of the wheel is measured by the product of the momentum of the
                    water and the velocity of the wheel, consequently the effect of the
                    undershot-wheel will be</p>

                <p>328. This result, which was first obtained by the Chevalier de Borda, has been
                    amply confirmed by the experiments of Mr Smeaton. “The velocity of the stream,”
                    says he, “varies at the maximum between one-third and one-half that of the
                    water; but in all the cases in which most work is performed in proportion to the
                    water expended, and which approach the nearest to the circumstances of great
                    works, when properly executed, the maximum lies much nearer <hi rend="italic"
                    >one-half</hi> than <hi rend="italic">one-third,</hi> one-half seeming to be the
                    true maximum, if nothing were lost by the resistance of the air, the scattering
                    of the water carried up by the wheel,” &amp;c. .</p>
                <p>329. A result, nearly similar to this, was deduced from the experiments of
                    Bossut. He employed a wheel whose diameter was three feet. The number of
                    floatboards was at one time 48, and at another 24, their width being five
                    inches, and their depth six. The experiments with the wheel, when it had 48
                    floatboards, were made in an inclined canal supplied from a reservoir by an
                    orifice two inches deep, the velocity being 300 feet in 27 seconds. The
                    experiments with the wheel, when it had 24 floatboards, were made in a canal,
                    contained between two vertical walls, 12 or 13 feet distant.. The depth of the
                    water was about seven or eight inches, and its mean velocity about 2740 inches
                    in 40 seconds. The floatboards of the wheel were immersed about four inches in
                    the stream.</p>

                <p>330. As the effect of the machine is measured by the product of the load raised,
                    and the time employed, it will appear, by multiplying the second and third
                    columns, that the effect was a maximum when the load was 34∣ pounds, the wheel
                    performing 20 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ⅜ revolutions in 40 seconds. By
                    comparing the velocity of the centre of impression computed from the diameter of
                    the wheel, and the number of turns which it makes in 40 seconds, with the
                    velocity of the current, it will be found, that the velocity of the wheel, when
                    its effect is the greatest possible, is nearly two-fifths that of the stream.
                    From the two last columns of the table, where the effect is a maximum when the
                    load is 60 pounds, the same conclusion may be deduced.</p>
                <p>331. The proper velocity of the wheel being thus established, we shall proceed to
                    point out the method of constructing a millwright’s table for undershot-wheels,
                    taking it for granted that the velocity of the wheel should be one-half the
                    velocity of the stream, and that water moves with the same velocity as falling
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>1. Find the perpendicular height of the fall of water; above the bottom of the
                    mill-course, and having diminished this number by one-half the depth of the
                    water at K, call that the height of the fall.</p>
                <p>2. Since bodies acquire a velocity of 32.174 feet, by falling through the height
                    of 16.087 feet; and as the velocities of falling bodies are as the square roots
                    of the heights through which they fall, the square root of 16.087 will be to the
                    square root of the height of the fall as 32.174 to a fourth number, which will
                    be the velocity of the water. Therefore the velocity of the water may be always
                    found by multiplying 32.174 by the square root of the height of the fall, and
                    dividing that product by the square root of 16.087. Or it may be found more
                    easily by multiplying the height of the fall by the constant quantity 64.348 = 2
                    χ 32.1 74, and extracting the square root of the product. This root, abstracting
                    from the effects of friction, will be the velocity of the water required.</p>
                <p>3. Take <hi rend="italic">one-half</hi> the velocity of the water, and it will be
                    the velocity which must be given to the flυatboards, or the number of feet they
                    must move through in a second, in order to produce a maximum effect.</p>
                <p>4. Divide the circumference of the wheel by the velocity of its floatboards per
                    second, and the quotient will be the number of seconds in which the wheel
                    revolves.</p>
                <p>5. Divide 60 by the number last found, and the quotient will be the number of
                    turns made by the wheel in a minute. <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938972"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8972-0090"/>—Or the number of revolutions performed by the
                    wheel in a minute may be found, by multiplying the velocity of the floatboards
                    by 60, and dividing the product by the circumference of the wheel.</p>
                <p>6. Divide 90, the number of revolutions which a millstone, five feet diameter,
                    should make in a minute, by the number of revolutions made by the wheel in a
                    minute; and the quotient will be the number of turns which the millstone ought
                    to make for one revolution of ihe wheel.</p>
                <p>7. Then, as the number of revolutions of the wheel in a minute is to the number
                    of revolutions of the millstone in a minute, so must the number of staves in the
                    trundle be to the number of teeth in the wheel, in the nearest whole numbers
                    that can be found.</p>
                <p>8. Multiply the number of revolutions performed by the wheel in a minute, by the
                    number of revolutions made by the millstone for one of the wheel, and the
                    product will be the number of revolutions made by the millstone in a minute.</p>
                <p>332. By these rules, the following table has been computed for a water-wheel
                    fifteen feet in diameter, which is a good medium size, the millstone being seven
                    feet in diameter, and revolving 90 times in a minute.</p>

                <p>333. The preceding table <hi rend="italic">{Appendix to Fergusorìs Lectures,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 174) supposes, according to theory, that the velocity of the wheel,
                    at the maximum effect, is one-half that of the stream, which is nearly the case
                    in practice, when the quantities of water discharged by the stream are
                    considerable. “When we consider, however,” observes the editor of the work now
                    quoted, “that after every precaution has been observed, a small quantity of
                    water will escape between the mill-course and the extremities of the
                    floatboards, and that the effect is diminished by the resistance of the air and
                    the dispersion of water carried up by the wheel, the propriety of making the
                    wheel move with three-sevenths the velocity of the water will appear. The
                    Chevalier de Borda supposes it never to exceed three-eighths; and Mr Smeaton and
                    the Abbé Bossut found two-fifths to be the proper medium.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The great hydraulic machine at Marly was
                    found to produce a maximum effect, when its velocity was two-fifths of that of
                    the stream.</p></note> With three-sevenths, therefore, as the best medium, which
                    differs only <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi

                    been computed. In Table I. the water was supposed to move with the same velocity
                    as falling bodies, but owing to its friction on the mill-course, &amp;c. this is
                    not exactly the case. We have therefore deduced the velocity of the water in
                    column se cond from the following formula, V = łZ? × RZ&gt; — — <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">^Αh</hi> the depth of the water at the bottom of the course.
                    The formula is founded on the experiments of Bossut, from which it appears, that
                    if a canal be inclined one-tenth part of its length, this additional declivity
                    will restore that velocity to the water which was destroyed by friction.”</p>

                <p>334. In order that the wheel may move with a velocity duly adjusted to that of
                    the current, we would not advise the mechanic to trust to the second column of
                    Table II. for the true velocity of the stream, or to any theoretical results,
                    even when deduced from formulae founded on experiments. Bossut, with great
                    justice, remarks, that “it would not be exact in practice to compute the
                    velocity of a current from its declivity. This velocity ought to be determined

                    water, therefore, where it strikes the wheel, be determined by the method in the
                    following paragraph. With this velocity, as an argument, enter column second of

                    disadvantages. The little wheel was employed in the experiments of Bossut. It is
                    the most convenient mode of determining the superficial velocity of the water;
                    and, when constructed in the following manner, will be more accurate, it is
                    hoped, than any instrument that has hitherto been used. The small wheel WW
                    should be formed of the lightest materials. It should be about ten or twelve
                    inches in diameter, and furnished with fourteen or sixteen floatboards. This
                    wheel moves upon a delicate screw <hi rend="italic">a</hi> B, passing through
                    its axle B <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when impelled by
                    the stream it will gradually approach towards D, each revolution of the wheel
                    corresponding with a thread of the screw. The number of revolutions performed in
                    a given time are determined upon the scale <hi rend="italic">m a,</hi> by means
                    of the index O <hi rend="italic">h</hi> fixed at 0, and moveable with the wheel,
                    each division of the scale being equal to the breadth of a thread of the screw,
                    and the extremity <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the index O <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> coinciding with the beginning of the scale, when the shoulder <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> of the wheel is screwed close to <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    The parts of a revolution are indicated by the bent index <hi rend="italic">m
                    n,</hi> pointing to the periphery of the wheel, which is divided into 100 parts.
                    When this instrument is to be used, take it by the handles CD, or when great
                    accuracy is required, make it rest on the handles CD; and screw the shoulder <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> of the wheel close to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> so that the
                    indices may both point to <hi rend="italic">o</hi> the commencement of the
                    scales. Then, by means of a stop-watch or pendulum, find how many revolutions of
                    the wheel are performed in a given time. Multiply the mean circumference of the
                    wheel (or the circumference deduced from the mean radius, which is equal to the
                    distance of the centre of impulsion or impression from the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> B) by the number of revolutions, and the product will be
                    the number of feet through which the water moves in the given time. On account
                    of the friction of the screw, the resistance of the air, and the weight of the
                    wheel, its centre of impression will revolve with a little less velocity than
                    that of the stream; but the diminution of velocity, arising from these causes,
                    may be estimated with sufficient precision for all the purposes of the practical
                    mechanic. <hi rend="italic">{Appendix to Eergusorìs Lectures,</hi> vol. ii. p.

                <p>336. It appears, from a comparison of the numerous and accurate experiments of Mr
                    Smeaton, that, in undershotwheels, the power employed to turn the wheel is to
                    the effect produced as 3 to 1; and that the load which the wheel will carry at
                    its maximum, is to the load which will totally stop it, as 3 to 4. The same
                    experiments inform us, that the impulse of the water on the wheel, in the case
                    of a maximum, is more than double of what is assigned by theory, that is,
                    instead of four-sevenths of the column, it is nearly equal to the whole column.
                    In order to account for this, Mr Smeaton observes, that the wheel was not, in
                    this case, placed in an open river, where the natural current, after it had
                    communicated its impulse to the float, has room on all sides to escape, as the
                    theory supposes; but in a conduit or race, to which the float being adapted, the
                    water could not otherwise escape than by moving along with the wheel. He
                    likewise remarks, that when a wheel works in this manner, the water, as soon as
                    it meets the float, receives a sudden check, and rises up against it like a wave
                    against a fixed object; insomuch, that when the sheet of water is not a quarter
                    of an inch thick before it meets the float, yet this sheet will act upon the
                    whole surface of a float, whose height is three inches. Were the float,
                    therefore, no higher than the thickness of the sheet of water, as the theory
                    supposes, a great part of the force would be lost by the water dashing over it.
                    In order to try what would be the effect of diminishing the number of
                    floatboards, Mr Smeaton reduced the floatboards, which were originally 24 to 12.
                    This change produced a diminution of the effect, as a greater quantity of water
                    escaped between the floats and the floor. But when a circular sweep was adapted
                    to the floor, and made of such a length that one float entered the curve before
                    the preceding one quitted it, the effect came so near to the former, as to
                    afford no hopes of increasing it by augmenting the number of floats beyond 24 in
                    this particular wheel. Mr Smeaton likewise deduced, from his experiments, the
                    following maxims.</p>
                <p>1. That the virtual or effective head being the same, the effect will be nearly
                    as the quantity of water expended.</p>
                <p>2. That the expense of water being the same, the effect will be nearly as the
                    height of the virtual or effective head.</p>
                <p>3. That the quantity of water expended being the same, the effect is nearly as
                    the square of the velocity.</p>
                <p>4. The aperture being the same, the effect will be nearly as the cube of the
                    velocity of the water.</p>
                <p>337. We have hitherto supposed the floatboards, though inclined to the radius, to
                    be perpendicular to the plane of the wheel. Undershot-wheels, however, have
                    sometimes been constructed with floatboards inclined to the plane of the wheel.
                    A wheel of this kind is represented in fig 89∙ wļiere AB is the wheel, and
                    CDEFGH the oblique floatboards. The horizontal current MN is delivered on the
                    floatboards, so as to strike them perpendicularly. On account of the size of the
                    floatboards, every filament of the water contributes to turn the wheel; and
                    therefore its effect will be greater than in undershot wheels of the common
                    form. Albert Euler imagines that the effect will be twice as great, and
                    observes, that in order to produce such an <pb break="no" facs="nls:192938998"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-8998-0092"/>effect, the velocity of the centre of impression
                    should be to the velocity of the water, as radius is to triple the sine of the
                    angle by which the floatboards are inclined to the plane of the wheel. If this
                    inclination, therefore, be 60°, the velocity of the wheel at the centre of
                    impression ought to 3 ν'3</p>
                <p>be to the velocity of the impelling fluid as 1 to —-—, that is, √3</p>
                <p>as 5 to 13 nearly, because Sin. 60° = —. When the inclination is 30°, the ratio
                    of the velocities will be found to be as 2 to 3.</p>
                <p>338. In wheels of this kind, the floats may also be advantageously inclined to
                    the radius. In this case, the stream, which still strikes them perpendicularly,
                    is inclined to the horizon. If the angle formed by the common section of the
                    wheel and floatboards with the radius of the wheel, be <hi rend="italic">=
                    m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the angle by which the floatboards are
                    inclined to the plane of the wheel be = <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> then the angle
                    which the floatboards should form with the direction in which the wheel moves,
                    will be = Cos. <hi rend="italic">m</hi> × Sin. <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> In
                    order, therefore, that the stream may strike the floatboards with a
                    perpendicular impulse, its inclination to the horizon must be = <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> and its inclination to the plane of the wheel — 90° — n.
                    The less that the velocity of the water is, the greater should be the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for there is, in this case, no
                    danger that the celerity of the wheel be too great. The area of the floatboards
                    ought to be much greater than the section of the current; and the interval
                    between two adjacent floatboards should be so great, that before the one
                    completely withdraws itself from the action of the water, the other should begin
                    to receive its impulse.</p>
                <p>339∙ Horizontal water-wheels have been much used on the Continent, and are
                    strongly recommended to our notice by the simplicity of their construction. In
                    fig. 90, AB is the large water-wheel which moves horizontally upon its arbor CD.
                    This arbor passes through the immoveable millstone EF at D, and being fixed to
                    the upper one GH, carries it once round for every revolution of the great wheel.
                    The mill-course is constructed in the same manner for horizontal as for vertical
                    wheels, with this difference only, that the part <hi rend="italic">m</hi> B <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> C, fig. 85 of which KLin fig. 86 is a section, instead of
                    being rectilineal like <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> must be circular like <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> P, and concentric with the rim of the wheel, sufficient
                    room being left between it and the tips of the floatboards for the play of the
                    wheel. In this construction, where the water moves in a horizontal direction
                    before it strikes the wheel, the floatboards should be inclined about 25° to the
                    plane of the wheel, and the same number of degrees to the radius, so that the
                    lowest and outermost sides of the floatboards may be farthest up the stream.</p>
                <p>340. Instead of making the canal horizontal before it delivers the water on the
                    floatboards, they are frequently inclined in such a manner as to receive the
                    impulse perpendicularly, and in the direction of the declivity of the
                    mill-course. When this construction is adopted, the maximum effect will be
                    produced when the velocity of the float-</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. , 5.67 √H</p>
                <p>boards is not less than —— -, where H represents the</p>
                <p>2 Sm. A</p>
                <p>height of the fall, and A the angle which the direction of the fall makes with a
                    vertical line. But as the quantity</p>
                <p>5.67 √H . . , . <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi>. , evidently increases as the sine
                    of A decreases, it 2 Sin. A <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> follows, that without
                    lessening the effect of these wheels, we may diminish the angle A, and thus
                    augment considerably the velocity of the floatboards, according to the nature of
                    the machinery employed; whereas, in vertical wheels, there is only one
                    determinate velocity which produces a maximum effect.</p>
                <p>341. In the southern provinces of France, where horizontal wheels are generally
                    employed, the floatboards are made of a curvilineal form, so as to be concave
                    towards the stream. The Chevalier de Borda observes, that in theory a double
                    effect is produced when the floatboards are concave; but that effect is
                    diminished in practice, from the difficulty of making the fluid enter and leave
                    the curve in a proper direction. Notwithstanding this difficulty, however, and
                    other defects which might be pointed out, horizontal wheels with concave
                    floatboards are always superior to those in which the floatboards are plain, and
                    even to vertical wheels, when there is a sufficient fall of water. When the
                    floatboards are plane, the wheel is driven merely by the impulse of the stream;
                    but when they are concave, a part of the water acts by its weight and increases
                    the velocity of the wheel. If the fall of water be 5 or 6 feet, a horizontal
                    wheel with concave floatboards may be erected, whose maximum effect will be to
                    that of the ordinary vertical wheels as 3 to 2.</p>
                <p>342. An advantage attending horizontal wheels is, that the water may be divided
                    into several canals, and delivered upon several floatboards at the same time.
                    Each stream will heap up on its corresponding floatboard, and produce a greater
                    effect than if the force of the water had been concentrated on a single
                    floatboard. Horizontal wheels may be employed with greatest advantage when a
                    small quantity of water falls through a considerable height.</p>
                <p>343. It has been disputed among mechanical philosophers, whether overshot or
                    undershot wheels produce the greatest effect. Μ. Belidor maintained that the
                    former were inferior to the latter, while a contrary opinion was entertained by
                    Desaguliers. It appears, however, from Mr Smeaton’s experiments, that in
                    overshot-wheels the power is to the effect nearly as 3 to 2 or as 5 to 4 in
                    general, whereas in undershot-wheels it is only as 3 to 1. The effect of
                    overshot-wheels, therefore, is nearly double that of undershot-wheels, other
                    circumstances being the same. In comparing the relative effects of water-wheels,
                    the Chevalier de Borda remarks that overshot wheels will raise through the
                    height of the fall, a quantity of water equal to that by which they are driven;
                    that undershot vertical wheels wdll produce only three-eighths of this effect;
                    that horizontal wheels w ill produce a little less than one-half of it when the
                    floatboards are plain, and a little more than one-half of it when the
                    floatboards have a curvilineal form.</p>

                <p>344. The water-wheel invented by Mr Besant of Brompton is constructed in the form
                    of a hollow drum, so as to resist the admission of the water. The floatboards
                    are fixed obliquely in pairs on the periphery of the wheel, so that each pair
                    may form an acute angle open at its vertex, while one of the floatboards extends
                    beyond the vertex of the angle. A section of the water-wheel is represented in
                    fig. 91, where AB is the wheel, CD its axis, and <hi rend="italic">mn op</hi>
                    the position of the floatboards. The motion of common undershot-wheels is
                    greatly retarded by the resistance which the tail-water and the atmosphere
                    oppose to the ascending floatboards; but in Besant’s wheel this resistance is
                    greatly diminished, as the floats emerge from the stream in an oblique
                    direction. Although this wheel is much heavier than those of the common
                    construction, yet it revolves more easily upon its axis, as the stream has a
                    tendency to make it float.</p>

                <p>345. In Guyenne and Languedoc, in the south of France, a kind of conical
                    horizontal wheel is sometimes employed for turning machinery. It is constructed
                    in the form of an inverted cone AB, fig. 92, with spiral floatboards winding
                    round its surface. The wheel moves on a vertical axis AB, in the building DD,
                    and is driven chiefly by the impulse of the water conveyed by the canal C to the
                    oblique floatboards, the direction of the current being perpendicular to the
                    floatboards at the place of impact. When the impulsive force of the water is
                    annihilated, it descends along the spirals, and continues to act by its weight
                    till it reaches the bottom, when it is carried off by the canal Μ.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II. ON MACHINES DRIVEN BY THE REACTION OF WATER.</p>
                <p>346. We have hitherto considered the nnechanical effects of water as the
                    impelling power of machinery, when it acts either by its impulse or by its
                    gravity. The reaction of water may be employed to communicate motion to
                    machinery; and though this principle has not yet been adopted in practice, it
                    appears from theory and from some detached experiments on a small scale, that a
                    given quantity of water, falling through a given height, will produce greater
                    effects by its reaction than by its impulse or its weight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">On Dr Barker’s
                    Mill.</hi></p>
                <p>347. This machine, which is sometimes called Parent’s mill, is represented in
                    fig. 93, where MN is the canal that conveys the water into the upright tube TT,
                    which communicates with the horizontal arm AB. The water will therefore descend
                    through the upright tube into this arm, and will exert upon the inside of it a
                    pressure proportioned to the height of the fall. But if two orifices A and B be
                    perforated at the extremities of the arm, and on contrary sides, the pressure
                    upon these orifices will be removed by the efflux of the water, and the
                    unbalanced pressure upon the opposite sides of the arm will make the tube and
                    the horizontal arm revolve upon the spindle D as an axis. This will be more
                    easily understood, if we suppose the orifices to be shut up, and consider &gt;
                    the pressure <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> Pθ <hi rend="superscript"> n a</hi>
                    circular inch of the arm opposite to the orifice, the orifice being of the same
                    size. The pressure upon this circular inch will be equal to a cylinder of water
                    whose base is one inch in diameter, and whose altitude is the height of the
                    fall; and the same force is exerted upon the shut-up orifice. These two
                    pressures, therefore, being equal and opposite, the arm A will remain at rest.
                    But as soon as you open the orifice, the water will issue with a velocity due to
                    the height of the fall; the pressure upon the orifice will of consequence be
                    removed; and as the pressure upon the circular inch opposite to the orifice
                    still continues, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939024"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9024-0094"/>the equilibrium will be destroyed, the arm will
                    move in a retrograde direction.</p>
                <p>348. The upright spindle D, on which the arm revolves, is fixed in the bottom of
                    the arm, and screwed to it below by a nut. It is fixed to the upright tube by
                    two cross bars, so as to move along with it. If a corn-mill is to be driven, the
                    top of the spindle is fixed into the upper millstone <hi rend="italic">m.</hi>
                    The lower quiescent millstone <hi rend="italic">n</hi> rests upon the floor K,
                    in which is a hole, to let the meal pass into a trough below. The bridgetree GF,
                    which supports the millstone, tube, &amp;c. is moveable on a pin at <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> and its other end is supported by an iron rod fixed into
                    it, the top of the rod going through the fixed bracket 0, furnished with a nut
                    o. By screwing this nut, the millstone may be raised or lowered at pleasure. If
                    any other kind of machinery is to be driven, the spindle D must be prolonged
                    above the hopper H, and a small wheel fixed to its extremity, which will
                    communicate its motion to any species of mechanism. An improvement on this
                    machine by M. Mathon de la Cour, and some excellent observations on the subject
                    by Professor Robison, will be found in the article <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    Water-</hi><hi rend="italic">Worhs.</hi></p>
                <p>349∙ Mr Waring of the American Philosophical Society, has given a theory of
                    Barker’s mill with the improvement of M. Mathon de la Cour, which he has
                    strangely ascribed to a Mr Rumsey about twenty years after it was published in
                    <hi rend="italic">Rozier’s Journal de Physique,</hi> Jan. and August 1775.
                    Contrary to every other philosopher, he makes the effect of the machine equal
                    only to that of a good undershotwheel, moved with the same quantity of water,
                    falling through the same height. The following rules, however, deduced from his
                    calculus, may be of use to those who may wish to make experiments on the effect
                    of this interesting machine.</p>
                <p>1. Make the arm of the rotatory tube or arm C, from the centre of motion to the
                    centre of the aperture, of any convenient length, not less than one-third
                    (one-ninth according to Mr Gregory,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    HI.</p></note> who has corrected some of Waring’s numbers) of the perpendicular
                    height of the water’s surface above their centres.</p>
                <p>2. Multiply the length of the arm in feet by .614, and take the square root of
                    the product for the proper time of a revolution in seconds, and adapt the other
                    parts of the machinery to this velocity; or, if the time of a revolution be
                    given, multiply the square of this time by 1.63 for the proportional length of
                    the arm.</p>
                <p>3. Multiply together the breadth, depth, and velocity per second, of the race,
                    and divide the last product by 18.47 (times 14.27 according to Mr Gregory) the
                    square root of the height, for the area of either aperture.</p>
                <p>4. Multiply the area of either aperture by the height of the fall of water, and
                    the product by4l∣ pounds (55.775 according to Mr Gregory), for the moving force
                    estimated at the centres of the apertures in pounds avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>5. The power and velocity at the aperture may be easily reduced to any part of
                    the machinery by the simplest mechanical rules.</p>
                <p>350. Long after the preceding machine had been described in several of our
                    English treatises on machines, Professor Segner published in his hydraulics, as
                    an invention of his own, the account of a machine, differing from this only in
                    form. MN was the axis of the machine, corresponding with DX in Barker’s mill,
                    and a number of tubes AB (fig. 94.) were also so arranged round this axis, that
                    their higher extremities A formed a circular superficies, into which the water
                    flowed from a reservoir. When the machine has this form, it has been shewn by
                    Albert Euler that the maximum effect is produced when the velocity is infinite,
                    and that the effect is equal to the power. As a considerable portion of the
                    power, however, must be consumed in communicating to the fluid the circular
                    motion of the tubes; and as the portion thus lost must increase with the
                    velocity of the tube, the effect will in reality sustain a diminution from an
                    increase of velocity.</p>

                    Euler’s Machine driven by the Reaction of the Water.</hi></p>
                <p>351. This machine consists of two vessels, the lowest of which EEFF (fig. 95.) is
                    moveable round the vertical axis</p>
                <p>00, while the higher vessel remains immoveable. The form of the lowest vessel,
                    which is represented by itself in fi &lt;∙. 96, is similar to that of a
                    truncated bell, which is fast ened by the cross beams <hi rend="italic">m,
                    n</hi> to the axis 0, so as to move along with it. The annular cavity <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">er, er er,</hi> diverging from the axis. Through the lower
                    extremities of these tubes, which are bent into a right angle, the water flowing
                    from the cavity <hi rend="italic">hlilιh</hi> issues with a velocity due to the
                    altitude of its surface in <hi rend="italic">h, It,</hi> and produces by its

                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9037-0095"/>round the axis 00. The cavity of the ring <hi
                    rend="italic">h, h,</hi> receives the water from the superior vessel GGHH,
                    similar to the inferior vessel in fig. 95, but not connected with the axis 00.
                    This vessel has also an annular cavity PP, into which the water is conveyed from
                    a reservoir by the canal R. Around the lower part HH of the cavity, this vessel
                    is divided into several apertures I <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> placed obliquely
                    that the water may descend with proper obliquity into the inferior vessel. The
                    width of the higher vessel at HH ought to be equal to the width of the lower
                    vessel at EE, that the water which issues from the former may exactly fill the

                <p>The determinations in the preceding table are exhibited in a general manner, that
                    the machine may be accommodated to local circumstances. The time of a revolution
                    T, for instance, is left undetermined, because upon this time depends the
                    magnitude of the machine; and T may be assumed of such a value that the
                    dimensions of the machine may be suitable to the given place, or to the nature
                    of the work to be performed.</p>
                <p>352. In order to shew the application of the preceding table, let it be required
                    to construct the machine when the height of the fall is five feet, and when the
                    reservoir furnishes one cubic foot of water in a second. In this case <pb

                    therefore, by column 3, the sum of the areas of the orifices will be 11.52
                    square inches. Consequently, if there are twelve orifices, the area of each
                    orifice will be</p>
                <p>11.52</p>
                <p>——-= 0.9θ of a square inch. Suppose the time of a</p>
                <p>1 A</p>
                <p>revolution to be = 1 second, or T = 1, then the 4th column will give the mean
                    radius of the annular orifice = 1.9894 feet, or nearly two feet. Let the breadth
                    of the annular orifice, or B = ∣ an inch, then the difference between the
                    altitude of each vessel will be 0.3539 × řŗŝųjĩ, <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>1 1 DD</p>

                <p>I × ⅛ × 1 × 1 ⅛</p>
                <p>1.4156 inches. Now, as the sum of the heights of the vessels must be always equal
                    to the height of the fall, half that sum will in the present case be two feet
                    six inches; and since half the difference of their altitudes is 7-10ths of an
                    inch, the altitude of the superior vessel will be two feet six inches' and
                    seven-tenths, and that of the inferior vessel two feet five inches and
                    three-tenths. It appears from the last column of the table, that the tangent of
                    the inclination of the tubes is 0.1536, which corresponds with an angle of 8° 44

                <p>353. The theory of this machine has also been discussed by Leonhard Euler, in the

                    p. 311; and its application to all kinds of work has been pointed out in a

                    results of Euler’s analysis are not sufficiently practical for the use of the
                    general reader. But it appears from his investigations, as well as from those of
                    John Bernoulli and other philosophers, that the reaction of water is the most
                    powerful way in which the force of that fluid can be employed.</p>
                <p>354. It has often occurred to the writer of this article, that a very powerful
                    hydraulic machine might be con-, structed by combining the impulse with the
                    reaction of water. If the spout <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> for example, instead
                    of delivering the water into the higher vessel, were to throw it upon a number
                    of curvilineal floatboards fixed on its circumference, and so formed as to
                    convey the water easily into the spiral canals, we should have a machine
                    something like the conical horizontal wheel in fig. 92, with spiral channels
                    instead of spiral floatboards, and which would in some measure be moved both by
                    the impulse, weight, and reaction of the water.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER III. ON MACHINES FOR RAISING WATER.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">On Pumps.</hi></p>
                <p>355. <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> subject of pumps has been fully and ably
                    discussed by Dr Robison under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pump,</hi> to
                    which we must refer the reader for a complete view of the theory of the machine.
                    In that article, however, a reference is made to the present for a description
                    of the ancient pump of Ctesibíus, and of those in common use to which it has
                    given rise. To these subjects, therefore, we must now confine our attention.</p>
                <p>356. The pump was invented by Ctesibius, a mathematician of Alexandria, who
                    flourished under Ptolemy Psy-chon, about 120 years before Christ. In its
                    original state, it is represented in fig. 97, where AB CD is a brass cylinder
                    with a valve L in its bottom. It is furnished with a piston MK made of green
                    wood, so as not to swell in water, and adjusted to the bore of the cylinder by
                    the interposition of a ring of leather. The tube CI connects the cylinder AB CD
                    with another tube NH, the bottom of which is furnished with a valve I opening
                    upwards. Now, when the extremity DC of the cylinder is immersed in water, and
                    the piston MK elevated, the pressure of the water upon the valve L from below
                    will be proportioned to the depth below the surface (41). The valve will
                    therefore open, and admit the water into the cylinder. But when the piston is
                    depressed, it will force the water into the .tube CH, and through the valve I
                    into the tube NH. As soon as the portion of water that was admitted into the
                    cylinder AB CD, is thus impelled into the tube NH, the valve I will close. A
                    second elevation of the piston will admit another quantity of fluid into the
                    cylinder, and a second depression will force it into the tube NH; so that, by
                    continuing the motion of the piston, the water may be elevated to any altitude
                    in the tube. From this pump of Ctesibius are derived the three kinds of pumps
                    now commonly used, the sucking, the forcing, and the lifting pump.</p>
                <p>357. The common sucking pump is represented in fig.</p>
                <p>98, where ICBL is the body of the pump immersed in the water at A. The moveable
                    piston DG is composed of the piston rod D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the piston
                    or bucket G, and the valve <hi rend="italic">α.</hi> The bucket H, which is
                    fixed to the body of the pump, is likewise furnished with a valve <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> which, like the valve <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> should by
                    its own weight lie close upon the hole in the bucket till the working of the
                    engine commences. The valves are made of brass, and have their lower surface
                    covered with leather, in order to fit the holes in the bucket more exactly. The
                    moveable bucket G is covered with leather, so as to suit exactly the bore of the
                    cylinder, and to prevent any air escaping between it and the pump, be elevated
                    or depressed by the lever is <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the extremity of the bent
                    arm R <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi></p>
                <p>358. Let us now suppose the piston G to be depressed so that its inferior surface
                    may rest upon the valve <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Then, if the piston G be
                    raised to C, there would have been a vacuum between H and G if the valve <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> were immoveable. But as the valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    is moveable, and as the pressure of the air is removed from its superior
                    surface, the air in the tube HL will, by its elasticity, force open the valve
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and expand itself through the whole cavity LC. This
                    air, however, will be much rarer than that of the atmosphere; and since the
                    equilibrium between the external <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939063"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9063-0097"/>air and that in the tube LH is destroyed by the
                    rarefaction of the latter, the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the
                    water in the vessel K will predominate, and raise the water to about <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in the suction pipe HL, so that the air formerly included
                    in the space LC will be condensed to the same state as that of the atmosphere.
                    The elasticity of the air both above and below the valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> being now equal, that valve will fall by its own weight. Let the piston
                    DG be now depressed to <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the air
                    would evidently resist its descent, did not the valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    open and give a free exit to the air in the space CH, for it cannot escape
                    through die inferior valve <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> When the piston reaches <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> the valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will fall by its
                    weight; and when the piston is again elevated, the incumbent air will press the
                    valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi> firmly upon its orifice. During the second ascent
                    of the piston to C, the valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will rise, the air
                    between <hi rend="italic">e</hi> II will rush into HC; and in consequence of its
                    rarefaction, and inability to counteract the pressure of the atmosphere, the
                    water will rise to <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> In the same way it may be shewn,
                    that at the next stroke of the piston the water will rise through the box H to
                    B, and then the valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi> which was raised by it will fall
                    when the bucket G is at C. Upon depressing the bucket G again, the water cannot
                    be driven through the valve <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which is pressed to its
                    orifice by the water above it. At the next ascent of the piston a new quantity
                    of water will rise through H, and follow the piston to C. When the piston again
                    descends, the valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will open; and as the water between
                    C and H cannot be pushed through the valve <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> it will
                    rise through <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and have its surface at C when the piston
                    G is at ό; but when the piston rises, the valve <hi rend="italic">α</hi> being
                    shut by the water above it, this water will be raised up towards I, and issue at
                    the pipe F. A new quantity of water will rush through H, and fill the space HC:
                    consequently, the surface of the fluid will always remain at C, and every
                    succeeding elevation of the piston from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to C will make
                    the column of water CH run out at the pipe F.</p>
                <p>359∙ As the water rises in the pipe CL solely by the pressure of the atmosphere;
                    and as a column of water, 33 feet high, is equal in weight to a column of air of
                    the same base, reaching from the earth’s surface to the top of the atmosphere,
                    the water in the vessel K will not follow the piston G to a greater altitude
                    than 33 feet; for when it reaches this height, the column of water completely
                    balances, or is in equilibrium with, the atmosphere, and therefore cannot be
                    raised higher by the pressure of the external air.</p>
                <p>3fi0. The forcing-pump is represented in fig. 99, where D <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is the piston attached to a solid plunger <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> adjusted to the bore of the pipe BC by the
                    interposition of a ring of leather. The rectangular pipe MMN communicates with
                    the tube BC by the cavity round H; and its upper extremity P is furnished with a
                    valve <hi rend="italic">a</hi> opening upwards. An air-vessel KK is fastened to
                    P, and the tube EGI is introduced into it so as to reach as near as possible to
                    the valve <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Let us now suppose the plunger D <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> to be depressed to <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> As soon as it
                    is elevated to C, the air below it will be rarefied, and the water will ascend
                    through the valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the same way as in the
                    sucking-pump, till the pipe is filled to C. The valve <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    will now be shut by the weight of the incumbent water; and therefore, when the
                    plunger D <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is depressed, it will force the water between
                    C and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> through the rectangular pipe MMN, into the air
                    vessel KK. Before the water enters the air-vessel, it opens the valve <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> which shuts as soon as the plunger is again raised,
                    because the pressure of the water upon its under side is removed. In this way
                    the water is driven into the air-vessel by repeated strokes of the plunger, till
                    its surface is above the lower extremity of the pipe IG. Now, as the air in the
                    vessel KK has no communication with the external air when the water is above I,
                    it must be condensed more and more, as new quantities of water are injected. It
                    will therefore endeavour to expand itself, and by pressing upon the surface H of
                    the water in the air-vessel, it will drive the water through the tube IG, and
                    make it issue at E in a continued stream, even when the plunger is rising to C.
                    If the pipe GHI were joined to the pipe MMN at P, without the intervention of an
                    air vessel, the stream of water would issue at F only when the plunger was
                    depressed.</p>
                <p>361. The lifting pump, which is only a particular modification of the forcing
                    pump, is represented in fig. 100. The barrel AB is fixed in the immoveable frame
                    KILM, the lower part of which is immersed in the water to be raised. The frame
                    GEQHO consists of two strong iron rods EQ, OH, which move through holes in IK
                    and LM, the upper and lower ends of the pump. To the bottom QH of this frame is
                    fixed an inverted piston, with its bucket and valve uppermost at D. An inclined
                    branch FH, either fixed to the top of the barrel, or moveable by a ball and
                    socket, as represented at F, must be fitted to the barrel so exactly, as to
                    resist the admission both of air and water. The branch FH is furnished with a
                    valve C opening upwards. Let the pump be now plunged in the water to the depth
                    of D. Then if the piston frame be thrust down into the fluid, the piston will
                    descend, and the water by its upward pressure will open the valve at</p>
                <p>D, and gain admission above the piston. When the piston frame is elevated, it
                    will raise the water above D along with it, and, forcing it through the valve,
                    it will be carried off by the spout above H.</p>
                <p>362. An ingenious pump, invented by De la Hire, is represented in fig. 101. It
                    raises water equally quick by the descent as by the ascent of the piston. The
                    pipes B, C, E, F, all communicate with the barrel MD, and have each a valve at
                    their top, viz. at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> S, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> The piston rod LM and plunger K never rise higher than K,
                    nor descend lower than D, KD being the length of the stroke. When the plunger K
                    is raised from D to K, the pressure of the atmosphere forces the water through
                    the valve <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and fills the barrel up to the plunger, in
                    the very same way as in the forcing pump. When the plunger K is depressed to D,
                    it forces the water between K and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> up the pipe E, and
                    through the valve <hi rend="italic">e</hi> into the box G, where it issues at
                    the spout 0. During the descent of the plunger K, the valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> falls, and covers the top of the pipe F; and as the piston rod LM moves
                    in a collar of leather at Μ, and is air-tight, the air above the plunger,
                    between K and Μ, will be rare <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939076"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9076-0098"/>fied, and likewise the air in the pipe CS, which
                    communicates with the rarefied air by the valve S. The pressure of the air,
                    therefore, will raise the water in CS, force it through the valve S, and fill
                    the space above the plunger, expelling the rarefied air through the valve <hi
                    rend="italic">f.</hi> When the piston is raised from D to K, it will force the
                    water through the bent pipe F into the box G, so that the same quantity of water
                    will be discharged at 0 through the pipe F, during the ascent of the piston, as
                    was discharged through the pipe E during the piston’s descent. Above the pipe 0
                    is a close air-vessel P, so that when the water is driven above the spout 0, it
                    compresses the air in the vessel P, and this air acting by its elasticity on the
                    surface of the water, forces it out at 0 in a constant and nearly equal stream.
                    As the effect of the machine depends on a proper proportion between the height 0
                    of the spout above the surface of the well, and the diameter of the barrel, the
                    following table will be of use to the practical mechanic.</p>

                <p>When the proportions in the preceding table are observed, a man of common
                    strength will raise water much higher than he could do with a pump of the common
                    construction.</p>
                <p>363. A very simple pump, which furnishes a continued stream, is represented in
                    fig. 102. It was invented by a Mr Noble, and consists of a working barrel AB,
                    with two pistons C and B, which are moved up and down alternately by the rods
                    fixed to the lever MN. The rod of the piston B passes through the piston C, and
                    the piston C moves upon the rod AB. When the piston rod B is depressed and
                    elevated, it will make the water rise in the barrel A, in the same way as in the
                    sucking pump, whether the valve C be moveable or not. Let us now suppose that
                    the water is raised to A. Then if the piston B is elevated by depressing the
                    extremity N of the lever, the water at A will be raised higher in the barrel,
                    and issue at the spout P; and when the same piston B is depressed by elevating
                    the end N of the lever, the piston C is evidently raised, and the water above it
                    will be expelled at P. This pump, therefore, will give a continued stream, for
                    as the pistons ascend and descend alternately, one of them must always be
                    forcing the water out at P. The pistons are elevated and depressed by means of
                    toothed arches, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> working
                    in the teeth of a rack, at the extremities <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> of the
                    piston rod.</p>
                <p>364. The pump invented by Mr Buchanan is shewn in fig. 103. In the vertical
                    section DGA, A is the suction barrel, D the working barrel, E the piston, G the
                    spout, B the inner valve, and C the outer valve. These valves are of the kind
                    called clack valves, and have their hinges generally of metal. It is easily seen
                    that when the piston E is raised, the water will rise through the suction barrel
                    A into the working barrel D, in the same way as in the sucking pump; and that
                    when the piston E is depressed, it will force the water between it and the valve
                    B, through the valve C, and make it issue at G. The points of difference between
                    this pump and those of the common form, are,—that it discharges the water below
                    the piston, and has its valves lying near each other. Hence the sand or mud
                    which may be in the water, is discharged without injuring the barrel or the
                    piston leathers; and as the valves B, C, may be of any size, they will transmit,
                    without being choked, any rubbish which may rise in the suction barrels. If any
                    obstruction should happen to the valves, they are within the reach of the
                    workman’s hand, and may be cleared without taking the pump to pieces. This
                    simple machine may be quickly converted into a fire-engine, by adding the
                    air-vessel H, which is screwed like a hosepipe, and by fixing in the spout G, a
                    perforated stopple fitted to receive such pipes as are employed in fire-engines.
                    When these additions are made, the water, as in the case of the forcing pump,
                    will be driven into the air vessel H, and repelled through the perforated
                    stopple G, by the elasticity of the included air.</p>
                <p>365. A simple method of working two pumps at once, by means of a balance, is
                    exhibited in fig. 104, where AB is the balance, having a large iron ball at each
                    end, placed in equilibrium on the two spindles C, see fig. 105. The person who
                    works the pump stands on two boards I, I, nailed to two cross pieces fastened to
                    the axis of the machine, and supports himself by a cross bar D&lt;Z joined to
                    the two parts D, E. At the distance of ten inches on each side of the axis are
                    suspended the iron rods M, N, to which the pistons are attached. The workman, by
                    bearing alternately on the right and left foot, puts the balance in motion. The
                    pistons M, N, are alternately elevated and depressed, and the water raised in
                    the barrel of each is driven <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939089"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9089-0099"/>into the pipe HH, in which it is elevated to a
                    height pro portional to the diameter of the valves, and the power of the
                    balance. In order to make the oscillations of the balance equal, and prevent it
                    from acquiring too great a velocity, iron springs F, G, are fixed to the upright
                    posts, which limit the length of its oscillations.</p>
                <p>366. The chain pump is represented in fig. 106. It con sists of a chain MTHG,
                    about 30 feet long, carrying a number of flat pistons M, N, O, P, Q, which are
                    made to revolve in the barrels AB CD and GH, by driving the wheel F. When the
                    flat pistons are at the lower part of the barrel T, they are immersed in the
                    water RR, and as they rise in the barrel GH, they bring up the water along with
                    them into the reservoir MG, from which it is conveyed by the spout S. The teeth
                    of the wheel F are so contrived as to receive one-half of the flat pistons, and
                    let them fold in; and sometimes another wheel like F is fixed at the bottom D.
                    The distance of the pistons from the side of the barrel is about half an meh;
                    but as the machine is generally worked with great velocity, the ascending
                    pistons bring along with them into the reservoir as much water as fills the
                    cavity GH. Sometimes chain pumps are constructed without the barrels ABCD and
                    GH. In this case, the flat pistons are converted into buckets connected with a
                    chain, which dip in the water with their mouths downwards, and convey it to the
                    reservoir. The buckets are moved by hexagonal axles, and the distance between
                    each is nearly equal .to the depth of the buckets. Chain pumps are frequently
                    placed in an inclined position, and in this position they raise the greatest
                    quantity of water when the distance of the flat pistons is equal to their
                    breadth, and when the inclination of the barrels is about 24° 21'.</p>
                <p>367∙ The hair-rope machine, invented by the Sieur Vera, operates on the same
                    principle as the chain-pump. Instead of a chain of pistons moving round the
                    wheel F (fig. 106.), a hair-rope is substituted. The part of the rope at T that
                    is lowest always dips in the water, which, adhering to the rope, is raised along
                    with it. When the rope reaches the top at G and Μ, it passes through two small
                    tubes, which, being fixed in the bottom of the reservoir, prevent the water from
                    returning into the well. Sometimes a common rope is employed, having a number of
                    stuffed cushions fixed to it instead of the flat pistons in the chain-pump.
                    These cushions carry the water along with them through the barrel HG, and
                    deliver it into the reservoir.—For the description of other pumps, see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pümp</hi>; and for pump mills, sec the article <hi

                <p>368. The common fire-engine which discharges water in successive jets is
                    represented in fig. 107, and is only a mo dification of the lifting pump. In the
                    vessel AB, full of water, is immersed the frame DC of a common lifting pump.
                    This frame, and consequently the piston N, is elevated and depressed by means of
                    the levers E, F, and the water which is raised is forced through the pipe G,
                    which may be moved in any direction by means of the elastic leather pipe H, or
                    by a ball and socket screwed on the top of the pump. While the piston N is
                    descending, the stream at G is evidently discontinued, and issues only at each
                    elevation of the piston. The vessel AB is supplied with water by buckets, and
                    the pump is prevented from being choked by the strainer LK, which separates from
                    the water any mud that it may happen to contain.</p>
                <p>369. As this fire-engine. does not afford a continued stream, it is not so useful
                    in case of accidents as when the stream is uninterrupted. An improved engine of
                    this sort is represented in fig. 108, where H, H, are two forcing pumps
                    connected with the large vessel LMM, and wrought by the levers X, X, moving upon
                    Y as a fulcrum. This <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939102"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9102-0100"/>apparatus is plunged and fastened in a vessel I I
                    partly filled with water, and by means of the forcing pumps H, H, the operation
                    of which has already been described, the water is raised through the valves
                    above 11, and driven through the valves A, A into the large vessel LMM, where
                    the included air is condensed. Into this vessel is inserted the tube YY,
                    communicating with the leathern hose which carries off the water. The elasticity
                    of the condensed -air in the vessel LMM pressing upon the surface of the water
                    in that vessel, forces it up through the tube YY into the leathern pipe, from
                    whose extremity it issues with great force and velocity; and as the condensed
                    air is continually pressing upon the water in the air-vessel, the stream will be
                    constant and uniform.</p>
                <p>370. A section of the fire-engine, as improved by Mr Newsham, is represented in
                    fig. 109, where TU and WX are the forcing pumps corresponding with H, H in fig.
                    108,</p>
                <p>YZ the large vessel corresponding with LMM, and <hi rend="italic">er</hi> the
                    tube corresponding with YY. The vessels TU, WX, YZ, the horizontal canals ON,
                    QP, ML, and the vertical canal EE, all communicate with each other by means of
                    four valves O, I, K, P opening upwards, and the vertical pipe is immersed in the
                    water to be raised. When the piston R is raised by means of the double lever <hi
                    rend="italic">x β,</hi> a vacuum would be made in the barrel TU, if the water at
                    R were prevented from rising; but as this barrel communicates with the vessel of
                    water below EF, on the surface of which the pressure of the atmosphere is
                    exerted, the water will rise through EF, force open the valve H, and follow the
                    piston R. By depressing the piston R, however, the water is driven down the
                    barrel, closes the valve H, and rushes through the valve I into the air-vessel
                    YZ. The very same operation is going on with the pump WX, which forces the water
                    into the air-vessel through the valve K. By these means the air-vessel is
                    constantly filling with water, and the included air undergoing continual
                    condensation. The air thus compressed, reacts upon the surface YZ of the water,
                    and forces it through the tube <hi rend="italic">er</hi> to the stop-cock <hi
                    rend="italic">eg,</hi> whence, after turning the cock, the water passes into the
                    tube <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> fixed to a ball and socket, by which it may be
                    discharged in any direction.</p>
                <p>371. The fire-engine has’undergone various alterations and improvements from
                    Bramah, Dickenson, Simpkin, Ra-ventree, Philips, and Furst, an account of whose
                    engines may be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> &amp;c. A
                    very simple and cheap fire-engine has been invented by Mr B. Dearborn, and is
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">American Transactions</hi> for 1794, and in

                <p>372. Mr Whitehurst<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Philosophical Transactions, 177ð·</p></note> was the first who suggested the
                    ingenious idea of raising water by means of its momentum. A machine upon the
                    same principle as Mr Whitehurst’s, but in an improved form, has lately made its
                    appearance in France, and excited considerable attention both on the Continent
                    and in this country. Whatever credit, therefore, has been given to the inventor
                    of the hydraulic ram, justly belongs to our countrymen Mr WTňtehurst, and
                    Montgolfier is entitled to nothing more than the merit of an improver.</p>
                <p>373. Mr Whitehurst’s machine, which was actually erected at Oulton in Cheshire,
                    is represented in fig. 110, where</p>
                <p>AM is the original reservoir, having its surface in the same horizontal line with
                    the bottom of the reservoir BN. The diameter of the main pipe AE is one inch and
                    a half, and its length about 200 yards; and the branch pipe EF is of such a size
                    that the height of the surface Μ of the reservoir is nearly 16 feet above the
                    cock F. In the valve box D is placed the valve <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and
                    into the air-vessel C are inserted the extremities <hi rend="italic">m,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> of the main pipe, bent downwards to prevent the air from
                    being driven out when the water is forced into it. Now as the cock F is 16 feet
                    below the reservoir AM, the water will issue from F with a velocity <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939115" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9115-0101"/> of nearly 30 feet
                    per second. As soon as the cock F therefore is opened, a column of water 200
                    yards long is put in motion, and though the aperture of the cock F be small,
                    this column must have a very considerable momentum. *Let the cock F be now
                    suddenly stopped, and the water will rush through the valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> into the air-vessel C, and condense the included air. This condensation
                    must take place every time the cock is shut, and the imprisoned air being in a
                    state of high compression, will react upon the water in the air-vessel, and
                    raise it into the reservoir BN.</p>
                <p>374. A section of the hydraulic ram of Montgolfier is exhibited in fig. Ill,
                    where X is the reservoir, XA the height of the fall, and AB the horizontal canal
                    which conveys the water to the engine MFKR. C and D are two valves, and ME a
                    pipe reaching within a very little of the bottom E. Let us now suppose that
                    water is permitted to descend from the reservoir. It will evidently rush along
                    AB, and out at HH, which can be shut by the valves C or D. When the passage HH
                    is shut by the rise of the valve C, the water is suddenly checked, and, unable
                    to escape at HH, it will rush forwards to Z and raise the valves at E. A portion
                    of water being thus admitted into the vessel FF, the impulse of the column of
                    fluid is spent, the valves D and C fall, and the water issues at HH as before;
                    when its motion is again checked, and the same operation repeated which has now
                    been described. Whenever, therefore, the valve C closes, a portion of water will
                    force its way into the vessel FF, and condense the air which it contains, for
                    the included air has no communication with the atmosphere after the bottom of
                    the pipe ME is beneath the surface of the injected water. This condensed air
                    will consequently react upon the surface of the water, and raise it in the pipe
                    ME to an altitude proportioned to the elasticity of the included air. An
                    enlarged view of the valves C, D, and their seat, is shewn in the annexed figure
                    (fig. 112). With a fall of water in which XA is <hi rend="italic">five</hi>
                    feet, the pipe AB <hi rend="italic">six</hi> inches in diameter, and 14 feet
                    long, a good proportioned ram will raise water 100 feet high. When wrought with
                    a power of 70 cubic feet of water in the minute, it will raise 2∣ cubic feet of
                    water per minute to the height of 100 feet. One of these machines is stated to
                    have raised 100 hogsheads of water in 24 hours to the height of 134 feet, and a
                    fall of only <hi rend="italic">4į</hi> feet. From this description it w ill be
                    seen, that the only difference between the engines .of Montgolfier and
                    Whitehurst is, that the one requires a person to turn the cock, while the other
                    has the advantage of acting spontaneously. Montgolfier<note anchored="true"

                <p>' 375. The screw-engine invented by Archimedes is represented in fig. 113, where
                    AB is a cylinder with a flexible pipe, CEHOGF, wrapped round its circumference
                    like a screw. The cylinder is inclined to the horizon, and supported at one
                    extremity by the bent pillar IR, while its other extremity, furnished with a
                    pivot, is immersed in the water. When, by means of the handle K, the cylinder is
                    made to revolve upon its axis, the water which enters the lower orifice of the
                    flexible pipe is raised to the top, and discharged at D. On some occasions, when
                    the water to be raised moves with a considerable velocity, the engine is put in
                    motion by a number of floatboards fixed at L, and impelled by the current; and
                    if the water is to be raised to a great height, another cylinder is immersed in
                    the vessel D, which receives the water from the first cylinder, and is driven by
                    a pinion fixed at I. In this way, by having a succession of screw-engines, and a
                    succession of reservoirs, water may be raised to any altitude. An engine of this
                    kind is described in Ferguson’s Lectures, vol. ii. p. 113.</p>
                <p>376. In order to explain the reason why the water rises in the spiral tube, let
                    AB be a section of the engine, BCcřDE the spiral tube, BF a horizontal line or
                    the surface of the stagnant water which is to be raised, and ABF the angle which
                    the axis of the cylinder makes with the horizon, Then, the water which enters
                    the extremity B of the spiral tube will descend to C, .and remain there as long
                    as the cylinder is at rest. But if a motion of rota tion be communicated to the
                    .cylinder, so that the lowest part C of the spiral BCD moves towards B, and the
                    points <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> D, E towards C, and become successively the
                    lowest parts of the spiral, the water must occupy successively the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939128" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9128-0102"/> points <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> D, E, and therefore rise in the tube; or, which is the
                    same thing, when the point C moves to <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the point <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> will be at C; and as the water at C cannot rise along with
                    the point C to c, on account of the inclination of Cc to the horizon, it must
                    occupy the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the spiral, when C has moved to <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>; that is, the water has a tendency to occupy the lower
                    parts of the spiral, and the rotatory motion withdraws this part of the spiral
                    from the water, and causes it to ascend to the top of the tube. By wrapping a
                    cord round a cylinder, and inclining it to the horizon, so that the angle ABC
                    may be greater than the angle ABF, and then making it revolve upon its axis, the
                    preceding remarks will be clearly illustrated.—If the direction of the spiral BC
                    should be horizontal, that is, if it should coincide with the line BF, the water
                    will have no tendency to move towards C, and therefore cannot be raised in the
                    tube. For a similar reason, it will not rise when the point C is above the
                    horizontal line BF. Consequently, in the construction of this engine, the angle
                    ABC, which the spiral forms with the side of the cylinder, must always be
                    greater than the angle ABF, at which the cylinder is inclined to the horizon. In
                    practice, the angle of inclination ABF should generally be about 50°, and the
                    angle ABC about 65°.</p>
                <p>377. The screw of Archimedes is now generally constructed as shewn in the annexed
                    figure, where AB is the axis of the screw, having a flat plate of wood or thin
                    iron coiled, as it were, round the axis, like a spiral, or the threads of a
                    screw. The plane of this plate is perpendicular to the surface of the
                    cylindrical axis AB, but is inclined to the direction of the axis at an angle
                    which must always be greater than the angle which the axis AB forms with the
                    horizon when in use. This spiral plate, which is nothing more than a wooden
                    screw with a very deep and narrow thread, is fixed in a cylindrical box, CDEF,
                    so as to form a spiral groove, as it were running up the tube from B to A, which
                    is exactly the same thing as if a pipe of lead or leather had been wrapped round
                    the cylindrical axis, as in fig. 115. If the outer case CD EF is fixed so that
                    the screw revolves within it, the engine is called a <hi rend="italic">water
                    screw-engine.</hi> In the common screw-engine, Mr Eytelwein has shewn that the
                    screw should be placed in such a manner that only <hi rend="italic"
                    >one-half</hi> of a convolution may be filled at each revplution. When this
                    condition, however, cannot be fulfilled, from the height of the water being
                    variable, he gives a preference to the <hi rend="italic">water</hi> screw,
                    -notwithstanding that in this case one-third of the water generally runs back,
                    and the screw is apt to become clogged by impurities or weeds, t- 378. In a
                    (screw-engine erected at the Hurlet Alum Works, for raising the alum liquor, the
                    length of the screw is 127 feet, its inclination to the horizon 37° 36′; the
                    height to which it raises the liquor 76 feet 9 inches, the octagonal axis of the
                    screw 8 inches in diameter, the diameter of the spiral 22 inches, the thickness
                    of the covering 2 inches, the distance of the threads 9 inches, the number of
                    the threads 168, the thickness of the spiral 2 inches, the width and depth of
                    the spiral tube 7 inches each. The screw is sustained upon five sets of pivots
                    or rollers, each set consisting of two rollers. The engine is driven by a
                    waterwheel, which performs <hi rend="italic">one</hi> revolution while the screw
                    performs <hi rend="italic">two.</hi> The quantity of liquor raised is 70 wine
                    gallons; and as its specific gravity is 1.065, the quantity discharged in an
                    hour is 17 tons. The screw is built wholly of wood, as the alum liquor acts upon
                    iron.</p>

                    Wheel.</hi></p>
                <p>380. The Persian wheel is an engine which raises water to a height equal to its
                    diameter. It is shewn in fig. 116, where AB is the wheel driven by the stream
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> acting upon floatboards fixed on one side of its rim. A
                    number of buckets, <hi rend="italic">n, o,p,q,</hi> are disposed on the opposite
                    side of the rim, and suspended by strong pins. When the wheel is in motion, the
                    descending buckets <hi rend="italic">q, q</hi> immerge into the stream, and
                    ascend full of water till they reach the top at <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> where
                    they strike against the extremity of the fixed reservoir S, and being overset,
                    discharge their contents into that reservoir. As soon as the bucket quits the
                    reservoir, it resumes its perpendicular position by its own weight and descends
                    as before. On each bucket is fixed a spring <hi rend="italic">t, t,</hi> which
                    moves over the top of the bar fastened to the reservoir S. By this means the
                    bottom of the bucket is raised above the level of its mouth, and its contents
                    completely discharged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> 381. On some occasions the Persian wheel is made to

                    only to the height of its axle. In this case, instead of buckets, its spokes, C,
                    C, C, C, &amp;c., are made ota spiral form, and hollow within, so that their
                    inner extremities all terminate in the box N on the axle, and their outer
                    extremities in the circumference of the wheel. When the rim AB, therefore, is
                    immersed in the stream, the water runs into the tubes I, I, &amp;c., rises in
                    the spiral spokes C, C, C, &amp;c., and is discharged from the orifices within
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> into the reservoir N, from which it may be conveyed in
                    pipes.</p>

                    Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>382. This machine is a kind of pump invented and erected by H. Andreas Wirtz, an
                    ingenious tin-plate worker in Zurich, and operates on a principle different from
                    all other hylraulic engines. The following description of it, written by Dr
                    Robison, is transferred to this part of the work for the sake of uniformity.</p>
                <p>383. Fig. 117∙ is a sketch of the section of the machine, as it was first erected
                    by Wirtz at a dye-house in Limmat, in the suburos or vicinity of Zurich. It
                    consists of a hollow cylinder, like a very large grindstone, turning on a
                    horizontal axis, and partly plunged in a cistern of water. The axis is hollow at
                    one end, and communicates with a perpendicular pipe CBZ, part of which is hid by
                    the cylinder. This cylinder or drum is formed into a spiral canal by a plate
                    coiled up within it like the main-spring of a watch in its box; only the spires
                    are at a distance from each other, so as to form a conduit for the water of
                    uniform width. This spiral partition is well oined to the two ends of the
                    cylinder, and no water escapes between them. The outermost turn of the spiral
                    begins to widen about three-fourths of a circumference from the end. and this
                    gradual enlargement continues from Q to S nearly a semicircle: this part may be
                    called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Horn.</hi> It then widens suddenly, forming a
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Scoop</hi> or shovel SS'. The cylinder is supported so as
                    to dip several inches into the water, whose surface is represented by VV'.</p>
                <p>384. When this cylinder is turned round its axis in the direction ABEO, as
                    expressed by the two darts, the scoop SS' dips at V ’ and takes up a certain
                    quantity of water before it immerges again at V. This quantity is sufficient to
                    fill the taper part SQ,, which we have called the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Horn</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> and this is nearly equal in capacity to
                    the outermost uniform spiral round.</p>
                <p>385. After the scoop has emerged, the water passes along the spiral by the motion
                    of it round the axis, and drives the air before it into the rising-pipe, where
                    it escapes.—In the mean time, air comes in at the mouth of the scoop; and when
                    the scoop again dips into the water, it again takes in a similar quantity. Thus
                    there is now a part filled with water and a part filled with air. Continuing
                    this motion, we shall receive a second round of water and another of air. The
                    water in any turn of the spiral will have its two ends on a level: and the air
                    between the successive columns of water will be in its natural state; for since
                    the passage into the rising pipe or <hi rend="smallcaps">Main</hi> is open,
                    there is nothing co force the water and air into any other position. But since
                    the spires gradually diminish in their length, it is plain that the column of
                    water will gradually occupy more and more of the circumference of each. At last
                    it will occupy a complete turn of some spiral that is near the centre; and when
                    sent farther in, by the continuance of the motion, some of it will run back over
                    the top of the succeeding spiral. Thus it will run over at K 4 into the
                    right-hand side of the third spiral. Therefore it will push the water of this
                    spire backwards. and raise its other end, so that it also will run over
                    backwards <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the next turn be completed. And this
                    change of disposition will at last reach the first or outermost spiral, and some
                    water will run over into the horn and scoop, and finally into the cistern.</p>
                <p>386. But as soon as water gets into the rising pipe, and rises a little in it, it
                    stops the escape of the air when the next scoop of water is taken in. Here are
                    now two columns of water acting against each other by hydrostatic pressure and
                    the intervening column of air. They must compress the air between them, and the
                    water and aircolumns will now be unequal. This will have a general tendency to
                    keep the whole water back, and cause it to be higher on the left or rising side
                    of each spire than on the right descending side. The excess of height will be
                    just such as produces the compression of the air between that and the preceding
                    column of water. This will go on increasing as the water mounts in the rising
                    pipe; for the air next to the rising pipe is compressed at its inner end with
                    the weight of the whole column in the main. It must be as much compressed at its
                    outer end. This must be done by the water column without it; and thia column
                    exerts this pressure partly by reason that <hi rend="italic">its</hi> outer end
                    is higher than its inner end, and partly by the transmission of the pressure on
                    its outer end by air, which is similarly compressed from without. And thus it
                    will happen that each column of water, being higher at its outer than at its
                    inner end, compresses the air on the water column beyond or within it, which
                    transmits this pressure to the air beyond it, adding to it the pressure arising
                    from its own want of level at the ends. Therefore, the greatest compression,
                    viz. that of the air next the main, is produced by <hi rend="italic">the sum of
                    all the transmitted pressures</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and these are the sum
                    of all the differences between the elevations of the inner ends of the water
                    columns above their outer ends: and the height to which the water will rise in
                    the main will be just equal to th⅛ sum.</p>
                <p>387∙ Draw the horizontal lines K'K 1, K’K 2, K ’K 3, &amp;c. and <hi
                    rend="italic">mn, mn, mn,</hi> &amp;c. Suppose the left-hand spaces to be filled
                    with water, and the right-hand spaces to be filled with air. There is a certain
                    gradation of compression which will keep things in this position. The spaces
                    evidently decrease in arithmetical progression; so do the hydrostatic heights
                    and pressures of the water columns. If, therefore, the air be dense in the same
                    progression, all will be in hydrostatical equilibrium. Now this is evidently
                    producible by the mere motion of the machine; for since the density and
                    compression in each air column is supposed inversely as the bulk of the column,
                    the absolute quantity of air is the same in all; therefore the column first
                    taken in will pass gradually inwaras, and the increasing compression will cause
                    it to occupy precisely the whole right-hand side <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939154" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9154-0104"/>of every spire. The gradual
                    diminution of the water columns will be produced during the motion by the water
                    running over backwards at the top, from spire to spire, and at last coming out
                    by the scoop.</p>
                <p>388. It is evident that this disposition of the air and water will raise the
                    water to the greatest height, because the hydrostatic height of each water
                    column is the greatest possible, viz. tlje diameter of the spire. This
                    disposition may be obtained in the following manner: Take CL to CB as the
                    density of the external air to its density in the last column next the rising
                    pipe or main; that is, make CL to CB as 33 feet (the height of the column of
                    water which balances the atmosphere), to the sum of 33 feet and the height of
                    the rising pipe. Then divide BL into such a number of turns, that the sum of
                    their diameters shall be equal to the height of the main; then bring a pipe
                    straight from L to the centre C. The reason of all this is very evident.</p>
                <p>389. But when the main is very high, this construction will require a very great
                    diameter of the drum, or many turns of a very narrow pipe. In such cases it will
                    be much better to make the spiral in the form of a cork-screw, as in fig. 118.
                    instead of this flat form like a watch-spring. The pipe which forms the spiral
                    may be lapped round the frustum of a cone, whose greatest diameter is to the
                    least (which is next to the rising pipe) in the same proportion that we assigned
                    to CB and CL. By this construction the water will stand in every round so as to
                    have its upper and lower surfaces tangents to the top and bottom of the spiral,
                    and the water columns will occupy the whole ascending side of the machine, while
                    the air occupies the descending side.</p>
                <p>390. This form is vastly preferable to the flat one: it will allow us to employ
                    many turns of a large pipe, and therefore produce a great elevation of a large
                    quantity of water.</p>
                <p>The same thing will be still better done by lapping the j)ipe on a cylinder, and
                    making it taper to the end, in such a proportion that the contents of each round
                    may be the ;ame as when it is lapped round the cone. It will raise the water to
                    a greater height (but with an increase of the impelling power) by the same
                    number of turns, because the vertical or pressing height of each column is
                    greater.</p>
                <p>Nay, the same thing may be done in a more simple manner, by lapping a pipe of
                    uniform bore round a cylinder. But this will require more turns, because the
                    water columns will have less differences between the heights of their two ends.
                    It requires a very minute investigation to show the progress of the columns of
                    air and water in this construction, and the various changes of their
                    arrangement, before one is attained which will continue during the working of
                    the machine.</p>
                <p>391. We have chosen for the description of the machine that construction which
                    made its principle and manner of working most evident, namely, which contained
                    the same material quantity of air in each turn of the spiral, more and more
                    compressed as it approaches to the rising pipe. We should otherwise have been
                    obliged to investigate in great detail the gradual progress of the water, and
                    the frequent changes of its arrangement, before we could see that one
                    arrangement would be produced which would remain constant during the working of
                    the machine. But this is not the best construction. We see that, in order to
                    raise water to the height of a column of 34 feet, which balances the atmosphere,
                    the air in the last spire is compressed into half its bulk; and the quantity of
                    water delivered into the main at each turn is but half of what was received into
                    the first spire, the rest flowing back from spire to spire, and being discharged
                    at the spout.</p>
                <p>392. But it may be constructed so as that the quantity of water in each spire may
                    be the same that was received into the first; by which means a greater quantity
                    (double in the instance now given) will be delivered into the main, and raised
                    to the same height by very nearly the same force This may be done by another
                    proportion of the ca pacity of the spires, whether by a change of their caliber
                    or of their diameters. Suppose the bore to be the same, the diameter must be
                    made such that the constant column of water, and the column of air, compressed
                    to the proper degree, may occupy the whole circumference. Let A be the column of
                    water which balances the atmosphere, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the height to
                    which the water is to be raised. Let A be to A + <hi rend="italic">h</hi> as 1
                    to <hi rend="italic">m.</hi></p>
                <p>393. It is plain that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> will represent the density of the
                    air in the last spire, if its natural density be 1, because it is pressed by the
                    column A + Ä, while the common air is pressed by A. Let 1 represent the constant
                    water column, and therefore nearly equal to the air column in the first spire.
                    The whole circumference of the last spire must be 1 + -, in order to hold the
                    water 1, and the air compressed <hi rend="italic">m</hi></p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1 A</hi> into the space — or -—— <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> A + <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi></p>
                <p>394. The circumference of the first spire is 1 + 1 or 2. Let D and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> be the diameters of the first and last spires; we have 2:1
                    + — = D: <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> or 2 <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">rn</hi> + 1 = D.∙&lt;Z. <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore, if a pipe of uniform bore be lapped round a cone, of which D and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> are the end diameters, the spirals will be very nearly such
                    as will answer the purpose. It will not be quite exact, for the intermediate
                    spirals will be somewhat too large. The conoidal frustum should be formed by the
                    revolution of a curve of the logarithmic kind. But the error is very
                    trifling.</p>
                <p>With such a spiral, the full quantity of water which was confined in the first
                    spiral will find room in the last, and will be sent into the main at every turn.
                    This is a very great advantage, especially when the water is to be much raised.
                    The saving of power by this change of construction is always in proportion to
                    the greatest compression of the air.</p>
                <p>The great difficulty in the construction of any of these forms is in determining
                    the form and position of the horn and the scoop; and on this greatly depends the
                    performance of the machine. The following instructions will make it pretty
                    easy.</p>
                <p>395. Let ABEO (fig. 119.) represent the first or outermost round of the spiral,
                    of which the axis is C. Suppose it immerged up to the axis in the water VV, we
                    have seen that the machine is most effective when the surfaces KB and Ο <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> of the water columns are distant the whole diameter BO of
                    the spiral. Therefore, let the pipe be first supposed of equal calibre to the
                    very mouth E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which we suppose to be just about to dip
                    into the water. The surface<pb break="no" facs="nls:192939167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9167-0105"/> Ο <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is kept there, in
                    opposition to the pressure of the water column BAO, by the compressed air
                    contained in the quadrant OE, and in the quadrant which lies behind EB. And this
                    compression is supported by the columns behind, between this spire and the
                    rising pipe. But the air in the outermost quadrant EB is in its natural state,
                    communicating as yet with the external air. When, however, the mouth E s has
                    come round to A, it will not have the water standing in it in the same manner,
                    leaving the half space BEO filled with compressed air; for it took in and
                    confined only what filled the quadrant BE. It is plain, therefore, that the
                    quadrant BE must be so shaped as to take in and confine a much greater quantity
                    of air; so that when it has come to A, the space BEO may contain air
                    sufficiently dense to support the column AO. But this is not enough: for when
                    the wide mouth, now at A α, rises up to the top, the surface of the water in it
                    rises also, because the part <hi rend="italic">Ao</hi> 0 <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is more capacious than the cylindric part OE <hi rend="italic">e o</hi>
                    which succeeds it, and which cannot contain all the water that it does. Since,
                    then, the water in the spire rises above A, it will press the water back from Ο
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to some other position <hi rend="italic">m' n',</hi>
                    and the pressing height of the water-column will be diminished by this rising on
                    the other side of 0. In short, the horn must begin to widen, not from B but from
                    A, and must occupy the whole semicircle ABE; and its capacity must be to the
                    capacity of the opposite cylindrical side as the sum of BO, and the height of a
                    column of water whiph balances the atmosphere to the height of that column. For
                    then the air which filled it, when of the common density, will fill the uniform
                    side BEO, when compressed so as to balance the vertical column BO. But even this
                    is not enough; for it has not taken in enough of water. When it dipped into the
                    cistern at E, it çarried air down with it, and the pressure of the water in the
                    cistern caused the water to rise into it a little way; and some water must have
                    come over at B from the other side, which was drawing narrower. Therefore, when
                    the horn is in the position EOA, it is not full of water. Therefore, when it
                    comes into the situation OAB, it cannot be full nor balance the air on the
                    opposite side. Some will therefore come out at 0, and rise up through the water.
                    The horn must, therefore, 1st, Extend at least from 0 to B, or occupy half the
                    circumference; and, 2dly, It must contain at least twice as much water as would
                    fill the side BEO. It will do little harm though it be much larger; because the
                    surplus of air which it takes ⅛ at E will be discharged, as the end E <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> of the horn rises from 0 to B, and it will lcave the
                    precise quantity that is wanted. The overplus water will be discharged as the
                    horn comes round to dip again into the cistern. It is possible, but requires a
                    discussion too intricate for this place, to make it of such a size and shape,
                    that while the mouth moves from E to B, passing through 0 and A, the suface of
                    the water in it shall advance from E s to 0 <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and be
                    exactly at 0 when the beginning or narrow end of the horn arrives there.</p>
                <p>400. W e must also secure the proper quantity of water. V ’ hen the machine is so
                    much immersed as to be up to the axis in water, the capacity which thus secures
                    the proper quantity of air will also take in the proper quantity of water. But
                    it may be erected so as that the spirals shall not even reach the water. In this
                    case it will answer our purpose if we join to the end of the horn a scoop or
                    shovel QRSB (fig. 120.), which is so formed as to take in at least as much water
                    as will fill the ho⅝n. This is all that is wanted in the beginning of the motion
                    along the spiral, and more than is necessary when the water has advanced to the
                    succeeding spire; but the overplus is discharged in the way we have mentioned.
                    At the same time, it is needless to load the machine with more water than is
                    necessary, merely to throw it out again. We think that if the horn occupies
                    fully more than one-half of the circumference, and contains as much as will fill
                    the whole round, and if the scoop lifts as much as will certainly fill the horn,
                    it will do very well.</p>
                <p>The scoop must be very open on the side next the axis, that it may not confine
                    the air as soon as it enters the water. This would hinder it from receiving
                    water enough.</p>
                <p>401. The following dimensions of a machine erected at Florence, and whose
                    performance corresponded extremely well with the theory, may serve as an
                    example.</p>
                <p>The spiral is formed on a cylinder of ten feet diameter, and the diameter of the
                    pipe is six inches. The smaller end of the horn is of the same diameter; it
                    occupies three-fourths of the circumference, and is 7∙j⅞ths inches wide at the
                    outer end. Here it joins the scoop, which lifts as much water as fills the horn,
                    which contains 4340 Swedish cubic inches, each = 1.577 English. The machine
                    makes six turns in a minute, and raises 1354 pounds of water, or 22 cubic feet,
                    10 feet high in a minute.</p>
                <p>402. The above account will, we hope, sufficiently explain the manner in which
                    this singular hydraulic machine produces its cffect. When every thing is
                    executed by the maxims which we have deduced from its principles, we are
                    confident that its performance will correspond to the theory; and we have the
                    Florentine machine as ft proof of this. It raises more than ten-elevenths of
                    what the theory promises, and it <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is not perfect.
                    The spiral is of equal caliber, and is formed on a cylinder. The friction is so
                    inconsiderable in this machine, that it need not be minded ♯ but the great
                    excellency is, that whatever imperfection there may be in the arrangement of the
                    air and water columns, this only affects the elegance of the execution, causing
                    the water to make a few more turns in the spiral before it can mount to the
                    height required; but wastes no qiower, because the power employed is always in
                    proportion to the sum of the vertical columns of water in thç rising side of the
                    machine; and the height to which the water is raised by it is in the very same
                    proportion. It should be made to move -very slow, that the water be not always
                    dragged up by the pipes, which would cause more to run over from each column,
                    and diminish the pressure of the remainder.</p>
                <p>403. If the rising-pipe be made wide, and thus room be made for the air to escape
                    freely up through the water, it will rise to the height assigned; but if it be
                    narrow, so that the air cannot get up, it rises almost as slow as the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939180" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9180-0106"/> water, and by
                    this circumstance the water is raised to a much greater height mixed with air,
                    and this with hardly any more power. It is in this way that we can account for
                    the great performance of the Florentine machine, which is almost triple of what
                    a man can do with the finest pump that ever was made: indeed, the performance is
                    so great, that one is apt to suspect some inaccuracy in the accounts. The entry
                    into the rising-pipe should be no wider than the last part of the spiral; and it
                    would be advisable to divide it into four channels by a thin partition, and then
                    to make the rising-pipe very wide, and to put into it a number of slender rods,
                    which would divide it into slender channels that would completely entangle the
                    air among the water. This will greatly increase the height of the heterogeneous
                    column. It is surprising that a machine that is so very promising should have
                    attracted so little notice. We do not know of any being erected out of
                    Switzerland, except at Florence in 1778. The account of its performance was in
                    consequence of a very public trial in 1779, and honourable declaration of its
                    merit, by Sig. Lorenzo Ginori, who erected another, which fully equalled it. It
                    is shortly mentioned by Professor Sulzer of Berlin, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sammlungen</hi><hi rend="italic">Vermischlen Schristen</hi> for 1754. A
                    description of it is published by the Philosophical Society at Zurich in 1766,
                    and in the descriptions published by the Society in London for the encouragement
                    of Arts in 1776. The celebrated Daniel Bernoulli has published a very accurate
                    theory of it in the Petersburgh Commentaries for 1772, and the machines at
                    Florence were erected according to his instructions. Baron Alstromer in Sweden
                    caused a glass model of it to be made, to exhibit the internal motions for the
                    instruction of artists, and also ordered an operative engine to be erected; but
                    we have not seen any account of its performance. It is a very intricate machine
                    in its principles; and an ignorant engineer, nay the most intelligent, may erect
                    one which shall hardly do any thing; and yet by a very trifling change, may
                    become very powerful. We presume that failures of this kind have turned the
                    attention of engineers from it; but we are persuaded that it may be made very
                    effective, and we are certain that it must be very durable. Fig. 121. is a

                    the rising-pipe, like the key of a cock. This mouth has a plate <hi

                <p>CHAPTER IV. ON MACHINES IN WHICH WATER IS THE CHIEF AGENT.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">On the Water-Blowing
                    Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>404. The water blowing machine, or <hi rend="italic">trombe,</hi> as the French
                    call it, consists of a reservoir of water AB, fig. 122, into the bottom of which
                    the bent leaden pipe BCH is inserted; of a condensing vessel DE, into whose top
                    the lower extremity H of the pipe is fixed, and of a pedestal P resting on the
                    bottom of this vessel. When the water from the reservoir AB is descending
                    through the part CH of the pipe, it is in contact with the external air by means
                    of the orifices or tubes <hi rend="italic">m, n, o, p</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and by the principle of the lateral communi cation of motion in fluids,
                    the air is dragged along with the water. This combination of air and water
                    issuing from the aperture H, and impinging upon the surface of the stone
                    pedestal P, is dispersed in various directions. The air being thus separated
                    from the water, ascends into the upper part of the vessel, and rushes through
                    the opening F, whence it is conveyed by the pipe FG to the fire at G, while the
                    water falls to the lower part of the vessel, and is discharged by the openings
                    M, N. That the greatest quantity of air may be driven into the vessel DE, the
                    water should begin to fall at C with the least possible velocity; and the height
                    of the lowest tubes above the extremity H of the pipe should be three-elevenths
                    of the length of the vertical tube CH, in order that the air may move in the
                    pipe FG with sufficient velocity.</p>
                <p>405. A different form of the machine is shewn in fig. 123, where AB is the pipe
                    of a conical form, and where the water which flows down AB is supplied with air
                    by the pipes CB, DB.</p>
                <p>406. In the machines of this kind used at Alvar in Dauphiny, the diameter of the
                    conical pipe AB is 12 inches at A, and 5 at B, and only four tubes are used for
                    admitting the air. This machine gives a powerful as well as an equal and
                    continued blast, but the air is considered to be too moist and too cold.</p>
                <p>407. Fabri and Dietrich imagined that the wind is produced by the decomposition
                    of the water, or its transformation into gas, in consequence of the agitation
                    and percussion of its parts. But Μ. Venturi, to whom we owe the first
                    philosophical account of this machine, has shewn that this opinion is erroneous,
                    and that the wind is supplied from the atmosphere, for no wind was generated
                    when the lateral openings <hi rend="italic">m, n, o, p</hi> were shut. The
                    principal object, therefore, in the construction of water-blowing machines, is
                    to combine as much air as possible with the descending current. For this purpose
                    the water is often made to pass through a kind of cullender placed in the open
                    air, and perforated with a number of small triangular orifices. Through these
                    apertures the water descends in many small streams; and by exposing a greater
                    surface to the amosphere, it carries along with it an immense quantity of air.
                    The water is then conveyed to the pedestal P, fig. 122, by a pipe CH opened and
                    enlarged at C, so as to be considerably wider than the end of the tube which
                    holds the cullender.</p>
                <p>408. It has been generally supposed that the waterfall should be very high; but
                    Dr Lewis has shewn, by a variety of experiments, that a fall of four or five
                    feet is sufficient, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939193"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9193-0107"/>and that when the height is greater than this, two
                    or more blowing machines may be erected, by conducting the water from which the
                    air is extricated, into another reservoir, from which it again descends, and
                    generates air as formerly. In order that the air which is necessarily loaded
                    with moisture, may arrive at the furnace in as dry a state as possible, the
                    condensing vessel DE should be made as high as circumstances will permit; and in
                    order to determine the strength of the blast, it should be furnished with a gage
                    <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> filled with water.</p>
                <p>409. The rain wind is produced in the same way as the blast of air in
                    water-blowing machines. When the drops of rain impinge upon the surface of the
                    sea, the air which they drag along with them often produces a heavy squall,
                    which is sufficiently strong to carry away the mast of a ship. The same
                    phenomenon happens at land, when the clouds empty themselves in alternate
                    showers. In this case, the wind proceeds from that quarter of the horizon where
                    the shower is falling. The common method of accounting for the origin of the
                    winds by local rarefaction of the air appears pregnant with insuperable
                    difficulties; and there is reason to think that these agitations in our
                    atmosphere ought rather to be referred to the principle which we have now been
                    considering. The <hi rend="italic">ventaroli</hi> which issue from volcanic
                    mountains, arise from the air which is carried down the hollows by the falls of
                    water. At the foot of the cascades which fall from the glazier of Roche Melon,
                    Venturi found the force of the wind arising from the air dragged down by the
                    water to be so strong, that it could scarcely be withstood. For far,ther
                    information on this subject, the reader is referred to Lewis’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>410. The machine invented by Mr Bramah, depends ,upon the principle, that any
                    pressure exerted upon a fluid mass is propagated equally in every direction. It
                    is represented in fig. 124, where L is a strong metallic cylinder, furnished
                    with a piston A, perfectly water-tight at the neck N. Into the side of this
                    cylinder is inserted the end of the tube I, the interior orifice of which is
                    closed by the valve at I. The other extremity of the tube communicates with the
                    forcing pump DCH, by which water or other fluids may be driven into the cylinder
                    L. The whole rests on a solid mass of masonry EF, or a firmly fixed wooden
                    frame. A valve K, wrought by a screw, allows the water to return to G from the
                    pipe Μ. The body to be crushed, broken, or pressed, is placed above the
                    horizontal board B. Then, if any pressure is exerted on the surface of the water
                    in the cylinder H, by means of the lever D, this pressure will be propagated to
                    the cylinder L, and exert a certain force upon the piston A, varying with the
                    respective areas of the sections of each cylinder. If the diameter of the
                    cylinder H, is equal to the diameter of the cylinder L, and if a force of 10
                    pounds is exerted at the handle D, then the piston A will be elevated with a
                    force of 10 pounds; if the diameter of H be one-half that of L, the piston A
                    will be raised with a force of 40 pounds, because the area of the one piston is
                    four times the area of the other. Or, in general, if D be the diameter of the
                    cylinder L, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> that of the cylinder H, and F the force
                    ex-</p>
                <p>F × D <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> erted at the lever D, we shall have <hi

                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ which is the force exerted upon the piston B. Thus, if
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = 2 inches, D — 24 inches, and F = 10 pounds, then F×D
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 10 × 24 × 24</p>
                <p>= = 1440 pounds, the force with <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi> 2 × 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> &lt; which the piston
                    B is elevated. Now, as this force increases as <hi rend="italic">&lt;P</hi>
                    diminishes, or as F and D <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> increase, there is no
                    limit to the power of the engine; for the diameter of the cylinder L may be made
                    of any size, and that of the cylinder H exceedingly small, while the power may
                    be still farther augmented by lengthening the lever D. The same effects may be
                    produced by injecting air into the pipe I by means of a large globe fixed at its
                    extremity. Upon the same principles the power and motion of one machine may be
                    communicated to another; for we have only to connect the two machines by means
                    of a pipe filled with water, inserted at each extremity into a cylinder
                    furnished with a piston. By this means the power which depresses one of the
                    pistons will be transferred along the connecting pipe, and will elevate the
                    other piston. In the same way water may be raised out of wells of any depth, and
                    at any distance from the place where the power is applied; but we must refer the

                <p>411. This machine, invented by Μ. Mannoury Dectot of Paris, consists of a
                    cylindrical trough of tin-plate, nearly as high as it is broad, and having a
                    hole in the centre of its bottom. It is fixed to a vertical axis of iron, which
                    passes through the middle of the hole in the bottom, a vacant space being left
                    all around to permit the water to escape. The axis turns with the trough upon a
                    pivot, and is fixed above to a collar.</p>
                <p>A drum of tin-plate, close above and below, is fixed upon the axis of the trough,
                    and placed within the trough, so as to be concentric with it, and to leave only
                    between the outer circumference of the drum and the inner circumference of the
                    trough, an annular space not exceeding lį-inches. This annular space
                    communicates with a space less than 1 <hi rend="italic">ļ-</hi> inches, left
                    between the bottom of the drum and the bottom of the trough, and divided into
                    compartments by diaphragms fixed upon the bottom of the trough, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939206" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9206-0108"/>and proceeding from the
                    circumference to the central hole in the bottom of the trough.</p>
                <p>The water comes from a reservoir above by one or two pipes, and makes its way
                    into this annular space between the trough and drum. The bottom of these pipes
                    corresponds with the level of the water in the trough, and they are directed
                    horizontally, and as tangents to the mean circumference between that of the
                    trough and of the drum. The velocity which the water has acquired by its fall
                    along these pipes, makes the machine move round its axis, and this motion
                    accelerates by degrees, till the velocity of the water in the space between the
                    trough and drum equals that of the water from the reservoir; so that no Sensible
                    shock is perceived of the affluent water upon that which is contained in the
                    machine.</p>
                <p>This circular motion communicates to the water between the trough and drum a
                    centrifugal force, in consequence of which it presses against the sides of the
                    trough. This centrifugal force acts equally upon the water contained in the
                    compartments at the bottom of the trough, but it acts less and less as this
                    water approaches the centre.</p>
                <p>The whole water then is animated by two opposite forces, viz. gravity, and the
                    centrifugal force. The first tends to make the water run out at the hole at the
                    bottom of the trough; the second, to drive the water from that hole.</p>
                <p>To these two forces are joined a third, viz. <hi rend="italic">friction,</hi>
                    which acts here an important and singular part, as it promotes the efficacy of
                    the machine, while in other machines it always diminishes that efficacy. Here,
                    on the contrary, the effect would be nothing were it not for the friction, which
                    acts as a tangent to the sides of the trough and drum.</p>
                <p>By the combination of these three forces, there ought to result a more or less
                    rapid flow from the hole at the bottom of the trough; and the less force the
                    water has as it issues out, the more it will have employed in moving the
                    machine, and of course in producing the useful effect for which it is
                    destined.</p>
                <p>The moving power is the weight of the water running in, multiplied by the height
                    of the reservoir from which it flows above the bottom of the trough; and the
                    useful effect is the same product diminished by half the force which the water
                    retains when it issues out of the orifice below.</p>
                <p>In order to ascertain, by direct experiment, the magnitude of this effect, MM.
                    Prony and Carnot fixed a cord to the axis of the machine, which passing over a
                    pulley, raised a weight by the motion of the machine. By this means, the effect
                    was found to be <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ¾ of the power, and often
                    approached <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> without reckoning the friction of the pulleys, which
                    has nothing to do with the machine. This effect exceeds that of the best
                    overshot-wheels. See the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Institute,</hi> 23d

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">On Clcpsyclrae or
                    Water-Clocks.</hi></p>
                <p>412. A clepsydra or water-clock, derived from κλs⅛τw, <hi rend="italic">to
                    steal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tθωζ, water,</hi> is a machine which measures
                    time by the motion of water. The invention of this machine has been ascribed to
                    Scipio Nasica, the cousin of Scipio Africanus, who flourished about two hundred
                    years before the Christian era. It was well known, however, at an earlier
                    period, among the Egyptians, who employed it to measure the course of the sun.
                    It is highly probable that Scipio Nasica had only the merit of introducing it
                    into his native country. These machines were in use for a very long period, and
                    continued to be employed as measurers of time till the invention of the pendulum
                    clock enriched the arts and sciences.</p>
                <p>413. The earliest, and probably the simplest water-clock, consisted of a
                    hollowcone A (fig. 125), perforated at its apex, and of a solid cone B, which
                    exactly fitted the interior of A. Theaperturéof the cone A was of such a size in
                    relation totlie contents of A, that it discharged all the Water in A in the
                    course of the shortest day* in winter. The length of the cone was divided into
                    <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> parts, which indicated the hours as the water was
                    discharged. As the day became longer, the line in which the water was d
                    ischarged required to be increased; and, in order to effect this, the solid cone
                    B was introduced into the hollow cone A, and, in proportion to the depth of its
                    immersion, the water flowed with less facility, and more slowly, from the
                    aperture at the vertex of the cóne A. By this means the time of emptying the
                    cone was accommodated to the varying length of the day, and the adjustment for
                    this purpose was made by a graduated scale BC, upon the handle of the solid
                    cone.</p>
                <p>413. The clepsydra, invented by Ctesibius of Alexandria, was an interesting
                    machine. The water, which indicated the progress of time by the gradual descent
                    of its surface, flowed in the form of tears from the eyes of the human figure.
                    Its head was bent down with age: its look was dejected, while it seemed to pay
                    the last tribute of regret to the fleeting moments as they passed. The watfer
                    which was thus discharged was collected in a vertical reservoir, where it raised
                    another figure, holding in its hand a rod, which, by its gradual ascent, pointed
                    out the hours upon a vertical column. The same fluid was afterwards employed in
                    the interior of the pedestal, as the impelling power of a piece of machinery,
                    which made this column revolve round its axis in a year, so that the months and
                    the days were always shewn by this index, whose extremity described a vertical
                    line divided according to the relative lengths of the hours of day and night.
                    Among the ancients the length of the hours varied every day, and even the hours
                    of the day differed in length from those of the night; for the length of the
                    day, or the interval between sunrise and sunset, was always divided into twelve
                    equal parts, while the length of the night, or the interval between sunset and
                    sunrise, was divided into the same number of parts, for hours. A farther
                    description of this beautiful machine, and others of the same nature, may be
                    seen in Perrault’s <hi rend="italic">Vitruvius.</hi></p>
                <p>415. The method of constructing clepsydrae, when the vessel from which the fluid
                    issues is cylindrical or of any other form, has been shewn in Prop. VII. Part
                    II. Instead of dividing the sides of the vessel, for a scale to ascertain the
                    descent of the fluid surface, the following method may be adopted. In the bottom
                    of the cylindrical vessel ABCD (fig. 126.), which is about twelve inches high,
                    and four inches in diameter, is inserted a small glass adjutage E, which
                    discharges the water in the vessel by successive drops. A hole F, about half an
                    inch in diameter, is perforated in the cover AB, so as to allow the glass tube
                    GI, about sixteen inches long, and half an inch in diameter, to move up <hi
                    rend="subscript"> an</hi> d down without experiencing a <hi rend="subscript">
                    n</hi> y resistance. To the extremity of this tube is attached the ball I, which
                    floats on the surface of the water in the vessel and is kept steady, either by
                    introducing a quantity of mercury int <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> it <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> cavity, if it be hollow, or by suspending a weight, if
                    it is a solid which does not sink in water. When the vessel is filled with
                    water, the ball I will be at the top AB; then, in order to graduate the tube C,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939219" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9219-0109"/>let the water
                    flow· out at E, and by means of a watch mark the points on the tube, which
                    descend to F after the lapse of every hour, and every quarter, and the
                    instrument will be finished. In order to use this hydroscope or waterclock, pour
                    into the vessel AB CD till the hour of the day is about to descend below F; and
                    when this is done, it will point out any succeeding hour till the vessel is
                    emptied.</p>
                <p>359. The clepsydra, invented by the honourable Mr Charles Hamilton, is
                    represented in fig. 127. An open canal <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> supplied with
                    a constant and equal stream by the syphon <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> has at each
                    end <hi rend="italic">f f</hi> open pipes/1, /2, of exactly equal bores, which
                    deliver ttιe water that runs along the canal <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    alternately into the vessels <hi rend="italic">gh, g2,</hi> in such a quantity
                    as to raise the water from the mouth of the tantalus <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    exactly in an hour. The canal ceis equally poised by the two pipes ∕1,∕2, upon a
                    centre <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the ends of the canal
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are raised alternately, as the cups <hi rend="italic"
                    >zz</hi> are depressed, to which they are connected by the lines running over
                    the pulleys <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi> The cups <hi rend="italic">zz</hi> are
                    fixed at each end of the balance <hi rend="italic">mm,</hi> which moves up and
                    down upon its centre <hi rend="italic">v. nl, n2,</hi> are the edges of two
                    wheels or pulleys, moving different ways alternately, and fitted to the cylinder
                    <hi rend="italic">0</hi> by oblique teeth, both in the cavity of the wheel and
                    upon the cylinder, which, when the wheel <hi rend="italic">n</hi> moves one way,
                    that is, in the direction of the minute-hand, meet the teeth of the cylinder,
                    and carry the cylinder along with it, and slip over those of the cylinder when
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> moves the contrary way, the teeth not meeting, but
                    receding from each other. One or other of these wheels <hi rend="italic">un</hi>
                    continually moves <hi rend="italic">0</hi> in the same direction, with an
                    equable and uninterrupted motion. A fine chain goes twice round each wheel,
                    having at one end a weight X, always out of the water, which equiponderates with
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> at the other end, when kept floating on the surface of
                    the fluid in the vessel <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    must always be; the two cups <hi rend="italic">z, z,</hi> one at each end of the
                    balance, keep it in equilibrio, till one of them is forced down by the weight
                    and impulse of the water, which it receives from the tantalus <hi rend="italic"
                    >ti.</hi> Each of these cups <hi rend="italic">z, z,</hi> has likewise a
                    tantalus of its own <hi rend="italic">h, h,</hi> which empties it after the
                    water has run from <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and leaves the two cups again in
                    equilibrio: <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is a drain to carry off the water. The
                    dial-plate, &amp;c. needs no description. The motion of the clepsydra is
                    effected thus: As the end of the canal <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> fixed to the
                    pipe∕l, viz. the lowest in the figure, all the water supplied by the syphon runs
                    through the pipe <hi rend="italic">fl,</hi> into the vessel <hi rend="italic"
                    >gh,</hi> till it runs over the top of the tantalus <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> when it immediately runs out at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    into the cup Z, at the end of the balance <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and forces
                    it down; the balance moving on its centre V. When one side of <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> is brought down, the string which connects it to <hi rend="italic"
                    >fl,</hi> running over the pulley <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> raises the endjf 1,
                    of the canal e, which turns upon its centre <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> higher
                    thanjf2; consequently, all the water which runs through the syphon <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> passes through <hi rend="italic">f2</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">2,</hi> till the same operation is
                    performed in that vessel, and so on alternately. As the height to which the
                    water rises in <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in an hour, viz. from S to <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> is equal to the circumference of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    the float <hi rend="italic">y</hi> rising through that height along with the
                    water, allows the weight X to act upon the pulley <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    which carries with it the cylinder <hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and this, making a revolution, causes the index <hi rend="italic">k</hi>
                    to describe an hour on the dial-plate. This revolution is performed by the
                    pulley <hi rend="italic">n</hi> 1; the next is performed by <hi rend="italic">n
                    2,</hi> whilst <hi rend="italic">n</hi> 1 goes back, as the water in <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> 1 runs out through the tantalus; for <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> must follow the water, as its weight increases out of it. The axis <hi
                    rend="italic">0</hi> always keeps moving the same way; the index <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> describes the minutes; each tan talus must be wider than
                    the syphon, that the vessels <hi rend="italic">g g</hi> maybe emptied as low as
                    S. before the water returns to them.</p>
