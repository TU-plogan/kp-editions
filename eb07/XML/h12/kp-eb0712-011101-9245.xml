                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> formation of steam or aqueous vapour, and its
                    diffusion in space or in a gaseous medium, have already been considered under
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Evaporation.</hi> We now propose first to take
                    a view of various methods and devices which have been employed to detect the
                    presence of aqueous vapour, and to ascertain its amount, or how much of it is
                    contained in a given volume, whether when alone or diffused in a gaseous medium.
                    This is necessarily connected with, and will in a great measure consist of, the
                    description, theory, and use of such instruments as almost exclusively belong to
                    this branch of inquiry, and which are usually denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >hygrometers,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">υγgος, moist,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">μi</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rgiω, I measure.</hi> We shall then consider under what circumstances moisture
                    is deposited from the atmosphere, and shall examine some of the more remarkable
                    phenomena resulting from or connected with the condensation of aqueous vapour.
                    Many contrivances bearing the name of hygrometers have appeared from time to
                    time, and these, though extremely various in their constructions, we shall only
                    divide into two very different classes: 1st, Such as are slow or uncertain in
                    their indications, or are formed of decaying or changing materials; 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, such as are not only more prompt in their indications, but
                    are formed of materials comparatively free from change. The former are obviously
                    unfit for hygrometers, but have been so numerous, that a description of the
                    whole of them alone would greatly exceed our limits; which is the less to be
                    regretted, since the greater and more superficial part have already served their
                    day, and gone entirely into disuse. It will, however, be proper briefly to
                    notice a few of those either already become obsolete, or soon to be so, were it
                    only to show their imperfection.</p>
                <p>The earliest account of hygrometers perhaps worth no- ’ ticing is that contained
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1676, where several
                    are described, and allusions made to others; but both then, and during more than
                    a century which followed, the indications of such instruments depended on the
                    change which the weights or dimensions of bodies undergo from a change of
                    humidity. Thus, when the weather becomes more damp, the deliquescent salts
                    gradually become heavier from absorbing moisture, and in drier weather lighter
                    from parting with it. The like happens with certain stones and various other
                    minerals; with sulphuric acid and several other liquids; with sponges and many
                    vegetable and animal substances, whose dimensions are considerably though slowly
                    altered by change of humidity. In bodies of a fibrous structure, however, the
                    change of dimension occurs principally in a transverse direction, or across the
                    fibres, and but very slightly in the direction of their length. Thus a beam of
                    straight-grained wood becomes thicker and broader by absorbing moisture, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while its length is
                    altered in a much smaller råtio. The same thing takes place with whalebone,
                    ivory, and other substances.</p>
                <p>As several sorts of wood are at first very susceptible of participating in the
                    dryness and moisture of the atmosphere, they have sometimes been employed in the
                    construction of hygrometers. For this purpose a small and very thin board is
                    placed on edge, with its ends slightly entering into grooves in two upright
                    pillars, its fibres being in a horizontal direction, so that the expansion or
                    contraction of the board may be vertical; for, as was noticed above, it is
                    principally in the lateral direction, or across the fibres, that wood expands or
                    contracts by change of humidity. On the upper edge of the board is fixed an
                    upright toothed rack, working in the leaves of a small pinion, on whose axis is
                    fixed a wheel, which turns another pinion on the axis of the index. It is thus
                    evident, that a very slight motion communicated to the rack, by the rising or
                    falling of the upper edge of the board, will be greatly magnified by the
                    wheel-work, so as to be shown in a very sensible manner by the index. But the
                    defect of this and all similar contrivances is, that the wood takes such a long
                    while to receive the impressions, whether of humidity or dryness, from the
                    atmosphere, that by the time they indicate greater dampness, the air may have
                    really become drier, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and besides, the board gradually becomes less sensible to these
                    impressions, till at length the index almost ceases to move.</p>
                <p>An obvious consequence of the lateral expansion and contraction of organic fibres
                    is, that ropes, cords, or strings, formed of such fibres twisted together, are
                    rendered thicker and shorter by absorbing moisture, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> On this principle it has frequently been attempted to construct
                    hygrometers, as, for instance, by making fast one end of a piece of rope, cord,
                    or catgut, winding it backwards and forwards over several pulleys, and
                    suspending from its other end a small weight, which, by rising and falling with
                    the alternate shortening and lengthening of the cord, marks, on a graduated
                    scale placed behind it, the changes of humidity. Sometimes the one extremity of
                    the catgut being made fast, the other carries a small weight, and an
                    intermediate part is wound on a small axis, carrying an index round a graduated
                    plate, the degrees of which are meant to mark the humidity or dryness of the
                    air. When a weight is suspended by a fine string, a piece of catgut, or the
                    naturally twisted beard of the wild oat, it will be seen to turn in the one
                    direction or the other, owing to the twisting and untwisting of the cord, from
                    the changes of humidity. The hygrometer or weather-house, commonly sold as a
                    toy, depends on this principle. It usually consists of a kind of box,
                    representing a building with two doors, within which is suspended a horizontal
                    bar, by means of a cord attached to its middle. Upon one end of this bar is a
                    figure of a man, with an umbrella to protect him from the rain, and on the other
                    that of a woman with a fan. They are so adjusted in respect of the doors, that
                    when the man appears it is a sign of rain; but when he withdraws, and the woman
                    presents herself, fair weather is predicted. This contrivance unfortunately has
                    just the same faults as the one first noticed, being both liable to change and
                    decay, so as ultimately to lose almost entirely its sensibility. It is therefore
                    of no other use than as a mere toy; for the value of an instrument employed as a
                    measure of any kind must depend not only on its being at first accurately
                    constructed, but likewise upon its indications not being, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ccBtoris paribus,</hi> liable to change.</p>
                <p>The preceding remarks upon the effects of a change of humidity on organic
                    substances may enable us to correct what we consider a great mistake. Slips of
                    metal are sometimes employed to strengthen or bind together cabinet work; and
                    this has been objected to on the professedly scientific ground, that the
                    expansion and contraction of the metal by change of temperature is apt to tear,
                    warp, or distort the wooden work. That some such effects as have just been
                    stated do frequently occur, cannot be denied; but we have no hesitation in
                    ascribing them to a very different and far more powerful cause, the lateral
                    expansion and contraction of the wood itself by changes of humidity, and
                    particularly the permanent contraction due to the gradual loss of natural sap,
                    if the wood has not been <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939258"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9258-0112"/>previously well seasoned; for the bad effects in
                    question rarely appear at first, and only occur at all when the metal is of
                    considerable length and fixed across the grain of the wood, and more especially
                    when the wood has not been of the proper sort, or has been worked when damp or
                    badly seasoned. Indeed, when a sufficiently strong slip of wood is firmly
                    applied in place of and in the same position as the metal, there <hi
                    rend="italic">is^paeterisparibus,</hi> no sensible difference in the bad
                    effects; and it is particularly to be remembered, that a rise of temperature
                    which would alter the length of the metal so as to do any harm in the manner
                    supposed, would seriously injure cabinet work although no metal were near it.
                    Wood in general, if exposed to drought, continues to shrink permanently more or
                    less, especially in the lateral direction, or across the fibres, so long as it
                    lasts; and when alternately exposed to the expanding and contracting influences
                    of moisture and drought, the permanent contraction is upon the whole accelerated
                    and increased.</p>
                <p>The hygrometer invented by the late ingenious Captain Kater depends upon the
                    twining and untwining which the changes of humidity produce in the naturally
                    twisted beard of grass known in the <hi rend="italic">Canarese</hi> language by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Oobeena Hooloo.</hi> This is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andropogon</hi><hi rend="italic">contortum</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Linnaeus, and is gathered in the Mysore country in January. The frame of this
                    instrument is commonly cylindrical; and, that it may allow the air to pass
                    freely through, it is formed of small bars of brass, or sometimes of silver.
                    Upon one end of this frame is soldered a flat plate, having a projecting rim, to
                    protect the index which turns upon it over a circular dial divided into a
                    hundred equal parts or degrees. The index, which is very slender and nicely
                    balanced, is put on one end of an axis of silver wire, which has liberty both to
                    turn round and to shift a little longitudinally through double conical holes in
                    the frame. The axis extends about half the length of the frame; and a part of it
                    next the index is formed into a screw of fourteen or fifteen threads. This is
                    effected by twisting tightly round it a smaller silver wire. A loop and drop
                    made of fine gold wire are so formed, that when suspended from the axis, the
                    loop may slide freely along the screw, and by the number of threads thus run
                    over, it can show the number of complete revolutions of the index. The farther
                    end of the axis is swelled a little, and has a notch to receive the end of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oobeena Hooloo,</hi> which is fixed by drawing upon it a
                    sliding ring. This beard is then extended in the line of the continuation of the
                    axis, till it meet the frame, where its other end is fixed similarly to the
                    former one, but admits of adjustment by a screw which stretches it slightly.
                    Such is a brief outline of the very simple and ingenious mechanism by which the
                    gradual expansion or contraction of the hygrometric substance communicates a
                    rotatory motion to the index; so that whilst the index shows the fraction of a
                    revolution on the graduated dial, the loop and drop indicate the number of
                    complete revolutions, or the integral number of hundreds of degrees which the
                    index has passed over on the dial. So great is the sensibility of this
                    instrument, that its index makes ten or twelve revolutions, while that of
                    Saussure’s only makes one. Captain Kater recommended that all observations made
                    with his hygrometer should be reduced to what they would have been had the
                    entire scale, or the utmost range traversed by the index, consisted of a
                    thousand degrees, which would be ten complete revolutions. By this, we suppose,
                    he meant to render all hygrometers of his construction comparable; a property
                    which, however, belongs to no hygrometers whose principal parts are formed of
                    animal or vegetable substances, which are continually changing, and gradually
                    becoming less and less sensible to the influence of humidity.</p>
                <p>Hygrometers have frequently been formed by suspending from one arm of a balance
                    some substance which strongly attracts moisture from the atmosphere, and nice-1
                    ly counterpoising it by a weight on the other arm. The changes in the humidity
                    of the air are then meant to be indicated by the changes in the position of the
                    beam, arising from the gain or loss of weight in the suspended body. A great
                    variety of substances have been used for this purpose, such as sponge, caustic
                    potash, the deliquescent salts, sulphuric acid, &amp;c. These, like the former
                    instruments, are all too late in their indications, though some of them might
                    scarcely be liable to lose their sensibility, were it not that they soon become
                    useless from the accumulation of dust, soot, &amp;c. especially if in or near a
                    large city.</p>
                <p>But the expansions and contractions of hair and of whalebone are, from the
                    tenuity of their, substance, somewhat more expeditious in acquiring the humidity
                    or dryness of the surrounding air. They have therefore been employed in the
                    construction of hygrometers; the former by Saussure, and the latter by Deluc.
                    Both these instruments are impaired by time, and they sometimes acquire contrary
                    errors. Their indications generally differ materially, even when graduated
                    alike, and more especially when differently graduated; but so unsteady is the
                    relation between them, even for the same state of the air, that no certain rule
                    can be given for reducing the one to the other. This is evident from the
                    circumstance, that scarcely two authors who do not derive their information from
                    the same source agree respecting the relation between the indications of these
                    instruments. Deluc states, we think, very just objections to Saussure’s
                    hygrometer, and as justly does Saussure object to his; so that, had it not been
                    out of respect for the high reputation of these philosophers, and the frequent
                    reference made to their instruments in scientific researches, and in books of
                    voyages and travels, we should scarcely have felt warranted to give even the
                    following brief description of them here. We begin with that of Saussure, which
                    is represented in fig. 3, Plate CÇXCV.</p>
                <p>The lower end of the hair <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is held by the screw-pincers
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> at the bottom of the frame. These pincers, shown
                    separately at B, fig. 4, terminate in a screw which enters the hollow screw C,
                    fig. 5. By turning this screw, the pincers <hi rend="italic">b</hi> or B may be
                    raised or lowered at pleasure. The other end <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the
                    hair is held by the inferior mouth of the double and moveable pincers <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> seen separately at A, fig. 6, and which, with their upper
                    mouth, take hold of a fine well-tempered silver wire, which is wound round the
                    arbor <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This arbor, seen separately at OF, fig. 6,
                    carries the index <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> marked E in the separate figure 6,
                    and is cut like a screw, with a flat· bottomed groove to receive the silver
                    wire, which, as mentioned above, is connected with the hair by means of the
                    double pincers. The wire was adopted from its being found that, when the hair
                    itself was wound on the arbor, it became rough, and contracted a stiffness,
                    which the small weight <hi rend="italic">g</hi> or G, employed as a
                    counterpoise, could not overcome; whereas a proper wire always preserves the
                    same flexibility. It was necessary thus to cut the arbor like a screw, that the
                    wire might no,t have its coils wound one upon another, so as to thicken the
                    arbor, or to take a position too oblique and uncertain. The wire is fixed to the
                    arbor by a small pin F. The other end D of the arbor has the form of a pulley,
                    with a groove flat at the bottom to receive a fine silk thread, by which is
                    suspended the counterpoise marked <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in fig. 3, and G in
                    fig. 6. This is intended to keep the hair always gently stretched. One end of
                    the arbor, formed into a fine pivot, passes through the centre of the dial, and
                    carries the index <hi rend="italic">e¢</hi> on its extremity. T ’ he other end
                    has a similar pivot turning in the arm <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of fhe
                    doubly-kneed piece <hi rend="italic">hi,</hi> or HI, fig. 7, which is fixed to
                    the back of the dial <hi rend="italic">hh</hi> by the screw I. The dial is
                    divided into 360 degrees, and is soldered to two tubes <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll,</hi> which surround and can be slid up and down the two upright wires <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939271" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9271-0113"/><hi rend="italic"
                    >mm, mm</hi> of the frame. The dial can thus be fixed at any place on the wires
                    by means of the screws <hi rend="italic">nn.</hi> The square column <hi
                    rend="italic">pp</hi> carries a box <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> to which is fixed
                    a sort of pencil-case <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> fitted to receive the
                    counterpoise <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> When the hygrometer is to be transported
                    to and <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ther place, and some harm is apprehended
                    from the vibrations of the counterpoise, the case <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is
                    raised to receive it. Both are then made fast by the screws s and <hi
                    rend="italic">t.</hi> When, again, the hygrometer is to be used, the
                    counterpoise is disengaged, and the box lowered as in the figure. At the corners
                    of the base of the frame are four screws <hi rend="italic">o, o, o, o,</hi> for
                    the purpose of levelling the base, or making the instrument stand upright. The
                    three columns of the frame are connected at the top by the crooked piece <hi
                    rend="italic">xyx,</hi> having a hole at <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> by which the
                    instrument may be suspended.</p>
                <p>The point of extreme dryness is obtained by placing the instrument under a
                    receiver, with a quantity of quicklime or caustic alkali; and that of extreme
                    moisture by enclosing it in a receiver whose sides are kept continually
                    moistened. This last Deluc regards as very fallacious.</p>
                <p>The scale of Saussure’s hygrometer sometimes contains 100 divisions or degrees,
                    and sometimes a larger number. That in our figure has 360. Saussure gives a
                    decided preference to human hair, which he first causes to undergo a
                    preparation, for the purpose of divesting it of a kind of natural oiliness,
                    which, if not removed, would render it less sensible to the action of humidity.
                    This preparation is made at the same time on a considerable number of hairs
                    forming a tuft, the thickness of which need not exceed that of a quill. This
                    tuft being enveloped in a bit of fine cloth, as in a case, is immersed in a
                    long-necked phial full of water, holding in solution about the hundredth part of
                    its weight of sulphate of soda, and which is made to boil about three minutes.
                    The tuft is then passed through two vessels of pure water at the boiling
                    temperature; afterwards the hairs are drawn from their wrapper and separated;
                    then they are hung up to dry. It only remains to select those which are
                    cleanest, softest, most brilliant, and most transparent. The effects of dryness
                    and of moisture upon the hair are modified by those of heat, which affect it in
                    different ways. Thus, if it be supposed, for example, that the air becomes
                    warmer about the hygrometer, its drying quality being thereby increased, it will
                    abstract from the hair a part of the water which it had imbibed, thus tending to
                    shorten it; while, on the other hand, the heat, by expanding the hair, will
                    tend, though in a much smaller degree, to lengthen it; so that the total effect
                    will consist of the excess of the former over the latter. It is therefore
                    necessary, where precision is aimed at, to consult the thermometer, and apply a
                    corresponding correction.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Essais sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hygrométrie,</hi> M. de Saussure, while he candidly acknowledges
                    the imperfection of his own instrument, enumerates the following as properties
                    which he thinks a perfect hygrometer ought to possess: Is/, Its variations
                    should be sufficiently extensive to show very small changes of humidity or
                    dryness; 2a, these indications should be so prompt as to proceed <hi
                    rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the actual state of the air; 3cZ, the
                    instrument should always accord with itself; that is to say, in the same state
                    of the air it should always be found at the same degree; <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛th,</hi> it should be comparable; that is to say, any number °f hygrometers
                    constructed separately upon the same principles should always indicate the same
                    degree in the same circumstances; <hi rend="italic">òth,</hi> it should only be
                    affected by humidity or dryness properly so called; <hi rend="italic">6th,</hi>
                    the variations in the indications should be proportional to those of the air; so
                    that, in like circumstances, a double or triple number of degrees should always
                    indicate a double or triple quantity of moisture.</p>
                <p>This last property, however, we cannot regard as by any means indispensable to a
                    perfect hygrometer, though we grant that an instrument possessing it is likely
                    to be somewhat more convenient. For it is quite clear, that if we only knew the
                    true relation between the indications of the instrument and the state of the
                    air, we could by that means compute the degree of humidity with perfect
                    certainty; no matter how much the variations of the indications of the
                    instrument and those of humidity differed from simple proportionality.</p>
                <p>We shall next give a brief description of Deluc’s hygrometer. The frame will be
                    readily understood from inspecting fig. 1, Plate CCXCV. The principal part
                    consists of a slip of whalebone, cut transversely, or across the fibres, and is
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">db.</hi> Its end <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    held by a very simple sort of pincers, made of a bit of flattened wire bent and
                    pressed together on the whalebone by a sliding ring. The other end <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is fixed to a bar <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which can be
                    moved by a screw for adjusting the index e, to have a proper position at first
                    on the dial. The loop of the pincers which hold the whalebone is hooked to the
                    end of a thin brass wire, to the other end of which is also hooked a very thin
                    silver gilt lamina, which has at that extremity pincers similar to those of the
                    whalebone; but its other extremity is pinned into a hole in the axis. The spring
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> which stretches the whalebone is made of silver gilt
                    wire; it exerts a force equal to a weight of twelve grains, but with this among
                    other advantages over a weight, that in proportion as the slip is weakened by
                    lengthening, the spring relaxes its force by unbending. The axis has very small
                    pivots, whose ends are confined, to prevent the shoulders from rubbing against
                    the frame. A section of this axis is shown on a large scale in fig. 2. The slip
                    acts on the diameter <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> and the spring on the smaller
                    diameter <hi rend="italic">bb.</hi> The point of extreme dryness is obtained by
                    enclosing the instrument under a receiver, along with some quicklime; that of
                    extreme humidity, by wetting the whalebone with water, or immersing the whole
                    instrument in it. The graduated arc on the dial is about five sixths of the
                    entire circle, and is divided into 100 equal parts or degrees. The zero denotes
                    extreme dryness, and the 100th degree extreme humidity. Saussure, however,
                    alleges that the whalebone is more thoroughly soaked or swelled by immersion in
                    water than in the most humid air, which, he says, never brings it to the
                    extremity of the scale.</p>
                <p>Deluc maintains that hairs and other animal or vegetable hygroscopic substances
                    taken lengthwise, or in the direction of their fibres, undergo contrary changes
                    from different variations of humidity; that when immersed in water, they
                    lengthen first, and then shorten; that when they are near the extreme of
                    humidity, they shorten with an increase and lengthen with a diminution of
                    humidity. This he regards as the necessary consequence of their organic
                    reticular structure; and in illustration of it he has given the following
                    comparison between the corresponding indications of his own hygrometer and those
                    of Saussure. The scale of each is supposed to be divided into 100 degreps.</p>

                <p>From this it would appear, that after the hair becomes very moist, its lateral
                    expansion produces a contraction in the length, as in the case of ropes.
                    Saussure, however, alleges that in this trial his instrument must have been in
                    bad order; and he even retaliates by ascribing as great defects to that of
                    Deluc. According to Boeckman, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45 of Deluc correspond to 33, 54,
                    65, 80, 86 respectively of Saussure; but in atmospherical observations he found
                    Deluc’s at 56 and 48, when Saussure’s indicated 85 and 90 respectively.</p>
                <p>Μ. Gay-Lussac has made many experiments on the hair hygrometer, which would place
                    it in a rather more favourable light than the above; and Μ. Biot has exerted his
                    great analytical skill in endeavouring to perfect its theory, by giving, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de Physique</hi> (tome ii. p.
                    199), a very elaborate investigation of the relation between its indications and
                    the actual humidity, which has been farther illustrated at great length by
                    Signor Melloni, in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Physique</hi> for January 1830. But unfortunately this relation
                    is so soon deranged by the rapidly changing and perishable nature of the
                    instrument, as to render all such labours of very little use, no matter how much
                    learning or ingenuity may have been expended on them.</p>
                <p>It will be unnecessary here to notice Deluc’s ivory hygrometer, because a
                    description of an improved instrument of the same kind will be found under the

                <p>Mr Wilson’s hygrometer is very similar to a mercurial thermometer; but in place
                    of the bulb being of glass, it consists of a rat’s bladder, which when new is
                    very sensible to changes of humidity; so that by expanding with moisture, or
                    contracting with drought, it produces corresponding depressions, or rises in the
                    column of mercury in the glass stem. This instrument must obviously have its
                    indications somewhat affected by changes of temperature like a thermometer; and,
                    in addition to some of the imperfections common to the instruments already
                    described, it has been objected that the pressure of the column of mercury in
                    the stem must occasion a variable, and perhaps increasing distension of the
                    bladder.</p>
                <p>The foregoing we presume to be sufficient specimens of such hygrometers as are
                    slow or uncertain in their indications, or formed of comparatively changing and
                    perishable materials. These, too, we should think, have been treated at as great
                    length as the little and decreasing importance now attached to them seems to
                    warrant. But since the science of heat lies at the foundation of all accurate
                    knowledge in hygrometry, we now propose, preparatory to entering on the
                    consideration of such hygrometers as are more durable in their construction and
                    constant in their indications, to investigate some relations of air to heat,
                    which will be useful in the sequel of this article. In so doing we shall reason
                    from admitted principles only; for we see no necessity for calling in the aid of
                    the old notion which some are so anxious to revive again, that heat is a species
                    of motion; because such a hypothesis, in place of solving the difficulties, is,
                    like “the 0cc41lt qualities,” a mere subterfuge for our ignorance, or an excuse
                    for not encountering the difficulties, and unavoidably leads to still greater
                    difficulties; whereas the more closely the other theory is traced, the more the
                    difficulties, numerous as they still are, disappear. Of this we shall have
                    occasion to notice several instances in the course of this research. We now
                    begin the investigation with a brief demonstration of the following preliminary
                    proposition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lemma.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If the area of a curve
                    between every two ordinates be such that, when cut by a third ordinate in a
                    given ratio, the two corresponding differences in the logarithms of the three
                    abscissae are likewise in that ratio, the curve is a hyperbola.</p>
                <p>Let the curve ABC be such, that when AHKC, its area between any two ordinates AH,
                    CK, is cut by any third ordinate BI, making area AHKC to AHIB in the given ratio
                    ofanto n, the three corresponding abscissae reckoned on the'straight line GH
                    from a fixed point G, are related thus; log. GK — log. GH: log. GI — log. GH <hi
                    rend="italic">::</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">η,</hi> the curve ABC is a hyperbola.</p>
                <p>For if not, with G as a centre, GH as one asymptote and the other parallel to AH,
                    describe through B the hyperbola αBc cutting AH and CK in <hi rend="italic"
                    >α</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Then by the well-known property of the
                    hyperbola, area αHKc: aĤIB:: log. GK — log. GH: log. GI — log. GH.</p>
                <p>But AHKC: AHIB:: log. GK</p>
                <p>— log. GH: log. GI — log. GH; wherefore, by equality of ratios, alternation and
                    division,</p>
                <p>BIKC: B1Kc;; AHIB: αHIB.</p>
                <p>If cK &lt; CK, and <hi rend="italic">aH &gt;</hi> AH, and if the curves do not
                    again meet between A and C, the first term of the analogy last stated must
                    exceed the second, while yet the third is less than the fourth, which is absurd.
                    The like would as readily follow, were cK^&gt; CK and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >öH</hi> AH.</p>
                <p>But it is evident that in every case in which the hyperbola is supposed to cut
                    the other curve, the same process of reasoning will lead to the like absurdity,
                    if three ordinates intercepting areas in the given ratio be drawn so close
                    together as to embrace no other meeting of the curves but the foresaid
                    intersection. Now such a construction is always practicable; for in every case
                    two of three such ordinates may be drawn arbitrarily, viz. one through the point
                    of intersection, and a second as close as we please to either side of it; whilst
                    the abscissa which gives the position of a third still nearer, if wished, on the
                    other side, may be had from such an analogy as was stated above, namely, log. GK
                    — log. GH: log. GI — log. GH:: <hi rend="italic">rn∙ n.</hi></p>
                <p>It is indeed a supposable case, that the hyperbola, in place of cutting, might
                    have the other curve wholly on one side, only touching it in the point B; but
                    then it is evident that another hyperbola drawn near enough to that side of the
                    former one, and having the same asymptotes, could not fail to cut the curve ABC.
                    Of course, three ordinates being drawn as before, viz. one through the point of
                    intersection, and the other two near enough to it, would still produce the
                    former absurdity. Hence the curve ABC can only be a hyperbola.</p>
                <p>The physical principles which we are about to employ as data tor investigating
                    the relations of air to heat, are essentially the same as those from which MM.
                    de Laplace and Poisson attempted to deduce the true scale of the airthermometer,
                    as may be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celeste</hi> (tome V. p. 127), and <hi rend="italic">Annalesdc Chimicetde
                    Physique (tome</hi> xxiii. p. 337); where, after proceeding so far, and with
                    data which, it properly managed, were amply sufficient for their purpose, they
                    abandoned the project, and contented themselves with <hi rend="italic"
                    >assuming</hi> that the common mode of graduating an air-thermometer forms a
                    true scale of temperature. This they were forced to do in consequence of having
                    adopted a mode of investigation so unnecessarily abstruse that it soon became
                    quite unmanageable. That they should have failed to <hi rend="italic">prove</hi>
                    the common scale to be the true one, need excite no surprise; for we shall soon
                    see that such a result would be quite incompatible with the very principles from
                    which they attempted to deduce it, and that, without the aid of any assumption,
                    a much more <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939297" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9297-0115"
                    />sin &gt;ιe process of reasoning, illustrated by a diagram or two, would have
                    necessarily led them to the legitimate, though a very different, result. These
                    principles or data, and some inferences from them, we shall now distinctly
                    state, numbering a few of the paragraphs as we proceed, chiefly for the sake of
                    after reference, and not as if we were specifying so many independent data: for
                    the whole force of the reasoning rests on the first two; the third is merely an
                    inference from the second; and the only use here made of the fourth and fifth is
                    to trace more readily, in known terms, the relation between the common scale of
                    the air-thermometer and the results to which this investigation leads.</p>
                <p>1. The law of Boyle and Mariotte, that at the same temperature the elasticity or
                    pressure of air is as its density, or inversely as its volume; and consequently,
                    while air undergoes the same change of temperature, its volume varies under a
                    constant pressure, precisely in the same proportion as the pressure would do
                    were the air confined in an inextensible vessel.</p>
                <p>2. If <hi rend="italic">s</hi> denote the specific heat of air when it sustains a
                    constant pressure, and <hi rend="italic">s'</hi> the spee fic heat of the same
                    mass of air when confined in an inextensible vessel; then it has been
                    ascertained, through à great range of temperature and pressure, as will be
                    afterwards explained, that s always exceeds s' in a constant ratio, which we may
                    now call the ratio of <hi rend="italic">in</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    which are constants; but their values not being now given, will show our
                    investigation to be independent of the value of their ratio.</p>
                <p>These two, viz. the law of Boyle and the <hi rend="italic">constancy</hi> in the
                    ratio of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> are the
                    principles to which we have alluded above as being employed by MM. de Laplace
                    and Poisson, and as being quite sufficient, if properly managed, to have
                    unavoidably led these great mathematicians to the conclusion that air expands in
                    geometrical progression for equal increments of heat. But this, and most of the
                    other legitimate results, they failed to reach, in consequence of unnecessary
                    intricacy, and their introducing an assumption which we shall shortly see to be
                    quite incompatible with the data now specified. The second principle, as will be
                    afterwards noticed more particularly, was first shown by the illustrious Μ. de
                    Laplace himself to be a necessary deduction from the fact ascertained by the
                    experiments of MM. Desormes and Clement, and more especially by those of MM.
                    Gay-Lussac and Welter, which were continued through a great range of temperature
                    and pressure, viz. that when the density of air suffers a minute and sudden
                    change, <hi rend="italic">rn</hi> times such variation of density is to the
                    whole density as <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times the accompanying variation of
                    pressure to the whole pressure. Or, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> being the density
                    and/» the pressure, <hi rend="italic">, ,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>3. The last equation evidently expresses the relation between the fluxions of the
                    logarithms of the pressure and density of air when the total heat in it is
                    constant. The fluent is <hi rend="italic">η</hi> log. <hi rend="italic">p =

                    air, when the total heat in it is invariable.</p>
                <p>4. It has been ascertained by Dr Dalton, Μ. Gay-Lussac, &amp;c. that on heating
                    air under a constant pressure from 32° F. to 212°, its bulk acquires an increase
                    of three eighths. Such increase, in the common graduation of the
                    air-thermometer, is divided into 180 equal parts or degrees for Fahrenheit’s
                    scale; and the like divisions corresponding to equal vanatωns of bulk, are
                    continued both above <hi rend="italic">212°</hi> and below 32°, viz. upward
                    indefinitely, but downward they have a limit; for as three eighths are to 180°,
                    so is the whole bulk at the freezing point to 480°; and therefore more than 480
                    degrees cannot with propriety be reckoned or put below 32° on the Fahrenheit
                    scale of an air-thermometer.</p>
                <p>5. Since the freezing point is marked 32°, it is obvious that 480 degrees wΙl
                    reach from it down to —448°. The bulk of a given mass of air, therefore, under a
                    constant pressure, varies as its temperature reckoned from — 448° on the common
                    scale; that is, as <hi rend="italic">t</hi> + 448, the degrees of Fahrenheit
                    being í. Hence, by art. 1, the pressure of air confined in an inextensible
                    vessel, likewise varies as í + 448.</p>
                <p>We shall now apply these principles to determine the scale of temperature for air
                    . Let ABC be a curve, such that, while AHIB, its area between any two ordinates,
                    denotes an addition to the heat contained in a given mass of air, the straight
                    line HI shows on the common scale the consequent rise of temperature, under a
                    constant pressure, viz. from II to I, as indicated on the common scale of an air
                    thermometer. Let DEF be a similar curve, making AH: DPI:; <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and cutting all the
                    other ordinates and areas of ABC in that same ratio. Hence, area DHIE is equal
                    to (AHIB), and it therefore (art. 2) represents the smaller addition of heat
                    which would bo sufficient to raise the temperature of the same air from H to I,
                    were that air, in place of being free to expand under a constant pressure,
                    confined in an inextensible vessel. For since the specific heats or the minute
                    increments are always in the ratio of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> so must any larger addition of heat raising the
                    temperature from H to I under a constant pressure, be to that producing the same
                    rise under a constant volume. Let the common scale, of which HI is a part, be
                    continued downward to the point G answering to — 448° Fahrenheit; then (art. 5)
                    the volume of the air is increased, under a constant pressure, in the ratio of
                    GI to GH, by its temperature being raised from H to I. Suppose, therefore, that
                    the air, after having, under a constant pressure, received an increase in its
                    total beat equal to AHIB, and thereby acquired the temperature I, is instantly
                    compressed to its original volume; by which means its temperature is suddenly
                    raised from I to K on the common scale, in such a manner that area DHKF = AH1B;
                    because the air is evidently now raised to the same temperature, and in every
                    respect brought to the same state as if, with its original volume all the while
                    invariable, it had received the same increase in its quantity of heat as is
                    mentioned above, and which is now denoted by area DHKF instead of AHIB.</p>
                <p>While the air was thus being compressed to its original volume, or the density
                    re-increased in the ratio of GI to GH, the pressure has been thereby increased
                    (art. 1) in the same ratio compounded (art. 5) with the ratio of GK to GI for
                    the second rise of temperature; that is, in the ratio of GK to GH; and during
                    this compression the total quantity of heat in the air is supposed to be
                    constant. Hence, <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> GK » GI <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    AIIIB = DHKF; and the same thing holds at any part of the curves. Consequently,
                    by the lemma, each of these curves is a hyperbola, having G for its centre and
                    GH for an asymptote.</p>
                <p>All the preceding reasoning evidently applies as well to the accented letters in
                    the lower part of the figure, where AHI'B', the area between any two ordinates,
                    denotes a loss of heat, HF the consequent depression of temperature on the
                    common scale in cooling from II to 1' under a constant pressure, and I'K' a
                    farther depression, such that area DHK'F ʹ = AHITF; being caused by suddenly
                    dilating, to its original volume, the air which had just been contracted by
                    cooling from H to I ʹ.</p>
                <p>Since in each curve the segments of the area denote variations of heat, while the
                    corresponding segments of the abscissae denote variations of temperature on the
                    common scale, it follows from the known property of the hyperbola, that while
                    the variations of the quantity of heat in air under a constant pressure are
                    uniform, those on the common scale of an air-thermometer form a geometrical
                    progression. Or, in more general terms, while the variations in the quantity of
                    heat in air are uniform, the variations of its volume, under a constant
                    pressure, form a geometrical progression, as do likewise the variations of
                    pressure under a constant volume.</p>
                <p>Hence, in place of being equal, the divisions on a true scale of an
                    air-thermometer should form a geometrical progression, increasing upward, such
                    that the length of each division may be proportional to its distance from — 448°
                    F.; and hence also the values of the degrees usually put on Fahrenheit’s scale
                    of an air-thermometer decrease upward, the value of each being inversely as its
                    distance from — 448°. The same thing holds regarding any other scale with equal
                    divisions.</p>
                <p>Such are some of the necessary results of the very principles from which MM. de
                    Laplace and Poisson failed to deduce a corresponding scale of temperature; we
                    mean a scale which should necessarily follow from, and be compatible with, the
                    law of Boyle and the foresaid <hi rend="italic">constancy</hi> in the ratio of
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to n. But having failed in this, they attempted to
                    supply the defect, by <hi rend="italic">assuming</hi> that the variations in the
                    quantity of heat in air, under a constant pressure, are proportional to the
                    corresponding variations on the common scale of an air-thermometer. We shall
                    merely notice so much of their investigation here as will be sufficient to show
                    the utter incompatibility of such an <hi rend="italic">assumption</hi> with the
                    two principles just named. These illustrious philosophers set out with an
                    equation which, adapted to Fahrenheit’s scale, is <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> +
                    448 X</p>
                <p>^ = <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi> *t+448∕</p>
                <p>To this we have no objection. It just expresses the relation between the law of
                    Boyle and the common scale; <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being the pressure, <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> the density, and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the temperature,
                    of a given mass of air; also <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a constant and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> a given temperature on Fahrenheit’s scale. Having next
                    introduced the assumption in question, they obtain the equation, <hi

                    rend="italic">q</hi> is the quantity of heat to be added or withdrawn, in order
                    to change the temperature of the given mass of air from <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">tļ</hi> A and B are constants, and <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> numbers in the constant ratio already defined. By
                    combining the two equations, we have likewise <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi>, B (r + 448) <hi rend="italic">q</hi> = A ♯ ——</p>
                <p>Taking the fluxion of this with the density <hi rend="italic">g</hi> constant, we

                    rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">dp.</hi> But the constancy in
                    the ratio of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> provides that
                    the change to be made in the quantity of heat in air, in order to produce a
                    given change in its temperature, under a constant pressure, must be proportional
                    to the change of heat necessary to produce the same change of temperature, were
                    the volume constant; and it is well known to be the same thing, whether
                    variations of temperature on the common scale are reckoned by the variations of
                    volume under a constant pressure, or by variations of pressure under a constant
                    volume. Hence Laplace and Poisson assume the variations in the quantity of heat
                    to be proportional, as well to the variations of pressure under a constant
                    volume, as to the variations of volume under a constant pressure. Wherefore <hi
                    rend="italic">dq</hi> varies as <hi rend="italic">dp</hi> simply; but we have

                <p>From the remarkable inconsistency just pointed out in the principles adopted by
                    these illustrious philosophers, it is evident that they had not had so much as a
                    conjecture of what the legitimate result should be. Nobody wonders when a
                    research of this sort fails in the hands of an inexperienced tyro; but if those
                    who are deservedly regarded as at the head of their profession be liable to
                    deceive themselves in so remarkable a manner, how cautious ought we to be in
                    receiving even what emanates from high authority, if accompanied by nothing
                    deserving the name of argument or intelligible evidence; for the foregoing
                    investigation, we presume, will be found to be both legitimate, and to depend on
                    nothing but admitted principles. It is long since our distinguished countryman,
                    Dr Dalton, proposed what he alleged to be the true scale of the mercurial
                    thermometer, founded on the supposition that the expansions of liquids were
                    everywhere as the squares of their true temperatures, setting out from the
                    greatest density of each. With this he coupled another speculation: he supposed
                    that, relatively to equal intervals on his new scale of temperature, the
                    expansions of air, or of any other gas, under a constant pressure, formed a
                    geometrical progression; which evidently was a very different scale from the one
                    we have deduced above, because, as will presently be seen, it bore such a
                    different relation to the expansion of mercury. For, unfortunately, these views,
                    which Dr Dalton had never shown to be necessarily deducible from admitted
                    principles, were soon found to be mutually incompatible; but of the two
                    hypotheses, that regarding the expansion of mercury being the greater favourite
                    with Dr Dalton, he rather chose to retain it, and abandon the one respecting the
                    expansion of air; in place of which, he has since, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chemical Philosophy</hi> (vol. ii. p. 298, published in 1827), adopted the very
                    different notion, that it.is the forces of steam, and of other vapours in the
                    state of saturation, which form geometrical progressions for equal intervals of
                    temperature. It was absolutely necessary that the one of his former hypotheses
                    should be relinquished; for they were not only inconsistent at extreme
                    temperatures, but they required the common mercurial thermometer to be more than
                    7° below the common air-thermometer at 122° F.; whereas at that point, several
                    eminent French chemists declared they could find no such difference; and in
                    their decision Dr Dalton at length acquiesced.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939323" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9323-0117"/>
                <p>However, from the recent comparison of these two instruments by Dr Prout, it
                    appears that their indications do not everywhere coincide throughout the
                    interval between the freezing and boiling points of water; but their difference
                    is quite of the contrary sort to that which Dr Dalton alleged, the mercurial
                    thermometer being in advance of the other.</p>
                <p>It was shown (art. 3) that =; viz. that when the total quantity of heat in a
                    given mass of air is constant, the nth power of the pressure varies as the ∞th
                    power of the density; and since <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is greater than <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">rn</hi> pressure varies faster than
                    the density, or —øð”. But in this, a part of the variation of pressure is due to
                    change of temperature; for (art. 1) when the temperature is the same, the
                    pressure and density vary in the same ratio. Also (by art. 1 and 5), when along
                    with a change of density from <hi rend="italic">ξ'</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> the temperature changes from <hi rend="italic">r to t,</hi> and the

                    related thus; - <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> = - <hi rend="italic">t</hi> +

                    the air is constant. This investigation is given in general terms, but we shall
                    soon see that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> either
                    exactly or very nearly as 4 to 3; and therefore, <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi

                <p>Most of the formulae which have been proposed for this purpose are fraught with
                    inconsistencies, such as making the rise of temperature which would be produced
                    by a quadruple compression, to be very different from the sum of the separate
                    rises which should be produced by twice doubling the density; and they are
                    equally faulty when we compare a quadruple dilatation with twice halving the
                    density. Nay, when we attempt to retrace our steps by reversing either process,
                    they do not restore the air to the same temperature and pressure which it had at
                    first; but the formulae now given, unless when sadly mismanaged, lead to no such
                    inconsistencies. Thus, suppose the density of air at the temperature of 60° to
                    be quadrupled, the rise of temperature is (60 + 448) Įĵļ·) —l] = 298° ∙4. To
                    effect the same thing by two separate doublings, we have first 508 [2^— l] =
                    !32° ∙04, which, added to the initial temperature 60°, makes 192°·04; and by
                    doubling again the density of the air at this higher A temperature, the second
                    rise is (I92∙04 + 448) [2 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> —∙ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > r</hi> 1J ≡ 166 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 36. So that the total rise is
                    132 ’ 04 + 166∙36</p>
                <p>= 298° ∙4, the same as before. The like consistency will be found to hold with
                    any proper trial of these formulae. (See <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil.
                    Journ. for</hi> July 1827, p. 153.)</p>
                <p>From the foregoing investigation it is likewise evident, that if the total heat
                    in a given mass of air undergo no change, while its density is being increased
                    in any assigned ratio, as, for instance, in the ratio of GI to GH (see the
                    preceding figure), the temperature is thereby raised from I to K on the common
                    scale, making area DHKF = AHIB. In this case the area EIKF = ADĽB represents the
                    heat which has been elicited from a latent state, or rendered sensible by the
                    compression. But if, on the contrary, the density of the air were diminished in
                    the ratio of GP to GH, without any change in the quantity of heat, the
                    temperature would be thereby lowered from I' to K', making area DHK'F = AHI'B';
                    and area E'I'K'F' = ADE'B' would denote the heat absorbed by the dilatation, or
                    rendered latent without being actually lost. Now, area EIKF = (DHIE) = (DHKF),
                    and E'PK'F' = (DHI'E') = l’LZlľ(DHK'F); wherefore area EIKF, or the heat evolved
                    by compression, bears</p>
                <p>Ŷ72, <hi rend="underline">-</hi><hi rend="italic">EĮ;</hi> the same ratio to DHIE
                    that the part of the in-</p>

                    — log. GH; and the same is also the ratio which area E'1'K'F', or the heat

                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">constancy</hi> in the ratio of the specific heats,
                    or of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> as already defined,
                    had been well ascertained by the experiments of Gay-Lussac and Welter, and been
                    likewise adopted as a fundamental principle by the leading philosophers both
                    here and on the Continent; yet the most important of its necessary and
                    unavoidable consequences were long overlooked, especially how very different a
                    graduation of the air-thermometer it requires from what they had assumed to be
                    the true one, as was first pointed out by Mr Meikle in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Phil. Joum.</hi> for October 1826, page 336. A more obvious
                    consequence likewise noticed in that paper, and of importance here, is, that the
                    specific heat of the same mass of air under a constant pressure, must be
                    independent of the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> of such pressure; and that
                    when the same mass of air is confined in an inextensible vessel, its specific
                    heat must be independent of the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of that vessel. This
                    admits of the most rigorous demonstration, and might even have been inferred
                    from the consideration that the above-mentioned constancy in the ratio of the
                    specific heats keeps the quantity of heat, which merely raises the temperature
                    quite distinct from what is absorbed, or goes to enlarge the volume, and which
                    is represented by the area between the two curves in the last figure. Now the
                    remarkable curiosity is, that in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Celeste,</hi> livre xii. chap. 3, formulae professedly derived
                    from the same data are given for expressing the <hi rend="italic">different</hi>
                    values which the specific heat is fancied to have under different constant
                    pressures, and also its supposed <hi rend="italic">different</hi> values under
                    different constant volumes. The same are given by Μ. Poisson <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Μ. Laplace had previously given in that journal (xviii. 185) a very different,
                    though still a <hi rend="italic">variable</hi> value to the specific heat of
                    air; but this he virtually discarded, by subsequently adopting the other, though
                    both are alike incompatible with the principles from which they profess to be
                    deduced. Sanctioned by such names, these formulae are and must be received as
                    orthodox by those who never think for themselves, or who do not thoroughly
                    examine the investigations by which such expressions are deduced. But since the
                    clearing up of this point is of great importance in researches of this nature,
                    we shall endeavour to put the matter beyond dispute, by giving, from the very
                    data used by Laplace and Poisson, a very simple demonstration of what we have
                    now alleged, and which is the more satisfactory as it does not require the law
                    of temperature to be previously decided upon; for since the same degree may be
                    used for the several specific heats, it may be supposed to belong to any
                    scale.</p>
                <p>Let therefore the temperature of a given mass of air be reckoned on any scale of
                    which the straight line BE is a part; and let CF be a line, no matter to our
                    present purpose whether straight or curved, if it be such that every two
                    ordinates may, like BC and EF, intercept an area BCFE proportional to the
                    quantity of heat which would raise the temperature of the mass of air, under a
                    constant volume, from any point B in the scale to any other point E in it. Let
                    DG be a similar line or curve, so as to make the area BDGE proportional to the
                    heat which would raise the temperature of the same mass, if under a constant
                    pressure, from B to E. Now the chief condition on which we proceed is, that the
                    quantities of heat represented by every two areas, such as BDGE and BCFE,
                    between the same parallels, may be to each other in the given ratio of <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and which is obviously the
                    same with the ratio of any ordinate of DG to the corresponding ordinate of CF.
                    Let the point B mark the initial temperature, whatever that may be, of the given
                    mass of air; raise this temperature from B to any other point E under a constant
                    pressure; make Ee one degree, draw the ordinate <hi rend="italic">efg.</hi> Then
                    area EGye is the specific heat, at the temperature E, of the same mass of air
                    dilated by heat under the original pressure remaining constant. Now the specific
                    heat, when the pressure is constant, is always to the specific heat when the
                    volume is constant as <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but area <hi rend="italic">VGge</hi>: EF <hi rend="italic"
                    >fe</hi><hi rend="italic">::</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> wherefore EF/è would be
                    the specific heat at the temperature E, under the dilated volume, were it made
                    constant. But since area BCFE is the quantity of heat which would raise the
                    temperature from B to E under the original volume, and area EF/è the heat which
                    would raise it one degree more; therefore EF/è would still have been the
                    specific heat of the same mass of air at the temperature E, and all the while
                    under the original volume. Hence EF/è is the specific heat of the same mass of
                    air at the temperature E, whether under the <hi rend="italic">dilated</hi>
                    volume remaining constant, or under the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> volume
                    constant.</p>
                <p>Again, suppose the air to be heated up from B to E under the original volume
                    remaining constant, by which means the pressure will be gradually augmented; but
                    by the data, the specific heat at the temperature E, under the augmented
                    pressure, were that now made constant, must exceed EF/è in the ratio of <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n;</hi> wherefore EGye, which exceeds
                    EF/è in that ratio, is the specific heat of the same mass of air at the
                    temperature E, whether under the <hi rend="italic">augmented</hi> pressure
                    remaining constant, or, as in the first case above mentioned, under the <hi
                    rend="italic">original</hi> pressure constant. The same conclusions would
                    obviously follow by a similar process of reasoning, taking the second
                    temperature at any point E ’ lower than B. Both cases might also be proved in
                    several ways, a little differently from the preceding; as, for instance, by
                    showing that EF/è or E'F' <hi rend="italic">f'd</hi> will be the specific heat
                    of the same mass of air under a constant volume, as well after the temperature
                    has been changed from B to E or E' by a change in the quantity of heat only, as
                    by a change in the volume only; and of course EGŷ¢ or E'G'&lt;∕e ’ will be the
                    corresponding specific heat under a constant pressure, whether under the
                    original pressure constant, or under the pressure made constant after being thus
                    changed.</p>
                <p>It is thus clearly established as a necessary result of admitting the <hi
                    rend="italic">constancy</hi> of the ratio above mentioned, that neither the <hi
                    rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of a constant volume, nor the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intensity</hi> of a constant pressure, has any thing to do with the specific
                    heat of a given <hi rend="italic">mass</hi> of air.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many eminent writers, without any evidence,
                    take it for granted that the specific heat of a body depends on, or is in exact
                    proportion to, its total or absolute heat; which is the more remarkable,
                    considering that nothing is yet known, or likely ever to be, either of the real
                    or relative values of the absolute heats of different bodies. But if we suppose,
                    with far greater probability, that the specific heats of other bodies, as well
                    as that of air, have no dependence on their volumes, this would enable us to
                    account, in a more rational way than is usually done, for the heat accompanying
                    friction, as, for instance, in Count Rumford’s well-known experiments on the
                    boring of cannon. Thus the grains of metal worn off by the intentionally blunt
                    borer used on that occasion would be greatly compressed by the abrasion, and so
                    might emit much heat without having their specific heats in the least impaired
                    by the diminution of their volumes. In this way too the evolution of heat would
                    continue as long as the wear and friction; which affords an explanation
                    seemingly in accordance with the fact, without having recourse to the old notion
                    that heat is a species of motion. The investigation in the text indeed implies
                    that the absolute heat of air is indefinitely greater than its specific heat;
                    and certainly many difficulties could he explained on the supposition that the
                    same thing holds of bodies generally, or that all the heat we can impart to or
                    abstract from bodies bears no proportion to their absolute heats.</p></note>
                    From this it is obvious that the specific heat of a given <hi rend="italic"
                    >volume</hi> of air is, <hi rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi> as its mass or
                    density.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Desormes and Clement on the specific heats of gases <hi
                    rend="italic">(Journal de Physique</hi> for December 1819), have been supposed
                    to make the specific heat of a given volume of air to vary as the square root of
                    its density; but we do not see how they warrant any thing of the sort. These
                    distinguished chemists having enclosed air in a glass globe, placed it in an
                    empty trough, which they next filled up with hot water, and assumed that the
                    specific heat of the air was exactly proportional to the time which it and the
                    globe took to acquire the same temperature with the water; whereas, for aught
                    that is known to the contrary, the specific heat of the air might follow some
                    other power or root, or some very complex function of the time. Nor do they make
                    any allowance for the share which the mass or matter of this globe, which far
                    exceeded that of the included air, had in protracting the time; or for the
                    different mobilities, and consequently different conducting powers, of different
                    gases, or of the same gas at different pressures. Thus, when the globe was
                    filled with hydrogen, it was probably from the extreme mobility and great
                    conducting power of that gas that the time of its attaining the temperature of
                    the hot water was scarcely two thirds of that in the case of air; and it is as
                    natural to think, that when filled with carbonic acid, it was the more sluggish
                    motions of that gas which rendered the time one half longer than in the case of
                    air; for the experiments of Dr Haycraft <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939349"

                    from all such objections, and show that, under equal volumes and pressures, the
                    specific heats of the different gases are equal, a result equally fatal to the
                    conclusions which were deduced from the excessively complicated method of MM.
                    Delaroche and Berard. If, therefore, the experiments of Desormes and Clement are
                    so very erroneous for comparing the specific heats of different gases, why
                    should we put any confidence in them for that of the same gas under different
                    pressures?</p>
                <p>Experiments somewhat similar to those just noticed have been made by MM. de la
                    Rive and Marcet, and described in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Chimie</hi> for May 1829; but in an article on the same subject
                    in the next number of that journal, Μ. Dulong has shown, that in these
                    experiments, from their being made on an exceedingly minute scale, the mass of
                    air operated on was so very small, compared with that of the vessel, that they
                    do not warrant any definite conclusion at all. We are scarcely better satisfied
                    with the method which Μ. Dulong himself has there employed for estimating the
                    specific heats of the gases from the frequency of their vibrations, as supposed
                    to be registered by a kind of wind-instrument coupled with wheel-work, and
                    called a <hi rend="italic">sirène;</hi> because that method involves several
                    questions not yet cleared up. But what we particularly object to is, that no
                    allowance is made for the tendency which it is natural to think the vibrations
                    of the materials of the wind-instrument itself must have to increase the
                    frequency of the vibrations of the gas under examination; an oversight similar
                    to what, as we shall by and by see, pervades the usually received theory of
                    sound. Nor can there be a doubt that the vibrations of strings, wires, &amp;c.
                    in musical instruments are influenced by the vibrations of the materials by
                    which they are stretched.</p>
                <p>Having completed the intended investigations, it may now be useful to give some
                    account of the experiments to which we have several times alluded, for
                    ascertaining the value and constancy of the ratio of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> We shall first give a familiar illustration of the
                    principle, and then state more nearly the actual mode of experimenting. Suppose
                    a vessel to be accurately closed, when occupied by air of the same temperature
                    and pressure as that around it or in the apartment, and to be furnished with a
                    gauge for show- .ng any minute change of pressure. In this state let the
                    apparatus be carried into another room of a little higher temperature, say <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> degrees warmer than the former; and then the gauge will
                    soon indicate an increase of elasticity, which we may call <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> degrees. If the vessel admit of being now opened sufficiently, and shut
                    aga <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> n so promptly as just for the moment to allow
                    the included air to regain the external or its original pressure, vithout
                    affording time for its abstracting heat from the materials of the vessel, the
                    gauge will in a little time indicate a second but much smaller increase of
                    pressure, which we may call <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> degrees. The reason of this may be traced in a general way
                    to the well-known fact, that air of whatever density is cooled by dilatation.
                    The gauge, while indicating <hi rend="italic">m</hi> degrees, shows the included
                    air to be denser than that in the second apartment; and therefore, on opening
                    the vessel, the superior elastic force witnm expels a portion of that air,
                    leaving the remainder of course rarer than that of the first room, though still
                    a little denser than that of the second; because it has been cooled, as the
                    result shows, <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> decrees below the temperature of the second room. For at the instant of
                    re-shutting the vessel, the elasticity of the ncluded air is in equilibrio with
                    the external pressure; but it must then be more dense than the air of the second
                    apartment, otherwise, its temperature being lower, it could ιot balance the
                    external pressure. On recovering therefore from the small and momentary
                    depression of temperature, the excess of density shows itself by the gauge. The
                    escape of a small portion of air while the vessel is open does not alter the
                    result, because it only carries off its own heat. By this mode of operating, the
                    ratio between the small quantities <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> can
                    evidently be ascertained with incomparably greater exactness than by any
                    thermometer whatever. The distinguished German philosopher Lambert had long ago
                    contrived to operate on air in such a way that it showed the changes of its own
                    temperature; and no doubt it has been the uncertainty attending the employment
                    of thermometers in more recent researches on air, that has led to such strange
                    and paradoxical results, and wh ch has called in the aid of so many fanciful
                    hypotheses regarding the nature of heat. Indeed there is no time for a
                    thermometer of any sort acquiring the minute change of temperature denoted by
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                <p>• Since we shall presently see that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is to <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> either exactly or very nearly as 4 to 3, it will conduce to
                    greater simplicity if we now give this value to that ratio. But it s obvious,
                    that during the small moment the vessel was open, the air which remained in it,
                    having its temperature slightly depressed, could not lose heat, and had not time
                    to gain any; so that the total heat in that remainder may be regarded as
                    constant during the operation. Hence the same quantity of heat which had been
                    sufficient to keep the air <hi rend="italic">m</hi> degrees or 4° above its
                    original temperature while confined in the vessel, shows itself to be only able,
                    while again put under the original pressure, to maintain an excess of <hi

                    heat, therefore, which would produce a given minute change, for instance, one
                    degree in the temperature of air, and which variation is usually called its
                    specific heat, must be one third greater when the air is free to change its
                    volume under a constant pressure, than if confined in an inextensible
                    vessel.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the experiment would be essentially the same, if the vessel,
                    in place of being brought from a colder apartment, were to have as much
                    additional air injected into it as should make the gauge indicate 4° above the
                    external pressure, after the temperature of the included air has settled to that
                    of the room; the rest of the process, as to opening and promptly shutting again
                    the vessel, being as already described. Now, in either method it is obvious,
                    that at the instant of suddenly re-shutting the vessel, the included air, being
                    brought to an equilibrium with the atmosphere, had, with reference to pressure,
                    lost all the additional 4°; while, as the second indication of the gauge, viz.
                    1°, shows it had only lost 3° with regard to density, one of the lost degrees of
                    pressure being therefore due to momentary depression of temperature. Hence, the
                    height of the barometer, or whole pressure, is to the variation of pressure

                <p>Such is nearly the mode of experimenting followed by Mr Meikle, as detailed at

                    more recently repeated with an improved apparatus, fully as large as the former
                    one, which contained 2310 cubic inches, but with the advantage of having four
                    apertures, amounting together to twenty-five square inches, which can be both
                    opened and shut again so promptly, that the time of their being open is only a
                    small fraction of a second. Something similar had been previously practised,
                    though with a less perfect apparatus <hi rend="italic">{Journal de Physique</hi>

                    which is very nearly the relation obtained by Mr Meikle from a mean of many
                    experiments, and with either apparatus; but they make <hi rend="italic"

                    considerable; and the following consideration, we think, renders it extremely
                    probable that the former is the true relation. Sir Isaac Newton has shown <hi
                    rend="italic">ÇPrincipia,</hi> lib. ii. prop. 23), that if in an elastic fluid
                    the cube of the pressure vary as the <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> + 2 power of the
                    density, the particles should repel each other with forces inversely as the rth
                    powers of their distances; and similar investigations and results may be seen in
                    other elementary works. Now, these experiments of the French philosophers just
                    named make the cube of the pressure proportional to the 4∙1244 power of the
                    density, as is evident if we put 3 and 4*1244 in place of wand <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> in art. 3. Hence <hi rend="italic">r</hi> — 2∙1244, and therefore the
                    particles would repel each other with forces inversely as the 2∙1244 powers of
                    their distances; a law of which there is no known parallel in nature. But if the
                    ratio of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to <hi rend="italic">m</hi> were that of 3 to
                    4, and these numbers were substituted as indices in art. 3, we should have = ,
                    or the cube of the pressure varying as the fourth power of the density; and
                    consequently, the repulsion between the particles of the air would vary
                    inversely as the squares of their distances, which is the only known law of
                    repulsion, and most likely the only one which exists.</p>
                <p>It had long been well known in a general way, that when air has its volume or
                    bulk changed so suddenly as to afford little or no time during the process for
                    its either imparting heat to or receiving it from surrounding bodies, the
                    pressure is at that instant changed in a much higher ratio than the density is.
                    This was quite sufficient to render it certain, that whatever might be precisely
                    the true law of repulsion, it must follow something very different from the
                    reciprocal of the simple distance, which supposes the pressure and density to
                    vary in the same ratio. For it was as well known, that during cases where the
                    pressure has varied in the same ratio as the density, time enough has always
                    elapsed for the air either imparting to or receiving from surrounding bodies as
                    much heat as it may either have evolved by compression or absorbed by
                    dilatation; because compression, by tending to warm the air, induces it to give
                    out heat, and dilatation, by tending to cool the air, induces it to receive
                    heat. But when, from cases in which the pressure had varied in the same ratio as
                    the density, Newton inferred that the particles of air repelled each other with
                    forces inversely as their simple distances, he was quite excusable; because the
                    facts just noticed were not known in his time, nor were they indeed attended to
                    till towards the end of last century. The like excuse, however, cannot so well
                    be pleaded for Dr Dalton, who, in speculating on the constitution of the
                    atmosphere so lately as in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1826,
                    just adopts the law of repulsion deduced by Newton, and without making the
                    slightest objection to it on the score now stated. The French savans. again, in
                    having virtually made the repulsion vary inversely as the 2T244 power of the
                    distance, seem to have run a little into the opposite extreme. But when they
                    adopted that conclusion, they were perhaps influenced a little by Laplace’s
                    theory of sound, which required something of the sort to help it out, and for
                    which indeed the experiments of Gay-Lussac and Welter were purposely undertaken.
                    The defect of the theory, we presume, lies rather in its not including the share
                    which it is likely the re-action of the earth’s surface has in accelerating the
                    transmission of sound. For it seems reasonable to think, that since the air
                    presses strongly on the earth’s surface, it must, while propagating sound, both
                    set that surface a vibrating, and, in return, have its own vibrations
                    accelerated thereby; because the vibrations of the earth’s surface should
                    incline to be more frequent than those of air. Such at least seems to be the
                    case with the vibrations of solids and liquids generally; though these again
                    differ widely among themselves, and should of course affect the velocity of
                    sound differently. According to this suggestion, the louder or the more intense
                    the sound, the more fully will the earth s surface be brought into action, and
                    consequently the greater, <hi rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi> should be its
                    accelerating influence. A similar defect, as we hinted above, seems to attach to
                    the many attempts which have been made to determine the frequency of the
                    vibrations of elastic fluids by means of windinstruments; no allowance being
                    made for the influence which it is likely the vibrations of the materials
                    composing the wind-instruments have on the frequency of the vibrations of the
                    gas under examination.</p>
                <p>We shall now enter on the consideration of hygrometers which are formed of
                    materials comparatively free from decay, which are constant or consistent in
                    their indications, and which, in short, seem in a great measure to possess the
                    first five of the properties already specified, which Saussure considered
                    necessary to a perfect hygrometer: as for his sixth, we regard it as
                    supererogatory. The fact that humid air readily wets bodies which are colder
                    than itself, such as stones and walls at the commencement of a thaw, must have
                    been familiar to mankind from the remotest antiquity ;, though it has not been
                    long known that dew or hoar-frost affords the most universal example of this all
                    the world over; being moisture deposited on bodies which have been sufficiently
                    cooled by radiation below the temperature of the incumbent air. The ancients
                    appear to have conjectured that a copious deposition of moisture on cold bodies
                    prognosticated bad weather; but the first step perhaps towards applying this
                    principle to the construction of a hygrometer was made by the Florentine
                    academicians, who having suspended in the open air a conical vessel filled with
                    snow or pounded ice, supposed the humidity of the air to be proportional to the
                    quantity of moisture which, being condensed on the exterior surface of this
                    vessel, trickled down its sides, and dropt from the apex of the cone. This,
                    however, could afford but a very vague estimate of the humidity of the air;
                    because the quantity of moisture thus collected must obviously have depended in
                    a great measure on the velocity of the wind; and such an estimate would be still
                    more erroneous, or rather useless altogether, in the time of frost. The same
                    idea was farther improved upon by M. Leroy of Montpellier, who, by dropping ice
                    into water contained in a vessel with a bright exterior surface, gradually
                    lowered its temperature, till dew began to be deposited from the contiguous air
                    on that surface. Saussure substituted sal ammoniac for ice, and different salts
                    have been employed by others for the same purpose. The temperature to which the
                    vessel is thus brought at the moment of incipient deposition, is obviously the
                    temperature to which, if the air were cooled under the same pressure, the vapour
                    in it would be in a state of saturation, or ready to deposit dew upon any thing
                    in the least degree colder than itself. Such temperature is therefore
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">dew-point.</hi> Did the air, in cooling,
                    undergo no diminution of volume, it would not be brought to a state of
                    saturation with moisture, till it were cooled below <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    the temperature of the air through a range greater nearly in the ratio of 1 fl—
                    to 1 than that which obUv brings it to the dew-point. Some writers do not seem
                    aware of there being any difference between these points of saturation; and
                    others have such confused notions of it, that not unfrequently they transpose
                    them; though no <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939375" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9375-0121"
                    />thing is more certain than that these temperatures cannot be the same, and
                    that the dew-point is the higher of-the two. For if <hi rend="italic">t</hi> be
                    the actual temperature of the air, and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> the dew-point,
                    since the pressure is the same in both cases, the actual density of the air is
                    to its density when cooled to the dew-point, in the inverse ratio of <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> + 448° <hi rend="italic subscript"> t0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">yt</hi> + 448°, as was shown above regarding the expansion of air;
                    but since all elastic fluids yet tried expand or contract at the same rate by
                    the same change of temperature, the density of the vapour at the dew-point must
                    therefore be greater in the above ratio than its density at the actual
                    temperature, which is the same as its density would be were the air cooled
                    without shrinkage. This, however, is not meant to prove the above ratio to be
                    the very law of nature.</p>

                    at the temperature <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p>But when the vapour is not in a state of saturation, as, for instance, when the
                    actual temperature of the air is 60°, and the dew-point only 40°, we proceed
                    thus :—Opposite 40° in the first column of the table we find ∙2644 inch in the
                    second for the actual force of vapour in the air; but from what has been shown
                    above regarding the expansion of elastic fluids, the density at 60°,
                    corresponding to a force of ∙2644, must be less than if the temperature were
                    40°, in the ratio of 40 + 448 to 60 + 448, or of 1∙0167 to 1∙0583 (viz. using
                    the numbers in the fourth column opposite 40° and 60°). We must therefore reduce
                    in that ratio the maximum weight in a cubic foot at 40°, namely, l*016 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> 7 <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi></p>
                <p>3∙066 grains, which will make it 7-77757r × 3∙066 = 2∙945 l*(Juσo grains for the
                    actual weight of moisture in the air, corresponding to a temperature of 38° ∙8;
                    so that, had the air been cooled down to 38° ∙8, without shrinkage, or under the
                    original volume, the vapour would have been brought to a state of saturation.
                    The temperature 38° ∙8, as already observed, is lower than the dew-point by very
                    nearly <hi rend="italic">t</hi> + 448</p>
                <p>— <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>-—— times the difference between the dew-point and
                    8b00</p>
                <p>the temperature of the air. Thus 38° ∙8 = 40° — (60 — 40) <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">5θ8∕</hi>; which affords a ready mode of computing this
                    lower point of saturation without the aid of any table.</p>
                <p>It is much more convenient to use the grains in a cubic foot than the small
                    fraction of a grain in a cubic inch; because the latter requires more figures to
                    express it with the same accuracy. But it is not so much from pretensions to
                    superior exactness that we use so many decimal places in these columns, as to
                    render the differences of the numbers more uniform, which is of conseque nce
                    when there is any occasion for taking proportional parts, or interpolating
                    between them.</p>

                <p>The principles already explained will make the construction and use of Professor
                    Daniell’s elegant instrument easily understood. It is represented in its full
                    dimensions in fig. 8, Plate CCXCV. where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> are two thin glass balls of 1∙25 inch in diameter,
                    connected by a tube having a bore of about ∙125 inch. The tube is bent at right
                    angles over the two balls; and the arm <hi rend="italic">be</hi> contains a
                    small thermometer <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> whose bulb, which is of an oval
                    form, descends into the ball <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This ball having been
                    about two thirds filled with ether, is heated over a lamp till the liquid boils,
                    and the vapour issues from the capillary tube/on the under side of the ball a.
                    The vapour having expelled the air from both balls, the capillary tube /is
                    hermetically closed by the flame of a lamp. This process is familiar to those
                    who are accustomed to blow glass, and may be known to have succeeded after the
                    tube has become cool, by reversing the instrument, and taking one of the balls
                    in the hand, the heat of which will cause the ether to boil rapidly, and pass
                    wholly over by distillation into the other ball. The ball <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is now to be covered with a piece of muslin. The stand <hi rend="italic"
                    >gh</hi> is of brass, and the transverse socket <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is made
                    to hold the glass tube in the manner of a spring, allowing it to turn and be
                    taken out with little difficulty. Another small thermometer <hi rend="italic"
                    >hl</hi> is inserted into the pillar of the stand. The manner of using the
                    instrument is this After having driven all the ether <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939401" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9401-0123"/>into the ball <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> by the heat of the hand applied to the ball <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the instrument is to be placed at an open window, or out
                    of doors, with the ball <hi rend="italic">b</hi> so situated as that the surface
                    of the liquid may be upon a level with the eye of the observer. A little ether
                    is then to be dropped upon the covered ball. Evaporation immediately takes
                    place, which, by abstracting heat, cools the ball «, and causes a rapid and
                    continuous condensation of the ethereal vapour within it, together with a
                    diminution of pressure. The consequent evaporation from the included ether
                    produces a depression of temperature in the ball <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the
                    degree of which is measured by the thermometer <hi rend="italic">de.</hi> This
                    action is almost instantaneous, and the thermometer begins to fall in two
                    seconds after the ether has been dropped. A depression of thirty or forty
                    degrees is easily produced, and the ether may be sometimes seen to boil when the
                    thermometer is below the zero of Fahrenheit. So soon as the ball <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is cooled by this artificial process down to the dewpoint
                    of the surrounding air, a condensation of the atmospheric moisture takes place
                    upon its surface, and this first makes its appearance in a narrow ring of dew on
                    a level with the surface of the ether. The temperature at which this occurs,
                    viz. the dew-point, is to be carefully noted. A little practice may be necessary
                    to seize the exact moment of first deposition, but certainty is very soon
                    acquired. It is advisable, when the ball <hi rend="italic">b of</hi> the
                    instrument has been made of transparent glass, to have some dark object behind
                    it, such as a house or a tree, because the cloud is not so readily perceived
                    against the sky or open horizon. The depression of temperature is first produced
                    at the surface of the liquid, where evaporation takes place, and the currents
                    which immediately ensue to effect an equilibrium are very perceptible. We may
                    here remark by the by, that since the covered ball <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must
                    be fully the colder of the two, there is reason to think, that while it is
                    throwing off and furnishing latent heat for ethereal vapour, it is very likely
                    condensing aqueous vapour and absorbing its latent heat. The bulb of the
                    enclosed thermometer <hi rend="italic">de</hi> is but partially immersed in the
                    ether, with the view of making the line of greatest cold pass through it; but
                    this we shall find to be a faulty arrangement. In very damp or windy weather,
                    the ether should be very slowly dropped upon the ball, otherwise the descent of
                    the thermometer will be so rapid as to render it extremely difficult to be
                    certain of the degree at which deposition commences. In dry weather, on the
                    contrary, the ball requires to be well wetted more than once, to produce a
                    sufficient cold. If at any time there should be reason to suspect the accuracy
                    of an observation, it may, according to Mr Daniell, be corrected by observing
                    the temperature at which the dew upon the glass again disappears: the mean of
                    the two observations should give the true result; because their errors, he
                    thinks, if any, should lie in contrary directions. This, however, is on the
                    supposition that the error lies all with the observer, and that the instrument
                    itself is faultless; whereas we shall shortly see reason to conclude that,
                    unless it be agitated during an observation, it has a tendency to give the
                    dewpoint too high, owing to every part of the bulb of the included thermometer
                    not being alike exposed to the cooling effects of the ether. It is obvious that
                    care should be taken not to permit the breath to come into contact with the
                    glass.</p>
                <p>Mr Daniell’s hygrometer may also be applied to artificial atmospheres, and
                    experiments on air or other gas confined in a vessel. Fig. 9 represents a
                    receiver and hygrometer prepared for this purpose; and the following is the
                    manner in which they were fitted up. A hole is perforated in the side of the
                    receiver, through which the tube proceeding from the ball within it containing
                    the thermometer is first passed, and then welded by means of a lamp to the tube
                    attached to the other ball outside the receiver. The stem is secured in the hole
                    of the receiver with cement, the ether is boiled, and the capillary tube closed,
                    as before described. The external ball is then to be covered with muslin, and
                    ether being dropped upon it, the consequent evaporation produces, in the manner
                    already explained, a corresponding degree of coldness in the internal ball. The
                    state of humidity within may be ascertained by noting the temperature at which
                    dew begins to appear on that ball. In delicate experiments, a lighted taper in a
                    glass lantern, placed behind the instrument, renders the deposition more easily
                    visible, and ensures accuracy. The hygrometric properties of any substance, or
                    its power of absorbing moisture, may thus be readily estimated, by placing it
                    under the receiver, and marking the fall which it occasions in the dewpoint. By
                    means of this apparatus Mr Daniell made a variety of experiments, from which it
                    appeared, as Deluc, Dalton, and others had asserted, that the quantity of
                    moisture which can exist in a given volume depends solely on the temperature,
                    and is not influenced by the presence or density of air or other elastic fluids,
                    provided no chemical action occur.</p>
                <p>There have been various attempts to improve upon Mr Daniell’s hygrometer, or to
                    contrive a more simple one which should serve the same purpose. About ten years
                    ago, several instruments, essentially the same in principle, though differing
                    widely in contrivance from Mr Daniell’s, were proposed in different quarters
                    with this view. The leading features in their construction are, to cover
                    partially the bulb of a large thermometer with muslin, silk, cambric, or the
                    like; to wet this with ether; and to observe at what degree of that thermometer
                    moisture is deposited on the uncovered part of its bulb. A more simple
                    construction for directly observing the dew-point was scarcely to be expected,
                    but unfortunately it was soon found to be very fallacious. For, owing to the
                    uncovered partof the bulb not being directly exposed to the cooling effects of
                    the evaporation, its temperature, viz. the dew-point, is generally several
                    degrees higher than the mean temperature of the bulb, or that indicated on the
                    scale of the thermometer; so that such instruments generally give a dew-point
                    considerably below the truth, and the error is found to be greater when the bulb
                    is of an elongated or cylindrical form than when spherical. This error may be
                    made manifest in several ways, but the preferable one seems to be to observe the
                    dew-point at the same time by the method of Leroy, as improved by Saussure and
                    Dalton, namely, to cool down water in a bright vessel by dropping in colder
                    water, ice, or salts, and to stir it with a thermometer till dew just begin to
                    appear on the exterior surface of the vessel. The thermometer will at that
                    instant indicate the dewpoint with great accuracy if the vessel is thin, and
                    especially if of metal.</p>
                <p>The discovery of such a defect in these instruments led to a careful examination
                    of Mr Daniell’s hygrometer by the same test; and the result was, that it is
                    liable to the contrary error of giving the dew-point above the truth. For since
                    in that instrument the deposition occurs in a narrow ring or zone on a level
                    with the surface of the enclosed ether, which, during the cooling, is
                    considerably colder at the surface than beneath; and since the elongated bulb of
                    the enclosed thermometer is only half immersed in this ether, it is evident that
                    scarcely half of this bulb is subjected to so great a cold as that which
                    produces the deposition of moisture. As to any cooling effect of the ethereal
                    vapour on the upper half of the ball, it must be extremely feeble compared with
                    the cooling influence of that liquid itself, as is evident from the effect which
                    agitating the ether round the whole bulb of the thermometer has in lowering its
                    indication. In place therefore of an observation with this hygrometer being <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939414" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9414-0124"/> “simple,
                    expeditious, easy, and certain,” it is evident, that unless the instrument is
                    shaken, or the observation made so slowly and cautiously as to allow the bulb of
                    the included thermometer time to become all of one temperature, it cannot fail
                    to give the dew-point too high; so that the more clever or expeditious any one
                    fancies himself to be in using this instrument, so much the farther is his
                    observation likely to be from the truth.</p>
                <p>A substitute for this instrument, preferable to any of the foregoing, has been
                    contrived by Mr John Adie, and is described in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Journal of Science</hi> (new series, vol. i. page 60). A thermometer having a
                    small bulb is enclosed in an exterior bulb or case of black glass, which is
                    covered with silk, excepting a small space about a quarter of an inch in
                    diameter, where the deposition is to be observed. The space between the outer
                    and inner bulbs is nearly filled with any liquid not liable to freeze by the
                    depression of temperature required for finding a dewpoint, as alcohol, mercury,
                    linseed oil, &amp;c. When an observation is to be made, ether is applied to the
                    silk, and the instrument is kept in a state of gentle agitation, to render the
                    inner and outer bulbs all of one temperature. With this instrument Mr Adie
                    obtained constant results, not differing more than half a degree from Leroy’s
                    method, already described. The following table exhibits the results in
                    twenty-eight cases, as observed with five different dew-point instruments. The
                    first column is the temperature of the air; the second the dew-point, as
                    observed by Leroy’s method; the third, by Mr Adie’s instrument; the fourth, by
                    Mr Daniell’s; the fifth, by the large thermometer, having a round bulb partially
                    covered with muslin; the sixth, by the same kind of thermometer with an
                    elongated or cylindrical bulb.</p>

                <p>It has been objected to Mr Adie’s instrument, that the dew being formed alike
                    quite over the uncovered part of the outer bulb, it does not exhibit that fine
                    contrast between the clean and bedewed parts which Mr Daniell’s bulb does, and
                    which renders the commencement of deposition better defined. But an equally good
                    contrast, we presume, might easily be produced by forming a small blister
                    air-bubble, or other double spot, in the glass or metal of which the cover is
                    made. No dew would form on this spot, at least till long after it had begun on
                    the adjacent surface. Another objection is, that the air immediately round the
                    spot where the deposition occurs is strongly impregnated with ether, which may
                    possibly have some effect on the commencement of deposition, especially at
                    temperatures and pressures beyond the range of these experiments, and where the
                    dew-points are much farther below the temperature of the air.</p>
                <p>Μ. Pouillet has produced a different substitute for Mr Daniell’s hygrometer. The
                    stem of a thermometer descends through, is closely fitted into, and secured in,
                    a perforation in the bottom of a small silver cup; the bulb only of the
                    thermometer being left above within the cup. When this instrument is to be used,
                    ether is poured into the cup till it cover the bulb, and the consequent
                    evaporation producing cold, causes a deposition of dew in the form of a narrow
                    ring on the outside of the cup, and on a level with the surface of the ether.
                    But owing to the whole bulb of the thermometer not being exposed to so great a
                    cold as that at the surface of the ether, and which causes the deposition of
                    dew, we should suspect this contrivance of being liable to give the dew-point
                    too high, though not perhaps to the same extent as Mr Daniell’s. There is
                    likewise reason to think that the cup, if deep, would retard the evaporation,
                    while, if shallow, it could not prevent the wind from blowing the ether over its
                    sides. But perhaps both these inconveniences might be avoided by having a bit of
                    muslin stretched close over the surface of the ether, and as if swimming in it;
                    though this again, by retarding the circulation of the ether in the cup, might
                    tend to augment the error in the indication of the thermometer.</p>
                <p>We have sometimes thought that a construction combining the advantages, and
                    avoiding the defects, of these several contrivances, might be obtained, without
                    departing so far from the form of Mr Daniell’s instrument. Thus, if the
                    uncovered bulb <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which contains the ether in his
                    hygrometer, had a blister or air-bubble formed in the glass, the exterior
                    surface of this would remain dry or free from dew, at least till the cold went
                    far below the dew-point; so that, without running any risk of obliterating the
                    contrast between the clear and bedewed parts of the bulb, we might agitate the
                    instrument sufficiently to ensure that the thermometer within should indicate
                    the temperature of the bedewed surface. When the exterior bulb is of metal, it
                    would be equally easy to make a small part of its side double for the same
                    purpose. There would then be no need for bending the tube, to keep the
                    re-condensed ether from running down and cooling the upper half of the exterior
                    bulb, if indeed that was the design of bending it; for Mr Daniell assigns no
                    reason either for bending the tube or having it so very long. But it is evident,
                    that by keeping the tube straight and much shorter, the instrument would be
                    greatly simplified, and rendered much less liable to accidents. In this form,
                    too, it could be as readily suspended perpendicularly as before, by merely
                    slipping the tube into the forked end of a branch proceeding from the top of the
                    pillar. Perhaps it may be said that the design of the tube’s being so long was
                    to keep the ethereal vapour at a distance from the spot where dew is to be
                    deposited; but this, if intended, is effectually defeated by the bending of the
                    tube, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939427" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9427-0125"
                    />brings the bulbs as near each other as if the covered one were only a little
                    above the stem of the enclosed thermometer. Whether any chemical action may take
                    place between the aqueous and ethereal vapours, which could sensibly affect the
                    deposition of dew, we could not pretend to say; but it is natural to think that
                    the expansive force of the ethereal vapour should distend or dilate the air'and
                    moisture, which would tend to lower the dew-point. Mr Adie’s experiments, it is
                    true, seem to give the dew-point the same as by Leroy’s method; but in his cases
                    given above, the dew-point is generally so little below the temperature of the
                    air as to have required very little ether to produce the requisite cooling; so
                    that it may have been owing to the comparatively feeble state of the ethereal
                    vapour that the dew-point was not sensibly affected; or possibly the chemical
                    and mechanical effects of the ether on the dew-point might be opposed tor each
                    other. But it is surely more safe to avoid any risk of this sort altogether.
                    With any sort of dew-point instrument, it must be difficult to observe at low
                    temperatures the precise degree at which the vapour is cooled to saturation,
                    owing to its extreme tenuity. For unless the bright surface be sensibly colder
                    than the air to which it is presented, the commencement of deposition is not
                    likely to be readily noticed in very attenuated vapour.</p>
                <p>Dr James Hutton seems to have been the first who thought of applying the
                    comparison of the different indications which a thermometer exhibits in a dry
                    and in a moistened state to the purposes of hygrometry. With this view he had a
                    thermometer enclosed in a glass tube hermetically sealed, which he first held in
                    a proper situation till it acquired and showed the temperature of the air. Then
                    having dipped it in water, he held the end of the tube which contained the bulb
                    towards the current of air, and observing how much the thermometer had been
                    lowered by evaporation, he regarded the depression as a measure of the dryness
                    of the air. This view of the matter, though not quite correct, was a wonderful
                    step, considering how little was then known regarding the laws which regulate
                    the diffusion of aqueous vapour in air or other elastic fluids. But instead of
                    employing only one thermometer, and enclosing it, as Dr Hutton did, in a glass
                    tube, it is found not only more convenient, but conducing to greater accuracy,
                    to use two thermometers; one of which notes the actual temperature of the air,
                    while the other, having its bulb covered with muslin, silk, cambric, or the
                    like, and moistened with pure water, shows the temperature as depressed by
                    evaporation. We have found it to be still more convenient to have both
                    thermometers mounted on one broad and doubly graduated scale, and both might be
                    of the self-registering sort. Soft paper has sometimes been used to cover the
                    thermometer; but if it contain any soluble matter, it is apt to render the water
                    impure, and vitiate the results. In short, whatever sort of covering is used,
                    care should be taken to have it both clean and free from every thing which may
                    affect the purity of the water. Thus the thermometer is found to be much less
                    cooled by evaporation when moistened with brackish water than with fresh. Some
                    cover the bulbs of both thermometers, with the view of having the surfaces as
                    nearly alike as possible, and of one colour, to obviate any unequal effects of
                    light or radiation; the nearer to white of course the better.</p>

                    too has repeatedly expressed a desire to receive a satisfactory exposition of
                    the theory of this instrument, and has requested observers to institute
                    comparative experiments between its indications and the corresponding
                    dew-points, as obtained by the methods already described. So that, when once
                    comparisons of this sort have been made in circumstances sufficiently varied for
                    the different states of the air, this hygrometer, from the durability and
                    simplicity of its construction, the extreme facility with which it can be used,
                    and the consistency of its indications in like states of the air, bids fair to
                    come into more general use than any other; and this, we should think, is likely
                    to be the case in a very few years. One of its most remarkable features, and
                    which adds greatly to its value, is, that its indications are scarcely affected
                    by any ordinary wind. They are, however, as will be noticed after, somewhat
                    under the influence of the atmospheric pressure, but so slightly, that at the
                    same place variations of pressure may in ordinary cases be neglected. When the
                    moist thermometer is below 32°, about an eighth part of its depression below the
                    temperature of the air is owing to the expense of heat for liquefying the ice
                    previously to evaporation; the heat of liquidity being about a seventh part of
                    the latent heat of the vapour; but this is a point which, so far as we know, has
                    not yet been examined by any direct experiments.</p>
                <p>When this instrument is first exposed to the drying influence of air, in which
                    the aqueous vapour is not already in a state of saturation, evaporation takes
                    place, and lowers the temperature of the moist bulb, by abstracting heat from it
                    for the formation of additional vapour; but a limit is soon set to the fall of
                    temperature by the surrounding air, which, in successively touching the wet and
                    colder surface, imparts heat to it; and also no doubt by the warmer surrounding
                    bodies throwing in a little heat upon the colder bulb by radiation. The heat
                    thus imparted and thrown in is next to all we can think of as being continually
                    supplied to the moist surface, and spent in the formation of new vapour, the
                    supply being of course exactly equal to the expenditure, which depends on the
                    drying influence of the air; and so does the difference of temperature, though
                    the precise relations between them have not yet been determined. It might indeed
                    be supposed that the stem of the thermometer should convey a little heat to the
                    moist bulb; but the stem being of glass, is a bad conductor, and any heat which
                    it supplies must be very inconsiderable, since it makes no sensible difference
                    whether we apply a wet covering to the bulb alone, or continue it along a part
                    of the stem. However, in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopoedia,</hi>
                    art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry,</hi> Dr Anderson advances the doctrine,
                    that the moist bulb itself furnishes all the heat spent in the formation of new
                    vapour; whereas we cannot conceive how it can continue to furnish the smallest
                    portion of heat after the process has fairly commenced, any more than a hot iron
                    could continue to furnish heat to the air after it has been cooled down to the
                    temperature of the air. Dr Anderson has, in the same article, and afterwards in
                    different volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil. Jour,</hi> (first
                    series), given a variety of investigations connected with the use of the
                    moist-bulb hygrometer; but as they involve the idea that the capacity of air for
                    moisture is, <hi rend="italic">coeterisparibus,</hi> proportional to the
                    barometric pressure, his results necessarily diverge widely from the truth, when
                    applied to cases materially different from those on which they are founded.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, the extent of the depression of temperature is scarcely
                    affected by any ordinary wind; but unless the heat which surrounding bodies
                    throw in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939440" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9440-0126"/>by
                    radiation on the colder bulb be quite inappreciable, this constancy of
                    depression, so far from proving that the cooling influence of evaporation is
                    independent of the wind, would rather argue that it is less as the velocity of
                    the wind is greater. For since evaporation increases with the wind, while
                    radiation is believed to be independent of it, it follows that the heat supplied
                    by radiation not increasing in the same ratio as the expenditure or new vapour
                    does, the depression, in place of being constant, as it is found to be, ought to
                    increase with the velocity of the wind. Hence either the heat supplied by
                    radiation is inconsiderable, or, which is more probable, the cooling influence
                    of evaporation is less as the velocity of the wind is greater. From experiments
                    described by Mr Meikle in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil. Jour. ιox</hi>
                    January 1827, it appears that giving a pretty rapid motion to a moist
                    thermometer in air confined over sulphuric acid, tended considerably to increase
                    the depression of temperature; but it may be questioned whether this was not
                    owing to the agitation of the apparatus enabling the acid to render the air
                    drier.</p>
                <p>Philosophers are by no means agreed regarding the theory of this instrument,
                    which, as we shall afterwards see, is involved in great difficulty and
                    obscurity; but this is of less consequence, since a complete theory does not
                    seem necessary to enable us to apply it to hygrometric purposes. For when once
                    the dew-points corresponding to a sufficient variety of indications of the wet
                    and dry thermometers and of the barometer have been well ascertained, a table of
                    dew-points may be constructed from them, having for its entries or arguments the
                    indications of the wet and dry thermometers, corrected, if necessary, for the
                    particular pressure; so that, when aided by such a table, the indications of the
                    wet and dry thermometers, and of the barometer, may obviously give us the
                    dewpoint, whether we know any thing of the theory or not.</p>
                <p>The results of experiments determining the dew-point for a considerable number of
                    indications of the wet and dry thermometers, and under various pressures, though

                <p>The dew-points in the sixth column do not differ very materially from
                    observation; but the temperatures from which they were computed had first to be
                    corrected for the barometric pressure, being different from thirty inches. The
                    precise rule for estimating such a correction is as yet unknown; but it appears
                    that, for the same temperature of the moist bulb, the difference between it and
                    the dry thermometer, when the pressure amounts to thirty inches, is to their
                    difference under any other pressure B, nearly in the inverse ratio of 57 to 27 +
                    B. On this supposition, <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi

                    of the air. Although the temperature of the moist bulb is the one which is more
                    immediately affected by pressure, it is considered easier to compute a tolerable
                    correction to be applied to the other thermometer, so as still to lead to the
                    same result. Some account of experiments relating to this will be found under
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Evaporation</hi>; though, perhaps, owing to the
                    greater dryness and small volume of air operated on, the effect of pressure in
                    most of the experiments there described seems to be greater than in the open
                    air.</p>
                <p>A considerable number of experiments on the dewpoints corresponding to the
                    indications of the moist and dry thermometers, though only between the
                    temperatures of 69° ∙5 and 56° ∙25, are given in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Phd. Jour.</hi> for October 1834; but being made under the ordinary pressure,
                    they throw no light on the effects of different pressures; and, considering how
                    little the dew-points go below the temperature of the air, these experiments can
                    scarcely be said to agree so well, either among themselves or with the formula,
                    as the other 15 given above. The author supposes the discrepancies to be owing
                    to the uncertainty attending the use of Daniell’s hygrometer, with which they
                    had been observed.</p>
                <p>By means of the preceding formula for expressing the relations between the
                    temperatures <hi rend="italic">t, t’, t’',</hi> the same ingenious author has
                    computed the following table of dewpoints, which, however, we have arranged in a
                    more compact form, and curtailed considerably. For since it seems better to
                    leave extreme cases, and such as are of rare occurrence, to be computed by some
                    formula, than to swell out the tables to embrace them, we have omitted all that
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939453" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9453-0127"/>part of the
                    table winch went above the temperature of 100°; and really wish we had been
                    possessed of data to have authorized its extension downward, if possible, to the
                    zero of Fahrenheit. The argument or entry on the lefthand side is the
                    temperature of the air, while the excess of that over the temperature of the
                    moist bulb is the argument on the top. But if at the time of observation the
                    barometer has differed from thirty inches, these argu ments should first be
                    corrected by means of the small table in the lower right-hand corner, which is
                    to be entered at the bottom with the barometric pressure, and on the right side
                    with the observed difference between the wet and dry thermometers. The number
                    thus obtained from this small table is to be subtracted from both the arguments
                    of the large table when the pressure falls short of thirty inches, and added
                    when it is greater.</p>

                <p>A different mode of obtaining from the same data, not only the dew-point, but
                    likewise the force, weight, &amp;c. of moisture in the air, has been proposed by
                    Mr Meikle, in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil. Jour,</hi> for July 1834 and
                    April 1835, to consist of certain graduated lines or scales delineated on a
                    plane, and are to be used by laying over it any thing most convenient which will
                    form a straight line, such as a common ruler, a thread stretched, &amp;c. This
                    sort of scheme is not deduced from theory, but merely from observation, and
                    seems to adm it of being varied very considerably in its form; though it is
                    likely that, when more numerous and certain data have been obtained, some
                    particular modification will be found to have the advantage of the rest. For we
                    are not aware of any accurate experiments having yet been made on the moist-bulb
                    hygrometer at low temperatures. Plate CCXCVI. shows one of the various forms
                    proposed for this purpose in the articles just cited, though it is not here
                    followed up in every particular. The mode of using it will be pretty evident
                    from inspection. If a straight line or ruler be applied to the temperature of
                    the air on the left-hand curve, and at the same time, to the temperature of the
                    moist bulb on the oblique straight line, it will both mark the dew-point on the
                    scale so named on the right, and at the same time show on the other scale, a
                    little farther to the right, the weight of moisture actually diffused in a cubic
                    foot of the surrounding air, in grains and tenths of a grain. The like degrees
                    of temperature on the <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> different scales are
                    everywhere disposed in a horizontal straight line. If otherwise arranged, these
                    scales could not be used by simply laying a straight line over them, as is
                    evident if we take a case in which the vapour approaches saturation. The oblique
                    straight line is an asymptote to the two curves nearest it, which are meant for
                    hyperbolas; but the divisions for degrees of temperature decrease a little
                    downward in the lower part of the figure. It has been objected, that the
                    hyperbolas would not suit air absolutely dry, and a dew-point infinitely low;
                    but it is shown at length in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil. Jour,</hi>
                    for April 1835, that no such case can ever occur in using the moist bulb, and
                    that this scheme is not restricted to hyperbolas. The results obtained by this
                    method sometimes differ considerably at low temperatures from those of the large
                    table of dew-points; but we know of no experiments to decide how far any of them
                    may be right at low temperatures.</p>
                <p>We have thought it better at present not to encumber the diagram with what was
                    originally proposed in this scheme as a correction for pressure, because there
                    seems still to be some uncertainty regarding the precise allowance. But when the
                    barometer differs from thirty inches, the approximate correction, which was
                    already noticed above, may be employed here. It is equivalent to using <hi
                    rend="italic">t’</hi>-J ð?— × <hi rend="italic">(t</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    t’) in place of the actual temperature of the air. The force of vapour
                    corresponding to a known dew-point is sufficiently well ascertained for ordinary
                    purposes; but we have likewise at present omitted the scale proposed for it, in
                    order not to render the scheme too complicated at its first outset. The same
                    allowance for frost will of course be required here as in any other method with
                    the moist-bulb hygrometer.</p>
                <p>Were this project fully realized, that is, if by merely laying a ruler across the
                    plate in the manner above mentioned, the dew-point and weight, &amp;c. of the
                    vapour in the air could be indicated at once, and without computation, it would
                    obviously be one of the most convenient methods yet employed for the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>We shall now endeavour briefly to sketch out a few steps towards an investigation
                    of the relation between the dew-point and the corresponding indications of the
                    moist-bulb hygrometer, and have to regret that the present imperfect state of
                    the data does not warrant or enable us to render it more complete. It was shown
                    above, that the value of any particular degree on Fahrenheit’s scale of an
                    air-thermometer, that is, the increment or decrement of heat necessary to
                    produce a change of one degree by Fahrenheit’s scale, in the temperature of a
                    given mass of air under a constant pressure, will be inversely as the distance
                    of that degree from — 448°. But when the volume and pressure are both constant,
                    with a variable mass, the increment, decrement, or specific heat for one degree
                    of Fahrenheit, will, so far as depends on change of temperature, be inversely as
                    the square of the distance of that degree from — 448°, viz. in the ratio
                    compounded of the mass or density of the air and the value of a degree, each of
                    which varies inversely as the temperature reckoned from — 448. For we have
                    likewise shown above, that the specific heat of a given volume of air is, <hi
                    rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> as its density. Strictly speaking, it is
                    obviously the fluxion of the heat which varies in this manner. Hence, so far as
                    depends on change of temperature, the fluxion of the quantity of heat in a cubic
                    foot of air cooling under a constant pressure at the temperature <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> will be directly as <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi> and
                    inversely as (í + 448) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. It may therefore be
                    denoted by</p>
                <p>— A <hi rend="italic">dt</hi><hi rend="italic">(t</hi> + 448) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> where A is a constant.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fluxion of the heat due to the fluxion of
                    the mass, which is the same with the absolute heat in the increment of the mass,

                    all pertain to the specific heat.</p></note> The fluent of this taken between
                    the temperatures <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t’</hi> is <hi

                    cubic foot of air while its variable mass is cooling under a constant pressure
                    from <hi rend="italic">i</hi> to <hi rend="italic">t’.</hi> Hence, if the
                    specific heat of a cubic foot of dry air of thirty inches pressure, and confined
                    in an inextensible vessel at 32° F. be reckoned unit, and of course only three
                    fourths of what it would be were the pressure constant, the value of A for the
                    cooling of air under any constant pressure B, must be such that three fourths of
                    it may equal the denominator in the above formula, when B = 30 and <hi
                    rend="italic">(t</hi> + 448) <hi rend="italic">(tl</hi> + 448) = (32 + 448) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; so that, <hi rend="italic">A =</hi> I (480) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> χ</p>
                <p>Now, from Dr Haycraft’s experiments, it appears that at the same temperature the
                    specific heats of all elastic fluids, and mixtures of them, so far as yet tried,
                    are equal under equal volumes and pressures; and we have shown above, tĥat the
                    specific heat of a cubic foot of air, under a constant pressure, is directly as
                    its density and inversely as its temperature reckoned from — 448°. Combining
                    these together, it follows that the specific heat of a cubic foot of elastic
                    fluid is directly as the pressure and inversely as the square of the temperature
                    reckoned from — 448°; so that, at the same temperature, it is as the pressure
                    simply. It will therefore come to the same thing if, in place of taking the sum
                    of the separate specific heats of air, and of the vapour previously in it, we
                    suppose either to have the joint pressure of both, which will equal that of the
                    atmosphere. Consequently, the heat which a cubic foot of air and vapour at the
                    temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> would impart to the wet and colder surface,
                    while cooling through <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">t’</hi> degrees, under the constant pressure B, will be <pb

                <p><hi rend="italic">(t</hi> + 448) <hi rend="italic">(t'</hi> + 448)</p>
                <p>This perhaps would require to be slightly modified, for the mechanical influence
                    of the new vapour which enters into the air during the observation.</p>
                <p>We should have been happy to have completed an investigation of the relation
                    between the dew-point and the indications of the moist-bulb hygrometer; but in
                    endeavouring to prosecute it farther, we were met by difficulties which we
                    suspect have been in a great measure overlooked by those who profess to solve
                    the problem with perfect ease. Thus, if we suppose the depressed temperature to
                    extend unaltered to a certain distance from the moist surface, and then all at
                    once to change into the actual atmospheric temperature, is not this to assume an
                    abrupt transition of temperature having no known parallel in nature, especially
                    where the cooling process proceeds so slowly? We cannot comprehend, for
                    instance, how the moist bulb, at a temperature of 70°, could be surrounded by a
                    shell of air also exactly at 70° throughout its whole thickness, while the air
                    immediately outside of this could be at 90°. Nor is there greater probability
                    that the saturated vapour terminates abruptly, or that both terminate exactly at
                    the same distance. Now, if neither the depressed temperature nor the new vapour
                    terminate abruptly or at the same distance, is there any thing known of the
                    nature of the law according to which either the one or the other decreases in
                    the actual circumstances? Until some light is thrown on questions like these,
                    every thing in the shape of a solution of the problem must rest in a great
                    measure on conjecture; no matter how well successive trials and alterations may
                    bring such an empirical solution apparently to agree with the phenomena. We
                    should think it highly probable that the air enveloping the moist bulb is in a
                    state of continual intermixture similar to that of a fermenting liquor; but how
                    such a state of the air and' humidity, if it exist, could be expressed
                    algebraically, we cannot pretend to say.</p>
                <p>Another point which, we presume, has not been sufficiently attended to in
                    attempts to solve this problem, is the nature of the latent heat of aqueops
                    vapour, particularly the manner in which it probably varies in different
                    circumstances, and the relation which it bears to its own specific heat and that
                    of air. These we shall now endeavour to examine, in conformity with the
                    foregoing investigation respecting the relations of air to heat, though we can
                    scarcely accomplish this so independently of hypothesis as we did in that
                    case.</p>
                <p>When detached from their generating liquids, steam or aqueous vapour, and all
                    elastic fluids yet tried, expand by heat at the same rate as air does, and, like
                    it, observe the law of Boyle, by having the force at the same temperature
                    proportional to the density. But since the second principle above stated
                    regarding the <hi rend="italic">constancy</hi> in the ratio of the specific
                    heats, or of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">η,</hi> seems to be
                    closely connected with the rate of expansion and the law of Boyle, analogy
                    renders it extremely probable that it likewise belongs to all gaseous bodies.
                    Besides, Dr FIaycraft’s experiments for comparing the specific heats of gases
                    <hi rend="italic">(Edinburgh Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. X. p. 195, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosoph.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mag.</hi> for September 1824, p.
                    200) afford a farther presumption in favour of this; for they go far to
                    establish as another general law, that under equal volumes, pressures, and
                    temperatures, all elastic fluids have equal specific heats. His apparatus is
                    incomparably the best which, so far as we know, has been applied to the purpose.
                    That of Delaroche and Berard was so unnecessarily complicated, that we cannot
                    adopt their results. Now, from what we have already quoted from Newton <hi
                    rend="italic">(Principia,</hi> lib. ii. prop. 23), it readily follows that, if
                    the repulsion between the particles of an elastic fluid vary inversely as any
                    given power of the distance greater than unit, the second principle above
                    mentioned holds respecting that fluid; or its specific heat under a constant
                    pressure exceeds in an <hi rend="italic">invariable</hi> ratio its specific heat
                    under a constant volume; and that, if such be the case with steam, the rises of
                    true temperature produced in it by compression must at least be proportional to
                    those in air, whether they may be exactly equal to them or not. This, to be
                    sure, is very different from the theory of Clement, to which, we presume, fatal
                    objections have been stated in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Evaporation</hi>
                    (vol. ix. pp. 425, 426). But since there is no known instance of any other law
                    of repulsion than the reciprocal of the square of the distance, it is most
                    unlikely that the particles of air alone should observe this, and other gaseous
                    particles different laws.</p>
                <p>From such considerations we are led to conclude that steam should have the ratio
                    of its specific heats not only constant (as Laplace and Poisson maintain), but
                    the same as in air, and consequently have its temperature raised at the same
                    rate by compression; and, till something else be shown to the contrary, we shall
                    adopt Mr Watt’s opinion, which, we presume, few will be disposed to dispute,
                    that the latent heat of steam is the same with the heat which would be evolved
                    or rendered sensible by compressing steam to the density of water. By means of
                    these as data we shall proceed to compute the latent heat of steam in terms of
                    its own specific heat. It has been usual to express it in terms of the specific
                    heat of an equal weight of water at some low temperature; as, for instance, to
                    reckon it equal to 1000 times the specific heat of water. This quantity there is
                    reason to suspect to be a very different thing from the sum of the successive
                    specific heats of water, according to the common' graduation, continued up
                    through a range of 1000°; in other words, the latent heat of steam is probably
                    very different from the quantity of heat which would raise the temperature of an
                    equal weight of water up through a range of 1000° on Fahrenheit’s scale, though
                    they are usually assumed to be equal.</p>
                <p>In conformity, then, with the principles which have been laid down as above, let
                    the specific heat of steam at 212°, or the quantity of heat which it would be
                    necessary to add to raise its temperature 1° under a constant volume at 212°, be
                    represented by the variation for one degree in the logarithm of the temperature
                    counted from — 448° on Fahrenheit’s scale of an air thermometer; namely, by log.
                    (448 + 213) —log. (448 + 212) = ∙0006576. Steam having a pressure of one
                    atmosphere at 212°, is, according to Μ. Gay-Lussac, 1694 times rarer than water
                    at 32°, and, consequently, about 1626 times rarer than water at 212°. Hence, on
                    the principles now adopted, were such steam suddenly compressed to the density
                    of water, or to the 1626th part of its bulk, it would have its true temperature
                    raised above 212° by a quantity proportional to, and which might be represented
                    by, ∣- log. 1626; that is, supposing that the specific heat of steam should,
                    like that of air, bear the same ratio to the heat which is evolved or rendered
                    sensible by compression, that ∙0006576 bears to ⅛ log. 1626 (because — — =≡ λ);
                    and that the heat thus evolved, and which is to raise the temperature of the
                    steam so much under the reduced volume, is equal to the theat which it would
                    have been necessary to have added to the steam before its volume was reduced at
                    all, in order to raise its temperature as much under that original volume
                    unaltered. For we have seen that the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of the
                    volume, if constant, makes no difference on the quantity of heat necessary to
                    raise the temperature of a given mass of air through the same range, and that as
                    little does the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> of the pressure if constant.
                    Now ∣- log. 1626 = l∙0703735, in which ∙0006576, the above représenta-tive<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939492" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9492-0130"/> of one degree, is
                    contained 1627∙7 times; so that 1628° is the latent heat, in terms of the
                    specific heat of the steam itself at 212° under a constant volume. According to
                    MM. Delaroche and Berard, the specific heat of steam, notwithstanding its vastly
                    greater volume, is only ∙847 of that of water; but since ∙847 refers to steam
                    under a constant pressure, three fourths of it, or ∙635, will be the number for
                    steam under a constant volume. Hence the latent heat of steam, in terms of the
                    specific heat of water, should be 1627∙7 × ∙635 = 1034°, which comes very near
                    the usual estimate; but to this we attach little importance, because we see no
                    ground to believe that the specific heat of steam can be so much, if at all,
                    smaller than that of water at the same temperature. Indeed, considering the
                    vague, complicated, and indirect manner in which Delaroche and Berard obtained
                    the number ∙847, it is astonishing that other philosophers should ever have
                    adopted it. Were we to suppose the specific heats of steam and water to be equal
                    at 45° (the mean temperature of the water in which Dr Ure condensed the steam in
                    his experiments), the latent heat of steam at 212° would be I216° in terms of
                    the specific heat of water at 45°, because log. (448 + 46) — log. (448 + 45) =
                    ∙00088, and is contained 1216∙3 times in 1Ό703735. This, to be sure, rather
                    exceeds the ordinary estimates, which is no great objection to its accuracy;
                    because in the most approved methods hitherto followed for obtaining
                    experimentally the latent heat, there is reason to suspect that some of the
                    steam, in its passage from the boiler or retort, would be so much cooled as to
                    have either attained the liquid form or the state of a cloud before it reached
                    the cold water in which it was to be condensed, a circumstance which would tend
                    to bring out a deficient result, especially if the steam reached the cold water
                    by a horizontal or descending tube, which could not bring back to the boiler any
                    water formed from steam condensed by the way; but it is doubtful if any tube
                    could entirely obviate this, or prevent cloudy vapour from passing over.
                    Besides, the latent heat being generally computed from a slight rise produced by
                    it in the temperature of a large mass of water, it is obvious that a small
                    inaccuracy in measuring such rise may occasion a considerable error in the
                    latent heat; and it has often been alleged that the heat which raises the
                    temperature of water one degree, is far greater than the thousandth part of what
                    would raise it a thousand successive degrees reckoned on the common scale.</p>
                <p>But to come nearer our present purpose; since the latent heat of steam, in terms
                    of the specific heat of water, is scarcely a necessary ingredient in the theory
                    of the moist-bulb hygrometer, we shall now compute the latent heat of steam at
                    32° Fahrenheit, in terms of its own specific heat under a constant volume at
                    that temperature. Steam in a state of saturation at 32° is about 177200 times
                    rarer than water at same temperature, and log. (33 + 448) — log. (32 + 448) = ∙
                    0009039. This, which represents the specific heat, or one degree at 32°, is
                    contained 1935∙5 times in 1∙74949 = ļ-log. 177200. Hence the latent heat at 32°
                    is 1935∙5. Now, according to the view we have taken of the subject, the latent
                    heat of steam is expressed by the number of times the above numerical value of
                    the specific heat of an equal weight of it at some particular temperature is
                    contained in one third the logarithm of the number of times the steam is rarer
                    than water. But if we wish to express it always in terms of one quantity, as,
                    for instance, in terms of the specific heat of an equal weight of it under a
                    constant volume at 32°, we shall have log. 177200 to log. R. as 1935∙5, the
                    latent heat at 32°, to the latent heat of an equal weight of aqueous vapour at a
                    different temperature, and whose rarity, compared with that of water of its own
                    temperature, is R; so that the latent heat, in the terms now specified, will
                    be</p>
                <p>Fg⅛A= <hi rend="subscript"> 36</hi> 8∙77 <hi rend="subscript"> lθg</hi>.R, which
                    varies as the logarithm of the number of times the steam is rarer than water, as
                    was hinted in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Evaporation,</hi> vol. ix. p.
                    426. We there noticed, p. 425, an experiment which proves in a very decisive
                    manner, and independently of any thing now stated, that not only the latent, but
                    the total heat in a given mass of steam in a state of saturation must be less at
                    higher temperatures than at lower. Now, both this and the results of our
                    investigation are consistent with, nay afford a very satisfactory reason for,
                    the well-known economy of heat in high-pressure engines; whereas the
                    usually-received theory of Clement, which supposes the latent heat the same at
                    every temperature, is quite incompatible with such economy. Our investigation
                    also leads to a saving of heat in the case of steam used <hi rend="italic"
                    >expansively,</hi> as it is called; but it would here be out of place to go
                    through the computation at length. For some interesting experiments and remarks
                    by Dr Haycraft, on this, which he calls <hi rend="italic">surcharged</hi> steam,
                    see <hi rend="italic">Repertory of Patent Inventions,</hi> vol. xii. p. 25.</p>
                <p>Μ. de la Rive some time ago proposed for a hygrometer the following contrivance,
                    which is, in some respects, the counterpart of the one with the moist bulb. A
                    thermometer being dipped in sulphuric acid, and then exposed to the air, absorbs
                    and condenses the aqueous vapour, which, by evolving its latent heat, and
                    imparting it to the acid, raises the temperature of the thermometer. From this
                    increased temperature, and that of the air, Μ. de la Rive computes the degree of
                    humidity. In this case, the warming effect of the condensed vapour is restrained
                    by the cooling influence of the air and the radiation of surrounding bodies;
                    whereas in the hygrometer with the moist bulb, the cooling effect of evaporation
                    is limited by the warming influence of the air and radiation. But it is only
                    when the vapour is in a state of half saturation, that either the changes of
                    temperature or the effects of radiation are likely to be nearly equal in the two
                    hygrometers. Perhaps, therefore, a careful comparison of the indications of
                    these instruments in other states of the vapour might afford data for estimating
                    how far they are under the influence of radiation, which would tend materially
                    to elucidate their theories.</p>
                <p>While the sulphuric-acid hygrometer displays considerable ingenuity, the other
                    instrument is on several accounts so decidedly preferable, that the invention of
                    Μ. de la Rive is not likely ever to come into general use. Water can more
                    readily be obtained everywhere, and is much more safe and portable, than
                    sulphuric acid. Besides, owing to sulphuric acid freezing at an uncertain or
                    variable temperature, depending on its strength, such an instrument would be apt
                    to give doubtful results at low temperatures. For, whatever be the strength of
                    the acid at first, it will continue to decrease in an uncertain manner on the
                    bulb by gradually absorbing moisture. However, the heat derived from the
                    condensation of the vapour will sometimes be sufficient to keep the acid in a
                    liquid state at a temperature which would freeze it in a close vessel; and
                    whenever it happens that sulphuric acid remains liquid on the bulb of •one
                    thermometer, while water is frozen on that of another, a comparison of the two
                    instruments might throw some light on the influence of frost on the temperature
                    of the latter. We presume, therefore, that the most important use likely to be
                    derived from this hygrometer of Μ. de la Rive, would be to assist in perfecting
                    the theory of the moist-bulb hygrometer; and possibly some other absorbent
                    substances might answer even better for this purpose than sulphuric acid
                    does.</p>
                <p>Since the quantity of aqueous vapour which can exist in a given volume is
                    independent of the density of the air, it <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939505"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9505-0131"/>is evident that, when the vapour in the air is in
                    a state of half saturation, we may bring it to complete saturation by injecting
                    additional air into a close vessel till the density is doubled, and doing this
                    either so slowly as not sensibly to warm the air, or to wait a little till the
                    temperature settle. If the vessel is large and of a globular shape, a deposition
                    of moisture should be sensibly produced on its inner surface, so soon as the
                    density gets a very little beyond the double; but with a small vessel, a greater
                    increase of density would be required, because in that case the included mass of
                    vapour would be smaller in proportion to the surface. It would on several
                    accounts be preferable that any vessel for this purpose should be formed of
                    metal with two small openings on opposite sides, closed by bits of glass which
                    would become dim by the deposition of dew on their interior surfaces. Whatever
                    might be the proportion of humidity in the air, it would in all cases be in the
                    inverse ratio <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that in which the density was to be
                    increased to produce saturation, and so might be readily had from such a
                    manometer or gauge as is usually employed for showing the pressure, only having
                    a direct in place of an inverse graduation. If a thermometer were included in
                    the vessel, it would need to be cased like that of Dr Hutton’s hygrometer, to
                    protect it from the pressure, which, by compressing the bulb, might cause it to
                    show a temperature far above the truth.</p>
                <p>A hygrometer depending on the increase of pressure which additional moisture
                    produces in air not thoroughly damp, will be found described under the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology;</hi> but one depending on the effect which
                    humidity has on the specific gravity of the air might be had by suspending two
                    very light air-tight cylinders of equal dimensions and weight, from the arms of
                    a sensible balance. Thus, if the one cylinder were suspended in ajar containing
                    either <hi rend="italic">a</hi> little water, to render the air thoroughly damp,
                    or some drying substance, to render it perfectly dry, the difference in the
                    specific gravities of the exterior and included air would produce a
                    corresponding disturbance in the equilibrium; because the more humid the air, it
                    is the lighter under the same pressure and temperature. The jar would of course
                    need to be closed with a lid, leaving only a small opening for the free motion
                    of a thread ’ or wire suspending the cylinder. The opposite cylinder, too, would
                    need to be suspended in some vessel or cage, only so close as to be a protection
                    from the agitation of the wind.</p>
                <p>Since the specific gravity of aqueous vapour is to that of dry air as five to
                    eight, it is evident that when the cylinders, which are to be equal in volume
                    and weight, are both suspended in air of the same temperature and pressure, but
                    differing in humidity, any small weight which, being applied to the more buoyant
                    one, would maintain the equilibrium, must be proportional to the difference in
                    the densities of the aqueous vapour surrounding these two opposite cylinders. So
                    that, if the air around the one were made perfectly dry, the requisite
                    counterpoise would just equal three eighths of the weight of as. much aqueous
                    vapour as is contained in a volume of air contiguous to the other cylinder, and
                    equal its bulk. This, however, is not meant to apply to fog or cloudy air, nor
                    are we aware that any other hygrometer does apply to fog. But the same result
                    might be had without any counterpoise, by making the arm of the balance show on
                    a graduated arc the disturbance of equilibrium corresponding to such
                    counterpoise. The apparatus now proposed, though it might be somewhat bulky and
                    expensive, would indicate m the most direct manner, and without regard to
                    temperature or pressure, the actual weight of moisture in the air; and might
                    therefore be of great service in trying and verifying other hygrometers, with
                    the view of obtaining the real values of their indications, and perfecting their
                    theories. It would, in short, possess all the properties which Saussure
                    considered essential to a perfect hygrometer.</p>

                <p>This includes the reduction of the temperature of the air to 32°; because, under

                    however, mean, that this or any formula is applicable, when the air happens to
                    be foggy or cloudy. Nor would it be of any use here to speculate on, or to
                    attempt to employ, any law according to which the quantity of aqueous vapour may
                    be supposed to vary at different heights, in the form of an independent
                    atmosphere; because the wind and other uncertain vicissitudes of weather derange
                    every thing of this sort, as is evident from the dew-point being found to vary
                    at different heights in a manner which cannot be referred to any definite law

                <p>Professor Daniell has given, in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essays</hi> (p. 177), an extensive table for finding the specific gravity of a
                    mixture of air and vapour, under a pressure of thirty inches, and for
                    facilitating corrections for the effects of vapour and temperature on barometric
                    measurements; but it requires more trouble to apply it to either of these
                    purposes than the preceding formulae do; and it is curious that Mr Daniell does
                    not seem aware that the method he follows for correcting measurements, even when
                    aided by that large table, is only suited to a column of air and vapcur in a
                    state of saturation, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939518"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9518-0132"/>whose mean pressure is exactly thirty inches;
                    though it rarely happens in the mensuration of heights, that the mean pressure
                    of the air and vapour forming the column is so great. Thus, the force of vapour
                    in the third column of his table being expressed in terms of a pressure of
                    thirty inches as the unit, can of course suit no other; yet in an example on
                    page 183, he applies it as if the mean pressure, 28*77 inches, had been the
                    unit; and no doubt, when the pressure is smaller, it will lead to a more
                    considerable error. A similar objection attaches to the weight or density of
                    vapour in his fourth column; and besides, when he applies it as the “increase of
                    density for weight of vapour,” he uses the density of vapour corresponding to
                    the dew-point, which is always greater than the actual density, except when the
                    vapour is in a state of saturation. It is this step in Mr Daniell’s method which
                    restricts it to thoroughly damp air; whereas the formulae we have given above
                    are of general application, only they are not suited to foggy or cloudy air, nor
                    are we aware that any other method is.</p>
                <p>We shall now examine some of the more remarkable phenomena resulting from or
                    connected with the deposition <hi rend="italic">of</hi> aqueous vapour from the
                    atmosphere. The ingenious Dr James Hutton proposed a theory of rain, which many
                    receive^ as the true explication of it, viz. that rain is produced by the mixing
                    of different masses of moist air having different temperatures. It is well known
                    from experiment, that the variations in the capacity of air, or more properly of
                    space for moisture, proceed in a higher ratio than the corresponding variations
                    of temperature, as reckoned on the common scales, but still more so with
                    reference to the scale which we deduced above; where it is shown necessarily to
                    follow from admitted principles, that air expands in geometrical progression for
                    equal increments of heat (though this, as we have already noticed, is not
                    precisely the same with the scale which Dr Dalton long ago proposed, and
                    afterwards relinquished). Hence, if the space occupied by the mixture of the
                    different masses of air have either the mean temperature of the whole, or one
                    still lower, its capacity for moisture would come short of the mean, and so a
                    deposition of rain, &amp;c. will ensue, if the air has previously been
                    sufficiently moist. There can be no question that this theory is a possible one;
                    but it would be no easy matter to prove that it is the actual and ordinary mode
                    in which rain is produced. In the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of
                    Science</hi> for April 1829, Mr Meikle adduces some reasons countenanced by
                    experiments, which seem to render it very probable that clouds, rain, &amp;c.
                    may often be traced to a nearer and more natural source. The Huttonian theory
                    does not readily explain why rain is more commonly preceded or attended with a
                    falling barometer; for it is as easy to conceive mixtures of air occurring
                    whilst the barometer rises, as when it falls; and the like objection attaches to
                    the electrical theory of rain. Indeed, on many occasions electricity is as
                    serviceable to the moderns as the <hi rend="italic">occult qualities</hi> were
                    to the ancients; for by referring any difficulty to electricity, we can either
                    evade the trouble of solving it, or the mortification of acknowledging our
                    inability to solve it.</p>
                <p>But this prognostic of the falling barometer did not lonġ escape notice after the
                    Torricellian experiment had been made;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>We are aware that some of the first observers are said to
                    have coupled rain with a rising or high barometer; and indeed there are
                    exceptions. When the wind is shifting from west to east, the barometer generally
                    rises, though followed by copious rain; and, on the other hand, when the wind
                    shifts from east to west, the barometer usually falls, though it remains dry.
                    The motion of the barometer is in such cases to a certain extent connected with
                    the earth’s diurnal rotation, and is thus accounted for by Mr Meikle, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Phil. Jour,</hi> for December 1827, page 108 :—“The
                    curvilinear motion of the wind, describing a circle about the earth, in place of
                    always <hi rend="italic">lowering</hi> the barometer, as many have supposed,
                    ought frequently to <hi rend="italic">augment</hi> the pressure of the
                    atmosphere, and consequently to <hi rend="italic">raise</hi> the barometer. At
                    first sight this may seem paradoxical enough, if not thoroughly absurd; but to
                    solve it we have only to consider, that when the wind is from the east, its
                    diurnal motion round the earth’s axis is thereby lessened, its centrifugal force
                    will be of course weakened, and so the air will be more at liberty to gravitate
                    or press freely on the earth’s surface. Westerly winds, on the contrary, by
                    conspiring with the diurnal motion, increase the centrifugal force, and diminish
                    the pressure.”</p><p>The influence of centrifugal force on the pressure will
                    likewise afford a satisfactory reason for hills generally measuring higher by
                    the barometer during wind than during a calm; the air being probably
                    accumulated, or the pressure increased, at the bottom of the hill, by the wind
                    describing almost a straight line, or a curve which is convex downward, while
                    the air is dilated or the pressure diminished at the upper station, by the wind
                    describing over the summit a curve which, compared with the other, is very
                    concave downward. But the difference of centrifugal force at the two stations
                    will have little to do with the diurnal rotation, if the wind has the same
                    velocity and direction at both, though the velocity is more likely to be greater
                    at the summit than below. As for the difference of distance from the earth’s
                    centre, it is scarcely worth attending to.</p></note> and the explanation then
                    given, and for long after received, was, that the air, from its rarity, was
                    unable to buoy up or support the denser vapours, and so of course down they
                    came. It was not then known, that, at the same temperature and pressure, moist
                    air, especially if transparent, is lighter than dry. Yet the observers of that
                    period certainly inferred, on very probable grounds, that there existed a
                    connection between the concomitant circumstances of decreasing pressure and
                    depositions of rain, &amp;c. from the atmosphere. They are further to be
                    commended in seeking an explanation in a principle which they supposed to be
                    known; because reason and facts are always preferable to hypotheses. We are far
                    from reckoning their statical explanation to have no share in the phenomena;
                    because the denser the air, the more will it retard or obstruct the descent of
                    minute drops of water or particles of snow, &amp;c.; but the suspension of
                    transparent vapour depends on the temperature alone. For it is now well known,
                    as noticed more particularly under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Evaporation,</hi> that the quantity of vapour contained in a given space is
                    independent of the presence or density of any other elastic fluid with which it
                    is not chemically combined; or that the maximum quantity of vapour which can
                    exist in a given space is the same at the same temperature as it would be did
                    that space contain nothing else. Whenever, therefore, the volume of the same
                    mass of air increases, the capacity of that volume for moisture should increase
                    at the same rate, were the temperature to remain the same; but when air dilates
                    from a diminution of pressure, its temperature always falls, if there be no
                    accession of heat from some other source. A fall in the barometer, however, is
                    not necessarily attended with a reduction of temp’crature near the earth’s
                    surface. On the contrary, the temperature there may often be preserved, or even
                    raised (as we shall afterwards explain), by the intermixture of the higher and
                    lower strata, and by the retention of heat, such as had previously escaped
                    upward by radiation from the earth’s surface, but which ceases to do so after
                    the sky is obscured by dense clouds. But where none of these extraneous
                    circumstances interfere, the reduction of temperature properly due to dilatation
                    lessens the capacity of the space so cooled for moisture, far more than the
                    enlargement in bulk increases it; so that, generally speaking, if the air be
                    sufficiently moist, a fall in the barometer, or rarefying the air, should tend
                    to produce clouds, rain, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>For example, the volume of a given mass of air will increase about a ninetieth
                    part by being raised through a height of a hundred yards; and the capacity of
                    that volume for moisture would increase in the same ratio did <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939531" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9531-0133"/>the temperature continue the
                    same. But if the temperature lost one degree, the capacity for moisture would be
                    thereby diminished about a thirtieth; and therefore, upon the whole, aqueous
                    vapour in a state of saturation would have about its forty-fifth part condensed
                    into water by being raised a hundred yards, namely, a’ thirtieth minus a
                    ninetieth. However, for reasons given above, and to be farther illustrated by
                    and by, it is more likely that the temperature of an ascending current of air
                    will often lose 1° '5 F. or even more, by gaining an elevation of a hundred
                    yards, which would lessen the capacity for vapour about one twentieth. Hence, a
                    rise of a hundred yards would condense about a twenty-sixth part of the vapour,
                    viz. the excess of a twentieth over a ninetieth.</p>
                <p>Such at least would be the result, calculating from the foregoing principles; but
                    the following simple experiment affords a more direct proof that sufficient
                    rarefaction will always change common und ied air into a cloud. Connect a small
                    glass flask, containing the ordinary air, with the receiver of an air-pump, by
                    means of an intervening stopcock. Exhaust the receiver with the cock shut; then
                    looking attentively at the flask, open it suddenly into the receiver, by turning
                    the stop-cock, when a momentary mistiness will be perceived in the flask, which
                    is aqueous vapour condensed into a cloud by the cold produced by the
                    rarefaction. The cloud is here formed under peculiar disadvantages, being
                    everywhere surrounded at so short a distance by a warmer surface throwing in
                    heat upon it, and especially by a vitreous surface which is known to radiate
                    powerfully. But a cloud which is visible in so small a volume would be pretty
                    dense on the large scale. We have never tried this experiment without
                    succeeding; but we believe it may fail when the air contains little moisture, if
                    the receiver be not large compared with the flask, or if the connecting
                    stop-cock have a very narrow bore. It is, however, rare for the external air, in
                    a state of free circulation, to contain so little as a third of the total vapour
                    which could exist in it at the actual temperature.</p>
                <p>Since both modes of reasoning lead to the same results, we presume enough has now
                    been said to warrant us to conclude, that when air ascends sufficiently in the
                    atmosphere, it must, from being cooled by dilating, constitute a cloud, or, if
                    moist enough, produce rain, &amp;c. For example, if a current of air traverse
                    the ocean till it becomes very moist; and then, if, on arriving at the shore,
                    this current have to rise higher as the land rises, we have at once the reason
                    why rain so frequently commences nearer the sea, and extends thence forward with
                    the wind,—why more elevated situations are more liable to rain,—and why a wind
                    from the land is more rarely attended with rain on its approaching the shore.
                    But there is reason to think that a stream of air which has been gradually
                    elevated by traversing a rising ground, does not always descend again where the
                    surface declines, but, on the contrary, may continue for some time at that
                    height, or, from the upward force it has already acquired, may even rise higher.
                    In this manner it may deposit rain while rolling far above the tranquil plain,
                    as well as when contending with the asperities of the more elevated surface;
                    especially since the humidity, after being condensed, will be borne along with
                    the current, taking some time to force its way down through the air, and the
                    more so as the air is more dense. If the space over which the raining current
                    passes be not saturated with moisture, the air may revaporize a part or the
                    whole of the rain descending in it. This is no doubt the way in which clouds
                    seem suspended in the air, or even at rest in the wind, though, in fact, they
                    may be falling, and changing into transparent vapour, so as to float on unseen m
                    the wind beneath; whilst their place is continually supplied by the successive
                    condensation of other vapour arriv- <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> g with the
                    current, and which, in its turn, is revaporized or swept away by the wind. Much
                    in the same way clouds are apparently stationed over elevated peaks, or even
                    over large portions of hills; while the fact is, that their particles are moving
                    onward, and others coming in their stead. The apparent motions of clouds may
                    therefore differ so much from the true as to afford a most fallacious measure of
                    the velocity of the wind.</p>
                <p>The circumstance of clouds frequenting hills, or apparently moving towards them,
                    will admit of a similar explanation, without the aid of an imaginary force
                    residing in hills for the express purpose of attracting clouds, rain, &amp;c.
                    The notion that mountain-caps, or clouds hovering about the tops of hills, are
                    produced by the cooling influence of the summit, does not appear to be better
                    founded; because such phenomena frequently occur when the air is considerably
                    colder than the surface of the hill, though they may not continue long of very
                    different temperatures. But were the cloud really owing to the colder
                    temperature of the summit, it would not only touch, but be densest next the
                    surface of the hill, wetting it profusely; whereas the cloud is often observed
                    to be several feet, or many yards, clear of the hill, and the surface as dry at
                    least as that of the surrounding country; a clear proof that the hill is not
                    colder than the cloud. A more natural explanation, we presume,. is, that the
                    cloud called the mountain-cap is formed in that part of a current of moist air
                    which is sufficiently cooled by the rarefaction attending its sudden increase of
                    elevation in ascending and rolling over the summit; and that this current will
                    regain its transparency so soon as it afterwards passes on to where it either
                    absorbs as much heat, or acquires an increase of pressure sufficient to restore
                    its former temperature. The reason why the cloud is frequently observed to keep
                    clear of the summit for a considerable time, especially during a brisk wind, is,
                    that the centrifugal force due to the curvature of the current over the hill
                    carries it clear of the summit, and the intervening arched space is left to be
                    occupied by comparatively still air, into which the air recently cooled by
                    rarefaction scarcely enters; and by this means the higher temperature of the
                    summit is preserved for some time. In the same way it often happens, that whilst
                    a storm acts with fury on the face of a precipice, a person on the summit only
                    hears the sound, and feels himself as in a calm; the arched current, with its
                    copious load of rain or hail, being carried clear of the summit by the
                    centrifugal force, while the intermediate space is left almost free from wind,
                    hail, or rain. Since caps rarely occur on hills of moderate height, except when
                    the air is pretty moist, they are not unfrequently precursors of rain.</p>
                <p>Much in the same way as in the case of the mountaincap, may the origin of the
                    cloud called the <hi rend="italic">cumulus</hi> be traced, especially by means
                    of its horizontal base, to the dilatation of air. Such a cloud may be situated
                    partly in an ascending portion of a current of moist air, and partly in a
                    descending portion; or it may sometimes occupy the most elevated part of an
                    arched-like sweep of the current. Whenever the air reaches the requisite
                    elevation, it will become opaque, but will regain its transparency so soon as it
                    descends again sufficiently to have its temperature restored by increase of
                    pressure. The opacity should terminate underneath nearly all at the same level,
                    or in a horizontal plane, if the heat and moisture have been uniformly or
                    proportionally distributed through the air of the current. When the distribution
                    has been unequal, the base will of course be uneven, or may deviate mure or less
                    from a horizontal plane. Perhaps some other modifications of clouds might be
                    accounted for on similar principles. We may farther observe, that clouds, when
                    seen in profile, especially the several parts of the cirrus, when changing into
                    cirro-cumulus, generally appear as if leaning forward like shrubs in the
                    direction in which the wind moves; and longer pieces of cloud are commonly lower
                    in the rear than in front.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939544" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9544-0134"/>
                <p>It is evident that moisture which has ascended in the form of transparent vapour,
                    and descended again as rain, snow, &amp;c. must have left its latent heat above.
                    But much heat no doubt moves upward, from its natural propensity to render the
                    atmosphere of one temperature throughout its whole height, and from the tendency
                    of warmer air to rise above the colder. There is therefore good reason for
                    concluding, that air which has just been suddenly elevated and dilated should be
                    thereby reduced to a much lower temperature than what obtains in air which has
                    remained at that elevation for some considerable time, receiving heat from
                    below, from the sun, or other sources. This is both in accordance with direct
                    observation, and with the conclusions at which we arrived when investigating the
                    relations of air to heat. For the entire fall of temperature properly due to
                    dilatation, as expressed by either of the formula? given above, viz.</p>
                <p>(r + 248) ſß) <hi rend="superscript"> J</hi> ο» (r + «8) [(∣,)* - l] far exceeds
                    a reduction of one degree for every 100 yards of ascent. In Gay-Lussac’s famous
                    ascent, the pressure was reduced in the ratio of ∙432 to 1 at a height of 7600
                    yards, and the temperature fell 72° ∙54, or from S7° ∙44 to 14° ∙9; so that the
                    density was very nearly halved. With ι these data, the first formula gives
                    (87∙44 + 448) ∣"^ ; —1 ĵ = 110° ∙46 for the fall of temperature; but the second
                    gives about 9° less, or (535∙44)1^(∙432)⅛- 1ĵ = 101°-35; and so it ought,
                    because in Gay-Lussac’s ascent the cube of the pressure decreased more slowly
                    than in the ratio of the fourth power of the density. However, there is reason
                    to think that when a strong wind runs up a steep acclivity, the temperature
                    would be found to decrease very nearly in such a manner that the cube of the
                    pressure would, as in these formulae, vary as the fourth power of the density.
                    To make a proper trial of this, it would need to be done on air which is free
                    from any tendency to deposit moisture, as also when the surface of the acclivity
                    is dry, and completely shaded by elevated clouds from the sun and the aspect of
                    a clear sky, in order that the temperature of the air and surface might
                    everywhere correspond. As the wind is more likely to escape past the sides of an
                    elevated peak than go right over its top, an acclivity proper for this purpose
                    would need to be of such an extent that the temperatures and pressures could be
                    observed in parts of the currents where we were sure the air was making no
                    lateral escape. Calculating then from the second formula, it would follow, that
                    when such a current ascends to where the pressure is reduced in the ratio of
                    ∙432 to 1, the temperature should fall from 87° ∙44 to — 13° ∙91, or 101° ∙35,
                    which, being greater than 72° ∙54, shows that, in this case, the density would
                    not be reduced quite to the half.</p>
                <p>The experiment already described for producing the cloud in the flask shows that
                    if an equal weight of air in the upper regions did not contain far more heat
                    than in the lower, the sky would be perpetually obscured with clouds. This is
                    further illustrated by the circumstance, that when the atmosphere is much
                    agitated and intermixed to a great height, it becomes obscured above, no doubt
                    from the dilatation rendering the recently ascended air colder there than
                    corresponds to the constituent temperature of the vapour which it had brought
                    along with it, while the air beneath, which has recently descended, being warmed
                    to or above the dew-point of its vapour, by compression becomes quite
                    transparent, though previously it might have been opaque. In such cases the
                    clouds often present a deep-blue colour. However, it is long since Dr Dalton <hi
                    rend="italic">(ChemicalPhilosophy,</hi> vol. i. p. 123) proposed the hypothesis
                    that heat was diffused equally'·, or in the same proportion as the density of
                    the air, throughout the whole height of the atmosphere; in other words, that a
                    given weight of air anywhere in a perpendicular column contained the same
                    quantity of heat. In this he was followed by several eminent philosophers,
                    though it is quite incompatible with the facts now stated, and would, besides,
                    require the temperature to decrease so rapidly with the elevation, that aqueous
                    vapour, by its superior elasticity, would always shoot up through the air to
                    where it would be condensed by the cold into a cloud, keeping the sky
                    perpetually obscured, which is contrary to observation.</p>
                <p>It has become a common maxim, that dry air is less transparent than moist; the
                    latter of course being free from fog or cloud. If it is meant that mere dryness
                    impairs the transparency, we should be very apt to question such doctrine,
                    though we do not dispute that the atmosphere is less transparent in very
                    droughty weather. The reason of this we presume to be, that much solid matter is
                    then diffused through the atmosphere in the form of dust or smoke, a great part
                    of which, had it been sufficiently moist, would have been too heavy to float in
                    the air; and some of the remainder, had it been more humid, might have assumed
                    the gaseous form, so as to be transparent.</p>
                <p>The temperature at the tops of mountains is generally found to be lower than that
                    of air at the same height over the plains; and a probable reason for it is, that
                    mountains, besides having their temperatures reduced by radiation, are apt to be
                    further cooled by and enveloped in recently dilated ascending currents of air
                    rolling over them. But here again it should be remembered, that our knowledge of
                    the temperature at great heights over the plains has for the most part been
                    derived from a few ascents in balloons, undertaken during the day, and only in
                    very serene and mild weather, when there was scarcely any interchange going on
                    between the air of the different strata. Nothing is known of the decrease of
                    temperature over the plains in a coarse winter night. The same remarks apply in
                    a great measure to ascents on very high mountains; so that in all probability
                    the mean decrease of temperature in the atmosphere has hitherto been greatly
                    underrated. Snow-clad mountains are, besides, cooled, particularly in very dry
                    weather, by the evaporation from the snow; and we may remark, by the by, that at
                    the same temperature, dry air is, for the above reason, less efficacious in
                    melting snow than moist. Because the moist air, in place of spending its heat to
                    form vapour, does, in consequence of its touching a colder body, part with a
                    portion of the latent heat of the vapour it already contained, which must
                    greatly aid in liquefying the snow. The melting of snow therefore does not
                    depend solely on the temperature of the wind, but likewise upon its being
                    previously charged with moisture. Besides, when dry air passes over snow on a
                    high mountain, the evaporation, and consequently the reduction of temperature,
                    will be greatly promoted by the diminished pressure which obtains at such
                    heights. This may help to explain why <hi rend="italic">snow-winds,</hi> as they
                    are called, should be found so intensely cold; for the mere circumstance of wind
                    having passed over a colcļ mountain is not a sufficient reason why it should be
                    cold after its descent. But we may here observe by the by, that the reason why
                    snow at great elevations is so little affected by the action of the sun’s rays,
                    is, that the rarity of the air induces such a tendency to evaporation, that the
                    moisture evaporates just as fast as it melts, and in this way expends by far the
                    greater part of the sun’s heat on the formation of vapour. For since the
                    vaporization of water consumes about seven times as much heat as the melting
                    does, it follows that the heat spent in both melting and evaporating an ounce of
                    snow, would melt no less than eight ounces without evaporation.</p>

                <p>The explanation which we proposed above of the phenomena of clouds seeming
                    stationary in the wind, appears to be applicable to water-spouts. We readily
                    allow that the ascent of the water in them has been long accounted for in a very
                    rational way, which is briefly this: The collision of currents of air from
                    different quarters produces a whirlwind; the air near the axis of rotation is
                    rarefied by the centrifugal force; and the pressure on the spot under this
                    attenuated air is necessarily diminished. Of course, when a whirlwind occurs on
                    the sea, a lake, or a river, the water rises in the axis of rotation, on the
                    same principle as in the common pump. But the rarefied air itself ascends in
                    virtue of its levity. Its place is supplied by the concourse of the heavier
                    adjacent air, which being rarefied in its turn, ascends; and in this manner an
                    upward current of air is produced, which aids the ascent of the water. Thus far
                    the explanation is very satisfactory. The other principal part of the
                    phenomenon, the apparent descent of a dense stem from the clouds, nearly over
                    the spot where the water rises, has been ascribed to electricity. But this we
                    cannot help regarding as an evasion savouring of occult qualities, rather than
                    an explanation. It seems nearly allied to the notion that hills attract clouds.
                    The column which apparently descends from the clouds (for any descent is
                    altogether illusory till water actually falD may be accounted for in the same
                    way as the mountain-cap, viz. that it is aqueous vapour condensed by the cold
                    due to the rarefaction which is occasioned both by the whirling motion of the
                    air and by its rapid ascent. The more swift the rotation, the greater obviously
                    will be the rarefaction and cold; and of course the lower down in the axis or
                    stem will the condensation of moisture extend. The sound and flashes of light
                    seem to be thunder and lightning in miniature, according to a theory which will
                    presently be explained. In attending to this and other atmospherical phenomena,
                    most people are embarrassed with a preconception which is not easily overcome,
                    namely, that clouds are solids, or something more substantial than the air in
                    which they are formed.</p>
                <p>We have been long of opinion that the usually received theory of thunder and
                    lightning, as well as that of rain, is unnecessarily complicated and
                    far-fetched, and we therefore regard the following as a more natural and simple
                    one. Volta supposed that bodies, while passing into the gaseous form, absorb
                    electricity, which they emit again on being condensed. Several objections have
                    been made to this, particularly by M <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. Pouillet;
                    but as they rest in a great measure on the assumption that we possess perfect
                    electrometers, and that experiments made with them are free from every source of
                    fallacy, such objections have not, we think, disproved the more probable opinion
                    of Volta, which has been adopted by several eminent philosophers, who maintain
                    that the electricity emitted by the condensation of steam is always positive.
                    Thunder is unknown in the polar regions, and rarely occurs anywhere in cold
                    weather; from which it appears that thunder does not take place in air incapable
                    of containing much moisture, as is farther confirmed by its being ordinarily
                    produced in a dense cloud. The mode of explaining thunder, &amp;c. which we
                    would therefore prefer, is, that when a large mass of warm and damp air is
                    suddenly moved upwards, it dilates, is cooled, and deposits a considerable share
                    of its moisture, which, in laying aside the gaseous form, parts with positive
                    electricity so suddenly, and in such quantity, that the air is unable to conduct
                    or convey it away in an imperceptible form; and thus the cloud, at the moment of
                    its formation, may in ordinary language be said to emit lightning. The sound may
                    be partly a tremor which the air sustains at the moment the pressure is relaxed
                    by the vapour suddenly losing the elastic form, and may be partly a tremor due
                    to an effort of the electricity to make its escape from the cloud. The thunder
                    and lightning which sometimes attend the condensations of large volumes of steam
                    emitted by volcanoes, are favourable to this theory, as are likewise the noise
                    and lightning of the water-spout already mentioned, if not some parts of the
                    northern lights. A theory very similar to this, though more in detail, was not
                    long ago proposed to the Royal Society, by the Rev. G. Fisher; but the same
                    thing had been previously suggested by Mr Meikle, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Journal of Science</hi> for April 1829.</p>
                <p>Several important matters connected with this subject we have not felt warranted
                    to introduce, on account of their not being yet determined by sufficiently
                    extensive observations; such as the maximum, mean, and minimum dew-points for
                    different hours of the day, for different seasons of the year, for different
                    heights in the atmosphere, and in different countries. We now take leave of the
                    subject by referring again to the various works already cited here, and in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Evaporation</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> as also
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Reports of the British Association,</hi> particularly
                    the very excellent one by Professor Forbes on Meteorology. See also the articles
