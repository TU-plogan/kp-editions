                    present state of the science of penal law, the course we shall adopt, as best
                    suited to the narrow space within which our observations must be confined, is,
                    in the first place, to give an outline of the theory of punishment, according to
                    the opinions of some distinguished modern writers, and afterwards to offer a
                    sketch of the progress which penal legislation has recently made, as well on the
                    Continent as in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Experience abundantly proves, that the establishment of a tolerably good, much
                    less of a perfect system of law, whether civil or criminal, is a very slow and
                    difficult operation. Criminal law everywhere begins, where, amongst savages, it
                    continues and ends, with the pursuit and gratification of the passion of
                    revenge. Injuries, or presumed injuries, are punished according to the will and
                    power of the injured, whose might, in truth, constitutes their right. The first
                    step in civilization is the social union for the protection of every member of
                    it from injury, by the exercise of the aggregate power of the whole in his
                    defence. But in some countries ages have elapsed before, and in others it has
                    never come to pass, that any comprehensive view is taken of penal jurisprudence,
                    so as to enumerate and classify offences, and to annex to them the punishments
                    best adapted to prevent their recurrence. Unless the public feeling is outraged
                    by some glaring enormity, the mass of the people concern themselves little with
                    the relations existing between crimes and punishments; and it is only by opening
                    upon a nation the lights of reason and philosophy, that it can be brought to
                    appreciate the blessing of a wise and just criminal code. It is the task of the
                    philosopher to direct the opinion of the multitude in the direction of truth and
                    justice; nor is it possible to estimate too highly the benefits which mankind
                    are deriving from the wisdom which has been bequeathed to them by a Montesquieu,
                    a Filangieri, a Beccaria, or a Bentham.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The translation into French
                    by Morellet, with Diderot’s notes, (Patis, 1797), is the preferable
                    edition.</p></note> That remarkable man was the first to promulgate to Europe
                    the outlines of a system of jurisprudence founded upon the principle of “the
                    greatest happiness of the greatest number.” Assuming the general utility to be
                    the only legitimate object of law, Beccaria professes to inquire, What is the
                    origin of punishments, and what is the foundation of the right to punish? What
                    are the practicable means, under a good legislation, of seizing the criminal,
                    and of discovering and ascertaining the crime? Is torturing the criminal just,
                    and does it lead to the end proposed by the laws? Ought not punishments to be
                    proportioned to crimes, and how is this proportion to be established? What is
                    the measure of the gravity of crimes? Is the punishment of death useful and
                    necessary for the security and good order of society? What punishments ought to
                    be inflicted on different crimes? Are the same punishments equally useful at all
                    times? What influence have they upon manners? What are the most efficacious
                    means of preventing crimes? In offering solutions of these problems, Beccaria
                    proclaims, in the outset, that political morality, of which punishment is a
                    part, ought to be founded upon the permanent sentiments of the human heart, and
                    that the right to punish is derived from the social contract, wherein every
                    individual has surrendered to the society so much of his liberty as the
                    necessities of the whole require him to sacrifice, and no more. Every exercise
                    of power, every punishment, is an abuse of justice, unless it is necessary for
                    the preservation of the common deposit of public liberty. Three consequences
                    follow: first, that it belongs to law alone, as the condition of the social
                    contract, to award punishment to crime; secondly, that it is the province of the
                    judge, not of the sovereign power, to determine the fact of the violation of the
                    law; thirdly, that the inutility of a punishment is sufficient to constitute its
                    injustice, as contrary to the social contract. In regard to the gravity of
                    punishment, Beccaria held that it should be relative to the actual circumstances
                    of a nation, because it may be requisite to awe more strongly the minds of a
                    people recently elapsed from barbarism than those of a people whose
                    sensibilities have been softened by the influence of civilization. The
                    punishment of death is declared not to be authorized by any right belonging to
                    society, but to be rather the act of the nation making war against a citizen
                    whose destruction is regarded as useful and necessary to the society’s
                    preservation. An extreme case may arise, in times of national troubles, when the
                    death of a citizen may be justifiable by necessity, but never under the ordinary
                    and tranquil reign of the law. In other words, it is only when necessary, in the
                    strictest sense, that capital punishment is just. Punishment should be prompt,
                    because the less time that intervenes between it and the offence, the closer and
                    stronger will be the association of ideas, so that the punishment will
                    be'regarded as the effect of the crime. It should also be analogous to the
                    crime; should be public; and, above all, certain and inevitable, subject to the
                    rare exercise of the prerogative of mercy. A due proportion must exist between
                    crimes and their punishments; and if mathematical calculations could be rendered
                    applicable to the infinite and obscure combinations of human actions, there
                    should be a progressive scale of punishments, corresponding with all crimes,
                    from the gravest down to the lightest. Beccaria divides crimes into three
                    classes: viz. those destructive to society; those which attack the citizen in
                    life, wealth, or honour; and those which are generally injurious to the public
                    welfare. In his judgment, the way to prevent duels is to punish the aggressor
                    who gives the first provocation; thefts are to be corrected by fine, or
                    compensative labour; and suicide is not to be regarded as a crime in the sight
                    of men. Such are some of the ideas promulgated by Beccaria, as flowing from the
                    principle, that public utility is the only solid basis of human justice. We
                    shall presently see, that this principle has by no means obtained the general
                    assent of jurists; but the views of Beccaria are throughout consistent and
                    luminous, and were extraordinarily in advance of the age in which he lived. The
                    following general theorem is given as the conclusion of his essay: In order that
                    a punishment should not be a violence of one, or of several, against a citizen,
                    it should be public, prompt, necessary, the least possible under given
                    circumstances, proportioned to the offence, and fixed by the law.</p>
                <p>It is to our distinguished countryman, Bentham, that belongs the honour of having
                    been the first to travel over the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541891"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1891-0732"/>whole field of penal legislation; to shew the
                    intimate connexion that exists between all its parts; the mutual dependence and
                    relation of the civil and penal codes; and the impossibility of framing either
                    of these portions of law without having previously taken a comprehensive survey
                    of the whole. For the details we must refer to the works themselves, which so
                    completely exhaust the subject, that the theory offered is complete in all its

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We quote from Μ. Dumont’s
                    translations. The first complete edition of Bentham’s works in English, is now
                    in the course of publication. under the superintendence of his
                    executor.</p></note> Like Beccaria, Bentham recognized the general utility as
                    the sole object of legislation. A crime or offence, therefore, under his theory,
                    is an act which ought to be prohibited by reason of some evil to which it gives
                    rise, or tends to give rise. Crimes are then divided into four classes, viz:</p>
                <p>1st, Private offences.</p>
                <p>2d, Self-regarding offences.</p>
                <p>3d, Semi-public offences.</p>
                <p>4th, Public offences.</p>
                <p>And under these four general heads, and the combination of them, all offences may
                    be classed and arranged. These heads are again subdivided, thus:</p>
                <p>Private offences are, either against the person, against property, against the
                    reputation, or against the condition in life.</p>
                <p>Self-regarding offences may be similarly subdivided, and are enumerated rather to
                    remind the legislator that they are out of his sphere.</p>
                <p>Semi-public offences consist in the violation of the laws designed to prevent
                    physical calamities to the inhabitants of a given district, or malicious
                    injuries to particular classes of persons.</p>
                <p>Public offences are of nine kinds, viz: against the external security of the
                    state, against justice and police, against the national forces, against the
                    public revenue, against the population and the national wealth, against the
                    sovereign power, and against religion.</p>
                <p>The remedies applicable to these offences, and the means, direct and indirect, of
                    preventing their commission, form the subject of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principes</hi><hi rend="italic">du Code Penal.</hi></p>
                <p>The subsequent work <hi rend="italic">(Théorie des Peines,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c.)</hi> sets out by thus defining legal punishment: “According to the
                    principle of utility, legal punishments are evils inflicted, with judicial
                    forms, on individuals convicted of some hurtful act, forbidden by the law, and
                    in order to prevent similar acts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr. Johnson’s definition of punishment was, “any infliction
                    or pain in vengeance of a crime that of Grotius, “malum passionis quod
                    infligitur ob malum actionis.” The latter is obviously the better of the
                    two.</p></note> The same division as that of private offences is then made
                    applicable to punishments, inasmuch as an individual can only be punished by
                    affecting either his person, his property, his reputation, or his condition.
                    Personal or corporal punishments are then subdivided into, lst, Punishments
                    simply afflictive.</p>
                <p>2d, afflictive by complication.</p>
                <p>3d, restrictive.</p>
                <p>4th, active or laborious.</p>
                <p>5th, capital.</p>
                <p>Those affecting property, reputation, or condition, alike deprive the individual
                    of some advantage which he before enjoyed, and are either privations, losses, or
                    forfeitures. Thus are punishments reduced to two classes; viz. 1st, corporal,
                    and 2d, privative punishments.</p>
                <p>According to Bentham, the end of punishment is twofold; to prevent the repetition
                    of similar offences, and to repair, as much as possible, the evil of the offence
                    committed. He lays down the following rules, which serve to explain the general
                    proposition of Beccaria, that a proportion should be established between crimes
                    and punishments, viz:</p>
                <p>1st, The evil which the person punished is to sustain from the punishment, ifìust
                    exceed the advantage derivable by him from the crime.</p>
                <p>2d, When the act is of a nature to fiirnish a conclusive proof of habitude, the
                    punishment must be severe enough to exceed not only the advantage of the
                    particular offence, but also of all similar offences which may be supposed to
                    have been committed with impunity by the same offender.</p>
                <p>3d, The punishment ought to exceed the advantage of the crime to the extent of
                    making up that which the punishment wants in point of certainty and of
                    proximity.</p>
                <p>4th, If two or more crimes concur, the most hurtful ought to be subjected to a
                    more severe punishment, in order that the offender may have a motive to stop at
                    the least offence.</p>
                <p>5th, The more hurtful a crime, the more may a heavy punishment be hazarded for
                    the chance of preventing it.</p>
                <p>6th, The same punishment ought not to be inflicted for the same crime on all
                    offenders without exception. Regard must be had to the circumstances which
                    influence sensibility.</p>
                <p>These rules will better serve as a guide to the measure of punishment, than any
                    attempt at the mathematical scale suggested by Beccaria, which seems
                    inapplicable to the infinite varieties of the human mind. An ancient writer has
                    bequeathed us a plainer maxim on this point:</p>
                <p>adsit</p>
                <p>Regula peccatis, quae paenas irroget acquas, Nee scuticà dignum, horribili
                    sectere flagello.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hυrαt</hi> lib. i. sat. 3.</p></note></p>
                <p>The qualities enumerated by Bentham as desirable to every mode of punishment, in
                    order that it may answer its proper ends, are these :—</p>
                <p>1st, Divisibility; so that it may be susceptible of addition or diminution,
                    either in intensity or duration. Corporal chastisement, hard labour, and
                    imprisonment, are instances of punishments alike possessing this quality.</p>
                <p>2d, Certainty. A punishment is uncertain and unequal in itself, when an offender
                    may possibly undergo it, without suffering any evil. Banishment, for example,
                    may be good or evil according to various circumstances.</p>
                <p>3d, Commensurability. If death were inflicted on three offences of different
                    degrees of guilt, the punishment would not be commensurate, but would leave to
                    the offender the choice of the crime which might be easiest of execution.</p>
                <p>4th, Analogy. There should be some characteristic resemblance between the crime
                    and the punishment. Not exactly “eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,” but
                    something to strike the memory and imagination by association.</p>
                <p>5th, Exemplarity, so that there be not only the reality, but the appearance of
                    penality; otherwise the effect on the public will be lost.</p>
                <p>6th, Economy; viz. that the degree of severity be not greater than the end
                    requires, and also that the public charge be not enhanced more than is
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>7th, Remissibility. There should be an opportunity for remission or revocation.
                    Capital punishment is the strongest instance of a deficiency of this
                    quality.</p>
                <p>8th, Suppression of the power of injury. It may be possible, under extraordinary
                    circumstances, that death is the only available punishment possessing this
                    quality.</p>
                <p>9th, Tendency to moral amendment. If fear alone operates, the criminal will not
                    be reformed. Reformation is a change in the character and moral habits. The
                    association of prisoners is the grand obstacle in the way of imparting this
                    quality to imprisonment.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541904" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1904-0733"/>
                <p>10th, Convertibility to profit. This quality belongs only to certain kinds of
                    punishments, such as pecuniary fines, or deprivation of employments, which may
                    be conferred on more worthy persons.</p>
                <p>11 th, Simplicity in description is so obviously desirable as to require no
                    comment.</p>
                <p>12th, Popularity; that is to say, that in the choice of punishments, the
                    legislature should carefully avoid such as would shock established
                    prejudices.</p>
                <p>The above catalogue will assist the judgment in determining how far a given
                    punishment is desirable; but Bentham adds a caution, that in this as in every
                    inquiry, we should begin by forming an abstract idea of the qualities which an
                    object ought to possess, in order to reason pertinently about it, otherwise
                    approbation or disapprobation is merely a confused sentiment of sympathy or
                    antipathy. It should also be observed, in reference to the catalogue, that
                    regard is to be had not only to one quality in particular, but to all taken
                    together. No mode of punishment unites them all, but, according to the nature of
                    the offences, some are more important than others. Thus, for graver crimes,
                    exemplarity and analogy are especially to be regarded; for lighter offences,
                    economy and reformation; for crimes against property, convertibility to profit,
                    from whence compensation may be derived for the party injured.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the applicability <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Bentham’s penal
                    qualities, let us refer to one or two of the most familiar punishments.
                    Imprisonment, for instance, is very efficacious for suppressing the prisoner’s
                    power of doing injury, whilst he continues in custody. It may, or may not be
                    made profitable, according to the mode in which the prisoners are employed; but
                    under the plan of the Panoptico, the profit derivable from the earnings is a
                    leading feature of that establishment. In respect of certainty, or equality,
                    imprisonment is evidently very defective, as the evil of it depends so much upon
                    the age, the health, the habits, and frame of mind of the prisoner. It is
                    divisible, both in time and severity; and is in some sort exemplary, since
                    either the public may be admitted, as proposed in the Panoptico plan, or the
                    sight of the building will strike the imagination with a degree of terror. In
                    point of simplicity of description it is perfect, since all understand what
                    confinement means. In respect of reformation, the effect of imprisonment must
                    depend upon the system of discipline adopted. Bentham stigmatises the
                    association of prisoners in general as pregnant With evil, and as constituting a
                    punishment evidently uncertain, unequal, unexemplary, unprofitable, productive
                    of a variety of suffering, of which no one who has not experienced it, can form
                    a tolerably just idea. The hurtful consequences of such association, which are
                    vaguely expressed by the word <hi rend="italic">corruption,</hi> are thus
                    defined by Bentham:</p>
                <p>1st, The strengthening of the motives which excite to' the commission of
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>2d, The weakening of the considerations which tend to the repression of
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>3d, The instruction acquired in the art of accomplishing crimes.</p>
                <p>Bentham s views of what a prison should be are fully developed in his Panoptico,
                    wherein labour is made the main engine of reformation. We have treated this
                    subject more fully in another place, (see article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prisons);</hi> but although great advances have been lately made in regard to
                    it, the opinions ofBentham are stillfullof instruction,and shouldby no means be
                    lost sight of in determining the nature and conditions of imprisonment, the
                    punishment <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of civilized nations, and the
                    most important of any in respect of the numbers to whom it is applied.</p>
                <p>There are three other descriptions of confinement, which Bentham also discusses.
                    <hi rend="italic">Quasi-imprisonment,</hi> when the individual is confined
                    within the district of his ordinary residence. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelegation,</hi> when he is sent away from his ordinary residence, and confined
                    within a certain district in the state. <hi rend="italic">Banishment,</hi> when
                    he is removed from and forbidden to return to the state. All these are
                    preferable to imprisonment in point of economy; they are defective in equality
                    of operation; and though divisible in time, are scarcely so otherwise.
                    Banishment has too little of example in it, but, under some circumstances, may
                    prove reformatory. <hi rend="italic">Quasi-imprisonment,</hi> by continuing the
                    offender in old habits, may be corrupting, but <hi rend="italic"
                    >relegation,</hi> by removing him from bad associations into a new sphere, holds
                    out, in general, favourable prospects of his amendment.</p>
                <p>The punishment of transportation, as enforced for many years past in the
                    Australian colonies by the British government, has scarcely one of the qualities
                    above mentioned as desirable. It fails especially in the great object of <hi
                    rend="italic">example</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it neither deters others, nor
                    corrects the offender himself. Instead of suppressing the power of commission,
                    it is the fertile source of crimes. It does not supply the means of compensation
                    to the party injured; it is not Economical, but very costly to the state.
                    Experience has fully confirmed the sagacity of Bentham’s objections to this mode
                    of punishment, and of Archbishop Whately’s subsequent denunciation of it, both
                    as a penal measure and as a branch' of colonial policy. A valuable Report from
                    the late Sélect Committee on Transportation,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons
                    on Transportation, ordered to be printed 3d August 1838.</p></note> has
                    furnished unquestionable proofs “that the two main characteristics of
                    transportation as a punishment are, inefficiency in deterring from crime, and
                    remarkable efficiency, not in reforming, but iri still further corrupting those
                    who undergo the punishment; and that these qualities of inefficiency for good
                    and efficiency for evil, are inherent in the system, which is not, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> therefore, susceptible of any satisfactory
                    improvemént.” The committee have, therefore, recommended its abolition' as soon
                    as practicable. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps">Transportation.)</hi></p>
                <p>The rules of Bentham serve as well for the examination' of capital, as of
                    secondary punishments. Death has the advantageous qualities of completely
                    annihilating the power of injury; of being analogous, as well as popular, in the
                    ’ case of murder; and of being always exemplary. On the other hand, it is not
                    profitable, but costly, in depriving the community of one of its members; it is
                    extremely unequal, according to the sentiments and condition <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the offender; it is irrevocable, and, except in the case of murder,
                    unpopular. Balancing all thèse considerations, the conclusion is arrived at,
                    that the prodigality of capital punishment has been an error of legislators, and
                    that there has been a want of reflection in applying it to a class of u <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> nhappy and de&lt; graded men, who attach but little
                    value to life. If, for the purpose of deterring, it should be preserved at all,
                    it should be for crimes which excite the public hoι⅛or to the highest degree,
                    such as atrocious murders, and those by which several lives are destroyed; in
                    which cases' the execution' should be accompanied by every m leans of tragic
                    effect.· The noħ-execution of the law is ñìentiohéd as a collateral· effect of
                    the abuse of capital punishment; and this has indeed been the main argument of
                    those, who, from Sir Samuel Romilly, down to tħe present day, have laboured for
                    the mitigation of the criminal l⅛w of England. It is certain that excessive
                    severity defeats its own object, in so far as it induces the persons entrusted
                    with the administration of the laws, to substitute their own nbtions of right,
                    from time to time, for the will of the legislature.</p>
                <p>Bentham’s nomenclature and classifications have been objected to as too arbitrary
                    for the state of the science; but taking his theory of punishment as a part of
                    his general system of legislation, it cannot but be regarded as a masterpiece of
                    jurisprudence. It is only time to dismiss such a <pb break="no"

                    shall have formed for himself a better abstract idea of punishment than
                    Bentham’s suggestions have furnished.</p>
                <p>The writers on different branches of penal law, since the commencement of the
                    present century, have been so numerous, particularly on the Continent, that it
                    would be vain to attempt to recapitulate here the various theories of punishment
                    which have been offered. The names of Feuerbach, Mittermaier,<note

                    Germany, are an honour to jurisprudence, however little practical result may
                    have arisen from their labours. Several recent French writers are worthy of
                    reference; especially Μ. Charles Lucas, and the Due de Broglie, on the
                    punishment of death. Mr. E. G. Wakefield’s essay on the same subject, and Mr.
                    Montagu’s collection of opinions on capital punishment, may be consulted with
                    advantage. Archbishop Whately, in his well known Letters to Earl Grey on
                    Secondary Punishments, has laid down very clearly and forcibly the principles by
                    which the infliction of punishment ought to be regulated. “There are,” says the
                    Archbishop, “three and only three objects with a view to which punishments can
                    be inflicted or threatened; 1st, <hi rend="italic">retribution,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vengeance,</hi> or a desire to allot a proportionate suffering to
                    each degree of moral guilt, independent of any ulterior consideration, and
                    solely with a view to the past ill-desert of the offender. 2dly, What may be
                    called <hi rend="italic">correction,</hi> or the prevention of a <hi
                    rend="italic">repetition</hi> of offence by the same individual, whether by his
                    reformation or removal. 3dly, The <hi rend="italic">prevention</hi> of the
                    offence generally by the terror of a punishment denounced, whether that object
                    be attained by the example of a culprit suffering the penalty, or simply by the
                    mere threat and apprehension of it. To these appropriate objects may be added
                    another incidental advantage, not belonging to <hi rend="italic">punishment as
                    such,</hi> but common to them with other legislative enactments; the public
                    benefit in an economical point of view which may be conceivably derived directly
                    from a punishment, as when criminals are usefully employed on any public work,
                    so as to make, in that way, some compensation to society for the injury done to
                    it. Such a compensation, however, we should remember, must necessarily be so
                    very inadequate, that this object should always be made completely subordinate
                    to the main end, or ends, proposed in the denunciation of punishment.” The
                    archbishop then proceeds to shew that, regarding the prevention of crime as the
                    great object, the infliction of just vengeance on the guilty is clearly out of
                    man’s province, inasmuch as the degree of moral turpitude can never be perfectly
                    known but to the searcher of all hearts, and that no man, nor number of men, can
                    be authorised thus to render evil for evil for its own sake, but on the contrary
                    such a procedure is expressly forbidden, both by morality and the Christian
                    religion. Of the other two objects of punishment, the archbishop explains that
                    the prevention of a repetition of the offence by the same individual, is of less
                    importance than the prevention of crime generally by the terror of example or
                    threat, and after shewing that every man punished is an instance, <hi
                    rend="italic">pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto,</hi> of the inefficacy of the
                    law, remarks, “this absolute perfection, indeed, the entire prevention of crime,
                    is a point unattainable; but it is a point to which we may approach
                    indefinitely; it is the point towards which our measures must be always tending,
                    and we must estimate their wisdom by the degrees of their approach to it.”
                    Passing over thus briefly Archbishop Whately’s exposition of penal principles,
                    we proceed to notice a recent masterly work by a distinguished foreign jurist on
                    this subject.</p>
                <p>The work in question contains a complete theory of penal law, founded upon
                    ethical principles different from those of Beccaria and Bentham. We refer to
                    Rossi’s valuable treatise. <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de Droit Penal,</hi> par Μ. P. Rossi, Professeur
                    du Droit Romain à l’Académie de Genève.) Μ. Rossi examines at large the
                    foundation of the right to punish; whether it depends on a moral principle, or a
                    material interest; whether it is to be traced to justice, or merely to utility?
                    He rejects the notion of either individual, or general interest, conferring any
                    such right; not admitting the ground of necessity, direct or indirect, or the
                    existence of the social contract, upon which Beccaria relies. He holds that
                    there exists a moral order in the world, binding upon all free and intelligent
                    beings who are cognizant of it; that absolute justice is in perfect harmony with
                    this moral order; and that all human justice, though not able to attain such
                    perfection, ought to strive to approach it. Upon this justice, then, the right
                    of punishment is founded; and punishment is defined as “the retribution made, by
                    a legitimate judge, with pondération and measure, of evil for evil.” Thus, penal
                    justice only acts when some duty is violated; for law and right are, under this
                    theory, the same; and the natural effects of justice are instruction,
                    intimidation, and amendment. A crime is defined as the violation of a duty
                    towards society or individuals, requirable <hi rend="italic">(exigible)</hi> in
                    itself, and useful to the maintenance of public order; of a duty whose
                    accomplishment can only be assured by the penal sanction, and whose infraction
                    can be appreciated by human justice: and an enumeration of crimes and offences
                    follows. In his third book, Μ. Rossi treats of the nature and end, the measure
                    and effects of punishments, and then proceeds to give directions for the choice
                    of them, pointing out the characteristics which should mark them, in order that
                    the ends of human justice may be attained. Social justice, to be legitimate,
                    must respect the conditions of moral justice; must take into account the
                    imperfection of our means of knowledge and action; and must satisfy the
                    exigencies of the material order in civil society. These rules will direct the
                    choice of punishments, which in their application must be proportionate to the
                    crime, and sufficient for the protection of the right. In order, then, to
                    conform to the principle of justice, the legislator should choose such
                    punishments as are,</p>
                <p>(1st class) Personal,</p>
                <p>Moral, Divisible.</p>
                <p>To be in relation with our imperfect means of knowledge and action, he should
                    choose such as are,</p>
                <p>(2d class) Appreciable, Reparable, or remissable.</p>
                <p>To satisfy the exigencies of the material order, punishments should be adapted to
                    produce the effects which the legislator has in view, and should therefore
                    be,</p>
                <p>(3d class) Instructive and satisfying, Exemplary, Reformatory, Fortifying
                    (rassurante.)</p>
                <p>Trying different kinds of punishments by these conditions, it will appear that
                    the punishment of death is of the first class, except that it is not divisible;
                    that it is appreciable, because applicable to every one, but not remissible;
                    that it is instructive, because when applied to a small number of crimes, it is
                    a moral lesson to society; that it is only under particular circumstances that
                    it is exemplary, or calculated to intimidate those disposed to commit crimes;
                    that of course the dead cannot be reformed; and that it so far fortifies or
                    assures society, that it suppresses the individual’s power of injury. In the
                    result, Μ. Rossi declares capital<pb break="no" facs="nls:193541930"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1930-0735"/> punishment admissible in itself, but in extreme
                    cases only, and that its abolition is desirable when the advance of civilization
                    shall have prepared men for so important a change.</p>
                <p>Μ. Rossi regards all corporal punishment as of an immoral tendency, and considers
                    imprisonment as the punishment best fitted to civilized society. He states the
                    most essential object to be, such a separation of the convicted, as completely
                    corresponds with the ends of penality, and moral amendment. But he seems to
                    intend rather a kind of classification, than the entire separation of the
                    prisoners from each other. He is opposed to transportation, and in a less degree
                    to relegation and banishment, as being defective in the exemplary and
                    reformatory qualities. Local interdiction, restraining the offender from
                    frequenting particular districts, may, he thinks, be used with more advantage.
                    He shows the immorality of infamous punishments, such as the pillory, and the
                    impolicy and injustice of those which deprive offenders of civil rights, or of
                    the whole, or the greater portion of their property. Lastly, he cautions the
                    reader not to expect to find a punishment combining <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    desirable Dualities, much less one that unites them all in the same egree,</p>
                <p>In his fourth book, Μ. Rossi offers instructions as to the formation of a penal
                    code; for the details of which the enquirer is referred to this very systematic
                    and philosophical work. Μ. Rossi concurs with Beccaria and Bentham in many
                    important particulars; and although the principle upon which the right to punish
                    rests may not have been satisfactorily determined by any of these authorities,
                    still the short notice we have given of them will shew how far they have
                    advanced the science of penal jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>The efforts made in penal legislation have, from a variety of causes, been bolder
                    on the Continent than in Britain. The result has assuredly not been always
                    successful; but it is by such beginnings that the true course is pursued for the
                    formation of a good penal code; and no doubt can be entertained, that imperfect
                    as these, efforts have been, the condition of the people for whose use they were
                    made, has been greatly benefited by them. Of all of them it may be said that
                    they are deficient in respect of humanity, and the establishing a just
                    proportion between crimes and punishments; and moreover erroneous in the
                    including cases unfit, and excluding others fit for punishment, still leaving a
                    vast discretion to the judges; but they have however, to the extent of the
                    surface which they have covered, rendered a knowledge of the penal law
                    practicable, and given great facility to its improvement by the recordation of
                    its provisions. We shall give from one or two of the codes of criminal law now
                    before us, an outline of their most prominent features.</p>
                <p>The famous code collected under the auspices of the Emperor Charles V., and known
                    under the name of the “Carolina,” and which, we are told in the preface, “is
                    properly the collection and confirmation of the laws which have been, from time
                    immemorial, in use in the tribunals in Germany,” is an elaborate work on penal
                    jurisprudence; and in particular, is extremely copious and minute on the subject
                    of torture, which was at that time deemed a highly efficient and indispensable
                    instrument of criminal procedure.</p>
                <p>The code commences, very properly, in respect of arrangement, with the judicial
                    establishment; but after all, leaves it indeterminate with respect to the manner
                    in which it is to be composed, and omits to give any exact and precise
                    definition of the relative power of each of the several classes of individuals
                    that enter into its formation. It appears clearly that there were to be certain
                    established judges, and that to them were to be added all the nobles, <hi
                    rend="italic">in the quality of judges and assessors,</hi> not precisely fixing
                    in what quality they are to act, or whether the decision was ultimately to rest
                    with the judges, under the advice simply, or under the control, of those other
                    judges or assessors. Next follows, not as might have been expected, an
                    enumeration and definition of offences, and of the punishments annexed to them,
                    but a minute account of cases, consisting of forty· one articles, in which
                    torture may be employed to extract a confession of guilt. Afterwards come
                    several articles respecting proof by witnesses; and then the distribution of
                    offences, not as such, but by the punishment annexed to them.</p>
                <p>In this code, the torture, as has been already mentioned, is most extensively
                    applied. By article XLI. it is provided, that it shall be a sufficient ground
                    for applying torture, in order to produce confession, in the instance of a man
                    accused of incendiarism, whenever, in other respects, his conduct shall be
                    suspicious. It is upon similar slight grounds throughout the code, that this
                    most dreadful instrument is brought into action. The code, although defective in
                    the arrangement of offences, contains some observations with regard to the
                    indications of guilt from accompanying circumstances, that might not be found
                    altogether useless at the present day.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Code Carolina</hi> appears in the nineteenth century a
                    barbarous piece of legislation, but was unquestionably a progress in its time.
                    It had for its object the introduction of more regularity and measure in
                    criminal proceedings and sentences. Its establishment was not effected without
                    modification in some places, and even resistance in others. The following is a
                    curious instance of an attempt to pervert its meaning. Article XI. declares, “it
                    is never to be lost sight of, that prisons ought to be made and established for
                    the safe custody of those detained, and not to be used as a dangerous
                    punishment.” A French translation of the <hi rend="italic">Carolina,</hi> for
                    the use of the councils of war of the Swiss troops, printed at Bienne in 1767,
                    contains this commentary: “Although the law recommends humanity with respect to
                    the nature of the prison in general, we may say that in cases of atrocious
                    crimes, and where the vengeance of the public is absolutely interested, <hi
                    rend="italic">the hardest and darkest dungeons ought to be used</hi> for the
                    confinement of criminals, provided only that their lives are not risked.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rossi, Introduction, chap,
                    ii,</p></note> This code is still the foundation of criminal law throughout the
                    greater part of Germany and Switzerland, subject to many modifications which it
                    has undergone in the course of modern legislation.</p>
                <p>A criminal code was prepared for Corsica, under the direction of Louis XV. <hi

                    treason, murder, theft, and homicide, and giving a view very far short of a
                    complete one, of the field of criminal law, the framer of this code, (title IX.)
                    has this article: “In respect of all other crimes and offences which are not
                    mentioned above, we leave it to the prudence of the judges to condemn those who
                    shall be guilty of them, to the punishment fitting for them, according to the
                    exigence and circumstances of the case; not however allowing them the power of
                    punishing with death, either natural or civil, except in the cases above
                    enumerated ;” leaving them, however, a considerable latitude of power in the
                    cases so unprovided for; that is, in the cases in which they were thus invested
                    with despotic authority; namely, that of punishing by hard labour in the
                    galleys, either for a limited period, or for life.</p>
                <p>In the above two instances, we have specimens of two penal codes, formed at
                    comparatively early periods. Next follow examples of others of a more modem
                    date. A code for Bavaria was drawn up, by direction of the king, by Μ.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541943" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1943-0736"/>
                <p>Bexon, and published by him in a folio volume at Paris in 1807· It professes to
                    contain a complete system of criminal jurisprudence, including punishments and
                    police. Μ. Bexon, however, has by no means pursued the clear and natural course,
                    of first enumerating what are to be deemed offences, and then declaring the
                    penal consequences of committing such offences. He begins with a system of
                    police, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Legislation de la Surete,</hi> and
                    then proceeds to state the several purposes to which this branch of
                    administration is applicable. Now the characteristic feature of a system of
                    police, is, that it is to serve for the prevention of offences; so that we have,
                    at the outset, the rules of a system of administration employed for the
                    prevention of certain acts which remain to be stated. In the subdivisions of the
                    work, the dispositions are neither clear nor convenient. Crimes, punishments,
                    tribunals, and procedure, are mixed together, instead of being kept separate and
                    distinct, as they ought to be. The penal code itself adopts the old principle of
                    division, and classes offences under the several heads of crimes against the
                    public; crimes against persons; and crimes against things. But what is new in
                    this work, is the distribution of these several species of offences into three
                    distinct classes, according to their supposed delinquency, and which are
                    denominated, 1. <hi rend="italic">Contraventions et Fautes.</hi> 2. <hi
                    rend="italic">Délits.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Crimes.</hi> This is obviously
                    an unnatural and inapposite system of division, as it supposes that each class
                    of offences is susceptible of only three stages of extenuation or aggravation,
                    while, in fact, the same act is capable of varying, and continually does vary,
                    and that by extremely minute steps, throughout all the gradations of guilt.</p>
                <p>The present penal legislation of France is, without doubt, far more rational and
                    humane than that which existed before the Revolution. Still the Code Napoleon,
                    the offspring of that imperial power which re-established confiscation, and
                    re-opened Bastilles, is, in many respects, unworthy of the present state of
                    French civilization. The penal branch of the Code Napoleon was decreed the 12th
                    of February 1810, and promulgated the 22d of the same month. It is comprised
                    within 114 moderately-sized octavo pages. It begins by declaring that a
                    violation of the law, cognizable by the police, is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >contravention;</hi> that a violation of the law, which is visited by a
                    correctional punishment, is an <hi rend="italic">offence;</hi> and that a
                    violation of the law, which is visited by an afflictive and infamous punishment,
                    is a <hi rend="italic">crime.</hi> This division is quite arbitrary, and
                    displays too much disregard of the intrinsic nature of human actions. Certainly
                    it does not coincide with Μ. Rossi’s theory of the concordance of penal law with
                    the moral order of things; for actions are in many instances placed in the
                    catalogue of crimes and offences (such as the assembling together of twenty-one
                    persons in one place, art. 291,) which have nothing like immorality about them.
                    The several species of punishments employed are then enumerated, and are, 1.
                    Death. 2. Hard labour for life. 3. Transportation. 4. Hard labour for limited
                    periods. 5. Seclusion. 6. The <hi rend="italic">carcan,</hi> (analogous to the
                    pillory). 7. Banishment. 8. Civil degradation. 9∙ Imprisonment during a limited
                    period in a house of correction. 10. Suspension, temporary, of certain civil
                    rights. 11. Making satisfaction to the party injured. To these are added, in the
                    cases specified, the drawing a ball, to be attached to the feet; imprinting on
                    the right shoulder, by means of a red-hot iron, certain letters; standing on the
                    <hi rend="italic">carcan,</hi> having above the head affixed a writing in large
                    and legible characters, mentioning the name of the patient, his profession,
                    residence, punishment, and the occasion of it. Some of the punishments are also
                    attended with certain civil disabilities, of which some are temporary, others
                    perpetual. With regard to forfeiture, which figures to so great an extent in the
                    English penal code, it is here declared not to attach in any case as the
                    necessary consequence of conviction, but to have place only when expressly
                    pronounced to be a part of the punishment, and the instances in which it is used
                    are comparatively few; and even then the forfeited property remains liable to
                    all just encumbrances, and to the rightful portions of the children, or other
                    descendants.</p>
                <p>Offences are divided into two classes, 1st, those affecting the public; and 2dly,
                    those affecting individuals. Under the first class, the principal offences
                    comprised are, offences against the exterior and interior <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the state, levying war, counterfeiting the coin; and malversation on
                    the part of public functionaries. Under the second head are included, offences
                    affecting particular assignable persons, such as murder, and other personal
                    injuries, perjury, and offences against property.</p>
                <p>Under this code, the judges and officers of justice are placed in a somewhat
                    undignified light, by various pecuniary fines of fi'om 16 to 200 francs, for
                    pronouncing judgment notwithstanding an appeal, or other acts of misconduct. The
                    policy of thus setting a money price on infractions of judicial duty is very
                    questionable, although the judges should clearly be amenable to punishment of
                    some kind for the slightest malversation of their functions.</p>
                <p>Capital punishment is authorized by the Code Napoleon in many cases where it is
                    obviously not justifiable by necessity, such as, for counterfeiting the coin,
                    for destroying the national fortifications, &amp;c. And the application of such
                    degrading punishments as branding and the <hi rend="italic">carcan,</hi> to a
                    pretty wide class of offences, savours little of refinement. The establishments
                    for hard labour, called the <hi rend="italic">bagnes,</hi> though lately
                    improved, are carried on upon a brutal system of force, which is disgraceful, as
                    the penal instrument of a highly civilized nation.</p>
                <p>The present criminal code of Prussia consists of 1577 articles. With much that is
                    wise and humane, it mixes some enactments of quite revolting barbarity. It, in
                    fact, confuses together a number of moral precepts, of administrative
                    regulations, of legal dogmas, and penal enactments. More than twelve articles
                    authorise the breaking the offender on the wheel, making nice distinctions where
                    the punishment is to begin at the upper part of the body, and where at the legs.
                    Hanging, decapitation by the axe, flogging with rods, and whips, are all
                    specified as modes of punishment, and incendiaries are, in certain cases, to be
                    burned alive. The definition of treason is fearfully vague. “The voluntary act
                    of a subject, by which the state, or its chief, are attacked in an immediate
                    manner,” art. 91; and there is the most striking immorality in the manner in
                    which the wives of deserting soldiers are punished, if they do not betray their
                    husbands, even in certain cases in which they may be declared innocent by the
                    law.</p>
                <p>The penal code of Austria is, upon the whole, of a milder character than that of
                    Prussia, but its forms of procedure <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> commit so
                    much discretionary power to the administrators of the law, as to leave the
                    people little real security against oppression. The 14th article authorizes
                    solitary imprisonment of so severe a kind, as almost to amount to a lingering
                    death. The punishment consists in “shutting up the convict in prison, without
                    any communication, with as much light and space as is requisite to keep the
                    prisoner in health, who is to have heavy irons constantly on his hands and feet,
                    and round his body an iron ring fixed by a chain, except during labour; his diet
                    shall be wholly bread and water, and every other day a warm mess, but never of
                    meat; some bare boards are to form his bed, and all conversation is forbidden
                    him.” Men are to be flogged with a staff, and women and children with rods, for
                    many offences. Forging paper-money is punished with death; blasphemy, or
                    spreading false religious doctrines, with imprisonment from six months to ten
                    years. We will only add one curious specimen of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >contravention,</hi> “Whoever endeavours to persuade an Austrian subject to
                    establish himself in a foreign country, shall be punishable with confinement
                    from one month to six months.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541956"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1956-0737"/>The criminal law varies in every one of the States
                    which form the United States of Amcrica, and consequently, taking the whole
                    Union, there is a great inequality in the system of punishments, and more
                    especially of capital punishments. The disproportionate penalties inflicted in
                    different States for the same offence cannot but have an unfavourable tendency
                    upon morals, in a country which, for all purposes of intercourse and traffic, is
                    essentially <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> although possessing various local
                    legislatures. Many of these criminal laws will be found abstracted in Mr.
                    Crawford’s Report, and in the Second Report of the Criminal Law Commissioners.
                    The criminal code of Louisiana, drawn up by Mr. Livingston, is deservedly
                    celebrated, and is remarkable for not inflicting capital punishment upon any
                    crime whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Having thus adverted to some specimens of criminal legislation abroad, we shall
                    conclude with a notice of the progress that has of late years been made in
                    England in this respect.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the examples that have been thus set us abroad, the British
                    legislature has shewn little disposition to collect into one body of criminal
                    jurisprudence the various decisions and enactments which now constitute the
                    penal system of this country. Great authorities, both dead and living, may
                    indeed be quoted in support of a revision of our whole penal system, among whom
                    none are entitled to more weight than Mr. Justice Blackstone, who in his
                    Commentaries expressed himself decidedly in favour of such a revision, (b. iv.
                    eh. 1.) Little or nothing, however, was done towards the improvement of the
                    criminal law, until the late Sir Samuel Romilly, when he obtained a seat in
                    Parliament, brought in a series of bills, having for their object to mitigate,
                    in certain eases, the severity of the penal law, by substituting for the
                    punishment of death transportation for life, or for limited periods. He procured
                    the repeal of so much of the statute of 8th Elizabeth, as took away the benefit
                    of clergy from persons stealing privily from the person, and also the repeal of
                    capital punishment in eases of stealing to the amount of 40s. on navigable
                    rivers, and of stealing from bleaching-grounds. He failed in his attempts to
                    repeal the punishment of death in eases of stealing to the amount of 5s.
                    privately in a shop, and to the value of 40s. in a dwelling-house; but as we
                    shall presently see, these objects have been subsequently effected. Sir Samuel
                    Romilly, and after him Sir James Mackintosh, had the merit of contending against
                    the erroneous principle of severe punishment rarely inflicted, and advocating
                    that of the uniform infliction of milder punishments, duly proportioned to the
                    magnitude of offences; and it is to their exertions that is attributable much of
                    the attention which the legislature has since bestowed upon the subject. We
                    proceed to enumerate some recent statutes which have gradually mitigated the
                    severity of our penal law, and otherwise improved the administration of criminal
                    justice.</p>
                <p>The act 7th Geo. IV. cap. 64, (1826), “for improving the administration of
                    criminal justice in England,” among other provisions, enables bail to be taken
                    in eases of felony, where there is not a strong presumption of guilt.</p>
                <p>The act 7th and 8th Geo. IV. cap. 27, (1827), repeals upwards of 130 statutes,
                    and parts of statutes, relative to the benefit of clergy, and to lareeny and
                    other offences connected therewith, and to malicious injuries to property, and
                    to remedies against the hundred, thereby clearing the way for the four acts next
                    mentioned, (commonly called Sir Robert Peel’s), viz.:</p>
                <p>The act 7th and 8th Geo. IV., cap. 28, (1827,) which, among other provisions,
                    wholly abolishes the benefit of clergy, and declares that no person shall suffer
                    death, unless for some felony previously excluded from benefit of clergy.</p>
                <p>The act 7th and 8th Geo. IV., cap. 29, (1827,) for “con solidating and amending
                    the laws relative to larceny, and other offences connected therewith,” which
                    abolishes the distinction between grand and petty larceny, and declares that
                    larceny shall be punished with transportation, or imprisonment with whipping. It
                    then proceeds to inflict punishment on various offences of this description,
                    amongst which, for robbery from the person, death; for stealing from the person,
                    transportation, or imprisonment with whipping; for burglary, housebreaking,
                    stealing in a dwelling-house to the value of L.5, and cattle and sheep-stealing,
                    death. It also gives summary jurisdiction to justices of the peace over a
                    variety of petty depredations.</p>
                <p>The act 7th and 8th Geo. IV., cap. 30, (1827,) “for consolidating and amending
                    the laws relative to malicious injuries to property,” inflicts the punishment of
                    death for arson; for setting fire to coal mines, or to ships; and for riotously
                    demolishing buildings, or machinery; also transportation, or imprisonment with
                    whipping, for the destruction of manufactures, or machinery, or the destruction,
                    or injury of seabanks, turnpikes, dams, cattle, stacks of corn,” &amp;c.' It
                    also gives summary jurisdiction to justices, in cases of injuries to trees, or
                    fruit, and of various other petty trespasses.</p>
                <p>The act 7th and 8th Geo. IV., cap. 31, (1827,) which consolidates and amends the
                    laws relative to remedies against the hundred, for riotous destruction of
                    property.</p>
                <p>The act 9th Geo. IV., cap. 31, (1828,) repeals upwards of fifty statutes relative
                    to offences against the person; enacts the punishment of death for murder,
                    malicious shooting, cutting and maiming, administering poison, attempting to
                    drown, suffocate, &amp;c. and for rape and sodomy; and transportation or
                    imprisonment for various other óffenees of a personal nature. It also gives
                    summary jurisdiction to justices of the peace over common assaults.</p>
                <p>The act 11th Geo. IV., and 1st Will. IV., cap. 66, (1830,) abolishes capital
                    punishment in all eases of forgery, except those particularly specified, viz.,
                    forgery of the royal seals, or sign manual, of Exchequer bills, bank notes,
                    wills, bills of exchange, promissory notes, or money-orders, of transfers of
                    stock, or powers of attorney, and other forgeries connected with the preceding.
                    Forgeries of other descriptions are subjected to transportation or
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 2d Will. IV., cap. 34, (1832,) abolishes capital punishment for all
                    offences whatever relative to the coin, and subjects them to transportation, or
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 2d and 3d Will. IV., cap. 62, (18∙&gt;2,) substitutes transportation for
                    life for capital punishment, in cases of stealing in a dwelling-house to the
                    value of L.5, and of cattle and sheep stealing; so far altering the provisions
                    of the larceny act, 7th and 8th Geo. IV.</p>
                <p>The act 2d and 3d Will. IV. cap. 123, substitutes transportation for life for
                    capital punishment in all cases where the latter is inflicted by the 11th Geo.
                    IV., and 1st Will. IV., except only the forgery of wills, and of powers of
                    attorney for stock.</p>
                <p>The act 3d and 4th Will. IV., cap. 44, (I833,) abolishes capital punishment for
                    dwelling-house robbery as inflicted by the lareeny act, and substitutes
                    transportation or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 4th Will. IV., cap. 26, (1834,) abolishes the practice of dissecting, or
                    hanging in chains, persons convicted of murder.</p>
                <p>The act 4th and 5th Will. IV., cap. 67, (1834,) abolishes capital punishment in
                    case of returning from transportation.</p>
                <p>The act 5th and 6th Will. IV., cap. 33, (1835,) extends the powers of taking bail
                    in cases of felony, notwithstanding confession, or presumption of guilt.</p>
                <p>The act 5th and 6th Will. IV., cap. 81, (1835,) abolishes capital punishment for
                    letter stealing and sacrilege, and substitutes transportation or
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 23, (1837,) abolishes the punishment of the pillory in
                    all eases whatsoever.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541969" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1969-0738"/>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 84, (1837,) abolishes entirely the punishment of death
                    for forgery, as retained by the 2d and 3d Will. IV., or any other existing laws,
                    and substitutes transportation or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 85, (1837,) makes new provisions for the punishment of
                    offences against the person. Capital punishment is inflicted for administering
                    poison, or doing bodily injury with intent to murder. Other offences with intent
                    to commit murder, or for acts with intent to maim or disfigure, or to procure
                    abortion, are made punishable with different degrees of transportation or
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 86, (1837,) limits capital punishment for burglary, to
                    cases where that offence is accompanied by violence. In other cases,
                    transportation or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 87, (1837,) alters the former laws relative to
                    robbery, and some other offences. The punishment for robbery, attended with
                    cutting or wounding, is declared to be death, but in other cases, transportation
                    or imprisonment. Obtaining property, by accusation of unnatural crimes, stealing
                    from the person, assaults with intent to rob, obtaining property by menace, and
                    plundering wrecks, are subjected to transportation or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 88, (1837,) amends the laws relating to piracy, and
                    subjects that offence to death, where murder is attempted, or to transportation
                    or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 89, (1837,) amends the laws relating to arson,
                    punishing with death the offences of setting fire to a dwelling-house, any
                    person being therein, of setting fire to ships with intent to murder, and of
                    hanging out false lights to shipping. For other offences under this head,
                    transportation or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The act 1st Victoria, cap. 90, (1837,) substitutes transportation, during
                    specified terms of years, for transportation for life, in a variety of cases
                    particularized in the act.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the act of 1st Victoria, cap. 91, (1837,) mitigates the punishment of
                    death still further, by substituting transportation or imprisonment for it, in
                    the cases of riotous assemblies, of seducing from allegiance, of certain
                    offences against the revenue laws, and others enumerated in the act.</p>
                <p>A reference to the acts above cited, will shew the gradual mitigation which has,
                    within the last few years, been taking place in the severity of the ancient
                    criminal law of England. Much has thus been effected in the way of the
                    consolidation and arrangement of different branches of law under their proper
                    heads, in particular statutes. Still, since nothing like codification has yet
                    been attempted, the definitions and classifications of both crimes and
                    punishments continue very vague and uncertain. All that we can usefully record
                    here on the subject, is to state what crimes and punishments are understood, in
                    a general sense, to mean by English lawyers.</p>
                <p>A crime, says Blackstone, is the commission, or omission, of an act, in violation
                    of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it. (Commentaries, vol. iv. ch.
                    5.)</p>
                <p>A misdemeanour imports a crime which does not amount to felony, but is the
                    subject of indictment. (Commentaries, vol. iv. ch. 5.) It is generally
                    punishable with fine and imprisonment.</p>
                <p>A felony is such a crime as, independently of other punishments, occasioned at
                    common law a total forfeiture of lands, or goods, or both. (Commentaries, vol.
                    iv. ch. 55.) A felony generally carries with it the idea of a capital crime. But
                    felonies are either punishable with death, or not. Felonies are punishable with
                    death, where the offence was excluded from benefit of clergy by the common law,
                    or by any statute, before the 7th and 8th Geo. IV., cap. 28, or where, since
                    that statute, they have been made capital; provided that in neither case the
                    capital punishment has been taken away by any subsequent statute. In other
                    cases, felonies are punishable either in the particular manner described by the
                    statute relating thereto, or otherwise by transportation, or imprisonment, with
                    whipping, if a male, at the discretion of the court.</p>
                <p>Misprisions, and contempts, are a species of misdemeanour, affecting the king, or
                    his government, or courts of justice.</p>
                <p>Misprision of felony, however, in its ordinary sense, is a misdemeanour
                    consisting in the knowledge or concealment of a felony committed by another, and
                    is punishable by fine and imprisonment. (Burn’s Justice, title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Felony.)</hi><hi rend="italic">We</hi> should add, that on the 23d July, 1833,
                    a Royal Commission was issued for the purpose of digesting into one statute all
                    the statutes and enactments touching crimes, and the trial and punishment
                    thereof, and also of digesting into another statute all the provisions of the
                    common or unwritten law touching the same, and for inquiring and reporting how
                    far it might be expedient to combine both those statutes into one body of the
                    criminal law, repealing all other statutory provisions, or how far it might be
                    expedient to pass into a law the first mentioned statute only, and generally for
                    inquiring and reporting as to the consolidation of the other branches of the
                    existing statute law. The question of codification is discussed in the first
                    report of the commissioners dated 24th June, 1834, which, after a very elaborate
                    statement of the difficulties which the present uncertain state of the law
                    presents to such an undertaking, expresses a confident opinion that a digest of
                    the statute with the common law, into one criminal code, would tend greatly to
                    the improvement of the jurisprudence of the country. The second report, dated
                    9th June, 1836, is devoted partly to the question of the defence of prisoners by
                    counsel, (since authorized by the act 6th and 7th Will. IV., cap. 114,) and to
                    that of the infliction of capital punishment. The commissioners think that the
                    punishment of death ought to be confined to the crime of high treason, and to
                    offences which consist in, or are aggravated by such acts of violence to the
                    person as directly endanger human life, a list of which acts they subjoin. The
                    third report, dated 10th March 1837, is specially devoted to the subject of
                    juvenile offenders, and expresses the opinion of the commissioners, that it
                    would not be advisable to make any distinction in the mode of trial between
                    adult and juvenile offenders, except by increasing the summary jurisdiction of
                    magistrates in the manner therein mentioned; and that the extension of such
                    summary jurisdiction within certain limits, would be a safe and beneficial
                    alteration of the law, and would tend to diminish juvenile crime.</p>
                <p>The reader is referred to these reports for very valuable information and
                    suggestions, in regard to the amendment and consolidation of the penal law of
                    England, and in particular for a full explanation of the difficulties with which
                    those important objects have been, and continue to be, surrounded, and which,
                    without some technical knowledge, it is by no means easy to appreciate.</p>
