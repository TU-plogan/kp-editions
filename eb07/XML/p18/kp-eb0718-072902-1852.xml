                <p><label type="entry">PUNCTUATION</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> the
                    art of pointing, or of dividing a discourse into periods, by points expressing
                    the pauses to be made therein.</p>
                <p>The points used are four; the period, colon, semicoon, and comma, which are too
                    well known to require any particular explanation. We shall only observe, in
                    general, therefore, that the comma is used to distinguish nouns from nouns,
                    verbs from verbs, and such other parts of a period as are not necessarily joined
                    together. The semicoon serves to suspend and sustain the period when too long;
                    the colon to add some new or supernumerary reason or consequence to what is
                    already said; and the period to close up the sense and construction, and release
                    the voice.</p>
                <p>It has been asserted, that punctuation is a modern art, and that the ancients
                    were entirely unacquainted with the use of our commas and other points, and
                    wrote not only without any distinction of numbers and periods, but also without
                    distinction of words; a custom which, Lipsius observes, continued until the
                    hundred and fourth Olympiad, during which time the sense alone divided the
                    discourse.</p>
                <p>What places this beyond dispute is the Alexandrian manuscript, in the British
                    Museum. Whoever examines this codex will find that the whole is written <hi
                    rend="italic">continuo ductu,</hi> without distinction of words or sentences.
                    How the ancients read their works written in this manner, it is not easy to
                    conceive.</p>
                <p>After the practice ceased of joining words together, notes of distinction were
                    placed at the end of every word. In all the editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fasti</hi><hi rend="italic">Capitolini</hi> these points occur. The same are to
                    be seen on the <hi rend="italic">Columna</hi><hi rend="italic">Fostrata.</hi>
                    For want of them, we find much confusion in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Marmoreum,</hi> and the covenant between the
                    Smyrnaeans and Magnesians, which are both at Oxford. In Salmasius’s edition of
                    <hi rend="italic">Dedicatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Statuae Rigillae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Herodis,</hi> the same confusion occurs, where we find ΔETPITE and
                    ∆euf <hi rend="italic">ισi.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> these marks of
                    distinction, the Walcote inscription found near Bath may serve as a
                    specimen;</p>
                <p>IVLIUSv VITALISv FABRI CESISv LEGv XXVv Vv V STIPENDIORUMv</p>
                <p>After every word here, except at the end of a line, we see the mark v. There is
                    an inscription in Montfaucon, which has a capital letter laid in an horizontal
                    position, by way of interstitial mark, which makes one apt to think that this
                    way of pointing was sometimes according to the fancy of the graver.</p>
                <p>P. F ERRARI VS HERMES CAECINIAE d DIGNAE CONIVGÏ H RARISSIMAE NVMERIAE H</p>
                <p>Here we observe after the words a T laid horizontally, but not after each word,
                    which proves this to be of a much later age than the former.</p>
                <p>As the improvement of stops appears not to have taken place whilst manuscripts
                    and monumental inscriptions were the only known methods of conveying knowledge,
                    it is conjectured that it was introduced with the art of printing. The
                    fourteenth century, to which we are supposed to be indebted for this invention,
                    did not, however, bestow those appendages which we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >stops.</hi> Whoever will be at the pains of examining the first printed books,
                    will discover no stops of any kind; but arbitrary marks here and there,
                    according to the humour of the printer. In the sixteenth century we observe
                    their first appearance. From the books of this age, we find that they were not
                    at all produced at the same time; those we meet with in use being only the
                    comma, the parenthesis, the interrogation, and the full point. To prove this, we
                    need but look into Bale’s Acts of English Worthies, in black letter, printed in
                    1550. In the dedication of this book to Edward VI. we discover a colon, it is
                    true; but as this is the only one of the kind throughout the work, it is plain
                    that the colon was not established at that time, or, if it was, that it had not
                    yet come into common use. Thirty years afterwards, in the sensible and judicious
                    performance of Sir Thomas Elyot, entitled The Governour, imprinted in the year
                    1580, we see the colon as frequently introduced as any other stop; but the
                    semicoon and the mark of admiration were still wanting, neither of these being
                    visible in Sir Thomas’s book. In Hackluyt’s Voyages, printed in 1599, we meet
                    with the semicoon; but, as if the editors did not fully apprehend the propriety
                    of its general admission, it is sparingly introduced. It has been said, indeed,
                    that the semicoon was brought into use at a much earlier period; but it appears
                    that it was only for the purpose of an abbreviation, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ηαmq f) (neq</hi> for <hi rend="italic">namque, neque,</hi> and not in the
                    sense in which it is now employed.</p>
                <p>The semicoon, as well as all the ordinary points, is used in a work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Imagines</hi><hi rend="italic">Deorum,</hi> printed at Leyden in
                    the year 1581, in Roman characters. We likewise meet with them in the
                    translation of a book written in French by Philip de Mornay, lord of Plessis; in
                    the Schoolmaster of Roger Ascham, printed in 1570, with the exception of the
                    semicoon; and in the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion, by Sir Philip Sidney,
                    published in 1587, in which we find the asterisk, brackets, the interrogation,
                    the comma, and the semicoon, all as we now use them, the colon and period being
                    square dots.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541865" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1865-0730"/>
                <p>In an alchemical manuscript, of date 1572, the semicoon is said to be met with,
                    as well as the other three points which are now in common use. The colon and
                    period are abundant in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Dionysius de
                    Situ</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbis,</hi> printed at Venice in 1498, but none of
                    the other stops or points occur. The single point ( . ) appears to be the most
                    ancient. Since the year 1485 the colon was introduced; the comma is first seen
                    about the year 1521; and the more refined semicoon was brought into use about
                    the year 1570.</p>
                <p>The invention of the semicoon is most probably due to the English; for, from the
                    Leyden edition of Pliny, 1553, it is evident that the Dutch printers were not
                    then in the practice of using it; and if they were in 1570, Roger Ascham would
                    probably have employed it, since the Dutch were the principal classical printers
                    in his time. But we find that some English books were marked with it at that
                    period.</p>
                <p>The note of admiration was the last stop invented, and seems to have been added
                    to the rest at a period not far distant from our own time.</p>
                <p>Thus we see that these notes of distinction came into use as learning gradually
                    advanced and improved; one invention, indeed, but enlarged by several additions.
                    But notwithstanding what has been said relative to the use of stops as being a
                    modern invention, we shall find reason to be satisfied that the ancients were
                    not unacquainted with the method of making pauses in speaking and writing, if we
                    attend to the following investigation of Warburton.</p>
                <p>“Some species of pauses and divisions of sentences in speaking and writing must
                    have been coeval with the knowledge of communicating ideas by sound or by
                    symbols.</p>
                <p>“Suidas says that the <hi rend="italic">period</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >colon</hi> were discovered and explained by Thrasymachus, about 380 years
                    before the Christian era. Cicero says that Thrasymachus was the first who
                    studied oratorical numbers, which entirely consisted in the artificial structure
                    of periods and colons. It appears from a passage in Aristotle, that punctuation
                    was known in his time. The learned Dr Edward Bernard refers the knowledge of
                    pointing to the time of that philosopher, and says that it consisted in the
                    different positions of one single point. At the bottom of a letter, thus (A.),
                    it was equivalent to a comma; in the middle (A·) it was equal to a colon; at the
                    top (A’) it denoted a period, or the conclusion of a sentence.</p>
                <p>“This mode was easily practised in Greek manuscripts, while they were written in
                    capitals. But when the small letters were adopted, that is, about the ninth
                    century, this distinction could not be observed; a change was therefore made in
                    the scheme of punctuation. <hi rend="italic">Unciales literas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hodierno usu dicimus eas in vetustis codicibus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quae</hi><hi rend="italic">priscam formam servant, ac</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solutae</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt, nec mutuo colligantur.
                    Hujus</hi><hi rend="italic">modi literae</hi><hi rend="italic">unciales
                    observantur in libris omnibus ad nonum usque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >saeculum.</hi> Montf. <hi rend="italic">Palaeog.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Recens.</hi> p. xii.</p>
                <p>“According to Cicero, the ancient Romans as well as the Greeks made use of
                    points. He mentions these under the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >librariorum</hi><hi rend="italic">notae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in
                    several parts of his works he speaks of ‘ <hi rend="italic">interpunctae
                    clausula in</hi><hi rend="italic">orationibus.'</hi></p>
                <p>“Seneca, who died <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 65, expressly says that Latin
                    writers in his time had been used to punctuation. <hi rend="italic">‘ Nos,
                    cum</hi><hi rend="italic">scribimus, interpungere consuevimus'</hi> Muretus and
                    Lipsius imagined that these words alluded to the insertion of a point after each
                    word; but they certainly were mistaken, for they must necessarily refer to marks
                    of punctuation in the division of sentences, because in the passage in which
                    these words occur, Seneca is speaking of one Q. Haterius, who made no pauses in
                    his orations.</p>
                <p>“According to Suetonius, Valerius Probus procured copies of many old books, and
                    employed himself in correcting, pointing, and illustrating them; devoting his
                    time to this and no other part of grammar: <hi rend="italic">Multa exemplaria
                    contracta emendare, ac distinguere et adnotare curavit·, soli</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">huic, iieC ulli</hi><hi rend="italic">praeterea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">grammatices parti deditus.</hi> It appears from hence that, in the
                    time of Probus, or about the year 68, Latin manuscripts had not been usually
                    pointed, and that grammarians made it their business to supply this deficiency.
                    Quintillian, who wrote his celebrated treatise on Oratory about the year 88,
                    speaks of commas, colons, and periods; but it must be observed that by these
                    terms he means clauses, members, and complete sentences, and not the marks of
                    punctuation. Aelius Donatus published a treatise on Grammar in the fourth
                    century, in which he explains the <hi rend="italic">distinctio,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">media</hi><hi rend="italic">distinctio,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">subdis-tinctio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, the use of a
                    single point in the various positions already mentioned.</p>
                <p>“Jerome, who had been the pupil of Donatus, in his Latin version of the
                    Scriptures made use of certain distinctions or divisions, which he calls <hi
                    rend="italic">cola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">commata.</hi> It has however been
                    thought probable that these divisions were not made by the addition of any
                    points or stops, but were formed by writing, in one line, as many words as
                    constituted a clause, equivalent to what we distinguish by a comma or a colon.
                    These divisions were called <hi rend="italic">στιχοι</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ξηματα,</hi> and had the appearance of short irregular verses in poetry. There
                    are some Greek manuscripts still extant which are written in this manner.”</p>
