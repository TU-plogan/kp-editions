                    one of that group of West India islands called the great Antilles, and the
                    smallest of the four in population and extent, but yielding to none in fertility
                    and genera] importance. It is situated to the east or windward of Hayti, Cuba,
                    and Jamaica, being separated on the west from the first named island by a
                    channel twenty-five leagues in breadth, and having the Atlantic Ocean on the
                    north, with the Carribean Sea on the south. It is about ninety miles in length
                    from east to west, by thirty-three miles in average breadth; and contains,
                    according to an exact admeasurement, a plane superficies of 2970 square
                    miles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These are the
                    dimensions assigned to the island by Colonel Flinter in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Account of the Present State of the Island of Puerto Rico</hi> 1884. Malte
                    Brun, on what authority does not appear, makes it one hundred and twenty miles
                    in length by forty in breadth; and other geographical writers extend its
                    longitudinal dimensions still further. Probably the discrepancy arises from
                    extreme points being taken in the one case, whilst a medium measurement is that
                    given by Colonel Flinter, who had the most ample means of knowing every thing
                    connected with the island. To hi» work on Porto Ricowe have been chiefly
                    indebted for the present account of it.</p></note> A chain of lofty mountains
                    intersects it from east to west; the highest part, called Luguilla, at the
                    north-east extremity of the island, being 1334 Castillian yards in height.
                    Valleys, levels of table land, and gentle declivities, all highly fruitful, are
                    every where found embosomed in these mountains; and they are themselves
                    susceptible of cultivation to the very tops. To the north and south of this
                    interior ridge, situated between it and the sea coast, are those richly fertile
                    valleys which produce the chief wealth of the island. They are formed by smaller
                    ridges of hills, which run north and south from the principal chain, and are
                    much more level than those situated amongst the loftier mountains, which present
                    an unequal, undulating surface, and a continued succession of gentle
                    acclivities, covered with trees displaying all the varied colours and vivid
                    foliage of the tropics. The valleys of the north and east coasts are the richest
                    in cattle, and the most picturesque, the pasturage there being always verdant
                    and luxuriant, from the abundant supply of rain which they receive; whilst those
                    of the south coast, richer than the north in sugar, are often parched by
                    excessive drought. This, however, can easily be remedied, for water is found by
                    digging only half a yard below the surface of the ground. Few countries of the
                    same extent as Porto Ricoare watered by so many streams. Seventeen rivers,
                    taking their rise in the mountains, cross the valleys of the north coast and
                    fall into the sea. Some of them are broad and deep, and navigable for two or
                    three leagues <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538303" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8303-0456"
                    />from their emboucheurs, which, however, are much obstructed by bars. These
                    rivers arc well stocked with excellent fish; and the banks of the whole of them
                    are nearly all under cultivation. The south, west, and east coasts are well
                    supplied with water, notwithstanding the nnfrequency of rain. There are several
                    large streams, besides numberless rivulets, and branches of navigable water.
                    Porto Ricotherefore possesses great natural facilities for inland navigation,
                    particularly upon the north coast. Of course we find the year divided in this
                    island, as in the others belonging to the West Indies, into the wet and dry
                    seasons, the former the winter, the latter the summer. But this distinction does
                    not give <hi rend="italic">a</hi> proper idea of the seasons in Porto Rico for
                    on the north coast it sometimes rains during the whole year, whilst on the south
                    coast a perfect deprivation of rain for twelve or fourteen months isnouncommon
                    phenomenon, even when in the mountains there are daily showers. The climate of
                    the north and south coasts of this island, therefore, are essentially different,
                    although under the same tropical influence. The only difference of temperature
                    to be observed throughout the whole island, is between the valleys and the
                    mountains, which happens in every country similarly situated. In the mountains
                    the inhabitants enjoy the coolness of spring, whilst the valleys, were it not
                    for the daily breeze which blows generally frorft the north-east and east, would
                    be uninhabitable. In August the atmosphere is oppressively hot, the thermometer
                    being frequently above 90° of Fahrenheit; and during the coldest season it is
                    never below 70°. In September the rains descend like a deluge, and the rivers
                    swell and overflow their banks, completely inundating the low lands, whilst the
                    smallest brooks become deep and rapid torrents. In October the weather becomes
                    cooler, and in the following month the north and north-east winds generally set
                    in, diffusing an agreeable coolness through the atmosphere. When the fury of the
                    north wind abates, the most delightful weather is experienced. Hurricanes, the
                    scourge of the West Indies, sometimes visit this island, generally between the
                    months of July and October. In the year 1825, one occurred on the 27th of July,
                    which nearly laid it desolate. Notwithstanding the general heat of the climate,
                    and the humidity of some parts of Porto Rico it is reckoned healthy. The number
                    of mountains and running streams, the absence of stagnant water, and the general
                    cultivation of the land, no doubt powerfully contribute to purify the atmosphere
                    and render it salubrious to man. This island exhibits a singular scarcity of
                    indigenous animals. There are no venomous snakes or reptiles, no beast of prey,
                    or indigenous quadrupeds of any kind to be found in the forests, scarcely any of
                    the feathered tribes, and no noxious insects. But rats of an enormous size and
                    in great numbers infest the country, and sometimes commit dreadful ravages upon
                    the sugar canes.</p>
                <p>The principal wealth of Porto Ricoconsists in agriculture. No manufactories are
                    carried on, and no mines of gold and silver have been explored, if such exist.
                    The soil is of the richest description, and a prolific and luxuriant vegetation
                    covers every part of the island. The agriculturist is not limited by the nature
                    of the soil to the exclusive cultivation of any particular produce. Every
                    species of fruit and vegetables, congenial to tropical climates, may be planted
                    with the certainty of reaping an abundant .harvest. Ι he best and most luxuriant
                    pasture for rearing cattle; the rich, deep, vegetable mould necessary for the
                    sugar cane; the hnnful soil in which the cocoa vegetates; and the cool mountain
                    glades, so congenial to the coffee plant, may all be found within a small
                    circle. Cotton, tobacco, and indigo, the latter being a spontaneous product of
                    the fields, only require a little attention to render them objects of
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The whole agricultural riches of the island, houses, lands, and slaves, not
                    included, were valued in 1832 at 37,993,599 dollars, and the produce at
                    6,883,371 dollars; of which there were exported through the custom houses to the
                    value of 3,411,845½ dollars. The contributions levied on this property amounted
                    only to 266,526 dollars, which is less than 3½ per cent, on the value of
                    property, and less than 5⅛ per cent, on the value of produce. We have no doubt
                    that the value of property and produce is much greater than what has just been
                    stated; for as the people of the country themselves make the valuation, they
                    always endeavour to make it appear as small as possible, in consequence of the
                    direct tax levied on property.</p>
                <p>Colonel Flin ter thinks that there cannot be fewer than two hundred thousand
                    horned cattle on the island, the other animals being proportionally more
                    numerous than they appear to be from the statement given; and he thinks that the
                    total value of the cattle maybe estimated at 7,858,774 dollars. A great traffic
                    has long been carried on in them, with the English, French, and other
                    settlements. They bring a higher price than those of South America, in
                    consequence of being fattened from the finest pasture land in the world, and
                    from their extreme tameness. Vast quantities of raw and tanned hides are
                    likewise exported. The production of sugar is the next great branch of industry.
                    That the soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cultivation of the cane
                    will be seen from the following fact. The proportion of sugar produced from the
                    land employed in its cultivation, is in Jamaica and Dominica, ten quintals per
                    acre; in Grenada, fifteen quintals per acre; in St. Christopher’s and Tobago,
                    twenty quintals per acre, and in St. Vincent’s, twenty-five quintals per acre;
                    whilst in Porto Ricoit is estimated at thirty quintals per acre.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the great natural resources of this island, there are imported,
                    besides manufactured goods, considerable quantities of provisions and other
                    articles, of which, by attention, Porto Ricomight be made itself to yield
                    sufficient supplies. However, an examination of the exports and imports shows,
                    that of late years, the produce of the land exported, considerably exceeds the
                    value of goods and provisions imported.</p>

                <p>In 1830, there entered about 60,000 tons of shipping, of which one-half belonged
                    to America, one-fourth to Spain, and the remaining fourth chiefly to England,
                    France, and Denmark. The importations from America, which in value amount to
                    one-third of the whole, consist of salt fish, flour, butter, lard, grain,
                    lumber, boards, staves, and articles of furniture. The mother country exports
                    her olives and brandies, her wines and dried fruits, oils of olive and almond,
                    carpets for kneeling on, and other manufactures, alpute, anchovies, and so
                    forth. England imports cotton goods, Irish linen, hardware, earthen-ware, and
                    the like; and France imports linens, cambrics, ladies’ dresses and ornaments,
                    toys and jewellery. Foreign goods pay seventeen per cent, of importation duties,
                    <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and an export duty of
                    six per cent, is levied on all goods sent from the island, with the exception of
                    timber and live stock, which are charged much higher. Spanish vessels from the
                    peninsula pay six per cent, of importation duty, and the export tax is also much
                    less than it is for foreign vessels. It is scarcely necessary to say, that the
                    exports from Porto Rico consist of live stock, sugar, coffee, tobacco, and the
                    other rich productions of the island. Colonel<pb break="no" facs="nls:193538316"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8316-0457"/> Flinter states his conviction that the value of
                    the exportations and importations exceeds the amount which appears in the
                    custom-house returns; for goods are undervalued in general, and a considerable
                    contraband trade is carried on. The nett revenue of the island in 1832amount- ed
                    to 798,404 Spanish dollars (each equal to 4s.3^d sterling), and the expense of
                    maintaining the civil and military establishments, amounted to 630,300 dollars;
                    thus leaving a balance in the treasury, of 168,104 dollars. The taxes, although
                    levied in an obnoxious manner, being for the most part direct, arc comparatively
                    light. In 1832, the direct taxes produced 207,141; the custom-house duties,
                    493,930; and the indirect taxes, 97,333 dollars. The government, laws, and
                    institutions of this island, are nearly similar to those formerly established by
                    the kings of Spain in every part of the western hemisphere. There is a regular
                    military force stationed on the island, and likewise a strong disposable body of
                    well-disciplined militia.</p>
                <p>Porto Ricocontains fifty-eight towns and villages, thus giving nearly one to
                    every six square leagues. The largest place is San Juan, the capital. It is
                    finely situated on the slope of a hill, on the north coast of the island. The
                    streets, which run parallel and cross each other at right angles, are perfectly
                    straight, and run down to the side of the bay. It is enclosed on every part by
                    strong fortifications, which render the town almost impregnable. It is
                    considered as one of the best and healthiest towns in the West Indies. It is
                    adorned by a number of useful public edifices and institutions. Amongst these
                    may be mentioned, the cathedral, a large mass of building, which has never been
                    finished; four churches, two chapels, three convents, an episcopal palace, and a
                    seminary for the education of the clergy; the royal military hospital, a large
                    síone edifice, and an establishment of the same kind for females; the government
                    house, called the fortress of Santa Catalina, which has stood for upwards of two
                    hundred years; the royal goal, a large stone edifice; a house of correction; a
                    large and handsome town-house; a beautiful theatre, built at the public expense;
                    a custom-house; an arsenal, and some others. A society, called the Economical
                    Society, is established for promoting the fine arts. There is also a
                    mathematical class; whilst two schools for boys, and one for girls, are paid for
                    by the municipality. There is an excellent and secure harbour, and a commodious
                    wharf. This town is the residence of the governor, and the Catholic bishop, and
                    here all the principal courts are held. San Juan was founded in the year 1514.
                    Within a century afterwards it was twice taken and plundered by the English,
                    who, however, could gain no permanent footing on the island, neither at these
                    times nor at a later period under General Abercromby. The population is
                    estimated at 30,000.</p>
                <p>Some of the provincial towns may be considered as large with reference to the
                    extent of the island; such as Mayagues and Aguadilla on the west coast, Pouce on
                    the south, Pepino and Cayey in the interior, and Humacao on the eastern coast.
                    The other towns and villages, with few exceptions, are merely skeletons,
                    containing a large square, with the church, the houses of the curate and
                    magistrate, the militia quarters, and a few residences of wealthy people. There
                    are fifteen ports in which custom-houses and recep-tories have been established.
                    By far the greater number of the inhabitants are scattered over the island in
                    agricultural establishments. The total number will be seen from the following

                <p>This shews an extraordinary rate of increase; and allowing that the population
                    has augmented in the same ratio since the last census was taken, we may safely
                    estimate the number of inhabitants of this island in 1839 at about four hundred
                    thousand souls. The island of Bieques, situated three leagues from the
                    north-east coast of Porto Rico is under the command of the captain-general of
                    the latter. It is ten leagues in length, by two in breadth, and reckoned one of
                    the most fertile spots in the West Indies. It has several commodious ports and
                    harbours, and from its position to the windward might be made of considerable
                    importance to Porto Rico if properly settled, which it is not.</p>
                <p>Porto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and was supposed at
                    the time to contain 660,000 inhabitants. Having learned that the Spaniards had
                    made themselves masters of Española, these savages looked upon the invaders as
                    invincible and immortal. But to put the matter to the test, they tried an
                    experiment on one of the domestics of Columbus, and finding that he was mortal,
                    they rose upon the Spaniards, and made a great slaughter of them, whilst
                    employed in plundering the treasures of the natives. The Spaniards seldom
                    required so good a pretext for retaliation, and they accordingly rose upon the
                    inhabitants, and effected their total extermination. Since then it has been
                    gradually settled by Spaniards; and from the census given above, it will be seen
                    that it promises at no distant date to be as thickly peopled as it was when
                    first visited by the prince of navigators. <hi rend="smallcaps">r r.r.</hi></p>
