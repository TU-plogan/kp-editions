                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia,</hi> formerly a duehy, but now a powerful and
                    extensive kingdom of the second rank, was formed on the ancient electoral
                    possessions as a nucleus, by means of successive territorial acquisitions,
                    particularly in Poland, in Westphalia, and on the Rhine. The name is supposed by
                    some to have been derived from that of the <hi rend="italic">Borussi,</hi> a
                    Sarmatian or Slavonie tribe, who, having migrated from the foot of the Riphaean
                    Mountains, were tempted to settle in the district which is called Prussia
                    proper. But others are of opinion that the country derived its name from its
                    vicinity to the vast territory of Russia, and was for this reason called <hi
                    rend="italic">Porussia; po</hi> in the Slavonie language signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">near</hi> or <hi rend="italic">adjacent,</hi> and consequently
                    Porussia, shortened into Prussia, meaning near or adjacent to Russia. Nor is
                    this derivation of the name entirely fanciful or hypothetical. Several others
                    have been formed on the same principle. For instance, the river Elbe in Slavonic
                    was termed Labe, and, by a similar combination, the tribes who inhabited its
                    banks were called Po Labae or <hi rend="italic">Polabae.</hi> The reader,
                    however, must judge for himself which of these conjectures is the more probable.
                    To the latter Frederick the Great has given the sanction of his authority in the
                    treatise entitled Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg.</p>
                <p>The original inhabitants of Prussia were the Slavi or Sarmatae, in the east and
                    north-east; the Vandals on the shores of the Baltie, to the north of Pomerania;
                    and the Suevi in the remainder of the kingdom. These people, particularly the
                    first, are represented as having been extremely savage and barbarous; living
                    upon raw flesh, and drinking, even to intoxication, the blood of horses at their
                    feasts. They seem to have been unacquainted with the method of constructing
                    huts, and to have lived in eaves or under the shelter of rocks and trees, where
                    they protected themselves and their children from the inclemencies of the
                    weather. Sueh rude tribes cannot be expected to furnish materials for history;
                    and hence little is known respecting them until the thirteenth century, when the
                    Teutonic knights first obtained a footing in the country.</p>
                <p>This celebrated fraternity is more or less known to every reader. After the death
                    of Barbarossa, the Germans behaved with so much bravery in the Holy Land, that
                    the king of Jerusalem, the patriarch, and other princes, rewarded their valour
                    by conferring upon their order certain privileges. The body in question was thus
                    instituted under the most favourable auspices. The members were originally
                    called Knights of St George; but they were afterwards denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Equites</hi><hi rend="italic">Mariani,</hi> or Knights of St Mary.
                    In the year 1190, they elected Henry Walpol, a German, who had distinguished
                    himself for conduct and bravery, as their first grand-master; and in the
                    subsequent year Pope Celestine III. confirmed to them the privileges which they
                    already enjoyed, and conferred on them the title of Knights of the Teutonic
                    Order, an appellation by which they afterwards became so famous. On the
                    expulsion of the Christians from the Holy Land by Saladdin, a settlement was
                    given to these knights in Prussia by Conrad duke of Mazovia, the competitor of
                    Boleslas V. for the crown of Poland. Their original residence in the former
                    country was Culm, to which territory they were confined by the conditions of the
                    grant, excepting what they might conquer from their pagan neighbours, all which
                    the emperor granted to them in perpetuity. Encouraged by this grant, the knights
                    conquered the greater part of the country now called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prussia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, not content with this, they became so
                    troublesome to Poland, that the monarchs of that kingdom were sometimes obliged
                    to carry on dangerous and bloody wars with the order. (See the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Poland.)</hi></p>
                <p>The Teutonic order continued in Prussia until the year 1531. Their last
                    grand-master was Albert marquis of Brandenburg, and nephew of Sigismund I. king
                    of Poland. He was preferred to this dignity in hopes that his affinity to
                    Sigismund might procure a restitution of some of the places which had been taken
                    from the order during the previous unsuccessful wars with Poland; but in this
                    the fraternity were disappointed. Albert, however, was so far from endeavouring
                    to obtain any favour from his uncle by pacific means, that he refused to do
                    homage to him, and immediately began to make preparations for throwing off his
                    dependence, and recovering by force of arms the whole of Prussia and Pomerania.
                    But he was so far from succeeding in his design, that, foiled in every attempt,
                    he was forced to resign the dignity of grand-master; and in recompense for
                    divesting himself of this office, his uncle bestowed on him part of Prussia in
                    quality of secular duke. It was now the interest of the house of Brandenburg to
                    assist in the expulsion of the fraternity; and accordingly, the knights, being
                    at last driven out of Prussia and Pomerania, transferred their chapter to
                    Mariendal in Franconia; but in that and in other provinces of the empire where
                    they settled, little more than the name of the order now remains.</p>
                <p>The electorate of Brandenburg, like other parts of Germany, was anciently
                    possessed by barbarians, of whom no accurate account can be given. They were
                    subdued by Charlemagne, as has been related in the history of France (see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> part first); but being on every
                    occasion ready to revolt, Henry the Fowler, in 927, established margraves, or
                    governors of the frontiers, in order to keep the barbarians in awe. The first
                    margrave of Brandenburg was Sigefroy, brother-in-law of the emperor, under whose
                    administration the bishopries of Brandenburg and Havelberg were established by
                    Otho I. From the time of this Sigefroy, till the succession of the house of
                    Hohenzollern, from whom the present family derive their descent, there are
                    reckoned eight different families who have been margraves of Brandenburg;
                    namely, the family of the Saxons, of Walbeck, Staden, Plenek, Anhalt, Bavaria,
                    Luxemburg, and Misnia. The margraves of the first four races carried on
                    continual wars with the Vandals and other barbarous tribes; nor could their
                    ravages be stopped till the reign of Albert surnamed the Bear, the first prince
                    of the house of Anhalt, who was appointed margrave by the Emperor Conrad IIL,
                    and afterwards raised to the dignity of elector by Frederick Barbarossa, about
                    the year 1100. Some years afterwards, the king of the Vandals having died
                    without issue, left the Middle March by his last will to the elector, who was
                    besides possessed of the Old March, Upper Saxony, the country of Anhalt, and
                    part of Lusatia. In the year 1332 this line became extinct, and the electorate
                    devolved to the empire. It was then given by the Emperor Louis of Bavaria to his
                    son Louis, who was the first of the sixth race. Louis the Roman succeeded his
                    brother; and as he also died without children, he was succeeded by Otho, his
                    third brother, who sold the electorate to the Emperor Charles IV. of the house
                    of Luxemburg, for two hundred thousand florins of gold. Charles IV. gave the
                    March to his son Wineeslas, who was succeeded by Sigismund; and this elector,
                    being embarrassed in his circumstances, sold the New March to the knights of the
                    Teutonic order. Josse succeeded Sigismund; but aspiring to the empire, he sold
                    the electorate to William duke of Misnia, who, after possessing it for one <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193541098" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1098-0671"/> year, sold it
                    again to the Emperor Sigismund. In 1417, Frederick VI. burgrave of Nuremberg,
                    received at the Diet of Constance the investiture of the country of Brandenburg
                    from the hands of the Emperor Sigismund, who, two years previously, had
                    conferred upon Frederick the dignity of elector, and arch-chamberlain of the
                    Holy Roman empire.</p>
                <p>This prince, the first of the family of Hohenzollern, one of the oldest in
                    Europe, found himself possessed of the Old and the Middle March; but the dukes
                    of Pomerania had usurped the March of the Ukraine. The elector therefore
                    declared war against them, and soon recovered the province. But as the New March
                    still remained in the hands of the Teutonic knights, to whom it had been sold,
                    as already mentioned, the elector, to compensate for this, took possession of
                    Saxony, which at that time happened to be vacant by the death of Albert, the
                    last elector of the Anhalt line. The emperor, however, disapproving of this
                    step, gave the investiture of Saxony to the Duke of Misnia, upon which Frederick
                    voluntarily desisted from his acquisitions. This elector made a division of his
                    possessions by will. To his eldest son, who had too closely applied himself to
                    the search of the philosopher’s stone, he left only Voightland. The electorate
                    was given to his second son Frederick; Albert, surnamed Achilles, received the
                    duchies of Franconia; and Frederick, surnamed the Fat, had the Old March, which,
                    by his death, returned to the electorate of Brandenburg.</p>
                <p>Frederick I. was succeeded by his son, called also Frederick, and surnamed
                    Irontooth on account of his strength. He might with as much reason have been
                    surnamed the Magnanimous, since he refused two crowns, that of Bohemia, which
                    was offered him by the pope, and the kingdom of Poland, to which he was invited
                    by the people; but Frederick declared he would not accept of the latter unless
                    Casimir, brother of Ladislas, the late king, should refuse it. These instances
                    of magnanimity had such an effect on the neighbouring people, that the states of
                    Lower Lusatia made him a voluntary surrender of their country. But as Lusatia
                    was a fief of Bohemia, the king of that country immediately made war on the
                    elector, in order to recover it. In this, however, he was so far from being
                    successful, that, by a treaty of peace concluded in 1462, he was obliged to
                    surrender to the elector the perpetual sovereignty of Corbus, Peits, Sommerfeld,
                    and some other places. Frederick having redeemed the New March from the Teutonic
                    order for the sum of a hundred thousand florins, and having still further
                    enlarged his dominions, resigned the sovereignty to his brother Albert, in the
                    year 1469.</p>
                <p>Albert was fifty-seven years old when his brother resigned to him the electorate.
                    Most of his exploits had been performed whilst he was burgrave of Nuremberg.
                    Having declared war against Louis duke of Bavaria, he defeated that prince and
                    took him prisoner. He also gained eight battles against the Nurembergers, who
                    had rebelled and contested his rights to the burgraviate. In one of these he
                    fought singly against sixteen men, until his people came up to his assistance.
                    He made himself master of the town of Greiffenburg in the same manner as
                    Alexander the Great took the capital of the Oxydracae, by leaping from the top
                    of the walls into the town, where he defended himself singly against the
                    inhabitants until his men forced the gates and rescued him. The confidence which
                    the Emperor Frederick III. placed in him, gained him the direction of almost the
                    whole empire. He commanded the imperial armies against Louis the Rich, duke of
                    Bavaria; and also against Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, who had laid siege
                    to Nuis, but concluded a peace at the interposition of Albert. He gained the
                    prize at seventeen tournaments, and was never dismounted. All these exploits,
                    however, had been performed before Albert obtained the electorate.</p>
                <p>From that time we meet with no very important transactions until the year 1594,
                    when John Sigismund of Brandenburg, having married Anne, the only daughter of
                    Albert duke of Prussia, that duchy was united to the electorate, of which it has
                    ever since formed part; and he also obtained pretensions to the countries of
                    Juliers, Berg, Cleves, Marek, Ravensburg, and Ravenstein, of which Anne was the
                    heiress.</p>
                <p>Sigismund died in the year 1619, and was succeeded by his son George William,
                    during whose government the electorate suffered great calamities. At this time
                    commenced the war between the Protestants and Catholics, which, from the period
                    of its endurance, has been denominated the Thirty Years’ War. The former,
                    although leagued together, were on the point of being utterly destroyed by the
                    imperialists under the command of Tilly and Wallenstein, when Gustavus Adolphus
                    of Sweden turned the scale in their favour, and threatened the Catholic party
                    with total destruction. But by the death of the king on the field of battle at
                    Lutzen, the fortune of war was once more changed. At last, however, peace was
                    concluded with the emperor; and, in 1640, the elector died, leaving his
                    dominions to his son Frederick William.</p>
                <p>This young prince, though only twenty years of age at the time of his accession,
                    applied himself with the utmost diligence to repair the losses occasioned by the
                    wars which had preceded. He received the investiture of Prussia personally from
                    the king of Poland, on condition of paying a hundred thousand florins annually,
                    and not making peace with the enemies of that country. His envoy likewise
                    received the investiture of the electorate from the Emperor Ferdinand III. The
                    elector then thought of recovering his provinces from those who had usurped
                    them. He concluded a truce of twenty years with the Swedes, who evacuated the
                    greater part of his states. He likewise paid a hundred and forty thousand crowns
                    to the Swedish garrisons, which still possessed some of his towns; he concluded
                    a treaty with the Hessians, who delivered up a part of the duchy of Cleves; and
                    he obtained of the Hollanders the evacuation of several other cities.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the powers of Europe began to be sickened of a war which had
                    continued for such a length of time with unrelenting fury. The cities of
                    Osnaburg and Munster being chosen as the most proper places for negotiation, the
                    conferences were opened in the year 1645; but, by reason of the multiplicity of
                    business, they were not concluded till two years afterwards. France, which had
                    espoused the interests of Sweden, demanded that Pomerania should be ceded to the
                    latter, as an indemnification for the expenses which the war had cost Gustavus
                    Adolphus and his successors. Although the empire and the elector refused to give
                    up Pomerania, it was at last agreed to cede to the Swedes Hither Pomerania, the
                    isles of Rugen and Wollin, and also some cities; in return for which, the
                    bishoprics of Halberstadt, Minden, and Karnin were secularized in favour of the
                    elector, and he was put in possession of them, together with the lordships of
                    Hochenstein and Richenstein, and the reversion of the archbishopric of
                    Magdeburg. Thus was concluded, in 1648, the treaty of Westphalia, which serves
                    as a basis to all the possessions and rights of the German princes. The elector
                    then concluded a treaty with the Swedes for the regulation of limits, and for
                    the acquittal of certain debts; and next year the electorate, Pomerania, and the
                    duchies of Cleves, were evacuated by the Swedes.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these treaties, however, the Swedes soon afterwards invaded
                    Pomerania, but were entirely defeated by the elector near the town of
                    Fehrbellin. Three thousand were left dead on the field, amongst whom were a
                    number of officers; and a great many were made prisoners. The elector
                    immediately pursued his victory, and, gaining many advantages over the Swedes,
                    deprived them of the cities of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541111"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1111-0672"/>Stralsund and Greiphswald. The Swedes, however,
                    hoping to oblige the elector to evacuate Pomerania, which he had almost totally
                    subdued, invaded Prussia at the head of sixteen thousand men, who advanced from
                    Livonia, and entering the country, burned the suburbs of Memel, and took the
                    cities of Tilse and Insterburg. The elector, to oppose the invaders, left Berlin
                    on the 10th of January 1679, at the head of about nine thousand men. The Swedes
                    retired at his approach, and were much harassed by the troops on their march,
                    losing almost one half their army. At last, having crossed the bay of
                    Frisch-Haff and Courland on the ice, the elector, on the 19th of January,
                    arrived with his infantry within three miles of Tilse, where the Swedes had
                    established their head-quarters. The same day, General Trefenfeldt defeated two
                    regiments of the enemy near Splitter; and the Swedes who were in Tilse having
                    abandoned the place, retired towards Courland. They were pursued by General
                    Gortz, and entirely defeated with great slaughter, so that scarcely three
                    thousand of them returned to Livonia. Yet, notwithstanding these victories, the
                    elector, being pressed on the other side by Turenne and the Prince of Condé, was
                    obliged to make peace with the Swedes. The conditions were, that the treaty of
                    Westphalia should serve as the basis of the peace; and that the elector should
                    have the property of the customs in all the ports of Further Pomerania, with the
                    cities of Kamin, Gartz, Greiffenburg, and Wildenbruck; whilst, on his part, he
                    consented to give up to the Swedes all that he had conquered from them, and to
                    afford no assistance to the king of Denmark, upon condition that France should
                    deliver up to him his provinces in Westphalia, and pay him three hundred
                    thousand ducats as an indemnification for the damages done by the French to his
                    states. This treaty was styled the peace of St Germains.</p>
                <p>With the treaty of St Germains terminated the military exploits of Frederick
                    William, who passed the last years of his administration in tranquillity. Few
                    sovereigns ever attained greater celebrity, or enjoyed more fully the affections
                    of his subjects and the respect of foreign countries. An embassy was sent him by
                    Murad Geray, the khan of the Tartars, soliciting his friendship; and he received
                    other marks of the estimation in which he was held. In 1684, he admitted into
                    his dominions great numbers of Protestants who had fled from France after the
                    revocation of the edict of Nantes by Louis XIV.; twenty thousand of whom are
                    said to have settled in the electorate, where they introduced those arts and
                    manufactures which proved of the utmost benefit to the country. Before his time,
                    Prussia was held as a fief of Poland; but in 1656 he compelled the Polish
                    monarch to declare it an independent state. Puffendorf thought the life of this
                    prince a subject not unworthy of his pen; and Frederick the Great regards
                    him<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Memoirs of the
                    House of Brandenburg.</p></note> as the principal founder of the power and
                    influence of the house of Brandenburg.</p>
                <p>In 1688, the elector Frederick William died, and was succeeded by his son
                    Frederick III. This prince was remarkably f&lt;and of show and ceremony, which,
                    during the course of k⅛ government, involved him in great expense. The
                    attai/upent of the regal dignity seemed to be the great object of his ambition.
                    To accomplish this object, he joined with the emperor in the alliance against
                    France, in which he was engaged by William III. king of Britain. He also yielded
                    up the circle of Schwibus, which had been given to his predecessor; and, in
                    1700, he obtained from the emperor the royal dignity which he had so earnestly
                    desired. The terms on which it was obtained were, that Frederick should never
                    separate from the empire those provinces of his dominions which'depended on it;
                    that he should not, in the emperor’s presence, demand any other marks of honour
                    than those which he had hitherto enjoyed; that the ministers which he sent to
                    Vienna should be treated like those of other crowned heads; that the elector
                    should maintain at his own expense six thousand men in Italy, in ease the
                    emperor should be obliged to make war by reason of the succession of the house
                    of Bourbon to the crown of Spain; and that the troops in question should
                    continue there whilst the war lasted. »</p>
                <p>Such w ere the principal terms upon which Prussia was erected into a kingdom,
                    through the friendship of the emperor, with whom Frederick I. (so called as
                    being the first king of Prussia), continued all his life in strict alliance. He
                    was a pacific and patriotic prince; and having always preserved his dominions in
                    peace, consulted more effectually the true interest, of his subjects than those
                    monarchs who have dazzled the world by the splendour of their military
                    exploits.</p>
                <p>Frederick I. died in the beginning of 1713, and was succeeded by his son
                    Frederick William, sometimes called Frederick II. He was in almost everything
                    the reverse of his father. His dispositions being altogether martial, he applied
                    himself entirely to the augmentation of his army, and perfecting them in their
                    exercises, by which means they became the most expert soldiers in Europe. His
                    foible was an ambition of having his army composed of men above the ordinary
                    size; but as these could not be procured, he composed a regiment of the tallest
                    men he could find; and as his officers made no scruple of picking up such men
                    wherever they could find them for his majesty’s use, the neighbouring states
                    were frequently offended, and a war was often likely to ensue from this
                    ridiculous cause. However, his Prussian majesty never engaged in any martial
                    enterprise of consequence; but having placed liis army on the most respectable
                    footing of any in the world, and filled his coffers with cash, for he was of a
                    very saving disposition, he put it in the power of his son to perform those
                    exploits which proved matter of astonishment to all Europe.</p>
                <p>In this king’s reign Prussia first perceived that her natural enemy and rival was
                    the house of Austria, and not France, as had been formerly supposed. Hence
                    frequent disputes took place between these two powers, for which the persecution
                    of the Protestants by some of the Catholic states of the empire afforded a
                    pretence; and although a war never actually took place, yet it was easy to
                    perceive that bpth were at heart mortal enemies. But when Frederick William died
                    in 1740, this enmity broke out in full force.</p>
                <p>This king was succeeded by his son Frederick III., commonly styled Frederick the
                    Great, who ascended the throne in 1740. He was born on the 24th of January 1712,
                    and in his infancy intrusted to the care of Madame de Rocoule, who spoke no
                    language but French, and thus probably inspired him at once with a taste for
                    that language and a dislike of the German. As he advanced in years, he was put
                    under more accomplished tutors; but as his father’s object was to inspire him
                    with a love of military glory, and to teach him the art of war in all its
                    departments, he at first made little progress in science and literature; and, in
                    fact, his erudition was at the best but limited. The branches in which he
                    excelled were the belles lettres and ethics. He was also an adept in music, of
                    which he was passionately fond. But his father not reckoning such an
                    accomplishment compatible with the profession of a soldier, forbade him to
                    cultivate it; and his disobedience of the paternal restriction was the cause of
                    the misunderstanding which existed between him and his father till the death of
                    the latter. Finding himselr disgraced at court, he retired to the castle of
                    Rheinsberg, where he devoted his time to study, and to the society and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193541124" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1124-0673"/> conversation of
                    learned men of different countries. When he ascended the throne in 1740,..he was
                    welcomed by the unanimous acclamations of his subjects, who entertained sanguine
                    hopes of his future greatness and celebrity. In accordance with the uniform
                    policy of his family, the early and great object of his life was to increase his
                    dominions; and the first step he took in the accomplishment of this object was
                    the invasion of Silesia upon the death of the emperor of Germany. The
                    empress-queen was placed in a very disagreeable situation by the demise of her
                    father; and of this Frederick took the advantage to do himself justice, as he
                    said, with regard to Silesia, of which his ancestors had been unjustly deprived.
                    The province in question he accordingly seized; but it cost him dear; for the
                    empress, having at last overcome all difficulties, formed against him the most
                    powerful combination that was ever known in Europe.</p>
                <p>The treaty by which the empress reluctantly yielded up to the king of Prussia the
                    province of Silesia, and with it a clear revenue of L.800,000 a year, had
                    scarcely been concluded, when she entered into another with the court of St
                    Petersburg, which was concluded on the 22d of May 1746. This treaty, as far as
                    it was made public, was merely of a defensive nature; but six secret and
                    separate articles were added to it. By one of these it was pro∖ ided, that in
                    case his Prussian majesty should attack the ∈ mpress-queen, or the empress of
                    Russia, or even the republic of Poland, it should be considered as a breach of
                    the treaty of Dresden, by which Silesia had been given up. It was also
                    stipulated, that notwithstanding that treaty, which, in fact, had been dictated
                    by the king of Prussia himself, the right of the empress-queen to Silesia still
                    continued, and for the recovery of that province the contracting powers engaged
                    mutually to furnish an army of sixty thousand men. To this treaty, called the
                    treaty of St Petersburg, the king of Poland was invited to accede; but being in
                    a manner in the power of the king of Prussia, he did not think proper to sign
                    it. However, he verbally acceded to it, so as to convince the other parties of
                    his design to co-operate in all their measures; and in consideration of such
                    intention, it was agreed that he should have a share in the partition of the
                    king of Prussia’s dominions, in the event of the successful issue of their
                    enterprises.</p>
                <p>In consequence of these machinations, every art was used to render the king of
                    Prussia personally odious to the empress of Russia; the empress-queen made vast
                    preparations in Bohemia and Moravia; and the king of Poland, under pretence of a
                    military amusement, drew together sixteen thousand men, with whom he occupied a
                    strong post at Pirna. The empress-queen, still further to strengthen herself,
                    concluded a treaty with the court of France, dated at Versailles on the 1st of
                    May 1756. In the mean time the king of Prussia, understanding from his
                    emissaries what was going forward, resolved to be beforehand with his enemies;
                    and, to keep the war out of his own country, he entered Saxony with a
                    considerable army. At first he affected only to demand a free passage for his
                    troops, and an observance of the neutrality professed by the king of Poland; but
                    having good reasons to doubt this neutrality, he demanded, as a preliminary,
                    that the Saxon troops should immediately abandon the strong post they occupied,
                    and disperse themselves. This demand being refused, Frederick blockaded the
                    Saxon camp at Pirna, resolving to reduce it by famine, since its strong
                    situation rendered an attack dangerous. At that time there were in Bohemia two
                    Saxon armies; one under the command of Marshal Brown, and the other under that
                    of General Picoomini. To keep these in awe, the king had sent Marshal Schwerin
                    with an army into Bohemia, and Marshal Keith penetrated into the same kingdom on
                    the side of Misnia. But still the king of Prussia did not entirely confide in
                    these dispositions; and therefore fearing lest Brown might afford some
                    assistance to the Saxons, he joined his forces under Keith, and on the 1st of
                    December 1756 attacked and defeated the Austrian general at Lowositz. The latter
                    thus found it impossible to relieve the Saxons, and, after a vain attempt to
                    retire from their post, they were all taken prisoners. The king of Poland
                    quitted his dominions in Germany, and the Prussians took up their
                    winter-quarters in Saxony. Here they seized upon the revenues, levied
                    contributions, and obliged the country to supply them with recruits. At the same
                    time the king of Prussia made himself master of the archives of Dresden, by
                    which means he procured the originals of those documents which, when produced to
                    the world, showed the combination that had been formed against him, and
                    consequently justified the measures he had taken in his own defence.</p>
                <p>No sooner had the king entered Saxony in the manner already related, than a
                    process was commenced against him in the Aulic Council, and before the Diet of
                    the Empire, where he was soon condemned for contumacy, and put to the ban of the
                    empire. The various circles were then ordered to furnish their respective
                    contingents of men and money to put this sentence in execution; but these came
                    in so slowly, that, had it not been for the assistance of the French under the
                    Prince de Soubisc, the army would probably have never been in a condition to
                    act. The Austrians, in the mean time, made great preparations, and raised a
                    hundred‘thousand men in Bohemia, whom they placed under the command of Prince
                    Charles of Lorraine, assisted by Marshal Brown. The Czarina sent a body of sixty
                    thousand men under Apraxin to invade ducal Prussia, whilst a strong fleet was
                    equipped in the Baltic to cooperate with that army. The king of Sweden also
                    acceded to the confederacy, in hopes of recovering those possessions which his
                    ancestors had enjoyed in Pomerania; and the Duke of Mecklenburg followed the
                    same course, promising to join the Swedish army with six thousand men as soon as
                    it should be necessary. On the side of the king of Prussia appeared nobody
                    excepting an army of between thirty and forty thousand Hanoverians commanded by
                    the Duke of Cumberland; and these were outnumbered and forced to yield to a
                    superior army of French commanded by D’Etrées.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his Prussian majesty, finding that he must depend for
                    assistance solely upon his own abilities, resolved to make the best use of his
                    time. Aςcordingly, in the spring of 1757, his armies poured into Bohemia from
                    two different points, whilst the king himself prepared to enter it by a third.
                    Marshal Schwerin entered from Silesia, and the Prince of Bevern from Lusatia,
                    where he defeated an army of twenty-eight thousand Austrians who opposed his
                    passage. As the intentions of the king himself were not known, the Austrians
                    detached a body of twenty thousand men from their principal army to observe his
                    motions. This was no sooner done than the king cut off all communication between
                    the detachment and the main body; and having joined his two generals with
                    incredible celerity, he engaged the Austrians near Prague, totally defeated
                    them, and took their camp, military chest, and cannon; but he lost the brave
                    Marshal Schwerin, who was killed at the age of eighty-two, with a colonel’s
                    standard in his hand. On the Austrian side Marshal Brown was wounded, and died
                    in a short time, though it is supposed more from the chagrin he suffered than
                    from the dangerous nature of the wound itself.</p>
                <p>About forty thousand of the Austrian army took refuge in Prague, whilst the rest
                    fled in different directions. The city was instantly invested by the king, and
                    all succours were cut off. The great number of troops which it contained made an
                    attack unadvisable, but seemed to render inevitable its reduction by famine;
                    however, the king, ío accomplish his purpose the more speedily, prepared to
                    bombard the town. On the 29th of May, after a most dreadful<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193541137" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1137-0674"/> storm of thunder and
                    lightning, four batteries began to play upon the city. From these were thrown
                    every twenty-four hours, 288 bombs, besides a vast number of red-hot balls, so
                    that it was soon on firc in almost every quarter. The garrison made a vigorous
                    defence, and one well-conducted sally, which, however, was repulsed with great
                    loss. The magistrates, burghers, and clergy, seeing their city on the point of
                    being reduced to an heap of rubbish, earnestly supplicated the commander to
                    capitulate; but he was deaf to their entreaties, and drove twelve thousand of
                    the most useless mouths out of the town, who were quickly driven in again by the
                    Prussians.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the empress-queen seemed thus to be verging to destruction, when
                    Leopold count Daun took upon him the command of the army. This general, having
                    arrived within a few miles of Prague on the day after the great battle there,
                    immediately collected the scattered fugitives with the greatest diligence, and
                    retired with them to a strong post in the neighbourhood, whence he gave the
                    troops in Prague hopes of speedy relief. It was now the king of Prussia’s
                    business, either to attempt making himself master of the city by one desperate
                    effort, or entirely to abandon the enterprise, and drive Daun from his position
                    before his troops had recovered from the terror of their late defeat. But, by
                    attempting to do both, he rendered himself incapable of doing either. Though the
                    army of Daun already amounted to sixty thousand men, and though they were
                    strongly in trenched, and defended by a vast train of artillery, his majesty
                    thought proper to send against them no more than thirty-two thousand men. On the
                    morning of the 18th of June, the Prussians marched by the left along the great
                    road which leads from Prague to Kollin, intending to assail the enemy’s right
                    wing as soon as the necessary dispositions had been made for the attack, and the
                    flank sufficiently developed; but various circumstances conspired to render
                    ineffectual the plan which Frederick had formed. Daun had drawn up his army in
                    order of battle upon the very ground which the Prussians intended to occupy, and
                    the flank movement of the latter, being executed too close to the enemy’s line,
                    indeed within the range of their artillery, was arrested, at the critical
                    moment, by several brigades stopping to return the enemy’s fire. This
                    effectually deranged the whole combination; and though the Prussians did all
                    that human courage and steadiness could do in the circumstances, and the king
                    himself at last charged at the head of his cavalry, they were driven from the
                    field with a loss in killed, wounded, and missing, of nearly fourteen thousand
                    men of all arms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>The immediate consequence of the battle of Kollin was, that the king found
                    himself obliged to raise the siege of Prague, and to take refuge in Saxony. The
                    Austrians harassed him as much as possible in his retreat from Bohemia; but,
                    notwithstanding their superiority, they could not make any decisive attempt
                    against him, as the frontiers of Saxony abounded with positions easily defended.
                    In the mean time the Russians, who had hitherto been very dilatory in their
                    movements, began to exert themselves, and entered Prussia under Apraxin and
                    Fermor, where they committed innumerable cruelties and excesses. A large body of
                    Austrians also entered Silesia, penetrated as far as Breslau, and then laid
                    siege to Schweidnitz; whilst another body entered Lusatia, and made themselves
                    masters of Zittau. An army of twenty-two thousand Swedes also entered Prussian
                    Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmcin, and laid the whole country
                    under contribution. The French, too, being freed from all restraint by the
                    capitulation of the Duke of Cumberland at Closter-Seven, made their way into
                    Halberstadt and the Old March of Brandenburg, first exacting contributions, and
                    then plundering the towns. The army of the empire, being reinforced by that of
                    the Prince de Soubise, at length marched to occupy Saxony, and thus left the
                    Austrians at liberty to exert the greater part of their force in the reduction
                    of Silesia.</p>
                <p>General Haddick penetrated through Lusatia, passed by 1 the Prussian armies, and
                    suddenly appeared before the gates <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of Berlin,
                    which city he laid under contribution. He retired <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>
                    on the approach of a body of Prussians; yet he still found; means to occupy such
                    a position as interrupted the king’s communications with Silesia. The
                    destruction of the king of Prussia therefore seemed to be inevitable. Every
                    exertion which he had made, though able and well conducted, had been
                    unsuccessful. His general, Lehwald, who opposed the Russians, had orders to
                    attack them at all events. He obeyed his instructions, and with thirty thousand
                    men attacked sixty thousand of the enemy strongly intrenched at a place called
                    Norkitten. The Prussians behaved with the greatest valour; but after having
                    killed five times more of the eneriry than they themselves lost, they were
                    compelled to retire, although more formidable after their defeat than the
                    Russians after their victory. The king, in the mean time, exerted himself on
                    every side, and his enemies fled everywhere before him; but whilst he pursued
                    one body, another gained upon him in an opposite direction, and the winter fast
                    approached, whilst his strength decayed, and that of his adversaries seemed to
                    increase in every quarter.</p>
                <p>The Prussian monarch, however, though beset with the greatest difficulties, did
                    not abandon himself to despair, or lose that wonderful presence of mind which so
                    eminently distinguished him in all his military enterprises. He purposely
                    delayed a decisive action until the approach of winter, when at length, upon the
                    5th of November 1757, he, after a variety of skilful movements, encountered at
                    Rosbach the united army of his enemies, commanded by the Prince of
                    Saxe-Hilburghansen and the Prince de Soubisc. The allied army amounted to fully
                    fifty thousand men, but most of the troops of the Circles were newly raised, and
                    many of them not well affected to the cause. The Prussians did not exceed
                    twenty-five thousand men; but they were superior to any troops in the world, and
                    inspired, by the presence of their king, with the most enthusiastic valour. The
                    imperialists were attacked whilst in full march, their cavalry was overthrown at
                    the first shock; and being thus prevented from forming a regular order of
                    battle, or bringing their battalions into action except in succession, they were
                    defeated with the loss of three thousand killed, eight generals, two hundred and
                    fifty officers of different ranks, and six thousand private soldiers taken
                    prisoners. Night alone prevented the total déstruction of the allied army.</p>
                <p>By this battle the king was set free from the enemy on one side; but this only
                    gave him an opportunity of renewing h⅛ efforts on another. The Austrians had
                    collected a great force, and now began to make proportional progress in Silesia.
                    After a siege of sixteen days, they had reduced the strong fortress of
                    Schweidnitz, and obliged the Prussian garrison of four thousand men to surrender
                    as prisoners of war. Hearing of the victory at Rosbach, and learning that the
                    king of Prussia was in full march to relieve Silesia, they resolved to assault
                    the Prince of Bevern in his strong camp under the walls of Breslau. The attempt
                    was made on the 22d*of November; but their attack was sustained with the
                    greatest resolution. The slaughter of the Austrians was prodigious. A great part
                    of the enemy had retired from the field of battle, and the rest were preparing
                    to follow their example, when all at once the Prussian general took the same
                    resolution. His army had suffered much in the engagement, and he became
                    apprehensive of a total defeat in case the intrenchments should in any part be
                    forced; for which reason he quitted his strong position and retired beh<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193541150" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1150-0675"/> iùd the Oder. Two
                    days afterwards, the Prince of Bevern, going to reconnoitre without an escort,
                    attended only by a groom, was taken prisoner by an advanced party of Croats, a
                    small body of whom had crossed the Oder.</p>
                <p>Upon this the town of Breslau immediately surrendered; and there, as well as at
                    Schweidnitz, the Austrians found great quantities of provisions, ammunition, and
                    money. In fact, all Silesia was on the point of falling into their hands, and
                    the Prussian affairs were fast getting into the utmost distraction, when the
                    king, by a rapid and able march, passed through Thuringia, Misnia, and Lusatia,
                    in spite of the utmost efforts of Haddick and Marshal, who were sent to oppose
                    him, and, entering Silesia upon the 2d of December, joined the Prince of
                    Bevern’s corps, which repassed the Oder to meet him. The garrison of
                    Schweidnitz, who, as we have already observed, had been made prisoners of war,
                    also joined the king’s army unexpectedly; and their presence contributed not a
                    little, notwithstanding the smallness of their number, to raise the spirits of
                    the whole army. They had submitted with the greatest reluctance; but as the
                    Austrians were conducting them to prison, they happened to receive intelligence
                    of the victory at Rosbach, upon which they immediately rose on the escort that
                    conducted them, and entirely dispersed it; and afterwards marching in such a
                    direction as they thought would most readily lead them to their king, they
                    accidentally met with his army. ’</p>
                <p>His Prussian majesty now approached Breslau; on which the Austrians, confiding in
                    their superiority (for they exceeded seventy thousand, whilst the Prussians
                    scarcely amounted to thirty-six thousand), abandoned their strong camp, which
                    the Prince of Bevern had formerly occupied, and advanced to give him battle. The
                    king did not intend by any means to disappoint them, but on his part advanced
                    with the greatest celerity. The two armies met on the 5th of December, near the
                    village of Leuthen. Marshal Daun made the best dispositions possible. The
                    position occupied by his army was a plain, with small eminences, which he
                    covered with artillery; and as the ground was also interspersed with thickets,
                    the Austrians sought to turn these likewise to their advantage. On their right
                    and left were hills, upon which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in
                    their front was intersected by many causeways; and, to render the whole more
                    impracticable, the Austrians had felled a great number of trees, and scattered
                    them in the way. At the commencement of the engagement it was found almost
                    impossible for the Prussian cavalry to act, On account of these impediments; but
                    in consequence of a judicious disposition made by the king himself, all
                    difficulties were overcome. His majesty, foreseeing that General Nadasty, who
                    was placed on the enemy’s left with a corps de reserve, designed to assail him
                    in flank, had placed four battalions immediately behind the cavalry of his right
                    wing, to support them in case of attack. No disposition could have been more·
                    fortunate. It happened just as the king had foreseen. Nadasty’s cavalry attacked
                    the Prussian right wing with great fury; but they were received with such a
                    severe fire from the four battalions above mentioned, that they were obliged to
                    retire in disorder. The king’s flank, then, well covered and supported, was
                    enabled to act with such order and vigour as repulsed the enemy. The Austrian
                    artillery was also silenced by that of the Prussians. Still the Austrians
                    continued to make a gallant resistance during the whole of the battle. After
                    having been thrown into disorder, they rallied all their forces about Leuthen,
                    which was defended on every side by intrenchments and redoubts. The
                    Prussians∙attacked them with the utmost impetuosity, and at last became masters
                    of the position; upon which the enemy fled on all sides, and a total rout
                    ensued. In this battle the Austrians lost ' six thousand men killed on the spot,
                    fifteen thousand taken prisoners, and upwards of two hundred pieces of cannon.
                    „</p>
                <p>The consequences of this victory were very great. Breslau, being immediately
                    invested, surrendered on the 29th of December, and the garrison, amounting to
                    thirteen thousand men, were made prisoners of war. The blockade of Schweidnitz
                    was likewise formed, whilst detached Prussian parties overran the whole country
                    of Silesia, and reduced every place of importance. Meanwhile the Russians,
                    having ravaged and destroyed the country in such a manner that they could not
                    subsist in it, thought proper to retire from the Prussian dominions. General
                    Lehwald being thus left at liberty to act against the Swedes, quickly drove them
                    out of Prussian Pomerania, the whole of which he recovered, and also overran
                    some part of Swedish Pomerania. The duchy of Mecklenburg being thus left quite
                    exposed, the king took ample vengeance on it, by exacting <hi rend="superscript"
                    >:</hi> severe contributions of men and money. To complete this monarch’s good
                    fortune, the French, who had retired after the battle of Rosbach√were now
                    opposed by the Hanoverians under Prince Ferdinand, who kept them, so well
                    employed, that, during the remainder of the war, the king of Prussia had no more
                    trouble from them.</p>
                <p>The beginning.of the year 1758 proved favourable to the arms of his Prussian
                    majesty. On the 3d of April he commenced his∙ operations against Schweidnitz,
                    and pushed the siege so vigorously that the place surrendered in thirteen days.
                    He then disposed his forces in such a manner as might best guard his dominions
                    against his numerous enemies. For this purpose Count Dohna commanded a body of
                    troops on the side of Pomerania; whilst another considerable body was posted
                    between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Silesia from the Russians, in case
                    they should make their inroad that way. A little time afterwards an army was
                    formed in Saxony, commanded by the king’s brother, Prince Henry. This army
                    consisted of thirty battalions and forty-five squadrons, and was designed to
                    make head against the army of the Circles, which, by great efforts during the
                    winter, and the junction of a considerable body of Austrians, was again in a
                    condition to take the field. Between all these armies a ready’ communication was
                    kept up by a regular chain of posts. After the reduction of Schweidnitz, the
                    king, having made a show of invading Bohemia, suddenly burst into Moravia, where
                    in a short time he made himself master of the whole country, and on the 27th of
                    May laid siege to Ölmutz, the capital. Of this Daun no sooner got information
                    than he marched to Moravia through Bohemia; and though he was not in a condition
                    to risk a battle, yet, by placing himself in a strong situation, where he could
                    not be attacked, by harassing the king’s troops and cutting off their convoys,
                    he at last obliged him to abandon the enterprise. The king, however, who
                    frequently owed much of his success to the impenetrable secrecy in which he
                    shrouded all his designs, gave not the least hint of his intention to raise the
                    siege of 01- mutz. On the contrary, the very day before the siege was raised,
                    the firing continued as briskly as ever; but in the night of the 1st of July,
                    the whole army took the road to Bohemia in two columns, and gained an entire
                    march upon the Austrians. Thus, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of his
                    enemies, the Prussian army reached Bohemia, where the king seize(F upon a large
                    magazine at Lieutomissel; defeated some corps of Austrians who had attempted to
                    interrupt his progress; and arrived at Königsgratz, of which he took possession,
                    after driving from it seven thousand Austrians who were intrenched’there. This
                    city and several other districts he laid under Contribution; but he soon
                    afterwards, entered Silesia, and marched with the utmost rapidity to encounter
                    the Russians, who’having united their forces under Brown and her mor, had
                    entered the New March of Brandenburg, and laid siege’ to Custrin.</p>
                <p>The king arrived in this city at a very critical period. The Russians had laid
                    siege to it on the J5th of August; and though they were not well skilled in
                    managing artillery, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541163"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1163-0676"/>yet, by furious and unremitting discharges at
                    random, they threw in such a number of bombs and red-hot balls, that the town
                    was soon on fire in every quarter. Some of the wretched inhabitants were burned;
                    others were buried in the ruins of their houses, or killed by the balls which
                    fell like hail in the streets; whilst many of the survivors abandoned their
                    habitations, and fled out of the town on the side where it was not invested. The
                    governor did everything for the defence of the place; but as the walls were
                    built after the ancient manner, it was impossible that the town could have made
                    a lengthened defence, especially as the principal magazine of the besieged had
                    been blown up. The stern avenger of all these injuries, however, was now at
                    hand. The king came in sight of the Russians on the 25th of August, after a
                    march of fifty-six days, in the course of which he beheld the country everywhere
                    desolated, and the villages in flames. At his approach the enemy raised the
                    siege, and retired towards the neighbouring village of Zorn-dorft', where they
                    were almost immediately attacked. At nine o’clock in the morning a terrible fire
                    of cannon and mortars poured destruction on the right wing of the Russian army
                    for two hours without intermission. The slaughter was such as might have been
                    expected; but the Russians kept their ground with astonishing resolution, new
                    regiments pressing forward to supply the places of those that fell. When the
                    first line had expended all their ammunition, they rushed forward on the
                    Prussians with their bayonets; and these brave troops, although encouraged by
                    the presence of their king, gave way and fled before an enemy already half
                    defeated. The Russian generals ought now to have attacked with their cavalry the
                    disordered infantry of the enemy, which would have completed the defeat, and in
                    all probability given the finishing stroke to the king of Prussia’s affairs.
                    This opportunity, however, they lost. But the king was not so negligent. By a
                    very rapid and masterly movement, he brought all the cavalry of his right wing
                    to the centre, and falling upon the Russian infantry, uncovered by their
                    cavalry, and even disordered by their own success, drove them back with horrible
                    slaughter, at the same time that the repulsed battalions of infantry, returning
                    to the charge, decided the victory. The Russians were now thrown into the most
                    dreadful confusion. The wind blew the dust and smoke into their faces, so that,
                    unable to distinguish friends from foes, they fired on each other, plundered
                    their own baggage, which had been placed between the lines, and intoxicated
                    themselves with brandy; the ranks fell in upon one another, and being thus
                    crammed together into a narrow space, the fire of the Prussians produced
                    dreadful effect, whilst their enemies kept up only a scattered and ineffectual
                    discharge. Yet even in this dismal situation the Russians did not fly, but
                    suffered themselves to be slaughtered till seven in the evening, when their
                    generals having caused an attack to be made on the Prussian right wing, the
                    attention of the enemy was drawn to that quarter, and they had thus time to
                    retire a little from the field of battle to recover their order. In this
                    engagement the Russians lost twenty-one thousand five hundred and twenty-nine
                    men, whilst that of the Prussians did not exceed two thousand.</p>
                <p>A vast train of artillery was taken, together with the military chest, and many
                    officers of high rank. The consequence was, that the Russian army retreated as
                    far as Landsperg, on the frontiers of Poland, and the king was left at liberty
                    to march with his usual expedition to the relief of Prince Henry in Saxony.</p>
                <p>The prince was at this time severely pressed by Mar shal Daun. As soon as the
                    king had left Bohemia in the manner already related, Daun, considering it of no
                    use to follow him, resolved to turn his arms against Saxony. Towards that
                    country, therefore, he marched through Lusatia, by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen.
                    On the 3d of September he invested the strong fortress of Sonnestein, which
                    unaccountably surrendered, after a single day’s-resistance, to one of his
                    generals, named Macguire. He then directed his movement so as to favour the
                    operations of General Laudon, who had advanced through Lower Lusatia to the
                    confines of Brandenburg; and, by drawing the attention of the Prussian forces
                    which had been left in Silesia to the northward of that duchy, he facilitated
                    the progress of Generals Karsch and Deville in the southern parts. He then
                    proposed that Prince Henry should be attacked by the army of the Circles, whilst
                    that of the Austrians should pass the Elbe, and, falling at the same time on the
                    Prussians, second the attack of the imperialists, and cut off the retreat of
                    their enemies from Dresden. The sudden appearance of the king of Prussia,
                    however, put an end to his plan. General Laudon abandoned all his conquests in
                    Lower Lusatia, and retired towards Daun, whilst that general himself retired
                    from the neighbourhood of Dresden as far as Zittau. The army of the empire kept
                    its ground in the strong position at Pirna, formerly mentioned, but did riot
                    undertake any thing. As for the Swedes, who had directed their movements by
                    those of the Russians, they no sooner heard of the victory of Zorndoff than they
                    retreated with much more expedition than they had advanced.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the king of Prussia seemed to be thus pretty well retrieved, when,
                    by an unfortunate oversight, he was brought to the verge of ruin. Marshal Daun
                    had taken up an advantageous position at Stolpen, by which he preserved a
                    communication with the army of the empire. On the other hand, the king of
                    Prussia, having taken possession of an important post at Bautzen, extended his
                    right wing to the village of Hohenkirchen, by which he preserved a communication
                    with Prince Henry, protected Brandenburg, and had the power, if necessary, of
                    throwing succours into Silesia. The two armies kept a watchful eye on each
                    other’s movements; and as the principal aim of Daun was to cut off the king’s
                    communication with Silesia, and that of the king to intercept Daun’s
                    communication with Bohemia, a battle seemed inevitable. In this posture of
                    affairs the Austrian general formed a design of attacking the Prussian camp in
                    the night; and in point of fact he succeeded, under cover of the darkness,
                    prolonged by a thick mist, in surprising his usually vigilant enemy, who
                    obviously never contemplated such an enterprise on the part of his opponent.
                    Soon after midnight, the Austrian army began its march in three columns towards
                    the camp of the king of Prussia. The night was exceedingly dark, and they had a
                    considerable way to march; yet all the columns arrived simultaneously, without
                    being discovered, or the least confusion having occurred; and at five in the
                    morning they began a regular and well-conducted attack upon one extremity of the
                    Prussian line, which was at the same time taken in reverse by the Austrian left
                    wing formed <hi rend="italic">en potence.</hi> Nothing could withstand the
                    sudden attack thus made. The battalions, as they hastily formed, were swept away
                    by the overwhelming fire of the Austrians; the Prussians were thrown into
                    confusion; and Marshal Keith, one of their best generals, having received two
                    musket-balls, fell dead on the spot.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Frederick’s position was not good, and of this he was made
                    fully aware. Two days before the battle, Marshal Keith said to him. “Si les
                    Autrichiens nous laissent dans ce camp, ils méritent d’etre pendus.” The king,
                    smiling at the observation, replied, “Il faut espérer que Daun aura plus peur de
                    nous que de la corde.” This anecdote is eminently characteristic. ’The king
                    relied on the resources of his genius, and if light, which the ancient hero
                    prayed for when beset by his enemies, had been vouchsafed to Frederick, Daun
                    would never have gathered the bloody and bootless laurels of
                    Hohenkirchen.</p></note> Prince Francis of Brunswick had his head shot oft' by a
                    cannon-ball as he was mounting his horse; and everything seemed to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193541176" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1176-0677"/> announce the
                    total destruction of the army. Still, however, the king preserved his wonderful
                    presence of mind, which indeed never forsook him, even on the most trying
                    occasion. He ordered some detachments from his left wing to support the right;
                    but the moment that these orders were received, the left itself was furiously
                    attacked. General Ketzow, who commanded in that quarter, repulsed the Austrians
                    with difficulty, but was not able to afford any considerable assistance to the
                    right, which alone was obliged to sustain the weight of the principal attack.
                    The Austrians, in the beginning of the engagement, had driven the Prussians out
                    of the village of Hohenkirchen; and as the fate of the day depended upon the
                    possession of that post, no effort was spared to recover it. The Prussians made
                    three bloody and unsuccessful attacks on the village; in the fourth they carried
                    it; but the Austrians continually pouring in fresh troops, they were at last <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> driven out with great slaughter. The king then
                    ordered a retreat, which was conducted in good order, without being pursued;
                    nevertheless, this bloody action cost him seven thousand men, together with a
                    great number of cannon. The Austrians computed their own loss at five
                    thousand.</p>
                <p>His Prussian majesty, having thus happily escaped such imminent danger, took
                    every possible measure to prevent the enemy from gaining any considerable
                    advantage from his defeat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>When Frederick had retired to the camp of Doberschutz, he said to his
                    generals, “Daun nous a laissé sortir de l’échiquier; la partie n'est pas perdue;
                    nous nous reposerons ici, et nous .marcherons ensuite en Silésie pour délivrer
                    Neiss.” This saliy betrays a mind independent of and superior to events. A king
                    who, situated as Frederick then’was, preserves coolness enough to compare his
                    operations to a party at chess, the field of desolation which he had just
                    quitted to a chess-board, and his whole existence to the turn of a game, is
                    capable of performing the greatest actions in war. It is such men that triumph
                    over fortune. He had been surprised under circumstances most favourable to the
                    assailant, all of whose movements were completely concealed till the last moment
                    by a dense fog; the extremity of his line had been attacked, and almost at the
                    same instant taken in reverse, by the main body of the Austrian army; yet, in
                    spite of these fearful odds, he maintained the contest for hours with nearly
                    balanced chances, and inflicted such a severe loss on the enemy as deprived him
                    not only of the ability to pursue, but also of the fruits which he might have
                    expected to reap from his victory.</p></note> Perceiving that the only advantage
                    which they wished to derive from it was to cover the operations of their armies
                    in Silesia, and that he had now nothing to fear on the side of Saxony, he
                    reinforced his own army from that of his brother Prince Henry, and hastened into
                    Silesia to raise the siege of Neiss, which had been completely invested on .the
                    4th of October. On the 24th of that month, therefore, he quitted his camp, and
                    by a circuitous route, to avoid obstruction from the enemy, arrived in the
                    plains of Gorlitz. A body of the Austrians had in vain attempted to secure this
                    post before him, and some who arrived after him were defeated with the loss of
                    eight hundred men. From this place the king pursued his march with the utmost
                    diligence, but was followed by Laudon at the head of twenty-four thousand men,
                    who constantly hung upon his rear, and harassed his army. The king, however,
                    knowing the importance of his expedition, continued his march without
                    interruption, and suffered his antagonist to obtain some trifling advantages
                    without molestation. Daun, however, not content with the opposition given by
                    Laudon, sent a large body of horse and foot by another route to reinforce Karsch
                    and Deville, who had formed, the siege of Neiss and the blockade of Cosel,
                    whilst he himself passed the Elbe, and advanced towards Dresden.</p>
                <p>All these precautions, however, were of little avail. Ge*∙ nerals Karsch and
                    Deville, notwithstanding their reinforcement, no sooner heard of the king’s
                    approach than they raised the siege of both places, and retired, leaving behind
                    them a considerable quantity of military stores. The object of the march being
                    thus accomplished, the king instantly returned, and hastened to the relief of
                    Saxony, the capital of which was in great danger from Marshal Daun. The place
                    was but indifferently fortified, and garrisoned .only by twelve thousand men; so
                    that it could not hold out long against a numerous and well-appointed army. It
                    was besides commanded by a large suburb, of which, if once the enemy got
                    possession, all defence of the city would then be vain. For this reason
                    Sehmettau, the Prussian governor, determined to set these suburbs on fire, which
                    was, actually done on the 10th of November, to the incredible loss of the
                    inhabitants, as in the suburbs were carried on most of those valuable
                    manufactures which render the city of Dresden remarkable. This disappointed the
                    designs of Daun; but, though the act was conformable to the laws of war, and had
                    been executed with all the caution and humanity possible, yet the Austrians
                    exclaimed against it, as a piece of the most unprovoked and barbarous cruelty
                    recorded in history.</p>
                <p>After the king of Prussia had approached Dresden, all the Austrian armies retired
                    into Bohemia, where they took up their winter quarters, as did also the king of
                    Prussia in Saxony. This unhappy country he said he would now consider as his own
                    by right of conquest. .But instead of treating the conquered people as his
                    lawful subjects, he oppressed them in all possible ways, by levying the most
                    severe and exorbitant contributions, surrounding the exchange with soldiers, and
                    confining the merchants innarrow lodgings on straw beds, till they drew upon
                    their correspondents for such sums as he wanted.</p>
                <p>As early as the 23d of February 1759 the Prussians commenced military operations.
                    General Wobersow marched with a body of troops into Poland, where he destroyed
                    several large magazines belonging to the Russians, and returned into Silesia,
                    without any loss, on the 18th of April. In the mean time, by certain movements
                    on the part of the king, the greater part of the Austrian troops had been drawn
                    towards the frontiers of Silesia. Prince Henry immediately took advantage of
                    this opening, and on the 15th of April entered Bohemia with his army divided
                    into two columns. One, commanded by himself, marched towards Peterswalde; the
                    other, under General Hülsen, passed by the towns of Pasberg and Kommotau. That
                    commanded by Prince Henry himself penetrated as far as Loboschutz and
                    Leitmeritz; the enemy flying everywhere before them, and burning or abandoning
                    the vast magazines which they had amassed. The division under General Hulsefi
                    had more active employment. A strong pass at Pasberg was defended by a
                    considerable body of Austrians. General Hulsch, having conducted his cavalry by
                    another road, so ’as' to fall directly upon their rear, attacked them in front
                    with his infantry, drove them out of their intrenehments, and totally defeated
                    them with the loss of a great number killed, and two thousand taken prisoners,
                    whilst that of the Prussians did not exceed seventy in killed and wounded. '
                    After this exploit they returned into Saxony, with hostages for the
                    contributions which they had freely exacted during the course of their
                    expedition.</p>
                <p>Some other successes obtained by Prince Henry cleared Franconia of∙the enemy; but
                    the approach of the Russians seemed once more to bring the affairs of the king
                    of Prussia to a crisis. Notwithstanding the destruction of their magazines, they
                    had continued to advance into Silesia, where they were opposed by Count Dohna;
                    but as the troops he had under him were far inferior to the enemy, he found it
                    impossible to do more, at least with any appearance of success, than to observe
                    their motions and harass them on their march. This was so displeasing to the <pb

                    disgraced this general, and appointed Wedel to succeed him, with orders to
                    attack the Russians at all events. To enable Wedel, however, to comply with his
                    desperate order, he sent him some reinforcements, which increased his army to
                    about thirty thousand men. With these, on the 23d of July 1759, Wedel attacked
                    seventy thousand Russians posted in the most advantageous manner at Zulichau,
                    and defended by a numerous artillery. Though the Prussians marched on to almost
                    certain defeat, they sustained the attack for a long time with unparalleled
                    reSolution. At last, however, they gave way, and were obliged to retire with the
                    loss of four thousand seven hundred killed or taken prisoners, and three
                    thousand wounded.</p>
                <p>The consequences of this victory were, that the Russians penetrated into the
                    Prussian territories, and took possession of the towns of Crossen and Francfort
                    on the Oder, which rendered it absolutely necessary for the king to go in person
                    to oppose them. Accordingly, on the 4th of August he joined Wedel with a
                    considerable body of forces, having left the greater part of his army in Saxony
                    under Prince Henry. But as Marshal Dann had sent to the assistance of the
                    Russians under Soltikof a body of twelve thousand horse and eight thousand foot
                    under General Laudon, the king still found himself unable to fight them, since
                    with this and some other reinforcements their army now amounted to upwards of
                    ninety thousand men. He therefore recalled General Finck, whom he had sent into
                    Saxony with nine thousand men; but with all his reinforcements lie found it
                    impossible to augment his army to little more than forty thousand men of all
                    arms. His situation, however, was now so critical that a battle had become
                    inevitable; and therefore, on the 12th of August, with this inferior force, the
                    king attacked, his enemies, strongly intrenched, and defended by a prodigious
                    number of cannon.</p>
                <p>In this action his principal effort was directed against the left wing of the
                    Russian army. He began the attack, according to custom, with a heavy cannonade;
                    and having produced the desired effect, he then assailed the left wing with
                    several battalions disposed in columns. The Russian intrenchments were forced
                    with great slaughter, and seventy-two pieces of cannon were taken. But still
                    there was a defile to be passed, and several redoubts which covered the village
                    of Kunersdorf remained to be carried. These were attacked with the same
                    resolution, and one after another taken. The enemy made another stand at the
                    village, and endeavoured to preserve their ground there by pushing forward
                    several battalions of horse and foot; but this also proved unsuccessful, and
                    they were driven from post to post quite to the last redoubts. For upwards of
                    six hours the Prussians were successful, and everywhere broke the enemy with
                    prodigious slaughter; they drove them from almost all the positions they had
                    occupied before the battle, took more than half their artillery, and scarcely
                    anything seemed wanting to render the victory complete. In these circumstances,
                    the king wrote the following billet to the queen: “Madam, we have beaten the
                    Russians from their intrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious
                    victory.” But at this very instant victory abandoned the Prussian standards. The
                    enemy, defeated in almost every quarter, found their left wing, shattered as it
                    was, more entire than any other part of their line. Soltikof, the Russian
                    general, immediately assembled the remains of his right wing, and collecting as
                    many as he could from his centre, reinforced the left, and made a stand at a
                    redoubt which had been erected on an advantageous eminence in a cemetery. All
                    the king’s generals are said to have been of opinion that he ought to allow the
                    Russians to retain peaceable possession of this post. Their army had already
                    suffered so much, that it would have been impossible for them to attempt any
                    enterprise of consequence after the battle; besides, their artillery was still
                    numerous., the post was very strong, and the Prussian troops were greatly
                    fatigued. These reasons for a few moments weighed with the king; but the natural
                    impetuosity of his temper getting the better of his reason, he led on his
                    wearied troops to renew the combat.</p>
                <p>Within the limits to which we are restricted, it is impossible to give any
                    adequate military details of this terrible battle. Suffice it to state, that,
                    wherever the storm of the conflict raged most fiercely, there was the king
                    haranguing the troops, leading in person the battalions to the charge, and
                    exposing himself with all the hardihood of the merest soldier of fortune. The
                    carnage was truly horrible, the combatants mutually discharging showers of grape
                    at the distance of fifty paces, and musketry even closer. The battle had already
                    lasted six hours with inconceivable obstinacy; the Prussians were harassed, and
                    scarcely in a condition to sustain themselves; whilst sixteen thousand men
                    killed or wounded attested their courageous efforts, but deprived them of the
                    means of maintaining the conflict. At this moment some Austrian squadrons
                    charged the right flank of Finck’s division; the king, in attempting to cover
                    the retreat, received a contusion, and two battalions were taken behind him. The
                    disorder now became dreadful, and the total destruction of the army was only
                    prevented by that extraordinary presence of mind which had never for a moment
                    failed him, even in the midst of this terrible conflict. Such was the memorable
                    and sanguinary day of Kunersdorf, on, which the Prussians lost half their number
                    in killed and wounded, besides a hundred and sixty-five pieces of cannon,
                    abandoned in the battle and the retreat. The loss of the enemy in killed and
                    wounded amounted to sixteen thousand Russians, and three thousand Austrians.
                    Soltikof, in writing to the empress an account of the battle, dryly observed,
                    that “if he gained another such victory, he would himself be obliged to carry
                    the tidings on foot, with a staff in his hand.” The king, when he found the
                    victory totally lost, is said to have sent another billet to the queen,
                    expressed in the following manner: “Remove from Berlin with the royal family;
                    let the archives be carried to Potsdam; the town may make conditions with the
                    enemy.”</p>
                <p>Immediately after this defeat, the king set himself about repairing his losses
                    vzith the utmost diligence; and in a few &lt;lays everything was again put in
                    order in his camp. He replaced his artillery from Berlin; recalled General
                    Kleist with five thousand men from Pomerania; detached six thousand from his own
                    army to the defence of Saxony; and with the remainder threw himself between the
                    Russians and Great Glogau, covering that city, which had been the chief object
                    of their designs. In a word, notwithstanding their victory, he obliged the
                    Russians to return to Poland without accomplishing any thing besides the barren
                    victory of Kunersdorft', purchased at so fearful an expenditure of human
                    life.</p>
                <p>The misfortunes of the Prussian monarch, however, were not at an end. Prince
                    Henry, indeed, by a most extraordinary and well-conducted march, entered Saxony,
                    which had been totally overrun by the armies of the enemy; and strong
                    detachments having been sent into that country under Generals Finck and Wunsch,
                    the whole except Dresden was in a short time recovered. Towards this place
                    Marshal Daun retired, and in all probability he would soon have been obliged to
                    quit Saxony, had Frederick been content with attaining this object. But the
                    king’s impatience could not be satisfied without cutting off Daun’s retreat, and
                    forcing him to a battle; and for this purpose he sent General Finck, with
                    upwards of twelve thousand men according to the Prussian account, but with
                    twenty thousand according to that of the Austrians, to seize some passes through
                    which alone Daun could make his way towards Bohemia. This commission was
                    executed with the greatest exactness; but the Prussian general, having probably
                    advanced too far into these defiles, and neglected to preserve his
                    communications <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541202" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1202-0679"
                    />with the main army, gave the enemy an opportunity of surrounding him, and at
                    last forcing him and his whole army to surrender prisoners of war. Nor was it
                    long before this disaster was followed by another. General Durceke occupied a
                    position on the right bank of the Elbe, opposite to Meissen; and on the approach
                    of a large body of Austrians he prepared to retreat across the river, into a
                    place where he hoped to be more secure; but having been obliged by a hard frost
                    to withdraw the bridge of boats, a thaw supervened, and when the Prussians were
                    attempting to lay a bridge of pontoons, their rear-guard was attacked with great
                    fury by the Austrians, and the whole either killed or taken. The loss of the
                    Prussians on this occasion was computed at nearly three thousand men.</p>
                <p>The year 1760 showed the Prussian monarch in a more dangerous situation than he
                    had ever before stood. His affairs, indeed, seemed to be altogether desperate.
                    His losses were not to be measured by the number of the killed or prisoners, but
                    by armies destroyed or taken. Forty generals had died or been slain in his
                    service since the beginning of October 1756, exclusive of those who were wounded
                    or taken prisoners. This of itself would have been an irreparable loss, had not
                    the very wars which destroyed these men furnished others equally capable of
                    filling their places. But another deficiency, which could not be remedied, still
                    remained. The king, by his indefatigable industry and exertions, had supplied
                    all the deficiencies of men in his armies; but they were not the same men as
                    before. The hardy veterans, with whom he had originally taken the field, were
                    now no more, and their places were supplied by others who had neither the same
                    experience nor the same discipline; so that he was obliged to supply the
                    deficiency by his own genius and heroism.</p>
                <p>But whatever abilities the Prussian monarch might possess, and he undoubtedly
                    exerted them to the utmost, it seemed only to be contending against fate. His
                    enemies gained over him still greater and greater advantages. General Laudon,
                    with whom none but the king himself seems to have been able to cope, by a series
                    of artful movements drew Fouquet, one of the Prussian generals, who commanded a
                    strong body of forces, into a disadvantageous situation near Landshut.
                    Perceiving it impossible for the Prussians to escape, Laudon then attacked their
                    intrenchments on the night of the 23d of June. The Prussians made a gallant
                    defence, but at last were all either killed or taken prisoners, except about
                    three hundred. Of the Prussians four thousand were killed, and seven thousand
                    taken prisoners; fifty-eight pieces of cannon, and a great number of colours,
                    were also lost. The victory, however, was dearly bought; for the Austrians lost
                    in killed and wounded above twelve thousand men, whom, however, they could
                    better∙ spare than the Prussians, on account of their great superiority of
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>Laudon failed not to improve this victory to the utmost. He instantly turned back
                    from Landshut, and fell upon the city of Glatz, which he took in a very short
                    time, with the garrison who defended it, consisting of two thousand men. In this
                    place were found a hundred and one pieces of brass cannon, with immense
                    quantities of provisions and military stores. From thence he marched against
                    Breslau, and immediately invested it. But, in the mean while, the king of
                    Prussia, whose motions had been all this time counteracted by Marshal Daun in
                    Saxony, marched with his usual rapidity towards Silesia. By this means he drew
                    Daun out of Saxony; and indeed the Austrian general used such expedition that he
                    gained two days’ march on the king. This was no sooner known to his Prussian
                    majesty than he returned with the same expedition as he had advanced, and sat
                    down before Dresden.</p>
                <p>Daun soon received intelligence of the king’s retrograde movement, and also
                    returned. In the mean time, however, the buildings of the city were terribly
                    shattered by the king’s cannon and bombs, which continually played on it. But
                    his endeavours to reduce it before the arrival of Daun proved ineffectual. The
                    siege had been begun on the 13th of July, and on the 19th Daun appeared within a
                    league of Dresden. The Prussians then redoubled their efforts. They had that day
                    received reinforcements of heavy cannon and mortars, with which they battered
                    the place incessantly. The cathedral church, several principal streets, some
                    palaces, and the noble manufactory of porcelain, were entirely destroyed. The
                    siege was continued till the 22d; but on the night of the 21 st Daun had thrown
                    sixteen battalions into the city, which rendered it impossible for the king to
                    continue longer before it with any prospect of success. He therefore raised the
                    siege, and retired without molestation, though there were three considerable
                    armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood. Breslau was fiercely bombarded by
                    Laudon; but the approach of Prince Henry obliged him to desist from his
                    enterprise on the 5th of August.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the fortune of the king seemed likely to be terminated by one fatal
                    stroke. Finding it impossible for him to carry on a defensive war, he marched
                    towards Silesia with such astonishing rapidity, that before the middle of August
                    he had advanced two hundred miles, leaving Marshal Daun with his army far behind
                    him. The object he had in view by using such expedition was to engage Laudon
                    before he could have time to effect a junction with Daun, and Lascy, another
                    Austrian general; a union which seemed to threaten him with unavoidable
                    destruction. This, however, he found it impossible to prevent; and the three
                    armies, when united, formed a tremendous line of encampments, extending.no less
                    than thirty English miles, at the same time that every one of their posts was
                    strong, and the communication between them easy. The king was strongly encamped
                    at Leignitz, and for several days employed all his military skill in attempting
                    to induce one of the bodies to detach itself from the rest, or to attack them at
                    some disadvantage; but without the least effect.</p>
                <p>At last the Austrian generals, having maturely weighed all circumstances,
                    resolved to attack the king’s camp itself, strong as it was; and Marshal Daun,
                    remembering the advantage he had gained at Hohenkirchen by an attack in the
                    night-time, resolved to follow a similar plan on the present occasion. The whole
                    army, as soon as it became dark, were to march from their several stations to
                    such positions as were marked out for each corps; they were to strike their
                    tents, but still to keep up the fires in their camps, and to cause the drums to
                    beat the tattoo as usual, by which means they hopedto surprise the enemy; and,
                    even if they failed in this, they judged it impossible for him to escape them,
                    should he be ever so much on his guard. The king, having completed his
                    dispositions for the night, had seated himself and begun to doze near a bivouac
                    fire, when Major Hund, who, with five squadrons of Zeithen’s hussars, had been
                    sent in reconnoissance as far as Polschildern, returned at full speed, calling
                    out, “Where is the king? Where is the king ?” Frederick having demanded what was
                    the matter, the major said, with an animated air, “Sire, the enemy is <hi
                    rend="italic">there?</hi> pointing in the direction; “he has repulsed my
                    videttes, and is not more than four hundred paces from this.” The king having
                    ordered this officer to retard as much as possible the advance of the Austrians,
                    proceeded to issue orders, and make dispositions for defeating the design of the
                    enemy. He indicated to General Schenkendorf, who commanded the brigade of the
                    extreme left, an eminence situated near Bino-witz, on which he was to form; he
                    gave orders to the second line to prolong itself to the left, to prevent the
                    enemy from attacking the army in flank; and he immediately brought to the front
                    several regiments of cavalry, in order to gain the time necessary for the
                    execution of all these dispositions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541215" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1215-0680"/>
                <p>General Schenkenderf marched immediately by the left flank, gained the hill, and
                    there established a battery of ten twelvepounders, at the moment when the
                    Austrians were about to occupy the position. The latter, in fact, were so near,
                    that the Prussians opened on them a heavy fire of grape, which caused great
                    havock in the columns, while attempting to form, but unable to do so. As soon as
                    the Prussian army was drawn up, Frederick divided it, leaving his right on the
                    ground where it had been formed, to observe Marshal Daun, and to maintain their
                    post; whilst with his left he turned in order to fall upon the corps under
                    General Laudon. In the mean time, that commander, ignorant of the fate which was
                    awaiting him, advanced with the utmost expedition towards the place which had
                    been assigned him, in order to share in the glory of destroying the Prussian
                    monarch; when, at three in the morning, on the 15th of August, a thick fog which
                    covered the ground suddenly clearing up, discovered, like the opening of a
                    mighty scene, the front of the Prussian army regularly drawn up in order of
                    battle, and advantageously posted. Laudon, though surprised, made the best
                    dispositions that circumstances would admit of, and an obstinate engagement
                    ensued. After five successive attacks, executed by the Prussians, against as
                    many different lines, he at length resolved to yield them the field of battle.
                    It was not quite five in the morning when the battle was decided. It cost the
                    Austrians more than ten thousand men, of whom six thousand were prisoners, and
                    eighty-six pieces of cannon; but the loss of the Prussians did not exceed two
                    thousand men, because all the advantages were clearly on their side.</p>
                <p>The king did not venture to pursue Laudon, conceiving that he would require his
                    victorious troops to support his right wing against Daun, and even Lascy.
                    Conformably to his plan, and in order to attack by day-break the right of the
                    camp at Leignitz, the marshal had in the evening of the 14th marched in six
                    columns, intending to approach as far as the Katzbach. A detachment of partisans
                    passed the river at eleven o’clock at night, to dislodge the Prussians from a
                    village which they had occupied on the other bank, but which the enemy’s troops
                    were astonished to find they had abandoned. Dann was not apprised of this
                    circumstance until two in the morning, when he gave orders that the army should
                    immediately pass the Katzbach; but this operation, retarded by the darkness, the
                    construction of bridges, and the false direction given to some of the columns,
                    was not effected until five in the morning, when it was no longer time to
                    support Laudon, who had already sustained a defeat. The marshal having learned
                    the fate of his colleague, and observing the firm countenance maintained by the
                    victorious Prussians, retired to his original position between Neudorf and
                    Cosendau.</p>
                <p>The victory of Leignitz, though complete, gave but a partial relief to the king
                    of Prussia. The most essential service it did was the preventing the Russians
                    from joining those enemies which he already had before him. Count Czer-nichef
                    had been advancing with twenty-four thousand men, and had even passed the Oder;
                    but he was so intimidated by the result of this battle, that he instantly
                    repassed that river, even although Daun had sent him a strong body of troops in
                    order to encourage him to advance. Soon after this battle, the king joined his
                    brother Prince Henry, and marching against Daun, who had begun to form the
                    blockade of Schweidnitz, fell upon a corps under General Beck, made two
                    battalions of Croats prisoners, and dispersed the remainder, which obliged the
                    enemy to abandon the enterprise they had just undertaken. About the same time,
                    General Hulsen gained a considerable advantage over the imperial army in Saxony,
                    with very trifling loss on his part; by which he effectually prevented them from
                    cutting off his communications with Torgau.</p>
                <p>By these successes the affairs of his Prussian majesty seemed to revive; but his
                    enemies were still formidable and menacing. The recent manoeuvres had drawn him
                    so far into Silesia, that his communication with Brandenburg was almost wholly
                    intercepted. The Russian army, which, after it had repassed the Order, began to
                    quit Silesia, sent forward a powerful detachment under Count Czemichef towards
                    the March of Brandenburg. A body of fifteen thousand Austrians, under the
                    generals Lascy and Brentano, and the united body of Austrians and imperialists
                    which acted in Saxony, began their march in concert with the Russians, and
                    proposed to unite at the gates of Berlin. These armies amounted to forty
                    thousand men. To oppose this formidable force, General Hülsen called to his
                    assistance General Werner, who had been detached with a body of troops to
                    Pomerania; but, after being joined by him, their united forces were found not to
                    exceed fifteen or sixteen thousand men. To attempt a defence of the capital with
                    this force would have been little short of madness. These commanders were
                    therefore obliged to leave Berlin to its fate, which, indeed, considering the
                    barbarity of the Russians and the animosity of the Austrians, seemed to be a
                    dreadful one. However, by the powerful mediation of several foreign ministers,
                    the town obtained terms which were not altogether intolerable; but the
                    magazines, arsenals, and founderies were destroyed, and an immense quantity of
                    military stores was seized, with a number of cannon and other arms. The city was
                    first obliged to pay eight hundred thousand guilders, after which a contribution
                    of one million nine hundred thousand crowns was imposed; yet, notwithstanding
                    this, many acts of violence were committed, and the king’s palace was plundered,
                    the furniture being abused in a scandalous manner.</p>
                <p>The combined armies remained only four days in Berlin. Dreading the vengeance of
                    the king of Prussia, who was rapidly advancing, they deemed it prudent to make
                    their stay as short as possible. But so great were the embarrassments which now
                    beset that monarch, that it seemed almost beyond human power to retrieve his
                    affairs. The imperialists, on their return from Berlin, having no army to oppose
                    them, made themselves masters of Leipzig, Torgau, Meissen, and Wirtemberg, in
                    which last city they found the grand magazine of the Prussian army. Stainville
                    also, at the head of a detachment from the French army, laid both the city and
                    duchy of Halberstadt under contribution. In Eastern Pomerania, the Russians had
                    besieged Colberg both by land and by sea. In Western Pomerania, the Swedes
                    advanced with the greatest celerity, hoping to share in the plunder of Berlin.,
                    In Silesia, the king no sooner began his march to the northward, than Laudon
                    advanced, and laid siege to the important fortress of Cosel; and, to complete
                    his distress and embarrassment, the king himself was attended at every step by
                    Daun with a superior army, prepared to take every advantage.</p>
                <p>In this situation the king, being joined by Hülsen and the Prince of Wirtemberg,
                    with the corps under their command, advanced along the Elbe, whilst Daun fell
                    back in order to cover Leipzig and Torgau; but the latter finding that the
                    Prussians directed their march towards the Elbe, encamped within reach of
                    Torgau, one part of his army extending to the Elbe, by which he was protected on
                    one side, whilst on the other he was covered by hills and woods, thus occupying
                    a most advantageous position. The Prussian army did not amount to fifty thousand
                    men, whilst that of the Austrians exceeded eighty-six thousand; yet such were
                    the unfortunate circumstances of the king, that he was obliged to fight under
                    all these disadvantages. He therefore caused his army to be informed that he was
                    now to lead them to a most desperate attempt, that his affairs required it, and
                    that he was determined to conquer or die. His soldiers unanimously declared that
                    they would die with him.</p>
                <p>The 3d of November 1760 was the day upon which this important action was fought.
                    The king divided his forces <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541228"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1228-0681"/>into three columns. General Hulsen was directed to
                    take post with one in a wood which lay on the left of the Austrian army, with
                    instructions not to move until he found the rest of the Prussians engaged;
                    General Zeithen was to charge with the right; and the grand attack in front was
                    to be conducted by the king in person. His forces were disposed in such a manner
                    that either his right or left wing could take the enemy in rear and reverse, so
                    as to disable them from undertaking any thing against the part where he intended
                    to direct his principal attack. On the other hand, Marshal Daun, perceiving that
                    the king was serious in his design of fighting, in order to prevent confusion,
                    sent all his baggage across the Elbe, on which he had established three bridges,
                    in the event of a retreat being necessary. The Austrian army then changed front,
                    and passed to the rear, its left being placed on the heights of Zinna, and its
                    right amongst the vines in rear of Siptitz; the reserve was stationed near
                    Groswig, the division of the grenadiers of the left wing at Weidenhain, and that
                    of the grenadiers and carabineers of the right in rear of Neiden. Lascy retired
                    from Schilda, on Loswig and Torgau; whilst Ried with the light troops took a
                    position on the extreme right towards Mokrena. In this formidable position he
                    was found, when, about two o’clock in the afternoon, the king began the attack.
                    The latter was received by the fire of two hundred pieces of cannon, which were
                    disposed along the Austrian front.. The Prussians were thrice led to the attack;
                    but every time they were repulsed and broken. The king at length commanded a
                    fresh body of cavalry to advance, which at first compelled the Austrians to
                    retire; but as fresh reinforcements continually poured in, this cavalry was in
                    its turn obliged to fall back; and the Prussians maintained themselves with
                    extreme difficulty, until General Zeithen, with the right wing, attacked the
                    enemy in the rear, repulsed them, and took possession of some eminences which
                    commanded the whole Austrian line. Encouraged by this success, the Prussian
                    infantry once more advanced, carried several of the enemy’s intrenchments, and
                    made way for a new attack of the cavalry, which broke in with irresistible fury
                    amongst the Austrians, and threw several bodies of them into irreparable
                    disorder. It was now about nine o’clock, and consequently both armies were
                    involved in darkness; yet the fire continued without intermission, and the
                    battalions with a blind rage discharged at one another, without distinguishing
                    friend from foe. Daun received a dangerous wound in the thigh, and was carried
                    from the field, which probably hastened the defeat of his troops. The command
                    then devolved on Count O’Donnell, who, finding the greater part of his troops in
                    disorder, the night advancing, and the enemy possessed of some eminences which
                    commanded his camp, and whence it was in vain to think of driving them, ordered
                    a retreat, which was conducted in perfect order and dead silence; few were lost
                    in passing the Elbe, and by far the greater part of their artillery was
                    preserved. The loss of the Prussians was estimated at ten thousand in killed and
                    wounded. That of the Austrians in killed and wounded is not known; but eight
                    thousand were made prisoners, along with two hundred and sixteen officers,
                    amongst whom were four generals.</p>
                <p>The result of the victory gained at Torgau was, that the king recovered all
                    Saxony except Dresden; whilst General Werner having in the mean time marched
                    into Pomerania, the Russians raised the siege of Colberg, and retired into
                    Poland, without having effected any thing further than wasting the open country.
                    Werner then marched to the assistance of Western Pomerania, where he defeated a
                    body of Swedes, and at last drove them out of the country. Laudon too abruptly
                    raised the blockade of Cosel; and afterwards, abandoning Landshut, he retired
                    into Austrian Silesia, leaving the Prussian portion free from molestation. Daun
                    placed one part of his army in Dresden, and the other in some strong positions
                    which lie to the south and west of the city, by which he commanded the Elbe, and
                    preserved his communications with Bohemia. The army of the empire retired into
                    Franconia, and established its head-quarters at Bamberg.</p>
                <p>Though these successes had apparently retrieved in some measure the affairs of
                    the king, yet his strength was in reality nearly exhausted; and in the campaign
                    of 1761 he made no such vigorous efforts as he had formerly done. The Russians,
                    dividing themselves into two bodies, invaded Silesia and Pomerania. In the
                    former country they laid siege to Breslau, and in the latter to Colberg. ∙
                    Tottleben, who had commanded the Russian armies, was now removed on a suspicion
                    of having corresponded with the king of Prussia, and General Romanzof appointed
                    in his stead; a measure which, it was expected, would render the Russian
                    operations this year more vigorous and consistent than they had ever yet
                    been.</p>
                <p>The king continued strongly encamped near Schweidnitz, where he was so closely
                    watched by Daun and Laudon that he could not attempt anything. However, he
                    defeated the designs of the Russians against Breslau, by sending General Platen
                    to destroy their magazines; which the latter accomplished with great success, at
                    the same time cutting off a body of four thousand of their troops. But this only
                    brought the more certain destruction upon Colberg, against which the body of the
                    Russian army immediately marched, cruelly wasting the country as they advanced.
                    The king of Prussia was unable to do any thing but send small detachments,
                    which, although they could not oppose their enemies in the field, yet, he hoped,
                    by cutting off their convoys, might distress them to such a degree as to oblige
                    them to abandon the siege, or at least protract it till the severity of the
                    winter should render it impossible for them to carry on their operations. He
                    thus weakened his own army so much, that it was found requisite to draw out of
                    Schweidnitz four thousand men to reinforce it; and no sooner had this been done,
                    than Laudon suddenly attacked and took that fortress by a coup-de-main. Colberg
                    made a brave defence; but the troops sent to its relief being totally unable to
                    cope with the Russian army, consisting of fifty thousand men, it was, on the 3d
                    of December, obliged to surrender; and thus the fate of the Prussian monarch,
                    almost every part of whose dominions lay open to the invaders, seemed to be
                    decided.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these gloomy appearances, the empress of Russia, the king’s most
                    inveterate and inflexible enemy, died on the 2d of January 1762. ^ She was
                    succeeded by Peter III. who, instead of being the king’s enemy, was his most
                    sanguine friend. As early as the 23d of February, in a memorial delivered to the
                    ministers of the allied courts, he declared that, “in order to the establishment
                    of peace, he was ready to sacrifice all the conquests made in this war by the
                    arms of Russia, in hopes that the allied courts will on their parts equally
                    prefer the restoration of peace and tranquillity, to the advantages which they
                    might expect from the continuance of the war, but which they cannot obtain but
                    by a continuance of the effusion of human blood.” This address was not much
                    relished by the allies. They were very willing to make peace, provided it should
                    prove for their own interest to do so; but they recommended to his attention
                    fidelity to treaties, which constitutes no less valuable a part of the royal
                    character than humanity and disinterestedness. This answer made no impression
                    upon the Czar. A suspension of hostilities took place on the 16th of March,
                    which was followed by a treaty of alliance on the 5th of May. In this treaty the
                    Czar stipulated nothing in favour of his former confederates; on the contrary,
                    he agreed to join his troops to those of the king of Prussia, in order to act
                    against them. Sweden, which had for a long time acted under the direction of
                    Russian councils, now followed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193541241"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1241-0682"/> the example of her mistress, and on the 22d of
                    May concluded a peace with Prussia.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that the king of Prussia would remain long inactive
                    after such an unexpected turn of fortune in his favour. His arms were now
                    everywhere attended with success. Prince Henry drove the imperialists from some
                    important positions in Saxony, by which he secured all that part which the
                    Prussians had possessed; and though the Austrians frequently attempted to
                    recover the ground thus, lost, they were constantly repulsed with great
                    slaughter. The king was not joined by his new allies· till towards the end of
                    June; after which he drove Daun before him to the extremity of Silesia, leaving
                    the town of Schweidnitz entirely uncovered, and which the king immediately
                    prepared to invest. In the mean time, different detachments of Prussians, some
                    on the side of Saxony, and others on that of Silesia, penetrated into Bohemia,
                    laid many parts of the country under contribution, and spread universal alarm. A
                    considerable body of Russian irregulars also made an irruption into Bohemia,
                    where they practised on the Austrians the same cruelties which they had long
                    been accustomed to exercise on the Prussians.</p>
                <p>But whilst the king was thus making the best use of his time, he was all at once
                    threatened with a fatal reverse of fortune by a new revolution in Russia. The
                    emperor was deposed, and his deposition was soon afterwards followed by his
                    death. The empress, who succeeded him, suspected that her husband had been
                    misled by the councils of his Prussian majesty, against whom, therefore, she
                    entertained a mortal enmity. In the very beginning of her reign, however, she
                    could not again undertake a war of so much importance as that which had just
                    been concluded. She therefore declared her intention of observing the peace
                    concluded by the late emperor; but she nevertheless resolved to recall her
                    armies from Silesia, Prussia, and Pomerania, which indeed the unsettled state of
                    the kingdom rendered in some degree necessary. At the same time a discovery was
                    made regarding the king of Prussia himself, which turned the scale greatly in
                    his favour. The Russian senate, flaming with resentment against this monarch, as
                    well as against their late unfortunate sovereign, and the empress, full of
                    suspicion that the conduct of the latter might have been influenced by the
                    councils of the former, searched eagerly amongst the papers of the late emperor
                    for an elucidation of this point. Many letters from the Prussian monarch were
                    indeed found, but these were conceived in a strain absolutely different from
                    what had been expected. The king had, as far as prudence would permit, kept a
                    reserve and distance with regard to the rash advances of this unhappy ally; and,
                    in particular, had counselled him to undertake nothing against the empress his
                    consort. The reading of these letters is said to have produced such an effect
                    upon the empress, that she burst into tears, and expressed her gratitude in the
                    warmest terms towards the Prussian monarch. Still, however, the Russian army was
                    ordered to separate from the Prussians; but all the important places which the
                    former had taken during the war were faithfully restored.</p>
                <p>The king, finding that the Russians were no more to take an active part in his
                    favour, resolved to profit by their appearance in his camp; and, therefore, the
                    day after the order for their return had arrived, he attacked the Austrian army,
                    drove their right wing from all its positions, and entirely cut off their
                    communication with Schweidnitz, so that nothing could be attempted for its
                    relief. Prince Henry kept them in continual alarms for Bohemia; whilst <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> great share of their attention, and no small portion of
                    their forces, were engaged on that side. Marshal Daun, now finding himself
                    rendered almost incapable of undertaking any thing, detached Laudon, with a
                    force greatly superior, to attack the Prince of Bevern, and drive him from the
                    advantageous position which he occupied. But the prince defended himself with
                    such resolution, that all the efforts of Landon were baffled before the king
                    could come to the aid of his lieutenant. The Austrians, being then placed
                    between two fires, were routed and pursued with terrible slaughter; after which
                    the king met with no further interruption in his preparation for the siege, and
                    the trenches were opened on the 18th of July. Marshal Daun did not even attempt
                    to relieve the place; but the garrison being very strong, it held out for nearly
                    two months from the date of the opening of the trenches. It is said that the
                    attack was directed, and the defence conducted, by two engineers who had written
                    on the subject of the attack and defence of fortified places; and they were now
                    practically engaged in proving the superiority of their systems. At last,
                    however, the garrison, to the number of eight thousand men, surrendered
                    prisoners of war; and the whole of this body, except nine, were soon after
                    drowned at the mouth of the Oder, on their passage to their intended confinement
                    in Königsberg.</p>
                <p>The king of Prussia, having thus become master of Schweidnitz, turned his
                    attention towards Saxony, where he reinforced his brother’s army, and made
                    preparations for laying siege to Dresden. In this country the Austrians had
                    lately met with some success, and driven back Prince Henry as far as Freyberg;
                    but on the 29th of October they were attacked by the Prussian army thus
                    reinforced, and totally discomfited. After various tactical combinations, of no
                    great importance, a simultaneous attack made by three Prussian divisions, in
                    which they were ably supported by the cavalry, decided the fortune of the day.
                    The loss of the imperial army amounted to four thousand prisoners, and about
                    three thousand men <hi rend="italic">//ors</hi><hi rend="italic">de combat;</hi>
                    that of the Prussians did not exceed fifteen hundred men of all arms, and they
                    signalized their gallant achievement by the capture of twenty-eight pieces of
                    cannon and nine standards. This affair does them the more honour that they had
                    in the field only twenty-nine battalions and sixty squadrons, or scarcely
                    eighteen thousand men, whilst the enemy had forty-nine battalions and
                    sixty-eight squadrons, or more than twenty-six thousand men. The victory of
                    Freyberg proved decisive. The empress-queen, finding herself deserted by all her
                    allies, was glad to conclude a treaty, upon the principle of mutual restitution
                    and oblivion; and thus, at the end of a bloody war, both parties were content to
                    adopt the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante,</hi> and sit down in the same
                    situation in which they respectively stood before a sword had been drawn. This
                    treaty has been called the peace of Hubertsburg.</p>
                <p>The war was no sooner terminated than the king of Prussia turned his attention to
                    domestic policy, and the recovery of his dominions from those innumerable
                    calamities which had befallen them during the contest. He immediately
                    distributed lands to his disbanded soldiers, and gave them the horses of his
                    artillery to assist them in their cultivation. By his wise and prudent
                    management, the horrors of war were soon forgotten; and the country ere long
                    became as flonrishing as ever. But notwithstanding this pacific disposition, the
                    king never slackened his endeavours for the defence of his states, but kept on
                    foot a respectable army, which might be able to act with promptitude on any
                    emergency.</p>
                <p>In the year 1778, a new difference arose with the house of Austria, concerning
                    the duchy of Bavaria. But though great warlike preparations were made upon both
                    sides, and immense armies brought into the field, nothing of consequence was
                    effected. Any little advantage obtained seems to have been on the side of the
                    Prussians, who made themselves masters of several towns, and carried on the war
                    in the enemy’s country. However, the emperor acted with so much caution, and
                    showed so much skill in defensive tactics, that all the manoeuvres of his
                    Prussian majesty could gain no material advantage; whilst, on the other hand,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541254" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1254-0683"/>Frederick was
                    too wise to venture an engagement. A peace therefore was soon concluded; and
                    since that time the history of Prussia, during the remainder of this great
                    king’s reign, affords no remarkable event which has not been mentioned in other
                    parts of the present work. (See particularly the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Poland.)</hi></p>
                <p>A few general remarks, however, may not be deemed altogether out of place in
                    concluding this imperfect sketch of the military career of Frederick. He was
                    undoubtedly a great captain, and to him belongs the high merit of having
                    demonstrated how much success in war depends upon scientific combinations,
                    executed with corresponding celerity and precision. But still be is not entitled
                    to rank with the greatest masters of the art; and, compared with Napoleon, he
                    was as much surpassed by the latter in all the higher attributes of a great
                    commander as he excelled the captains of his own time. He was opposed to
                    generals far inferior to those with whom Napoleon had for the most part to
                    contend; and his tactics were frequently arranged upon the knowledge he
                    possessed of their respective characters, rather than in conformity to the
                    established principles of the art. Nor did he possess the invaluable secret,
                    which Napoleon first revealed to the world in his Italian campaigns, of promptly
                    following up his successes, and gathering in the fruits of victory, before the
                    enemy could have time to recover from the shock of defeat. This, which is the
                    last and highest endowment of a great general, was reserved for his immortal
                    successor, whose campaigns afford ample and instructive examples of all that is
                    most finished, not only in grand military combinations, but also in the still
                    more difficult and important art of deriving from them every result which they
                    seemed calculated to afford. Upon every occasion, however, the personal
                    character and conduct of Frederick in the field stamped him the hero of the age
                    in which he lived, and cannot but be viewed with admiration by every succeeding
                    one. I lis presence of mind was almost supernatural; nothing could shake,
                    nothing could for a moment disturb, the cool and steady composure with which he
                    regarded the most frightful scenes of war. Amidst the perils of surprise at
                    Hohenkirchen, when the fog rendered the enemy perceptible only by the murderous
                    fire they were pouring amongst his battalions; as well as when destruction and
                    ruin stared him in the face at Kunersdorf, where the men lay dead or dying
                    around him in sections, and the carnage appalled even his most, veteran
                    officers; he remained as collected and steady as at a review at Potsdam,
                    cheering and animating the troops by his voice and example, rallying them when
                    broken or driven back, and leading them back to the charge with a standard in
                    his hand. In a word, he was greater in defeat than in victory; and it is as
                    much, perhaps, to his personal conduct in the field, as to his superior tactics
                    and the natural bravery of his troops, that his principal successes are to be
                    ascribed.</p>
                <p>But Frederick was not continually engaged in war. He enjoyed many intervals of
                    tranquillity, many years of profound repose. Nor did he waste these in the
                    unworthy indulgence of luxurious ease or sensual gratification. On the contrary,
                    every moment of his time was spent in promoting the interests and the welfare of
                    his subjects. He occupied himself in adopting measures for promoting the
                    advancement of agriculture and manufactures, commerce, literature, and the arts;
                    he founded academies and seminaries of learning; he invited learned men from
                    every country in Europe to settle in his dominions; he cleared waste lands,
                    constructed canals, rebuilt and repaired the cities that had been dilapidated by
                    the enemy, rewarded men of merit in every department of enterprise; in a word,
                    he spared no labour or expense in promoting the internal improvement of his
                    kingdom. One of his chief objects was a reform in the courts of justice, and
                    this he effected, as far at least as regards the delay and expense of legal
                    proceedings, the great evils that obstruct or rather defeat the administration
                    of justice. Nor can it be doubted that the <hi rend="italic">Code
                    Frederick,</hi> published in 1746, and afterwards adopted throughout the
                    Prussian dominions, if regarded as the result of one reign and the wisdom of one
                    individual, is entitled to the hearty applause and commendation of every legal
                    reformer. But unfortunately the soldier was uppermost in everything. The learned
                    men whom he invited from other countries were treated by him rather as a
                    regiment of soldiers than a body of philosophers; and even in matters of taste
                    and literature he sought to introduce a sort of military regulation. The army
                    was naturally enough his favourite object of attention, and in seeking to
                    improve it he carried discipline amongst the troops to a degree of severity
                    unknown in Europe until his time, and which subsequent experience has rendered
                    it necessary to relax, or at. least to simplify greatly in its more oppressive
                    details. Nor, amidst all his avocations, did he lay aside his early attachment
                    to letters and to study. To this pursuit he, in times of peace, devoted a
                    portion of every day; and he is the author of various works which the influence
                    of his high rank and famè was not necessary to introduce to the notice of the
                    world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The principal
                    works of Frederick the Great are, 1. Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg; 2.

                    History of the Seven Years’ War. His poem on the Art of War, at first publish,
                    ed separately, was afterwards reprinted with other poems and epistles in a
                    volume entitled Miscellaneous Works of the Philosopher of Sans Souci.</p></note>
                    The foulest stain on his memory consists in first suggesting, and then
                    participating in, the dismemberment of Poland. Frederick planned the robbery,
                    the Russian monarch executed it, and then the leagued plunderers divided the
                    spoil between them.</p>
                <p>Frederick died in 1786, at the age of seventy-five, and was succeeded by his
                    nephew Frederick William II. This prince, on his accession, found the most
                    effectual securities for the preservation of his dominions; the finest army in
                    the world, a people enthusiastically loyal, and a treasury replenished with
                    seven millions sterling. Nor with these advantages was the new king wanting to
                    himself. The predilection of Frederick for the French language and French
                    literature was not grateful to his subjects. The new sovereign began his reign
                    with declaring in council, “Germans we are, and Germans I mean we*shall continue
                    ;” at the same time giving directions that their native language should resume
                    its natural rank and station, from which for nearly half a century it had been
                    degraded by the French. This was a very popular measure, and it was followed by
                    another still more so. Observing that he had marked with great concern the
                    progress of impiety and profaneness on the one hand, and that of blind
                    enthusiasm on the other, he declared that he would not have his subjects
                    corrupted either by fanatics or atheists, and strictly prohibited all
                    publications tending to excite a contempt for or indifference about
                    religion.</p>
                <p>On his accession to the throne, this pacific conduct upon the part of the new
                    king endeared him to his subjects, and commanded the approbation of all good
                    men. And an opportunity soon occurred in which he was thought to have: displayed
                    talents in negotiation and military arrangements, which rendered him in every
                    respect a worthy successor of his uncle. The states of Holland, which had long
                    been jealous of the power of the stadtholder, and inclined to a republican
                    government without any permanent chief, had gained such an ascendency in the
                    states-general, that in 1786 and 1787 they in effect divested the Prince of
                    Orange of all his prerogatives. They proceeded even to the seizure and
                    imprisonment of the princess, sister of the king of Prussia; and, depending upon
                    support from France, they treated with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541267"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1267-0684"/>insolence every power connected with them in
                    Europe. The court of Berlin did not witness these proceedings without
                    indignation; and the king formed a plan for restoring the power of the
                    stadtholder, with such secrecy and prudence, that perhaps nothing could surpass
                    it, except, indeed, the facility with which it was carried into execution. In
                    the short space of one month, the Duke of Brunswick led eighteen thousand
                    Prussians to Amsterdam, and restored the ancient prerogatives of the Prince of
                    Orange.</p>
                <p>The affairs of Prussia during the early period of the French revolution, and
                    especially the active but unsuccessful part which that monarch took against it,
                    are interwoven with the historical details of that period given in the articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> to which
                    the reader is therefore referred. Taking a just view of the true interests of
                    Prussia, he availed himself of the first favourable opportunity to withdraw from
                    the contest with republican France, in which the honour of his arms had suffered
                    abasement; and he died in the year 1797, when his son, Frederick William III.,
                    ascended the throne of Prussia.</p>
                <p>During the early part of this reign, nothing occurred deserving of commemoration.
                    Besides the most sedulous attention to the discipline of the army, which it was
                    his object to maintain in a state of perfect efficiency, the king occupied
                    himself in promoting the internal improvement of his states; and in this
                    judicious course of policy he persevered until the year 1806, when his own
                    rapacity and perfidy involved him in a war with France, which terminated in the
                    almost total extinction of his kingdom. Seeing the power of the French arms
                    rapidly increasing, and admonished by the stunning blow which the Austrians had
                    received at Austerlitz, he formed an alliance with Napoleon, and even shared in
                    the distribution of the spoil by invading Hanover, which he annexed to his
                    dominions, whilst he shut the northern ports of his kingdom against the British
                    flag. The result of this base proceeding may easily be anticipated. The British
                    minister immediately quitted Berlin, and this was soon followed by a declaration
                    of war on the part of his Britannic majesty. His situation now became
                    embarrassing and critical in the highest degree. Some time befor <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> e the battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon had ascertained,
                    by an intercepted correspondence, that the king of Prussia had been deeply
                    implicated in the counsels of his enemies, and that he fully intended, in the
                    event of the emperor sustaining a reverse in that campaign, to fall upon the
                    rear of the French army, and complete its destruction. But the unparalleled
                    victory of Austerlitz, which at one blow humbled Austria and staggered Russia,
                    rendered his position one of great difficulty and danger. His treachery had been
                    detected by a man who duly appreciated both its character and extent; and
                    henceforward his Prussian majesty found himself treated by Napoleon as little
                    better than a vassal prince, whose rights he disregarded, and whom he intended
                    to punish whenever he should have accomplished the more important enterprise of
                    thoroughly humbling Austria. The eyes of the king were further opened to the
                    precarious nature of his situation by the confederation of the Rhine, which was
                    now instituted, and afforded to France a secure basis of operations in any
                    attack which Napoleon might think proper to direct against Prussia. Had the
                    latter taken a decided part against France before the battle of Austerlitz, the
                    independence of Europe might have been preserved. But after this auspicious
                    moment had been allowed to pass unimproved, every chance of success was lost;
                    and the disasters which followed were no more than might have been foreseen by
                    any person of ordinary observation and sagacity.</p>
                <p>In crises of imminent peril, weak minds generally choose the part which most
                    certainly and directly leads to destruction. Early in October 1806, Prussia
                    declared war against France, and in less than a month thereafter the monarchy
                    had ceased to exist. Napoleon, having foreseen this step on the part of the
                    enemy, was fully prepared to meet it. By a most rapid and skilful march on the
                    Saale, he threw himself upon the communications of the Prussian army under the
                    Duke of Brunswick; and this decisive movement, one of the most masterly in the
                    whole history of war, led to the simultaneous battles of Iena and Auerstadt, in
                    which the Prussians lost twenty thousand men, including some twenty generals,
                    and the commander-in-chief, who was mortally wounded. This double conflict took
                    place on the 14th of October, a memorable day in the annals of the Prussian
                    monarchy; and with the rapidity of lightning Napoleon followed up the blow. The
                    Prussians having lost their communications, were obliged to retire on diverging
                    lines, which rendered mutual support impossible, and their destruction more
                    certain. They were pursued with incredible vivacity. Erfurt, Magdeburg, and
                    Stettin were reduced; and on the 27th of the same month, being only thirteen
                    days after the battle, Napoleon entered the capital at the head of his
                    victorious legions. In the mean time, the king of Prussia retired, first to
                    Custrin, and afterwards to Königsberg. The Russians had by this time come to his
                    aid, and on the 26th of December another dreadful battle took place at Pultusk,
                    where the allied armies were totally defeated. The French afterwards invaded
                    Silesia; took Stralsund, Colberg, and Dantzig; and carried with them victory and
                    conquest in every direction. And to such a state of distress was Frederick
                    William at length reduced, that, with all his dominions except East Prussia in
                    the hands of the enemy, the British envoy, Lord Hutchinson, on his arrival at
                    Memel in March 1807, found it necessary to advance eighty thousand pounds for
                    the support of his family and domestic household;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By this time peace had been re-established
                    between Great Britain and Prussia.</p></note> and this having been intimated to
                    the British ministers, his majesty recommended it to parliament to enable him to
                    fulfil the agreement entered into by our ambassador.</p>
                <p>The campaign of 1807 was in all respects glorious for the French arms. The mighty
                    battle of Friedland proved a conquest rather than a victory. By it the Russians
                    were completely defeated and humbled; whilst the king of Prussia, as the
                    consummation of his misfortunes, had the mortification to find himself at the
                    mercy of the conqueror, to be disposed of as the latter might think fit. The
                    Russians having retired beyond the Niemen, conferences took place at Tilsitt,
                    and were eventually followed by a treaty of peace, which left Frederick William
                    little more than a nominal sovereignty. By this disastrous arrangement the
                    Prussian monarch, who had formerly ceded to France the duchies of Cleves and
                    Berg, renounced the whole of his dominions situated between the Rhine and the
                    Elbe, part of Lusatia, the city of Dantzig, all the provinces which formerly
                    constituted part of Poland, and further agreed to shut his ports against the
                    trade and navigation of Great Britain; in a word, he gave up about ten thousand
                    square miles of territory, containing a population of about five millions of
                    souls, and had the additional humiliation of being forced to assist in carrying
                    out the continental system of Napoleon. Nor was this the utmost extent of his
                    abasement. He had to support the armies of France stationed in his territories,
                    to pay immense contributions to the French emperor, and not only to promulgate,
                    but enforce, in his provinces, every decree issued in Holland against the
                    commerce of this country. Frederick William, thus humbled and reduced,
                    endeavoured to submit with patience to his fate, and to alleviate the sufferings
                    of his subjects by effecting great reductions in his civil and military
                    establishments.</p>
                <p>This peace, which, as Napoleon fulfilled none of his engagements, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193541280" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1280-0685"/>could only be regarded as
                    nominal, continued nevertheless for six years, during which time all the
                    calamities attendant on foreign occupation by an exasperated conqueror were
                    accumulated on this kingdom. Hence the ardour with which the Prussians ran to
                    arms in 1813, their courage under the reverses at the outset of the campaign,
                    and their perseverance in its prosecution. They had been excited and prepared to
                    take arms, whenever the favourable moment for doing so should arrive, by means
                    of secret associations formed for the purpose, and more especially by the agency
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tugenbund,</hi> or Bond of Peace, whose ramifications
                    extended to every town and village in the kingdom. Nor was Frederick,
                    notwithstanding the thraldom under which he laboured, inattentive to the
                    discipline and improvement of his army, in which the military spirit had nearly
                    sunk under accumulated reverses. At one time the number of his troops was but
                    small, scarcely exceeding 20,000 men; yet, by successive enlistments, and
                    continually drilling levy after levy, so as not apparently to augment his force,
                    whilst he was in reality training to arms all the youth of the kingdom, he could
                    bring into the field, at the critical moment, more than 200,000
                    regularly-instructed soldiers. The French had indeed deprived the kingdom of
                    arms, which they carried off from the arsenals; but this loss was promptly
                    supplied by the assistance of Great Britain and other powers.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the disastrous termination of the Russian campaign proved the signal
                    for the desertion of Napoleon, first by Prussia, and afterwards by Austria. It
                    was now felt that his star had passed the culminating point, and already begun
                    to wane. General d’Yorck took the earliest opportunity to withdraw with the
                    Prussian contingent; a declaration of war followed; and Europe prepared to rise
                    in arms against the military despotism of Napoleon. In the campaigns of 1813 and
                    1814, the Prussian army, led by Blucher, Bulow, and other able officers,
                    distinguished itself in all the great battles, at Lutzen, Juterboch, Leipzig, in
                    the recovery of Silesia, and also in the plains of Champagne, where, though
                    several times defeated with great loss by the masterly combinations of Napoleon,
                    it displayed a noble perseverance, and fought with all the spirit of a truly
                    national army. Hostilities were for a short time suspended by the negotiations
                    which took place at Châtillon; but Napoleon having, from confidence in his own
                    genius, refused the terms offered, the allies decided to advance against the
                    heart of his power, and at Montmartre, where die Prussians again distinguished
                    themselves, the struggle ended, and was soon followed by the treaty of Paris.
                    The abdication of Napoleon was followed by his retirement to the island of Elba,
                    which had been assigned as the place of his exile. But early the following year
                    he returned to France, and by a march from Fréjus to Paris expelled the
                    Bourbons, at the same time reseating himself on the imperial throne. This
                    extraordinary conquest, which is perhaps without a parallel in history, produced
                    the campaign of 1815, in which the Prussians, it must be confessed, added
                    nothing to their laurels. On the 16th of June, their army was not only defeated
                    at Ligny, but so completely broken up, that out of more than 90,000 men of which
                    it consisted on the morning of the battle, not 30,000 ever afterwards
                    re-assembled. Yet this remnant having, by the united talents and energy of
                    Blucher and Bulow, eluded the corps of Grouchy at Wavre, and appeared on the
                    field of battle at Waterloo on the evening of the 18th, materially contributed
                    to render the victory there achieved by the British arms decisive of the fate of
                    Napoleon, France, and Europe.</p>
                <p>The immediate consequence of this mighty achievement was the settlement of the
                    different nations of Europe according to the views of the conquerors, and in the
                    circumstances in which they have ever since continued. The congress of Vienna
                    had the delicate and difficult task of as∙- signing acquisitions and boundaries
                    to the various powers which had been engaged in the struggle; and some strange
                    dislocations naturally resulted from this attempt to effect a general settlement
                    at the close of a war which had been productive of so great vicissitudes of
                    fortune. To Prussia were secured generally the restitution of the provinces
                    formerly wrested from her, excepting part of Poland, destined to be united with
                    the duchy of Warsaw, and ample indemnification for this partial sacrifice, in
                    Saxony and the Lower Rhine, by the addition of such territories as were deemed
                    consistent with the stability and security of the balance of power in Europe.
                    The acquisitions which Prussia thus made, through the grace and favour of the
                    congress of Vienna, were, from France, the Lower Rhine, and part of Juliers,
                    Cleves, and Berg; from Westphalia, Munster, and the remaining part of Juliers,
                    Cleves, and Berg; and from Saxony, Thuringia, Upper and Lower Lusatia, and
                    Menne-berg; large indemnities, it must be confessed, for parting with a portion
                    of territory originally acquired by robbery and spoliation. In this year also,
                    Prussia, partly by exchange, and partly by purchase, obtained from Denmark that
                    part of Western which is commonly called Swedish Pomerania, together with the
                    island of Rugen. And thus, after experiencing violent shocks and vicissitudes,
                    by which the kingdom had been broken in pieces, and little more than the name of
                    the monarchy saved from the wreck, we behold Prussia, after a series of
                    unparalleled changes in another direction, again raised from the condition of a
                    second-rate power, and taking her station amongst the first sovereign states of
                    Europe, as formidable as in the days of Frederick the Great, and with a
                    territory and population far exceeding any thing he could boast of.</p>
                <p>In fact, the settlement of 1815 invested Prussia with a degree of power which she
                    had never possessed before, and we need not wonder that it should have exercised
                    a marked influence on the general character and conduct of her government. In
                    the agony of the struggle against Napoleon, when a sudden freak of fortune, or
                    some bold stroke of his trancendent genius, might have disconcerted all the
                    schemes formed for his overthrow, everything was promised to the people, and
                    amongst the rest representative institutions. But, according to the morality of
                    kings, “vows made in pain are violent and void,” and hence impose no obligations
                    on royal consciences. So, at least, it happened in the case of Prussia, which,
                    so far from redeeming its pledge, has strenuously resisted every attempt made to
                    urge its fulfilment on the government, which, if not essentially hostile to
                    political liberty, might, from the general character of the people, have safely
                    granted them the boon that they so much desire. But the fact that such hostility
                    exists on the part of the government, is proved by the whole tenor and spirit of
                    its policy, external as well as internal. To say nothing of the circumstance,
                    that its closest political ties are with governments purely despotic,
                    particularly with Russia, no sooner did the demand for representative
                    institutions become general in Europe, and Spain, Naples, and Piedmont,
                    successively extort constitutions, than his majesty Frederick William III.
                    joined the Holy Alliance, and entered with eagerness into all the views by which
                    that confederacy was distinguished. Having repression for its object, it was
                    prepared to crush liberty, wherever it ventured to raise its ensign; to arrest
                    the progress of political improvement, and to employ military force to punish
                    all who were afflicted with any undue zeal in favour of a cause which freemen
                    are accustomed to consider as sacred. In time, however, the Holy Alliance, with
                    all its apparent power, yielded to the influence of events, and gradually
                    vanished as completely as if it had never existed and domineered over the
                    Continent. But the spirit still survives, at least in the Prussian government,
                    which, with all its ostentatious pretensions to a species of liberality, and
                    with the merit of having introduced some wise measures and use <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193541293" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1293-0686"/>ful improvements,
                    nevertheless carries despotism to a height which in this or in any other free
                    country would be intolerable. This, we think, is very evident from the conduct
                    which the Prussian cabinet has pursued in the formation of the German Commercial
                    League, a measure of decided hostility against the interests of this
                    country.</p>
                <p>The extent to which this confederacy has already (1839) been carried, will
                    astound those who have not been closely observant of the policy of Prussia
                    during the last twenty years. The Commercial League of Germany comprises the
                    vast territory included between the river Niemen and the Baltic at one
                    extremity, and the Alps and the Lake of Constance at the other. On the east it
                    is bounded by Russia, Poland, and Austria, and on the west by Belgium, Holland,
                    and France. It consists of the union of four kingdoms, one electorate, three
                    grand dukedoms, and more than twenty smaller states, the whole comprising 8654
                    German square miles, and 27,728,000 inhabitants, a population surpassing by
                    several millions that of Great Britain and Ireland, and nearly double that of
                    Spain. The dominions of the Commercial League comprehend the residences of
                    twenty-six sovereign princes, several of whom, however limited in domains,
                    exhibit a splendour approaching to that of the greatest empires. The army
                    consists of 246,168 soldiers in time of peace, and in the event of war may be
                    augmented to 550,000. The amount of the annual taxes paid by the population of
                    those provinces is nearly L. 17,000,000 sterling, by far the greatest part of
                    which is derived from the custom-house duties and the excise.</p>
                <p>Prussia created this league for the purpose of advancing her political projects,
                    the nature of which was manifested by her sovereign as early as the Congress of
                    Vienna. The enthusiastic efforts of the Prussian people having materially
                    contributed to the overthrow of the common enemy, their king founded on their
                    merit in this respect a pretension to unite under his dominion the greater part
                    of Germany. The whole kingdom of Saxony, all the country between the Weser and
                    the Elbe, the territory which formerly belonged to the Orange family, and that
                    which had formed the electorate of Mayence, were all claimed by the Prussian
                    monarch, as a reward for the sacrifices that had been made by his people.
                    Austria resisted, however, and her resistance proved successful. Prussia was
                    obliged to content herself with certain parcels of the principalities she
                    coveted, and which assorted ill with the rest of her dominions. The kingdom of
                    Prussia is, in fact, composed of incongruous and dislocated pieces. Her Saxon
                    and Westphalian provinces are separated from each other by the territories of
                    Hanover and Cassel, and the rest are interlaced by a number of small
                    principalities, which offer serious obstacles to the unity and efficiency of an
                    administrative system. Accordingly, the desire of finding an opportunity to
                    annihilate these principalities, and unite their territories with the Prussian
                    dominions, induced the court of Berlin to employ unscrupulous means, and resort
                    to dangerous expedients, in order to accomplish its object.</p>
                <p>These and other analogous intrigues, however, never interrupted the principal aim
                    of Prussia, which seems to have been that of becoming arbiter of Germany; and it
                    must be confessed that she has made a grand step in advance towards the
                    attainment of that object, by imposing upon the whole German nation her
                    commercial laws and institutions. The grand duke of Hesse-Darmstadt was the
                    first German prince who consented to enter into a commercial league with
                    Prussia. This was in the year 1825; and since that period Prussia has steadily
                    pursued her great scheme of a commercial union, with a degree of success which
                    has probably outrun ’ her most sanguine expectations.</p>
                <p>The acquisition of Hesse-Darmstadt served the Prussian government as a means of
                    transit to the southern provinces of Germany. There existed already a commercial
                    alliance between Bavaria and Wurtemberg, founded on just and equal terms, and
                    highly advantageous to both countries. Prussia, having succeeded with the
                    electorate, now endeavoured to prevail on both of these states to enter into the
                    league; but for a time all her efforts were baffled by the talents of the
                    Bavarian minister, Count Armansperg. The conferences, however, were carried on
                    during several years; and at length, in the year 1828, a commercial contract was
                    agreed to on both sides. This contract, however, did not stipulate the
                    establishment of a commercial union, though it facilitated the intercourse
                    between the southern and northern parts of Germany, by fair and moderate duties.
                    But Prussia never for an instant lost sight of her grand object; and having
                    effected the removal of Count Armansperg from the Bavarian ministry, her
                    conditions were at length accepted by both states, and the southern league,
                    consisting of Bavaria and Wurtemberg, entered into a complete commercial union
                    with the northern league, composed of Prussia and Hesse. The contract was
                    concluded in the beginning of 1832; and although the ruling power of Prussia was
                    not so explicitly acknowledged in the articles of the new contract as it had
                    been in that with Hesse, yet it was Prussia that dictated the laws of the union
                    in all essential points, and became the arbiter in all questions of
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>Bavaria and Wurtemberg being thus gained, it became an easy task to prevail upon
                    the remaining principalities. The kingdom of Saxony was the only one from which
                    resistance was anticipated. But the commercial union, being principally
                    calculated for obtaining an open market in Southern Germany, Saxony, which
                    abounds in manufactured products, profited by the opportunity to share in the
                    advantages which Prussia had prepared for herself; whilst the example of the
                    royal government was immediately followed by the smaller Saxon countries, and by
                    all those numerous states which are neither wealthy nor extensive enough to
                    maintain an independent commerce, and a system of internal industry. The free
                    city of Frankfort, however, was found much less tractable. Proud of its
                    republican constitution, and powerful by its wealth, it for a time maintained
                    its independence; but the struggle was too unequal to continue long between a
                    powerful confederacy and a small isolated state. By a mixture of intrigue and
                    violence, akin to that which had been exercised against the Polish commonwealth
                    of Cracow, the senate was at last obliged to yield, and consent to the union; at
                    the same time declaring, that its resolution was taken, not from any conviction
                    of its being beneficial to the republic of Frankfort, but in consequence of its
                    federative dependence, and the greatly superior strength of its antagonist.</p>
                <p>After the acquisition of Frankfort, the territory included in the league seemed
                    to be sufficiently compact; but it nevertheless wanted two additional states to
                    render it complete <hi rend="italic">(teres</hi><hi rend="italic">atque
                    rotundus),</hi> namely, the duchy of Baden in the south, and the territories of
                    Hanover, Brunswick, and Oldenburg, in the north. Both were equally important for
                    the full attainment of the objects contemplated by Prussia in securing the
                    command of the right bank of the Rhine, and also in furthering the schemes of
                    Russia respecting the navigation of the Baltic, and the exclusion of the British
                    mercantile navy from that sea.</p>
                <p>In the case of Baden, resistance, though strenuously offered, proved as
                    unsuccessful as in that of the free town of Frankfort, and of the smaller states
                    generally. The grand duchy was forced to enter the Prussian union; and Baden is
                    now an integral member of the league, notwithstanding the hatred of the people
                    against everything bearing the name of Prussia, or originating from that
                    country. With respect to Hanover and the northern principalities of Germany,
                    however, their position rendered it impossible for the Prussian cabinet to
                    proceed against them in a similar way. Hanover, Brunswick, and Oldenburg were
                    united with Hesse-Cassel<pb break="no" facs="nls:193541306"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1306-0687"/> in a separate league, and thus remained
                    independent of Prussian influence. Unable to surmount the difficulties opposed
                    to her schemes by the circumstance of the connection of Hanover with England,
                    Prussia now endeavoured to separate that kingdom from its commercial allies; and
                    succeeded as far as concerned the electorate of Hesse-Cassel, which, openly
                    violating the compact it had formed with its allies, withdrew from them, and
                    joined the Prussian union. This was one point gained; whilst the accession of
                    King Ernest to the throne of Hanover has excited hopes, we fear not altogether
                    groundless, of drawing him into the confederacy.</p>
                <p>At the same time it is but right to observe, that whatever may have been the
                    original views of Prussia in the formation of the union, the immediate results
                    deserve the acknowledgments of all Germany. Internal trade has received a new
                    impulse; the custom-house lines, which formerly separated the German states from
                    each other, have been abolished; and a great stimulus has been given to
                    manufacturing industry. From Aix-la-Chapelle on the confines of the Netherlands,
                    to Tilsitt on the borders of Russia, and from Stettin and Dantzig on the north
                    to Switzerland and Bohemia on the south, there is nothing to interrupt the
                    freedom of commerce: a commodity having once passed the frontier of the league,
                    may be conveyed without hindrance throughout its whole extent. But this internal
                    trade is governed and directed by a protector and ruler, namely, Prussia; and it
                    has for its main object to extend throughout Germany a monopoly of Prussian
                    manufactures, to the exclusion of all foreign competition. The same power also
                    profits by this union for obtaining a predominant influence in the political
                    affairs of Germany, and even endeavours to exercise this influence at the
                    expense of the independence of the smaller German states, and of those
                    constitutional rights which some of them have employed to the greatest advantage
                    in improving their internal condition. Freedom in trade and commerce throughout
                    the united German states is not alone sufficient. This is no doubt excellent in
                    itself, inasmuch as it is regarded by the inhabitants of Germany as a patriotic
                    institution, which strengthens the national union of their father-land, and
                    improves the social condition of its people. But it would have been more
                    consistent with sound commercial policy, and productive of greater advantage to
                    the majority of the German states, if such an union had been constructed on the
                    double basis of internal freedom, and the maintenance of an amicable intercourse
                    with foreign countries, instead of excluding the commerce and manufactures of
                    the latter from the German markets. As matters stand, however, the system of
                    exclusion introduced by, and essentially connected with, the commercial league,
                    has no other object than the establishment of a Prussian monopoly in Germany,
                    which it consequently deprives of all the benefit that might be obtained under a
                    more liberal and enlightened commercial policy.<note anchored="true"

                    good grounds of complaint against Britain, on account of her commercial policy
                    towards the German states. Prussia has only three great staple articles of
                    export, namely, corn, timber, and wool. In ordinary years we exclude the first
                    of these from our markets; and on Prussian timber we levy a duty of fifty-five
                    shillings a load, and admit Ameri can timber on payment of a duty of ten
                    shillings; whilst the government of Prussia has always expressed its willingness
                    to place its intercourse with foreign states on the basis of reciprocity.</p>
                <p>The Prussian government does not appear to understand thoroughly the important
                    maxim, <hi rend="italic">pas trop gouverner;</hi> at least, in its conduct
                    towards the Rhenish provinces, it has exhibited a busy, vexatious, intermeddling
                    spirit, productive of no good whatever to itself, and the occasion of much
                    discontent amongst the people. This tendency to interfere with details which are
                    beyond the natural competency of any government, or which, at all events, it
                    would be wiser to let alone, has displayed itself not only in accidental and
                    isolated acts, but in legislative enactments and solemn transactions. The
                    concessions which the French government had made in favour of the industry of
                    the Rhenish provinces whilst they formed part of the French empire, were
                    cancelled by a royal ordinance dated the 17th of September 1817; and this
                    proceeding, avowedly intended to advance the prosperity of the eastern provinces
                    at the expense of those on the Rhine, has since been followed by a series of
                    others, all calculated, not only to keep alive, but to embitter the irritation
                    which it first excited in the minds of the people. Nor has even the religion of
                    these provinces, though ostensibly acknowledged and protected by the state,
                    escaped the interference of the government, which, in attempting to regulate
                    everything, has involved itself in great difficulties, and gone far to alienate
                    the affections of the people. This is exemplified in the affair of the
                    Archbishop of Cologne, which, after forming for several years a principal
                    subject of its diplomacy, has at length terminated, as far as that prelate is
                    concerned, in his forcible expulsion from his diocese, and the virtual
                    abrogation of all ecclesiastical authority in the archiepiscopal province over
                    which he presided.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">We</hi> had intended to give a pretty full narrative of this
                    extraordinary occurrence; but considering that, in one sense at least, the
                    affair is not ended, the Prussian government having again opened negotiations
                    with the Court of Rome, we deem it the wisest course to abstain altogether from
                    attempting to give an exposition of a transaction which is still incomplete. It
                    is sufficient to say, that the Prussian government seems to feel its situation
                    to be anything but a comfortable one; and, if a judgment may be formed from the
                    notes addressed to the Cardinal Secretary, Lainbruschini, by its envoy, Bunsen,
                    since the expulsion of Baron Droste from the archiepiscopal see of Cologne by
                    military force, it would gladly retrace its steps, and fall back from the
                    aggressive position it has assumed, if it could do so without humiliation and
                    disgrace. By the last accounts, however, the sovereign pontiff, Gregory XVI.,
                    had refused to listen to any compromise. “Restore the archbishop to liberty,
                    replace him in the full exercise of his ecclesiastical functions, and then I
                    will hear you,” said Gregory, “but not till then.”</p></note></p>
                <p>STATISTICS.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Prussia is situated in the northern part of Germany. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Baltic Sea and a small portion of the duchy of Mecklenburg;
                    on the east by Russia, and its dependent kingdom, Poland; on the south-east by
                    Austria; on the south by the kingdom of Saxony and the Saxon duchies; on the
                    south-west by Bavaria and part of France; and on the west by France and the
                    kingdom of the Netherlands. In describing these boundaries, it is, however,
                    necessary to remark, that some parts of the kingdom are small detached portions
                    entirely insulated by the dominions of other powers, such as Neufchatel in
                    Switzerland, Suhl in Saxony, and Rahnis in Saxe-Weimar. The whole boundary by
                    land is in length 735 Prussian miles, equal to 3439 English miles. There is no
                    communication between the eastern and western provinces of Prussia without
                    passing through the dominions of other princes. Hanover, on the north, is
                    interposed between its eastern and western provinces; and in the southern parts
                    of it the territories of the sovereigns of Brunswick, Waldeck, Hesse-Cassel,
                    Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, Saxe-Weimar, and Saxe-Gotha, intercept the direct
                    communication.</p>

                <p>The population has increased very rapidly within the last twenty years. In 1819
                    there were, in 937 towns, 2,730,487 inhabitants. In 1831 the same towns

                    the towns in the province of Brandenburg was about 23 per cent., in the province
                    of Pomerania nearly 22 per cent., whilst in the province of Prussia it was only
                    about 13 per cent. The population of the whole kingdom from the year 1819 to the
                    year 1831 increased from 11,084,993 to 13,510,030, or about 21∣ths per cent.</p>
                <p>In 1829 there were in the whole kingdom, of marriages, 108,881; of births,

                    245,765; of deaths, males 187,650, females 176,164.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Prussia are of different races. The most numerous body are of
                    German origin, divided by language and customs into the High and Low Germans.
                    These, except in the province of Posen, form everywhere the great majority. The
                    Low German or <hi rend="italic">Platt Deutsche</hi> language is generally spoken
                    in the countries between the Rhine and the Elbe, on the north side of the Hartz
                    Mountains, and prevails along the Baltic through part of Bandenburg and
                    Pomerania. In Silesia, in the southern part of Saxony, in the trans-Rhenish
                    provinces, and in East Prussia, dialects, or rather differing idioms, of the
                    High German, are spoken, but all far removed from the pure language of Saxony,
                    or, as it is called, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Meissnichen

                    of the revocation of the edict of Nantes, are now much mixed with the German
                    inhabitants; but many of them have confused the two languages, and speak a kind
                    of German-French <hi rend="italic">patois.</hi> Amongst the higher classes in
                    every part of the kingdom the pure High German language is spoken, generally
                    with the peculiar idiom and pronunciation of Berlin; and that language is
                    universally used in books, in the churches, in the courts of law, and in the
                    more important transactions of commerce.</p>
                <p>There are about 10,400,000 Germans, Sclavonians, Poles, Lithuanians, &amp;c.
                    Those of Sclavonian origin amount to nearly two millions, and retain their
                    original language. The greater part of these are usually denominated Poles, and
                    are the inhabitants of parts of Posen, West Prussia, and Silesia. About 50,000
                    people in Lithuania have a peculiar language of their own. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wenden</hi> or Vandals have also a different language from all the other
                    subjects of Prussia. They are between two and three hundred thousand in number,
                    and are settled, a few in the province of Brandenburg, and the remainder in the
                    province of Pomerania, and the districts of Leignitz and Kassubon in East
                    Prussia. The Jews, according to the census of 1828, amounted to nearly 170,000
                    individuals; they are to be met with in every part of the Prussian territory,
                    but principally in the province of Posen.</p>
                <p>The established religion of Prussia is the Protestant, now denominated the
                    Evangelical Confession, comprehending Lutherans, Calvinists, Hernhutters or
                    Moravians, and Hussites. The professors of it amounted in 1828 to 7,738,664
                    individuals. They were formerly divided into two sects, the Lutheran and
                    Reformed, but are now united into one, and form a large majority in the circles
                    of Königsberg, Gumbinnen, Dantzig, Berlin, Potsdam, Frankfort, Stettin, Köslin,
                    Stralsund, Breslau, Reichenbach, Leignitz, Magdeburg, Merseburg, Erfurt, and
                    Minden. At the same period the Roman Catholics amounted to 4,816,813, and formed
                    the majority in the districts of Marie∏warden, Bromberg, Posen, Oppeln, Munster,
                    Arensberg, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Cleves, Coblentz, Nachen, and Treves. The United
                    Brethren, or Hernhutters, may be reckoned at between 10,000and 12,000 souls. The
                    Mennonites, a species of Anabaptists, amounted to 15,655; and the Jews, as
                    before stated, to about 170,000. The proportion of each religious denomination
                    was in 1825 calculated in the following manner: Supposing the whole population
                    of the Prussian kingdom to be unity, the various religious divisions are,
                    Evangelical Christians, 0∙6067; Roman Catholics, 0∙3795; Mennonites, 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 00l3; Jews, 0∙0125; or, in other words, in every

                    facs="nls:193541332" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1332-0689"/>13 Mennonites, 125 Jews.
                    These different sects are all equal in the eye of the law, have the same
                    protection for their worship, and arc all alike eligible to every civil,
                    judicial, and military office.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>According to an act passed in 1817, the Protestant clergy in
                    each province are regulated by a synod composed of all the superintendents,
                    headed by a president. They meet once or twice a year in a General Assembly, and
                    consult on the internal affairs of the churches belonging to the province. They
                    also superintend all schools, and take especial cognizance of the religious
                    instruction given in them. Their decisions are sent to the minister of the
                    interior, furnished with the approval of the consistory of the province. The
                    Roman Catholics are divided into two archbishoprics, the one of which
                    comprehends the eastern, the other the western provinces, nine dioceses, and
                    about 3200 parishes. Gnesen is the metropolitan see of the eastern, Cologne that
                    of the western districts. No archbishop or bishop can be elected without the
                    sanction of the king. The annual stipend of the archbishops is about L.i72θ
                    sterling, that of the bishops about L.1150 sterling, besides perquisites. Public
                    pilgrimages out of the country are entirely prohibited, and none allowed within
                    the state which extend to more than one day’s journey. Il is worthy of notice,
                    that in Silesia the number of Roman Catholics has diminished, and still
                    continues to diminish. Like the Society of Friends, the Mennonites are opposed
                    to the use of offensive arms. They are, therefore, by the act of 1815, exempted
                    from military service; but, to counterbalance this privilege, they are obliged
                    to contribute a sum amounting to about L∙720 a year towards the support of the
                    military academy at Culm. The Jews are acknowledged as Prussian subjects, and
                    enjoy the same rights and privileges with the Christians. They can fill any post
                    or office, and can hold real estates of all kinds, and follow all lawful
                    callings. They are of course obliged in return to contribute to the support of
                    the state, and are subjected to military service by conscription. They are,
                    however, not admitted as teachers in the public academies and universities,
                    owing to some impediments which arise in the discharge of these functions.
                    Apostacy from Christianity to Judaism is not tolerated.</p></note></p>
                <p>The different classes of inhabitants in Prussia may be divided into nobles,
                    landed proprietors, burgesses, with more or less extensive privileges, and
                    peasants. At the head of these the nobles are of two kinds practically, though
                    not legally. The high nobility are the princes, who were formerly petty
                    sovereigns on their own estates, but whose independence has merged in the
                    general government; they amount to about fifty families. The lower nobility,
                    consisting of about two hundred thousand individuals, have preferable claims to
                    certain offices in the army, the state, and the church; but their privileges
                    have been gradually contracting, and they are now in almost every point only
                    equal to the. burghers or citizens. Some of the Prussian nobles are the
                    descendants of the Teutonic knights, who renounced their monastic vows; but
                    other noble families came at a later period from the north of Germany. The
                    Prussian aristocracy is not a wealthy order; their estates are of little value;
                    it is supposed that the greatest income derived from the land of any one noble
                    does not exceed L.2500. The higher ranks of nobility, the princes, dukes,
                    counts, earls, viscounts, and some of the ancient barons, are not subjected to
                    military duty by conscription, and pay no personal taxes. The higher clergy,
                    namely, the bishops, abbots, provosts, &amp;c. have all these prerogatives, and
                    the same rank as the nobility. The burgesses are a numerous and respectable
                    class of inhabitants, but they differ according to their origin and the size of
                    their towns; the descendants of the German colonists being more enlightened than
                    those sprung from the Poles and the Wendes. Traces of the ancient freedom
                    enjoyed by the Hanseatic towns may still be observed in Memel, Königsberg,
                    Elbing, Dantzig, and Thorn. The burgesses of Dantzig are peculiarly
                    distinguished for their general intelligence, and their active and industrious
                    habits. The power of the guilds in the cities has been gradually diminished, and
                    they are now scarcely obstacles, as they were formerly here, and still are in
                    other parts of Germany, to the exercise of industry and ingenuity in any
                    profession which individuals may select for themselves. The largest class is
                    composed of the <hi rend="italic">baueren</hi> or peasants. They were formerly
                    slaves, and were usually sold, as in Russia, with the estates to which they were
                    attached; but their lot has been progressively ameliorated, and during the reign
                    of the present king the last vestiges of this barbarism have been totally
                    abolished. The final extinction of personal slavery was not decreed till
                    September 1811; and, from the military events which speedily succeeded, it was
                    not practically destroyed till several years afterwards. At present the
                    peasantry, who amount to two thirds of the whole population, are a species of
                    copyholders, with customary quitrents and herriots to the landowners; but they
                    may purchase land and become themselves proprietors, a benefit only recently
                    conferred upon them, and which those who are industrious and economical very
                    eagerly avail themselves of. The condition of the peasantry varies considerably
                    throughout the different provinces of which the Prussian monarchy is composed.
                    In some they are slothful, ignorant, and superstitious, whilst in others the
                    efforts of the Prussian administration to improve their moral and intellectual
                    condition have been attended with success. The peasants on the werders, and the
                    inhabitants of the new colonies, arc the wealthiest and most intelligent of the
                    peasantry. Their houses are not destitute of elegance, and their children are
                    well educated. The other extremity of the country is inhabited by Lithuanian
                    peasants, the descendants of the ancient Pruczi; they retain their native
                    dialect, and are still ignorant and slothful. The coarse cloth with which they
                    are clad is manufactured by themselves; and all of them wear a sort of scarf,
                    or, as it is called, a <hi rend="italic">margin,</hi> which appears to be the
                    same as the plaid of the Scottish Highlanders. The boots and the hats of the
                    women are nowise different from those of the men. “The German millers form
                    almost a distinct caste; the happy inhabitants of a romantic country, possessing
                    numerous flocks, abundantly provided with fish, poultry, and game, they make up
                    the class between the peasantry and the nobles, and neither associate with the
                    one nor the other, all of them intermarrying amongst themselves.”
                    (Malte-Brun.)</p>
                <p>In so extensive a territory as Prussia, there will necessarily be great
                    inequalities in soil, productions, and climate. The greater part of the country
                    is a sandy soil, generally very level, and often covered with heaths. The woods
                    of it are nearly one fourth of the whole surface, and only certain portions near
                    the rivers, or in particular situations, can be considered as fertile, or even
                    grateful soils. Many barren sandy plains are to be found, which are deemed to be
                    more expensive to bring into cultivation than could be repaid by their
                    productions. This is especially the case in the Churmark, in Lower Lusatia, and
                    in some of the Westphalian provinces, where large spaces are occupied by heaths,
                    such as the heaths of Minden, which extend over ten thousand acres, those of
                    Lippstadt, of twenty thousand, and the still larger ones oΓSenner andFuhling. In
                    EastPrus-sia there arc several very extensive morasses, which require draining
                    to render them productive. In the fruitful district of Magdeburg, the bog of the
                    Dromling covers more than a hundred thousand acres. A part of it indeed is in
                    the Hanoverian and a part of it in the Brunswick territory, which prevents the
                    necessary drains from being executed, which would make it one of the most
                    valuable tracts of land in that part of Germany.</p>
                <p>The most fruitful corn-land in the kingdom of Prussia is the vicinity of Tilsitt,
                    and some other districts of East Prussia, and the greater part of the duchy of
                    Posen. That province forms physically a part of Poland; the same plains, the
                    same kind of sand intermixed with clay and black loam, the same fertility in
                    corn, and the same sort of forests, may be observed in the two countries. But
                    many large marshes covered with weeds and brushwood are still undrained in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193541345" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1345-0690"/> the province,
                    particularly along the winding course of the Obra. In West Prussia, the district
                    of the Netz, the country around Marienburg, and that near Dantzig and Elbing,
                    are excellent corn countries. That part of Silesia which is on the cast of the
                    Oder forms a very large plain, slightly undulated by hills, and differs in no
                    respect from the plains in Poland. But in the western districts the land is more
                    unequal, and that portion of Silesia is bounded by high mountainous chains. This
                    province also contains several large and humid meadows and marshes. The land in
                    Brandenburg is low, and in general sandy. Its inclination is so inconsiderable,
                    that a great many marshes and small lakes are formed by the inundations of
                    rivers. In this province only some districts, such as the mark of Prignitz, and
                    the Ukermark, are celebrated for the quantity and quality of their grain; but
                    the country abounds in forests of fir, pine, oak, beech, and ash. In Pomerania
                    the soil is almost entirely formed by accessions from the sea, and alluvial
                    deposits from rivers and streams. A great part of the country is covered with
                    forests and extensive heaths, and it is only the banks <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the rivers and of the lakes that can be advantageously cultivated. The soil is
                    very favourable for all kinds of grain in the duchies of Saxony and Magdeburg,
                    in Thuringia, and in the principalities of Halberstadt and Quedlinburg. These
                    divisions, in favourable seasons, may he considered as the real granaries from
                    which the less fertile parts of Prussia draw their supplies of corn.</p>
                <p>The western parts of the Prussian dominions are far less productive than the
                    eastern. A few only of the Westphalian provinces are highly fruitful. The
                    districts most eminent for fertility are the vicinity of Minden and of
                    Paderborn, the borders of the Soester, and the circles of the Lieg and the
                    Wupper. In the Rhenish provinces, the neighbourhood of Juliers, Bonn, Cologne,
                    Coblentz, Kreusnaeh, Ba-charach, and the banks of the Meuse, are tolerably
                    fertile. The principality of Nenfehatel is very mountainous. Six or seven
                    valleys, some of which, such as those of Rutz and Travers, afford rich pasture,
                    make up the greater part of the land.</p>
                <p>The climate varies considerably in the different districts. It may generally be
                    described as temperate and healthy, though, from the great variety of
                    situations, there are many exceptions. On the borders of the Baltic the winters
                    are severely cold, and the weather changeable, raw, and foggy. The greatest
                    degree of cold in the last century was from the 2 J st to the 25th January 1795,
                    when Reaumur’s thermometer was at 24° below zero. The greatest heat of that
                    century was in the following summer, when the same thermometer was at 36° above
                    zero. The middle provinces of Posen, Brandenburg, Silesia, Saxony, and the whole
                    western parts of the monarchy, possess a more mild and less variable climate,
                    but very different in the several localities. The atmosphere of Brandenburg,
                    though mild, is humid, and subject to frequent variations in temperature; and
                    is, besides, often exposed to violent storms from the south and the east. On the
                    sandy plains of that province the heat is in the summer very oppressive, and the
                    air, from the abundance of stagnant water, frequently unhealthy, whilst in the
                    vicinity of the Hartz the cool mountain breezes are enjoyed. Silesia suffers
                    great disadvantages from snowy winters and rainy autumns. The air is in many
                    parts salubrious, but the southern districts, from the thick forests, and the
                    elevation of the soil, are exposed to long and severe winters. The climate is
                    milder in the northern part of the country; but the lakes and marshes infect the
                    air in several places, and render it unwholesome. The banks of the Rhine and
                    Moselle are covered with verdure before the inhabitants of Riesengebirge, and of
                    the Lithuanian heaths, have laid aside the fur pelisses of the winter.</p>
                <p>Few of the countries of Europe have been more favoured by nature than Prussia
                    with streams that contribute to for tility and intercourse; and the labour of
                    the inhabitants has been advantageously directed to several public works, which
                    have facilitated the communication between the different rivers. As the slope of
                    the whole Prussian dominions is towards the west and north, all the rivers that
                    rise in or pass through them empty themselves either into the Baltic Sea or the
                    German Ocean. The streams that merge in the first of these are the Niemen, which
                    rises in Lithuania, and becomes navigable at Sehmaleninken; about ten miles
                    below Tilsitt it divides into two branches, which, through the maritime lake of
                    Curisch-Haf, empty themselves into the sea. The German name of the Niemen is
                    derived from the town of Memel, which is built at the outlet of the same lake.
                    During its short course through the Prussian territory, the Niemen receives on
                    its right side the waters of the Sehesschappe, and on its left those of the
                    navigable river Jura. The river of the hills, the ancient Prussian Prigolla, the
                    modern Pregel, is composed of the united streams of the Pisa, Ranet, Russe,
                    Augerap, and Inster; after it assumes its name it receives the Deinenear,
                    Tappiau, and the Alle near Wehlau. It becomes navigable near Gottenburg, and,
                    passing Königsberg, discharges its streams by the Frisch-Haf into the Baltic.
                    The Vistula, the Polish Wisla, or the German Weichsel, rises in the Austrian
                    part of Silesia. It passes through Poland, where at Craeow it becomes navigable.
                    On its entrance into the Russian territories it divides into two branches, the
                    eastern of which takes the name of the Nogat, and joins the Baltic near Elbing;
                    the western is again subdivided into two arms, one of which is lost in the
                    Frisch-Haf, and the other reaches the sea near Dantzig. Its course after
                    entering Prussia is about 140 miles, and during its progress it is augmented by
                    the streams of the Ossa, the Brahe, and the Mottlau. Geographers have been led
                    to suppose, and not without probability, that the Vistula is not so deep as it
                    once was; it is certain that it may be forded in the vicinity of Thorn. The
                    Oder, which in the German dialect of Pomerania is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ader,</hi> and of which the ancient Wendo-Slavonie name is the Wiadro, a word
                    that signifies a <hi rend="italic">pitcher,</hi> has its source in the mountains
                    of Moravia, in the ancient circle of Olrnutz; but the Elsa, which rises from the
                    base of the Carpathians, is in reality the principal source. It becomes
                    navigable near Ratibor soon after entering the province of Silesia, and, after
                    passing through Brandenburg and Pomerania, divides into two branches, and enters
                    the great estuaries which communicate with the Baltic Sea through the three
                    mouths of Peene, Swine, and Divenou. Its course in the Prussian states is 370
                    miles; the general rate of its current is languid, forming in many places large
                    fens and turbid lakes; and it is prevented from overflowing by embankments. It
                    receives near Oderberg the waters of the Oppa, near Breslau those of the Ohlau,
                    near Grosglogau those of the Bartsch, near Neuzelle those of the Neisse, and at
                    Custrin those of the Wartha. This last is the most valuable of all the secondary
                    rivers of Prussia, because it affords the means of a communication between the
                    Oder and the Vistula. The rivers of Prussia which empty themselves into the
                    German Ocean are, the Elbe, which rises in the Riesengebirge, or Giant’s
                    Mountains, and is known at its source by the Slavonie name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labbe.</hi> It receives from the south of Bohemia the Moldawa or
                    the Bohemian Oritza, which, as it is deeper and broader than the Elbe, ought
                    perhaps to be considered as the principal river. It is navigable at Mühlberg,
                    where it enters Bohemia. It receives the Elster near Wittenberg, the Muldau near
                    Dessau, the Saale near Saalhorn, and the Havel near Werben; soon after which, in
                    its passage to the ocean, it quits the Prussian dominions. The Weser enters but
                    a small portion of the territory of the Prussian kingdom, though it forms the
                    boundary on the eastern side of the Westphalian provinces, from Holtzmin-den to
                    Carlshafen. The only part where both its banks <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193541358" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1358-0691"/>are in Prussia is near
                    Minden, where it has forced its way through the range of mountains, and formed
                    the celebrated passage well known to the ancients as the Porta Westpha- 1ica.
                    The Rhine enters the lately acquired provinces of Prussia at Bingen, a little
                    below Mentz, and quits thena at Kerkcrdom, above Nimeguen. From Bingen to the
                    country above Coblentz it is confined by mountains, and small islands and
                    headlands are formed by the rocks. It receives within the Prussian territories
                    the streams of the Nahe; the Lahn, that is concealed under mountains; the
                    Moselle, which, free from shallows and every incumbrance, resembles in its
                    meandering course a canal fashioned by the hand of man; the Ahr, the Erft, the
                    Ruhr, and the Lippe. The Ems, though it rises in the province of Westphalia, is
                    a small stream, not navigable till it enters the kingdom of Hanover.</p>
                <p>Most of the rivers of Prussia are so advantageously connected with each other by
                    means of navigable canals, that an uninterrupted communication is maintained by
                    them from Halle and Magdeburg to Elbing, and the surrounding districts have the
                    benefit of those facilities for exchanging their various productions. The
                    Frederieksgraben Canal, in East Prussia, is formed to avoid the dangerous
                    navigation of the Curisch-Haf, in the intercourse between Tilsitt and Memel. The
                    Bromberg Canal joins the Netze and the Brahe, and by their means the Oder and
                    the Vistula. It is the most expensive of all the Prussian canals, having within
                    eighteen miles ten locks. The commerce on it furnishes freight to about 600
                    barges annually, each of thirty tons burden, besides smaller boats. The Finnow
                    Canal, which unites the Oder and the Havel, is about twenty miles long, and has
                    on it about 4000 small, and from 1600 to 1700 large boats. The new Oder Canal
                    shortens the navigation of that river, and serves also for the purpose of
                    draining the meadows through which it passes. The Plauen Canal connects the
                    Havel with the Elbe, and is the channel of intercourse between Berlin and
                    Hamburg. The Friedrich-Wilhelm, or Mullros Canal, unites the Oder and the Spree.
                    Besides these, there arc others of less importance, as the Storkow, the
                    Werbellin, the Klodnitz, the Saxon, and the Munster Canals, all of which are of
                    local benefit; and the Rhine Canal, begun in 1S09.</p>
                <p>The lakes of Prussia, especially in the eastern portions of the kingdom, are
                    numerous and extensive. On the coast of the Baltic the two fresh-water lakes,
                    denominated the Curisch-Haf and Frisch-Haf, may be considered as the most
                    remarkable phenomena in the physical geography of Prussia. The former, which
                    received its name from the ancient Cures or Coures, who inhabited its banks, is
                    sixty-six miles in length, and varies from fifteen to thirty in breadth. It is
                    divided from the sea by a narrow stripe of land. The sand-banks and shallows on
                    this lake are so numerous that it is only navigable for boats, and they, too,
                    are exposed to frequent hurricanes. The Frisch-Haf, or fresh-water lake, is
                    about sixty miles in length, and from six to fifteen miles in breadth. It is
                    separated by a chain of sand-banks from the Baltic Sea, with which it
                    communicates by a strait called the Gatt. The Stettin-Haf is of nearly the same
                    extent. Besides the lakes on the shore, those in the interior of the country are
                    stated to exceed 1000, many of them from ten to twenty miles in length. In East
                    Prussia are 300, in West Prussia 160, and in the province of Brandenburg 680.
                    Many parts of these lakes have been contracted by embankments, and the soil
                    which they covered gradually appropriated to agricultural purposes. At present
                    they supply vast quantities of fish, the right to take which is in many
                    instances farmed at very high rates.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of the soil is the employment of three fourths of the inhabitants
                    of the Prussian dominions. The wants and the industry of the inhabitants, aided
                    by a rigid parsimony, directed and stimulated by a paternal though absolute
                    government, have changed, in the course of the last century, the most sterile
                    and unproductive kingdom of Europe into a territory which more than supplies the
                    demands of its own inhabitants, and leaves a surplus quantity of corn in most
                    years for exportation to other countries. In the three provinces which
                    communicate with the Baltic Sea, viz. East Prussia, West Prussia, and Pomerania,
                    it is calculated that four fifths of the inhabitants subsist wholly by producing
                    food. In these provinces, in the sense of the term as it is used in our country,
                    <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi> is still almost unknown. Almost every proprietor,
                    whether a large or a small one, cultivates his own land; and all the operations
                    of agriculture are performed in a slovenly and indolent manner. The general
                    course of cultivation is to fallow every third year, by ploughing three times if
                    intended for rye, and five times if for wheat, the land being allowed to rest
                    the whole of the year from one autumn to another. The extent of land sown with
                    wheat does not amount to one tenth of that on which rye is grown. After the
                    wheat or rye is harvested, oats or barley are sown in the succeeding spring.
                    This rotation completes the course, which is again succeeded by a whole year’s
                    fallow, so that the land only bears corn two years out of every three, and the
                    soil is so poor that the last crop is considered as a good one if it yields
                    three times the seed. The implements of husbandry correspond with the state of
                    agriculture and the nature of the soil. They are almost wholly formed of wood,
                    and are constructed in a very rude and clumsy manner.</p>
                <p>In the province of Brandenburg the soil is unproductive, but the husbandmen arc
                    industrious; and since the encouragement given to agriculture by Frederick the
                    Great, uncultivated lands have been covered with harvests, thick forests have
                    been changed into rich meadows, many unwholesome marshes have been drained, and,
                    in consequence, the land throughout the province has risen in value. The crops
                    in Silesia are inadequate for the numerous population, and a quantity of grain
                    is imported into the province from Poland and Austria.</p>
                <p>The principal grains of Prussia are wheat, rye, barley, and oats. The quantity of
                    rye far exceeds that of every other kind of corn; it forms the principal aliment
                    of the inhabitants, amongst whom wheat is seldom eaten in bread. Pease, both
                    white and gray, are extensively raised, and especially that description of them
                    known in England by the name of “Prussian blues.” Beans of all varieties are
                    cultivated in the soils on the borders of the rivers, which are suitable to
                    their growth. Buckwheat is much sown in some places, and forms an important part
                    of the sustenance of the labouring classes. An article for food is collected in
                    Prussia, especially in Brandenburg, from the seeds of the grass called <hi
                    rend="italic">festuca fluitans.</hi> It is manufactured into a substance called
                    <hi rend="italic">manna grits,</hi> and is far more agreeable to the taste,
                    though employed for the same purposes, than oat-meal with us. The cultivation of
                    potatoes has for many years past been gradually extending, and is become so
                    great as to supply almost the sole aliment of a very great proportion of the
                    labouring population.</p>

                <p>The most productive branch of rural economy next to corn is that of breeding and
                    fattening cattle. The practices in this branch are, however, of a very imperfect
                    kind; and though the different races, especially of cows, are to be found in
                    Prussia, yet so little attention has been paid, by crossing them, to obtain the
                    most perfect animals, that they are almost all very indifferent. The proportion
                    which the number of cattle of every description bears to the land is much too
                    small. It appears, from an official account published in 1819, that the stock of
                    cattle in the maritime provinces of Prussia at the end of that year was as
                    follows :— asses and colts, 556,839; oxen, cows, and calves, 1,171,434; sheep
                    and lambs, 2,049,801; swine, 617,310.</p>
                <p>According to the lowest estimate relative to the stock of cattle in England,
                    there are more than three times the number of horses, and upwards of four times
                    the number of oxen and sheep, in the same extent of land. The sheep generally
                    are bad, but of late years very great improvements have been made in their
                    fleeces by the introduction of the Merino and Paduan rams. It is supposed that
                    the sheep increased in the Prussian provinces betaveen the years 1819 and 1824
                    at the rate of twenty-five per cent, and that the finer sort of sheep have
                    increased in a still greater ratio. The fine-woolled sheep are now pretty
                    numerous, and supply the manufacturers with that raw material, which used
                    formerly to be furnished principally from Spain.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Silesia the flocks are shorn twice a year,
                    and the summer’s wool is considered as the most valuable. The number of sheep
                    throughout that province is upwards of two millions three hundred thousand, and
                    their annual produce varies from three millions five hundred thousand to four
                    millions of pounds.</p></note> The monied value of the live stock on the farms
                    is very low. The best flocks of Merino sheep, exclusive of the wool, do not
                    bring more than six shillings or six shillings and eightpence a head. Cows are
                    worth from thirty to sixty-five shillings, and the variation in their price is
                    much greater than in that of sheep. The races of horses are not good, though
                    great efforts have been made by the government to improve them; and
                    establishments of stallions, for gratuitous propagation, are fixed in several
                    parts of the kingdom. The breeding of swine is a very considerable employment,
                    and the hams, bacon, and sausages made from them form a large proportion of the
                    animal food of the inhabitants of the Prussian dominions.</p>
                <p>The great deficiency in the rural economy of Prussia, as in most parts of the
                    Continent, is the small portion of land appropriated to pasture. Hence the
                    number of cattle maintained is small in proportion to its extent; and the effect
                    of the deficiency of manure is to be found in the small increase upon the
                    different crops of grain. The average increase is stated to be six for one of
                    wheat, five and three quarters for one of barley, four for one of rye, and four
                    and a half for one of oats. The land of the kingdom is thus appropriated.</p>

                    the sites of cities, towns, and villages, or of so bad a soil as not to be
                    deemed worth cultivation.</p>
                <p>Besides articles for food, the soil of Prussia produces many for commerce. The
                    principal of these is flax, which is grown in every village, and almost by every
                    peasant. Besides what is used by the growers for their orvn domestic
                    manufactures, the quantity annually brought to market is very considerable. Two
                    thirds of this quantity is produced from Silesia alone. It is generally of a
                    good quality, with a fine and long fibre, especially when raised from foreign
                    seed. This change of seed is found so essential, that large quantities are
                    annually imported from Livonia and other Russian provinces; and the seed
                    preserved at home is mostly used for making oil and oil-cake, with the latter of
                    which the oxen are fattened. Thread is also made from felwort, a plant of which
                    the cultivation is rapidly increasing. Tobacco, madder, woad, sail our, and
                    hops, have been much grown, especially during the continental restrictions of
                    Napoleon; and though the opening of foreign commerce has greatly discouraged
                    their cultivation, they are still continued upon a small scale. Chicoium or
                    succory, as in other parts of Germany, is much used as a substitute for coffee;
                    and though the peace has reduced the price of the latter article, the succory
                    finds an extensive sale, and is still cultivated very largely in many districts.
                    It was in Prussia that the experiments of Margrave concerning the extraction of
                    sugar from beetrave were first put into practice upon a great scale; and works
                    were erected long before the process was generally known in France. And although
                    commercial transactions are now facilitated by the communications that have been
                    opened during peace, the making of sugar from beetrave has become an important
                    branch of industry in Prussia. The wine made in Prussia before the acquisition
                    of the Rhenish provinces was of a bad quality, and scarcely superior to vinegar;
                    but these territories yield wine of good flavour and great strength. The annual
                    quantity is calculated to vary from six to eight millions of gallons. Prussia,
                    like the rest of Germany, is well provided with alimentary vegetables of
                    excellent quality. The culture of cabbages, and the different sorts of turnips,
                    carrots, pease, and beans, has been carried to a great degree of perfection. The
                    silk raised in Silesia and some other districts is too inconsiderable to be of
                    much value; but the bombex or silk-worm succeeds well in the province of
                    Brandenburg, and the quantity of silk derived from it is very considerable. The
                    forests, amounting to nearly two sevenths of the whole country, furnish large
                    quantities of timber for building and for exportation; fuel, tar, pitch, rosin,
                    and potash, are more valuable, from the great facilities which the rivers and
                    canals afford to internal navigation, by which their products can be easily
                    conveyed to the borders of the sea. Game is rare or abundant, according as the
                    districts are well or ill wooded. The bear and the elk, the wild boar and the
                    stag, are frequently seen in the woods and the forests of Prussia proper; but
                    the elks and the wild oxen are very rare in the other provinces. The lynx is
                    sometimes seen on the mountains, where are also met the wild cat and the badger.
                    The wolf is now rare; and the fox, the marten, and the beaver, are not nearly so
                    common as they formerly were. The fish that abound in the rivers afford the
                    means of subsistence to many of the inhabitants. Some of them are of an
                    excellent quality, and there are several kinds in the Spree that are so much
                    prized as to form a lucrative branch of exportation. The salmon abounds most in
                    the Rhine; but it is by no means rare in the Elbe and the Weser. The sturgeon,
                    of which the length is sometimes from twelve to fourteen feet, the spams, the
                    glanis, that weighs from forty to fifty pounds, are often taken in the Oder, and
                    the finest trouts in the rivers that <hi rend="smallcaps">Aoav</hi> from the
                    Hartz and the Erzgebirge. The lamprey and the loach are not uncommon; and
                    numerous marshes or lakes abound with pike, murenae, and trouts.</p>
                <p>The mines of Prussia are by no means worked to the extent of which they are
                    capable. Every province possesses <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1384-0693"/>iron, which is prepared in forges and
                    blast-furnaces in their vicinity. They are principally worked with charcoal from
                    the neighbouring forests; but in some instances with fossil coal. Little or no
                    iron is exported, as it can be made cheaper in countries which have more easy
                    access to the ocean. The mines of rock-salt, and the salt springs, are
                    sufficiently worked to supply the consumption of their vicinity; but the
                    provinces in the Baltic Sea find it more advantageous to draw their supply from
                    the mines of Cheshire. Coals are found in Silesia and Saxony, Westphalia and
                    Brandenburg; but the mines are not extensively worked. From the unproductive
                    state of the gold-mines in Silesia, they were abandoned in 1798. The
                    silver-mines arc those of Tarnowitz and Rudelstadt in Silesia, and of Mansfeld
                    and Rothenburg in Saxony. In Tarnowitz there is an extensive and valuable
                    lead-mine, in which the silver is found. It is supposed that in ancient times
                    the mine yielded about fifteen or sixteen thousand quintals of lead, and between
                    three and four thousand marks of silver; and it has been affirmed that the
                    annual produce of the mine is at present greater. In Silesia there are found
                    also slate, mill-stones, marble, serpentine, porphyry, rock-crystal, jaspers,
                    carnelians, onyxes, agates, and a particular sort of chrysoprasus∙ The other
                    minerals of Prussia are copper, cobalt, calamine, arsenic, alum, vitriol, and
                    saltpetre; but they do not yield sufficient for the internal consumption. Amber
                    is almost an exclusive production of Prussia. It is found in mines, as well as
                    procured by the fishermen on the shores of the Baltic. Its value is at present
                    much less than it was in ancient times; but in some manufactories in Prussia
                    workmen are still employed in making from it small jewels, scented powder,
                    spirituous acid, and a fine oil that is used as a varnish. Part of the raw
                    material is exported by the Danes and Italians; but Turkey is the staple market
                    for the commodity. The quantity which is found in Prussia amounts annually to
                    more than two hundred tons, and the revenue which the crown derives from it is
                    equal to three or four thousand pounds.</p>
                <p>Prussia is a manufacturing country, though these branches of industry give
                    employment to a far less portion of its inhabitants than the cultivation of the
                    soil. The most natural and important manufacture is that of linen cloth, the raw
                    material of which, and all the articles that contribute to its perfecting, are
                    produced at home. It has long been established, and extensively spread. In
                    Silesia especially, the habit of spinning fine thread has given to the females a
                    delicacy of tact that is only excelled in some parts of the Netherlands. Besides
                    the common articles for personal and domestic usc, Prussia manufactures the
                    finest and most beautiful damask services for the table, which are generally
                    preferred to all others, in the higher circles, throughout nearly the whole of
                    Europe. Before the continental war, the produce of the linen from Silesia
                    amounted to L. 1,689,915 sterling, of which L.970,000 was destined for foreign
                    consumption. In the western provinces the linen cloth is principally made for
                    home consumption. Large quantities of linen goods were formerly exported to
                    Spain, and from Cadiz to the former Spanish colonies in South America; but that
                    trade was destroyed by the submission of the continent to the prohibitions
                    imposed by Napoleon, and has not since been recovered, as the markets are now
                    supplied by Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
                <p>The increase of Merino sheep has given a great stimulus to the fine woollen
                    manufactures, especially to those in the newly-acquired provinces on the French
                    frontiers, where some of the best superfine cloths that Europe can exhibit are
                    made. In the late department of the Roer, or, as it is now denominated, the
                    circle of Aachen, in the towns of Eupen, Aachen, Montjoic, Stolberg, and
                    Montmedy, fine cloths and cassimeres are manufactured, which are estimated to
                    amount to a million and a half sterling, and afford employment to upwards of
                    50,000 workmen, as well as to every kind of machinery that has been invented in
                    England or in any other country. The cloths for the dress of the middle and
                    lower classes are wholly made within the kingdom from their native wools. The
                    woollen manufactories throughout the kingdom, on an average from 1829 to 1831,
                    yielded annually about L∙4,525,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>Cotton goods have been made to a considerable extent. In some instances the yarn
                    is spun in foreign countries, and the weaving, bleaching, and dyeing only
                    executed in Prussia; and as the raw material, a foreign article, cannot be
                    procured so cheap as in England, this branch of industry has much diminished
                    since the general peace. During the period from 1829 to 1831, the cotton
                    manufactures produced to the state about L.4,250,000 sterling yearly, after
                    deducting the prime cost of the materials. The iron manufactures are more than
                    sufficient for the domestic consumption, and furnish to the value <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> about L.300,000 sterling for exportation. There are three
                    hundred paper-mills, which furnish the common kinds of paper in quantities
                    sufficient for the consumption of the country; but the finer sorts are supplied
                    either from Great Britain or from France. Silk goods, and mixed goods either of
                    silk and cotton or silk and woollen, are chiefly made in the capital, in which,
                    and in some other places, they give employment to about 20,000 looms. The
                    various kinds of leather are made from skins produced at home, as far as they
                    are found sufficient, and the deficiency is supplied from Buenos Ayres, through
                    the intervention of Britain or Spain. Copper and brass wares for all domestic
                    purposes are made, partly from the copper and calamine of their own mines, but
                    chiefly with copper furnished by other countries. The amount of these wares is
                    estimated at about L.200,000 sterling. Tobacco, snuff, sugar, soap, candles,
                    cabinet-ware, earthen-ware, porcelain, tin goods, and almost every article of
                    common consumption, are made within the kingdom. As no wine is made in the
                    eastern part of Prussia, the common beverage is either beer or brandy, distilled
                    from the native grains. The establishments for brewing and distilling are
                    consequently very numerous; but none of them approach in magnitude to the larger
                    concerns of a similar kind in England. The whole quantity of beer brewed is
                    between four and five million casks, of fifty gallons each. The consumption of
                    corn brandy is upwards of 8,000,000 gallons. In the larger cities the
                    letter-founders, printers, engravers, musical, optical, and mathematical
                    instrument makers, gold and silver smiths, jewellers, watchmakers, and other
                    similar artificers, are to be found as numerous and as skilful as in the other
                    countries on the Continent. With regard to the respective trades, Prussia
                    contains, on an yearly average, 328,317 mechanics, artisans, and craftmen, with
                    181,054 assistants. The number of printing-offices is 327, with 709 presses;
                    tile and brick manufactories, limekilns, glasshouses, tar manufactories, 5406;
                    iron, copper, and other smelts, 1932; watermills, 13,949, with 22,693 lets;
                    10,451 windmills, 1184 mills worked with horses, and 9422 oilmills;
                    fulling-machines, tan, saw, and paper-mills, looms for shawls, stockings, and
                    tissue of all sorts, 87,558; 5614 drivers of teams for the transportation of
                    goods by land, employing 11,994 horses; the licensed hotels, cook-shops,
                    taverns, wine and spirit retailers, amount in the whole country to 74,721.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Prussia with foreign nations is much less than the extent of the
                    country and the number of the inhabitants would lead us to expect. It is loaded
                    with many restrictions, which, however necessary they may be deemed in a fiscal
                    view, are vexatious and harassing. The commerce by land, by internal navigation,
                    is principally with Austria and Russia. From Austria she receives salt and wine,
                    and sends linen-yarn in exchange. From Russia she draws hemp, com, hides,
                    tallow, and some other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541397"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1397-0694"/>productions of the soil, and sends in return both
                    linen and woollen cloths. The provinces on the Rhine carry on very considerable
                    traffic in wine and manufactured goods with the adjoining provinces in the
                    kingdom of the Netherlands, and with several of the states of Germany.</p>
                <p>As Prussia possesses no seaports except on the Baltic, and as none of its
                    harbours enjoy good entrances, or are calculated to receive ships of a great
                    draught of water, there is very little commerce carried on beyond the limits of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the exports from Prussia are conveyed by foreign ships, of
                    which the British exceed in number those of all other nations together. Dantzig,
                    once a Hanse town, and the scat of extensive commerce, has much declined since
                    it has become subject to Prussia, notwithstanding its favourable situation for
                    exporting the productions raised on the banks of the Vistula and its tributary
                    streams. It still, however, exports corn, wood, potashes, linen, wool, wax,
                    honey, horse-hair, and feathers; and imports colonial wares and some few
                    manufactured goods. The vessels which entered the port of Dantzig during the
                    year 1835 amounted to 621, having a tonnage of 94,534; and those which cleared
                    out to 621, having a tonnage of 95,079. The imports by sea during the same year
                    amounted to L.495,909, and the exports to L.373,700. Königsberg exports corn,
                    but the vessels to be loaded with it can approach no nearer than to Pillau. The
                    number of vessels inwards during the year 1835 amounted to 246, and the tonnage
                    to 18,028; those outwards to 249, and the tonnage to 18,786. The imports during
                    the same year amounted to L.265,203, and the exports to L.275,642. Elbing has
                    lately increased by dividing the commerce with Dantzig, and the articles
                    imported and exported are of the same description as constitute the trade of
                    that city. Memel is the largest exporting city, and corn, ship-timber, and
                    masts, pot and pearl ashes, with flax-seed, are its chief commodities. Stettin
                    has the greatest portion of the import trade, as, from its position on the Oder,
                    it is best calculated to receive colonial produce, and forward it to the capital
                    and to the centre of the kingdom. It is also the port in which the greater part
                    of the vessels for the fisheries are equipped. The estimated value of its
                    exports in 1834 amounted to L.374,800, in 1835 to L.280,000; and that of its
                    imports in 1834 to L.714,050, and in 1835 to L.841,670. Stralsund, though it
                    possesses a good harbour, has but little trade, from being destitute of
                    water-communicqtion with the interior of the kingdom. The other ports of
                    Prussia, Colberg, Rugen-walde, Stolpe, Barth, Swinemunde, and Wolgast, carry on
                    some trade, and though not to a great extent, it is valuable, from being almost
                    exclusively conducted in national vessels. The whole exports of Prussia, both by
                    land and by sea, amount to about L.4,500,000 sterling, the whole of the imports
                    to about L.3,750,000; but in the latter is not included the products of their
                    own oil and herring fisheries. The duties on imported goods vary from ten to
                    twenty-five per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem,</hi> besides an additional
                    tax, never exceeding ten per cent., for the consumption of imported goods. With
                    very few exceptions, all exportations are duty free. For transit goods a certain
                    import and export duty is paid. According to the commercial treaty with Great
                    Britain, concluded 2d April 1824, a perfect reciprocity is established
                    respecting the duties levied on ships belonging to either country visiting the
                    ports of the other. Coasting is only permitted to ships belonging to
                    Prussia.</p>

                <p>The government of Prussia is an unlimited monarchy; for though in some of the
                    provinces, by ancient custom, the states still exist, they seldom assemble, and
                    only for such inferior purposes as regulating the debts or expenses of their
                    respective provinces. They have no legislative powers, and scarcely even the
                    right to make representations to the monarch. By the act of the 5th of June
                    1823, an assembly was instituted, composed of provincial members, to meet
                    alternately at Berlin, Königsberg, Dantzig, or Stettin. The qualifications for
                    membership are ten years’ possession of an estate, connection with one of the
                    Christian churches, to be thirty years of age, and to have a blameless
                    reputation. The electors must be twenty-four years of age, and no one can give
                    his vote by proxy. Tfie crown is hereditary in the oldest member of the royal
                    family, whether male or female. The monarch is of age when he arrives at his
                    eighteenth year. The natural guardian of the royal minor is the nearest and
                    oldest princely relation of the house. The king professes the evangelical
                    religion, but he may, if he chooses, follow the Roman Catholic faith. The sole
                    executive and legislative power is vested in him, and his authority is less
                    restrained by the ancient privileges and usages of his subjects than that of any
                    other European monarch. The administration is vested in a council· of state,
                    consisting of members of the royal family, and of the ministers of foreign
                    affairs, of the finances, of justice, of public instruction, of trade, of the
                    public debt, of police, and of war. The state chancellor is president of this
                    council, and to him all the heads of the different departments are accountable,
                    and make their weekly reports. He is uncontrollable by his colleagues, and
                    directed solely by the king. In the details of the administration, through all
                    the inferior departments there is much simplicity, and a degree of economy in
                    remunerating public services which scarcely finds a parallel under any other
                    government.</p>
                <p>The canton of Neufchatel enjoys peculiar privileges, and a form of government
                    altogether different from that by which the rest of the Prussian dominions is
                    regulated. It forms a part of the Swiss confederation; and though it
                    acknowledges the king of Prussia as its sovereign, his influence is very
                    inconsiderable. He receives only the revenue of some domains, and a very
                    moderate land-tax, which cannot be augmented. The inhabitants who choose the
                    military profession may enter into the service of any state not actually at war
                    with Prussia. Every profession and every trade are free, and no customs are
                    levied, and no duties imposed on any goods which enter or leave the
                    territory.</p>
                <p>The orders of knighthood established in Prussia are, the order of the black
                    eagle, founded 18th January 1701, by Frederick I.; the order of the red eagle,
                    founded 1734, by the Margrave Frederick Charles of Baireuth; the order <hi
                    rend="italic">pour le</hi><hi rend="italic">merite,</hi> founded 1740, by
                    Frederick II.; the royal Prussian new order of St John, founded 1812, in
                    commemoration of the ancient order of St John, dissolved 1811. During the war
                    with France in 1813 and 1815, the Iron Cross was given to those who either had
                    actually fought against the enemy, or else done some meritorious act, either
                    civil or military, during that period. The king also founded, in 1814, the order
                    of Louise for females who distinguished themselves in the cause of their country
                    during the war. There are, besides, various other marks of distinction given for
                    different degrees of military service. All orders are distributed by the king
                    alone.</p>
                <p>The revenues of Prussia are derived from taxes upon the land, upon persons, upon
                    patents, and licenses, which are denominated direct contributions; and from an
                    excise, or rather a custom-duty, on foreign productions. A small sum is derived
                    from stamped paper. In those provinces which were taken from the French empire,
                    the taxes on land, on trades, on doors and windows, as then established, are
                    still continued, and will remain till the whole of these provinces are brought
                    under the simple regulations established in the other dominions. More than one
                    fourth of the revenue of the monarchy is derived from the royal domains, and the
                    hereditary rights or royalties which are exercised over the mines, the
                    salt-springs, the game, the coinage, the posting, and the postage, with some
                    other branches. Though the higher branches of the administration appear to be
                    benefited by parsimony in the salaries, yet in the inferior departments it
                    appears to be injurious, as the petty officers, who are very numerous, are too
                    poor to refuse bribes; and they are not deterred by the apprehension of
                    dismission from offices whose fair emoluments scarcely equal the wages of a
                    day-labourer.</p>

                <p>Before the reign of the father of the present king, Prussia had no public debt
                    whatever, but usually a sufficient accumulation of money to meet any emergency
                    that might occur. The present king, by economy and regularity, had reduced the
                    debt which his predecessor had incurred, when the rupture with Napoleon in 1806
                    drew forth all his resources, and until the year 1815 the debt continued to
                    increase. Since the restoration of general peace, due measures have been taken
                    for the reduction of it. On the 12th of January 1833 it amounted to
                    L.25,678,365, including a loan of L.6,000,000 from British subjects, and the
                    debts assumed upon the cessions of territory from Sweden, Denmark, and Saxony.
                    Besides this national debt, many of the corporate bodies have borrowed
                    considerable sums, which were presented to the government in the most critical
                    periods, and which are in the progress of being liquidated from their own
                    incomes.</p>
                <p>The expenditure of the government is upon a very low scale. No court can be less
                    expensive than that of Berlin, and no monarch can be less attentive to his
                    personal gratifications than the present king, who, like his predecessor,
                    Frederick II., appropriates but a small portion of his patrimonial income to his
                    private purposes, devoting it principally to the service of the state. The
                    average annual expenditure from 1829 to 1837 inclusive was as follows:</p>

                <p>The regular ranks are filled by a conscription, which compels every young man, as
                    he arrives at twenty years of age, to serve for a limited period. If the
                    conscript can purchase his arms and accoutrements, and pay a small sum, he may
                    at the end of one year pass into the landwehr, which is composed of this class
                    of men, and of all others between twenty-five and forty years of age. In time of
                    peace the landwehr is exercised but one day in the year, but in war it becomes a
                    disposable force, and is marched wherever its services may be deemed necessary.
                    The other militia force, the landsturm, is composed of all males capable of
                    bearing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541436" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1436-0697"/>arms,
                    above forty years of age. This force is only called out in periods of great
                    emergency, and then its duty is entirely domestic, being confined to guarding
                    prisoners and maintaining internal tranquillity. But it is unnecessary to
                    enlarge on this subject, as it is pretty fully treated of in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Army,</hi> to which the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>Soldiers who are maimed or severely wounded are admitted either into the
                    hospitals at Berlin, Stolpe, &amp;c. or into one of the twenty-four invalid
                    companies, and receive board, lodging, clothes, and necessary medical
                    attendance. Those who are less severely wounded, or who in consequence of their
                    military service are incapable of entirely earning their livelihood, receive
                    pensions proportioned to circumstances.</p>
                <p>To the military establishment belong the institution for the education of the
                    children of soldiers in Stralsund and Annaburg, and the Military Orphan Hospital
                    in Potsdam, where the orphans of soldiers are maintained and educated.</p>
                <p>The principal fortresses in the kingdom are, in the province of Prussia, Dantzig,
                    with Weichselmunde, Grau-dentz, Pillau, and Thorn; in Pomerania, Colberg and
                    Stettin; in Brandenburg, Kustrin and Spandau; in Silesia, Glutz, Glogau, Kosel,
                    Neize, Schweidnitz, and Silberberg; in Saxony, Magdeburg, Wittenberg, Torgau,
                    and Erfurt; in Westphalia, Minden; in the province of the Rhine, Wesel, Cologne,
                    Gulick, Saarlouis, and Ehrenbreitstein, with Coblentz.</p>
                <p>Prussia enjoys a peculiar code of laws, founded by Frederick the Great upon the
                    ancient customs and usages of the people, and finally reduced to a more regular
                    system in 1794. The magistracy in the rural districts is still a patrimonial
                    right, vested in owners of particular estates; but the power formerly possessed
                    by them has been contracted within narrower limits than formerly. The decision
                    of these lower courts is not final, except in very trifling cases; and an appeal
                    may be made to the tribunals of the second instance, which are established in
                    the several provinces, and to whom is attached the superintendence of the
                    colleges for imparting legal knowledge to pupils. To these tribunals of the
                    second instance, or <hi rend="italic">Oberlandesgerichten,</hi> is intrusted the
                    duty of promulgating the laws, of watching over the interests of lunatics and
                    minors, as well as of deciding processes. They are usually divided into two
                    portions, one of which attends to the appeals from the inferior courts, and the
                    other pronounces sentence on such civil and criminal cases as originate in them.
                    From all the Oberlandesgerichten appeals may be brought before the High College
                    of Justice in Berlin, whose decisions are final. The Prussian system of law is
                    more simplified than most of those of feudal origin, and in its practice it is
                    expeditious, economical, and uniform. The police is under separate
                    jurisdictions; and in the country the <hi rend="italic">landraths</hi> resemble
                    in some measure our petty sessions of justices of the peace. In the cities there
                    are peculiar boards appointed, under whose direction the regulation of
                    buildings, sewers, and the supplies of water and of food, are placed. The police
                    has the superintendence of the examination of those who are licensed to practise
                    the medical profession, of the insurance offices against losses by fire, and of
                    the engines and other implements to prevent fire from extending. To this is
                    added the keeping a watchful eye on all individuals who have no visible means of
                    subsistence. In all the cities the police is mildly and regularly administered,
                    with more attention to the prevention than the punishment of crimes.</p>
                <p>As to the amount of crime, it varies considerably in the different provinces. It
                    appears from the returns, that crimes are most rare in the Protestant districts,
                    and most common in those where the numerous festivals and holidays of the Roman
                    Catholic Church are observed. It is certain, besides, that the most industrious
                    countries are those in which there are fewest Romanists. In the territories of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle one individual out of every 60,000 inhabitants has been found
                    guilty of murder; in the province of Saxony and the country of Munster, one out
                    of every 35,000; in the district of Marienwerder, one out of every 25,000; in
                    Pomerania, one out of every 4760; in the towns of Cologne, Munster, Dusseldorf,
                    and Aix-la-Chapelle, one out of every 400. As to the number of thefts and
                    robberies, there is in Pomerania one for every 6432 inhabitants; in Western
                    Prussia, Silesia, or Eastern Prussia, one for every 3000; in the neighbourhood
                    of Coblentz and Treves, one for every 800; in Cologne, Dusseldorf, Munster, and
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, one for every 400.</p>
                <p>Few of the nations of Europe have, within the last two centuries, exceeded
                    Prussia in the number and eminence of its men of learning, or in the variety and
                    excellence of its establishments for the promotion of science and literature. In
                    no other country is the instruction of the lower classes so sedulously provided
                    for, and in none are there so few persons who are ignorant of the first
                    rudiments of knowledge. In Prussia, as in other countries, public instruction
                    long formed a part of the business of the minister of the interior; but in 1819
                    a special department of administration was devoted to this object. The minister
                    of public instruction enjoys a rank and authority equal to those of any of his
                    colleagues. Under him is a numerous council, divided into three sections; one
                    for church affairs, composed of a certain number of councillors, chiefly
                    ecclesiastics, with a director at their head; another for public instruction,
                    also composed of a certain number of councillors, almost all laymen, with a
                    director; and a section for medicine, with its councillors and director. All the
                    members of this council receive salaries from the state. The same individual may
                    belong to two sections, but he can in no case receive more than the salary of
                    one. In each of the ten provinces into which Prussia is divided, under the
                    direction of the supreme president of the province, is an institution called the
                    Provincial Consistory, which is connected with and dependent upon the ministry
                    of public instruction, and having its internal organization formed upon the same
                    model. All the members are nominated directly by the minister of public
                    instruction, and they are remunerated for their labours. Their duty is more
                    peculiarly to superintend the secondary instruction, the gymnasia, and higher
                    burgher schools. Every <hi rend="italic">gemeinde</hi> (parish) must by the law
                    of the land have a school; and the pastor or curate is, in virtue of his office,
                    the inspector of this school, associated with whom is a committee composed of
                    some of the most considerable persons of the parish. In the urban parishes the
                    magistrates form a higher committee or board, which presides over all these
                    schools with their several committees, and arranges them into one harmonious
                    system. There is, moreover, in the chief town of the circle another inspector,
                    whose authority extends to all the schools of that circle, and who corresponds
                    with the local inspectors and committees. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >regierung</hi> (regency) of every department there is a special councillor for
                    the primary schools, called <hi rend="italic">schulrath</hi> (school
                    councillor), who acts as a link between the public instruction and the ordinary
                    civil administration of the province. He inspects the schools, quickens and
                    keeps alive the zeal of the school-inspectors, school-committees, and the
                    schoolmasters. He conducts the correspondence relative to schools in the name of
                    the regency, with the local and superior inspectors, as well as with the
                    provincial consistories and the minister of public instruction. Like all his
                    colleagues, he is a paid officer.</p>
                <p>In Prussia the state imposes on all parents the strict obligation of sending
                    their children to school, unless they can prove that they are giving them a
                    competent education at home. Children must remain at school from their seventh
                    to their fourteenth year inclusive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Five is the age fixed by the fundamental law, but seven is

                    parents or guardians to punishment by fine or imprisonment. The hours of lessons
                    in the elementary schools are arranged in such a manner as to facilitate to
                    parents the execution of this law, and at the same time not to deprive them
                    entirely of the assistance which their children might afford them in their
                    labours; and care is everywhere taken to furnish necessitous parents with the
                    means of sending their children to school, by providing them with the things
                    necessary for their instruction, or with such clothes as they stand in need of.
                    Every parish, however small, is bound to have an elementary school,
                    accomplishing at least the most indispensable part of the scheme of instruction
                    prescribed by law; and every town is bound to have at least one burgher school
                    or more, according to its population. Iu certain cases where a parish is
                    absolutely unable to furnish the means of an elementary school of itself,
                    several villages may unite together into one school association. The law
                    provides also a suitable income for teachers, and certain provision for them
                    when they are past service, a suitable building for the purposes of teaching and
                    of exercise, furniture, books, &amp;c. and pecuniary assistance for the
                    necessitous scholars. The gymnasia, and other establishments of a similar kind,
                    are principally supported by the general funds of the state, or of the province;
                    but the inferior schools in towns and villages are supported by the towns, and
                    by the school associations in the country. If, however, a town is unable out of
                    its own resources to support the lower grade of instruction of which it stands
                    in need, aid is given to it from the school funds of the department to which it
                    belongs. The necessary funds are provided by an assessment levied on all the
                    householders in the parish.</p>
                <p>Every complete elementary school comprehends the following objects:—Religious
                    instruction; the German language; the elements of geometry, together with the
                    general principles of drawing; calculation and practical arithmetic, the
                    elements of physics, geography, general history, and especially the history of
                    Prussia; singing, writing, and gymnastic exercises; the simplest manual labours,
                    and some instruction in husbandry. The instructions in religion, reading,
                    writing, arithmetic, and singing, are indispensable in every school; and no
                    school is considered as complete unless it fulfil the whole scheme of
                    instruction just marked out. Next to the village are the burgher schools, where,
                    in addition to the branches taught in the elementary schools, the pupils are
                    instructed in Latin, and prepared for admission into institutions called
                    gymnasia, similar to our grammar schools of Winchester, Eton, Westminster, and
                    Edinburgh. In these institutions classical learning is pursued to a great
                    extent, as preparatory to admission into the universities; some of them are
                    under the direction of the Protestants, others under that of the Catholics, and
                    some few under a combined direction of both sects. They have, according to their
                    extent, from four to twelve masters; and the pupils are divided into five or six
                    classes, the lower of which differ but little in their instructions from the
                    burgher schools. In the larger and middle-sized cities schools are established
                    for the instruction of the females, with which, in Silesia, are combined,
                    amongst those of the lower class, the teaching the delicate art of
                    lace-making.</p>
                <p>The religious instruction given in the Prussian schools is always adapted to the
                    doctrines of the church to which the school belongs. The children of a different
                    persuasion, however, are subjected to no kind of annoyance or constraint on
                    account of their particular creed. No attempt is made to proselytise them; and
                    they are not obliged, against the will of their parents, or their own, to attend
                    the religious instruction or exercises of the school, but private masters of
                    their own creed are charged with their religious education. Every scholar of an
                    elementary school must, when he leaves it, receive a certificate as to his
                    capacity, and his moral and religious dispositions, signed by the masters and
                    the school-committee. These certificates are always presented to the clergyman
                    before admission to the communion, to master-manufacturers or artisans on being
                    bound apprentices, or to housekeepers on entering service.</p>
                <p>In order to provide schools with proper masters, primary normal schools have been
                    instituted, in which those intended for the office of teachers receive
                    instruction in the appropriate branches of education, and especially in the
                    theory and practice of teaching. Pecuniary assistance is also given to a certain
                    fixed number of poor scholars of good promise. The expenses of these
                    establishments are defrayed partly by the general funds of the state, and partly
                    by the departmental funds for schools. The age of admission is from sixteen to
                    eighteen years, and the course of study extends to three years; and during that
                    time no pupil is called out to active service in the army. Any person of mature
                    age and irreproachable character may be appointed to the office of schoolmaster,
                    if he is found, on examination, to possess the necessary qualifications; but
                    preference is given to the pupils of the primary normal schools. The election of
                    the schoolmasters for country schools is vested in the committee of
                    superintendence; for town schools supported by a public rate, in the municipal
                    authorities; but in all schools in towns founded by the king, the election to
                    masterships is conducted by the provincial consistories. The election must,
                    however, be ratified by royal authority before the teacher can be installed in
                    his office, or be entitled to its revenues. Able and diligent schoolmasters are
                    encouraged by promotion to places of a higher class, and even, on particular
                    occasions, by extraordinary rewards; neglect of duty, and other offences, are
                    punished by reprimands, fines, and deprivation of employment. Public schools are
                    the basis of popular instruction in Prussia, but private schools are not
                    prohibited. Those, however, who wish to establish schools for private education
                    must undergo an examination, and receive a license from the provincial
                    consis-tory; and the establishment is placed under the special supervision of
                    one of the members of the school-committee of the town or district in which it
                    is situated.</p>
                <p>In 1831 it was estimated that, in Prussia, the children of from one day to
                    fourteén years old amounted to 4,767,072. It is a rule in statistics, that out
                    of a hundred children, those between seven and fourteen form three sevenths,
                    which gives out of every hundred, forty-three of an age to go to school (or, to
                    give theminutest fractions, 42,857 in 100,000), and consequently in Prussia
                    2,043,030. Now it has been found, according to the accurate calculation of the
                    attendance lists, that the actual number of children who attended the public
                    primary schools in the year 1831 was 2,021,421, exhibiting the slight difference
                    of only 21,609 between the real and the normal number. And even this will
                    vanish, if we consider that these calculations are founded only on the public
                    primary schools, and do not include the private ones; and that no account is
                    taken of the children educated at home, nor of the boys belonging to the lower
                    classes of the gymnasia. Taking these circumstances into account, it is evident
                    that the number of children under fourteen who receive in one way or another the
                    benefits of education, is not only equal to three sevenths of the population,
                    but that it must actually exceed that number; a circumstance which can be
                    explained only by the fact, that in the most civilized provinces of Prussia the
                    taste for instruction is so generally diffused, that parents anticipate the age
                    fixed by law for sending their children to school. The following statement will
                    show the relative proportion in each province, of the total number of children
                    attending public schools:</p>
                <p>At the end of the year 1831, in every 100,000 children, the number who attended
                    public schools was, in the province of Saxony, 54,515; in that of Westphalia,
                    47,386; in that of Brandenburg, 45,814; in that of Silesia, 45,042; in that of
                    the Rhine, 41,002; in that of Pomerania, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541462"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-1462-0699"/>40,775; in that of Prussia, 39,651; and in that of
                    Posen, ' 22,283. The difference in the proportion of boys and of girls is
                    inconsiderable. Out of 2,021,421 children attending school, there were, in 1831,
                    1,044,364 boys, or 43,694 in 100,000; and 977,057 girls, or 41,106 in 100,000.
                    The total number of primary public schools was 22,612; of these, 21,789 are
                    elementary and 823 middle schools, of which 481 are for boys and 342 for girls.
                    The elementary schools are attended by 987,475 boys and by 930,459 girls, and
                    the middle schools by 56,889 boys and by 46,598 girls. For the 22,612 public
                    schools there are in all 27,749 masters and mistresses, who are distributéd as
                    follows, viz. 21,789 elementary schools, with 22,211 regular masters, 694
                    regular mistresses, and 2014 assistant masters and mistresses; 481 middle or
                    burgher schools for boys, with 1172 regular masters and 360 assistant masters;
                    342 middle or burgher schools for girls, with 633 regular masters, 289 regular
                    mistresses, and 471 assistant masters and mistresses.</p>
                <p>In the year 1831 there were in Prussia thirty-three great primary normal schools,
                    each of which contained from forty to 100 pupils; their total expenditure was
                    L.16,583, and the grants from the state amounted to L∙13,260. Besides these,
                    there are a considerable number of small normal schools. The annual sum paid by
                    the public treasury for the elementary and the burgher schools throughout
                    Prussia amounted in 1831 to L.34,520.</p>
                <p>As primary instruction belongs chiefly to the department and the parish, and
                    secondary instruction to the provinces, so the universities are under the
                    exclusive care of the state, and, like the universities in the other parts of
                    Germany, are either endowed, or the expenses of the professors and the libraries
                    are defrayed by the government. The course of study is left much to the choice
                    of the students, and is therefore too much influenced by the temporary
                    popularity of particular professors. The means of instruction in every branch of
                    science and literature arc abundantly furnished; and, in spite of the want of
                    discipline which generally prevails, the foundation is laid in them of those
                    eminent acquirements in which the students have afterwards distinguished
                    themselves in the various walks of science and literature. The principal
                    universities arc those of Berlin, Breslau, Halle, Bonn, Königsberg, Munster, and
                    Greifswald.</p>

                <p>There arc also, unconnected with the universities, theological academies for the
                    Catholics, Lutherans, and Moravians, where they receive the instruction
                    necessary to qualify them for the duties of their functions. Besides these,
                    there are useful establishments for pupils in medicine, surgery, midwifery, the
                    veterinary and military professions, rural economy, and for teaching the deaf
                    and dumb, and the blind.</p>
                <p>The collections of natural history, the philosophical and astronomical apparatus,
                    and the public libraries, are upon a very liberal footing, and at the service of
                    any individual who wishes to avail himself of their assistance. The libraries of
                    Berlin thus open to general use contain more than 300,000 volumes, those of
                    Breslau more than 100,000, that of Halle more than 50,000, and in the other
                    cities large collections are generally to be found.</p>
                <p>The freedom of the press has of late been somewhat restrained, particularly as
                    relates to fugitive and periodical publications of the smaller class. All books
                    must undergo censorship previous to publication; but works of science are
                    allowed to pass with scarcely any inspection, and there is no restriction on
                    bringing into Prussia any works published in any of the other states of Germany.
                    The universities have an unlimited right of printing without a previous
                    inspection. In the year 1819 the newspapers were, sixty-two government weekly
                    papers, which contained little but domestic intelligence and advertisements;
                    fifteen political papers written by individuals, but with much reserve; and one
                    literary journal.</p>
                <p>A savings bank was established in Berlin in 1818. It allows four and a half per
                    cent, on every deposit from a crown upwards. Its capital has increased rapidly,
                    and in 1824 amounted to 685,742 crowns.</p>
                <p>The practice of insuring against fire has now become very general, and the
                    property insured in the province of Brandenburg alone in 1824 amounted to
                    37,854,875 crowns.</p>
                <p>The currency of Prussia consists of metallic and paper money, but the former is
                    so much greater in amount, that the latter suffers no depreciation. The metallic
                    money is estimated to amount to 30,000,000 reichs-thalern. The paper money,
                    including that issued by a privileged company, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193541488" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1488-0701"/>does not amount to more than
                    5,000,000, and, by means of a sinking fund, is gradually diminishing, and will
                    soon be extinct. The money is coined in Berlin, Breslau, and Dusseldorf. The
                    gold coins are double, single, and half Frederick William d’ors, valued at 10
                    d., 5 d. and 2½ d. reichs-thalern. The silver coins are the thaler, the half
                    thaler, and the third, sixth, and twelfth of the thaler. The copper and mixed
                    metal coins are groschen, sechser, drier, and pfenninge. In the old provinces
                    accounts are kept in dollars (thalern), groschen, and pfenningen. Twelve
                    pfenningen make a grosch, and twenty-four groschen a dollar. The value of the
                    dollar in exchange with London varies from three shillings to three shillings
                    and twopence. In the provinces the accounts are kept in various denominations of
                    money, but they are easily reduced into florins or gulden, three of which are
                    equal to two dollars, and the value of which in exchange with London is about
                    two shillings.</p>
                <p>The legal long measure of Prussia is the Berlin ell of two feet, which contains
                    25½ths Rhenish inches, or 296 French lines. In the distant provinces a local
                    measure of length prevails, which differs in each. The Prussian mile is
                    23,685</p>
                <p>feet, or nearly the same as the German geographical mile, or one fifteenth of a
                    degree of latitude, being somewhat less than four and a half English miles. The
                    land measure is the Magdeburg morgen of100 roods, each rood of twelve feet; and
                    the foot is about one seventh longer than the English; thus the morgen is nearly
                    two thirds of an English acre. The dry measure is the Berlin scheffel of
                    2758Parisian cubic inches, or nearly one bushel, one peck, and one gallon,
                    English measure. The liquid measures are more various than any other, and differ
                    in every province; but as they are all legally reducible to Berlin measure, we
                    give that only, viz. an oxhoft is six cimer, an cimer two ankers, an anker
                    thirty-two quarts, the quart two noseln. The quart contains fifty-eight Parisian
                    cubic inches, or nearly one ninth less than the English quart. The weights of
                    commerce are the shipslast, containing twelve shipspounds; the shipspound
                    contains 280 common pounds; the centner, of 110 pounds, is divided into light
                    and heavy stones, having ten of the former and five of the latter; the pound is
                    divided into two marks, the mark into sixteen loth, the loth into fourquentchen,
                    and the quentchen into four pfenningen.</p>
