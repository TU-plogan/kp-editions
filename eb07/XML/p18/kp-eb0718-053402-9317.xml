                    of any superior.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prince</hi> likewise denotes a person who is a sovereign in
                    his own territories, yet holds of some other as his superior. Such are the
                    princes of Germany, who, though absolute in their respective principalities, are
                    bound to the emperor in certain services.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prince</hi> also denotes the issue of princes, or those of
                    the royal family. In France, before the Revolution, they were called “princes of
                    the blood,” and during the short continuance of the constitution of 179L “French
                    princes.” In England the king’s children are called “sons and daughters of
                    England;” the eldest son is created Prince of Wales; the cadets are created
                    dukes or earls, as the king pleases; and the title of all the children is “royal
                    highness.”</p>

                    Island,</hi> is situated on the western coast of the Malay peninsula, from which
                    it is separated by a narrowstrait, not more than twomiles in breadth. It formsan
                    excellent harbour, which is capacious, and yvell defended from all winds, and it
                    affords anchorage for the largest ships. The principal entrance is from the
                    north-west; but there is also a fine channel to the southward. There is an inner
                    harbour, in which ships may receive every kind of repair that can be performed
                    without going into dock. The area of the island is estimated at 160 square
                    miles. It is nearly five leagues in length and seven or eight miles in breadth.
                    It is of an irregular four-sided figure, which is highest on the north side and
                    shortest on the south; and is intersected by a range of lofty hills, which
                    decrease in magnitude as they approach the south, and in which are the sources
                    of numerous streams, that supply the island with abundance of water. These hills
                    are of a moderate height. The highest, namely, the Flag-staff Füll, does not
                    rise to more than 2500 feet above the level of the sea. Here the heat is
                    comparatively moderate; the thermometer seldom rises above 74°, and often falls
                    to 66° whilst in the plains it ranges from 76° to 90°. The climate is moist, and
                    the rains are heavy. Except in the dry hot months of January and February,
                    scarcely a day passes without rain, which is heaviest in November and
                    December.</p>
                <p>The island generally possesses a fertile soil, being for the most part a light
                    black mould, mixed with gravel, clay, and in many parts sandy. It is chiefly
                    formed from the decayed leaves of trees, f rom which originated a fine vegetable
                    mould, the whole island having been for ages covered with immense forests. This
                    has in some degree disappeared as the woods were cleared and the surface exposed
                    to the weather; but the soil in the interior is still adapted for any sort of
                    tropical produce. Cultivation is extended over the northern, and nearly the
                    whole of the southern and eastern sides of the island. The principal productions
                    are pepper, betel-nut, betel-leaf, cocoa-nuts, coffee, sugar, parsley, ginger,
                    yams, sweet potatoes, and a great variety of vegetables. The island abounds in
                    many species of fruits, such as the mangosteen, rambosteen, pine-apples, guavas,
                    oranges, citrons, pomegranates, and others. The island also produces cloves,
                    nutmegs, cinnamon, pimento, kyapootee, cotatova, and numerous other plants from
                    the Moluccas and Eastern Isles. Pepper is one of the chief articles of
                    cultivation. This island also affords the elastic gum vine, or American
                    caoutchouc. It grows to the thickness of an arm, creeping along the ground to
                    the distance of two hundred paces, and then ascending amongst the branches of
                    high trees. The forests which are found in this island abound in excellent
                    timber for ship-building, and supply masts of any dimensions, lower masts of any
                    size having been procured here for a seventy-four gun-ship.</p>
                <p>This island was originally granted, in 1785, by the King <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539330" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9330-0535"/>of Queda, to Captain Francis
                    Light, of a country ship, who had married his daughter. It was then transferred
                    to the East India Company, and accepted; being peculiarly adapted as a
                    mercantile station for vessels arriving from all the Malay ports, the Moluccas,
                    Borneo, the Celebes, and the Philippine Islands. A small detachment was
                    accordingly sent from Calcutta, under the command of Captain Light, who in 1786,
                    took possession of the island, for the use of the East India Company. But those
                    early Settlers had great difficulty in clearing the country, encumbered with an
                    immense forest, with swamps which required to be drained, and ravines which it
                    was necessary to fill up. A town called George Town was, however, marked out,
                    and within a year sixty Chinese farhilics had settled in it, besides great
                    numbers of Malays, Buggepes, and other Eastern traders. The port was made free
                    to all nations, and in a very short time numerous adventurers flocked to the
                    settlement, commerce and population rapidly increased, and cultivation was
                    extended. In 1797 the population amounted to 6,937, exclusive of Europeans and
                    the garrison; and in 1805, it had risen to 10,310. They have since been
                    progressively increasing, and exhibit an uncommon diversity of races, consisting
                    of British, Dutch, Portuguese, Americans, Arabs, Parsees, Chinese, Chulias,
                    Malays, Buggepes, Birmans, Siamese, Javanese, &amp;c. In 1805, the settlement
                    having grown in wealth and importance, it was determined to erect it into a
                    regular government, subordinate only to the Governor-General of India. But, on
                    account of the enormous expense of this establishment, some modifications were
                    made in these arrangements in the year 1808. This island is resorted to by
                    invalids from the continent in search of health; but if we may judge from the
                    number of governors who have died here, the change is scarcely for the better.
                    Captain Light died in 1794; and he was succeeded by Mr. Manningham, who died
                    soon after in Bengal. In 1796 Majof∙ Macdonald took the charge, and died at
                    Madras in 1799· Sir George Leith, who succeeded him, lived and returned to
                    Europe; but the Hon. C. Bruce, who arrived as governor in the year 1810, only
                    Survived till next December.</p>
                <p>The fort, which is called Fort Cornwallis, is incapable of defence, from its size
                    and construction. It is built upon the north-eastern point of the island, and
                    large sums have been spent without completing it. It contains barracks for the
                    military, an arsenal, a magazine, and several military storehouses. Of late
                    years the sea has made great encroachments on the northern face of the fort, and
                    along the esplanade. The town is of considerable extent, and the streets, which
                    cross each other at right angles, are spacious and airy. There is a large pier
                    for landing and shipping goods; a government house, a church, a jail, and
                    several substantial bridges have been built; whilst the fortifications have been
                    improved and strengthened, and the public roads repaired and widened. The
                    markets are well supplied with fish of various descriptions and of excellent
                    quality; with poultry of all sorts, pork, grain of every description, and a
                    profusion of vegetables and fruit. The beef and veal are not of a good quality.
                    Sheep are imported from the continent of India; whilst Sumatra and the Malay
                    peninsula furnish a supply of goats. Milk and butter are dear and scarce. A
                    great trade is carried on with Europe, India, and the islands in the Eastern
                    seas. Ships that are trading to the east, especially to China, tòüch here, where
                    they procure such refreshments or articles of trade as they require. Vessels
                    from Europe, bound for China, also touch here, and load large quantities of tin,
                    canes, rattans, sago, pepper, bötel-nut, hichc-de-mar, edible birds’ nests,
                    &amp;c., for the China market. This small island is the emporium of the whole
                    trade of the Straits of Malacca and adjacent islands. The imports from Europe,
                    either directly or from the other presidencies, are generally European
                    manufactures in iron and steel, such as anchors, cutlery of all sorts,
                    fire-arms, nails; also tin-ware, patent shot, sheet-lead, sheet-copper, iron in
                    bars, books, pamphlets, boots and shoes, cables, canvas, cabinet ware, cloths,
                    and Cassimeres, glass ware, hats, haberdashery, hosiery, musical and
                    mathematical instruments, oilmen’s stones, painters’ colours, plated wire,
                    watches, malt liquor, and European wines of all sorts. From Bengal, the imports
                    are opium, grain, iron, steel, marine stores, and piece goods; from the
                    Coromandel coast, salt, tobacco, cloths, evir rope and yarns, handkerchiefs,
                    chintzes, &amp;c.; from Bombay and the Malabar coast, cotton, salt, a few piece
                    goods, red wood, sandal wood, sharks’ fins, myrrh, piece goods, &amp;c.; from
                    Sumatra, pepper, benzoin, camphire, and gold dust; from Acheen and Pedeer, gold
                    dust, betel-nut, pepper, rice, and Acheen cloths. Tin is imported from the east
                    coast and from Junkceylon; also pepper, Sugar, oil, rice, tobacco, elephants’
                    teeth, edible birds’ nests, &amp;c.; spices from the Moluccas; gold dust, sago,
                    and black wood from Borneo; and from China, tea, sugar, lustrings, velvet,
                    paper, umbrellas, china-ware, quicksilver, and generally every article required
                    by the Chinese settlers, though British produce has in many cases superseded
                    that of China. Other articles from China are, raw silk, copper ware, China
                    camphor, China root alum. The exports consist of many of those articles which
                    are sent to Sumatra, Jnnkccylon, Java, Borneo, China, Bengal, Coromandel, as
                    they are required.</p>
