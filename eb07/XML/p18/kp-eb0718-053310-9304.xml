                <p><label type="entry">PRIMOGENITURE</label>, or the right of the first-born, has
                    amongst most nations been very considerable. The firstborn son, in the
                    patriarchal ages, had a superioritv over his brethren, and, in the absence of
                    his father, was the priest of the family. Amongst the Jews, he was consecrated
                    to the Lord, had a double portion of the inheritance, and succeeded in the
                    government of the family or kingdom. It is, however, remarkable, and
                    unquestionably shows the connection between this institution and the birth and
                    office of our Sa viour, that if a w oman’s first child were a girl, neither she
                    nor the children that came after her were consecrated.</p>
                <p>In almost every nation of Europe, the right of primogeniture prevails at present
                    in some degree, but it did not prevail always. The law which calls the
                    cider-born to the crown, preferably to the others, was not introduced into
                    France till a late period; it was unknow n to the first race of kings, and even
                    to the second. The four sons of Clovis shared the kingdom equally amongst
                    themselves, and Louis le Débonnaire did the same; it was not till the race of
                    Hugh Capet succeeded, that the prerogative of succession to the crown was
                    appropriated to the first-born.</p>
                <p>Mr. M‘Culloch, in one of the Notes to his valuable edition of Smith’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,</hi> makes the following observations on this
                    subject. “Though there can be little doubt of the injurious consequences that
                    must always flow from every attempt to regulate the succession to property by
                    means of compulsory regulations, there are good grounds for thinking that the
                    <hi rend="italic">custom</hi> of primogeniture, or the custom of leaving the
                    whole, or the greater part of the paternal estate, to the eldest son, to the
                    exclusion of his brothers and sisters, has been advantageous. The prejudices of
                    most political philosophers against primogeniture seem to rest on no solid
                    foundation. Dr. Smith says, that it is a custom which, ‘ in order to enrich one,
                    beggars all the rest of the children ;’ but, so far from agreeing in this
                    opinion, we cannot help thinking, that to it may be fairly ascribed much of the
                    industry, freedom, and civilization of modern Europe; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539317" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9317-0534"/>that were it abolished, and
                    the custom of equally dividing landed property established in its stead, all the
                    children of landlords, the youngest as well as the oldest, would be reduced to a
                    state of comparative poverty, at the same time that the prosperity of the other
                    classes would be greatly impaired.”</p>
                <p>“This custom of <hi rend="italic">gavelling, or</hi> dividing the paternal
                    inheritance, was not confined to any particular sort of property, but extended
                    to leasehold as well as freehold. And so strongly was it rooted in the public
                    esteem, that it was to no purpose that a landlord inserted a clause in the lease
                    of a farm prohibiting its subdivision. The courts of law were hostile to such
                    limitations; and the juries, before which a case of this description was
                    occasionally tried, if they returned a verdict in favour of the landlord, almost
                    uniformly awarded only nominal damages. The consequences resulting from the
                    combined operation of this custom and law, have been exactly such as might have
                    been anticipated. Instead of increasing with the increase of capital, and the
                    more general diffusion of a knowledge of the correct principles of agriculture,
                    the farms in the possession of the Irish tenantry have been gradually reduced in
                    most instances to mere patches.”</p>
                <p>“In Scotland a totally different system has been followed, and with the happiest
                    results. The succession to farms, as well as estates, has been long regulated in
                    that part of the empire by the law of primogeniture. The tenant of a Scotch farm
                    has no power, unless a provision to that effect be inserted in his lease, which
                    is very rarely done, to devise his interest in it. He can neither sublet nor
                    subdivide his farm; and, at his death, it descends entire to hi$ heir-at-law.
                    The younger children are not taught from infancy to trust to the land for
                    support; on the contrary, they are early made aware that farming is not a
                    profession on which they can enter, and that it is indispensable they should
                    apply themselves to something else. In consequence, they either establish
                    themselves in towns or emigrate to other countries; and perhaps there is no one
                    circumstance that has contributed so much as this to inspire Scotchmen with the
                    adventurous enterprising spirit for which they are celebrated. The agricultural
                    population is, in this way, kept down to its proper level; and prudential habits
                    are very generally diffused. Instead of becoming less, farms in Scotland are
                    gradually becoming larger, according to the increase in the capital of those
                    engaged in the business of agriculture. No one prosecutes farming as a means of
                    acquiring a miserable subsistence, but as a means of employing capital with
                    advantage. There is, however, great reason to fear that the enfranchising of the
                    tenants will have a most injurious influence over agriculture.”<note
