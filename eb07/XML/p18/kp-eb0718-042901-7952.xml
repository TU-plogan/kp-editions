                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Porcelain,</hi> in its more general signification,
                    comprehends all kinds of earthen ware, which are white, semitransparent, and
                    have some degree of a vitreous texture· Hence, in this extensive meaning of the
                    term, it includes all kinds of pottery, stoneware, delft ware, &amp;c. But in a
                    more limited sense, the word <hi rend="italic">Porcelain</hi> is employed to
                    denote only the finer kinds of earthen ware; and because this kind of ware has
                    been, from time immémorial, manufactured in the greatest degree of perfection in
                    China, it has obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">Chinese Porcelain,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">China Ware.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Chinese language, porcelain is denoted by the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >tse-ki,</hi> so that the derivation of the term is not to be sought for in that
                    language; and hence it is supposed to be of European extraction, and to be
                    derived from the Portuguese, in which language the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >porcellano</hi> signifies a cup or vessel.</p>
                <p>The first porcelain which was seen in Europe was brought from Japan and China.
                    Its "whiteness, transparency, and fineness of texture, with its elegance and
                    beautiful colours, soon introduced it as an ornament of the tables of the rich
                    and powerful, whilst, at the same time, it excited the admiration and industry
                    of the European manufacturer. Attempts were accordingly made to imitate this
                    kind of ware, in different countries of Europe. The first European porcelains
                    were made in Saxony. The manufacture was afterwards introduced into France, and
                    successively into England, Germany, and Italy, where it has arrived at various
                    degrees of perfection, according to the nature of the materials which can be
                    obtained, and the industry and ingenuity of the artist who superintends and
                    directs it. But after all, to whatever degree of perfection the manufacture of
                    this ware has attained in Europe, it must still yield, in excellence and
                    perfection, to the porcelain of eastern countries.</p>
                <p>Of the antiquity of the manufacture of porcelain in China, little precise
                    information can be expected from a people who have always shown themselves so
                    extremely averse to the freedom of intercourse with other nations. But it is
                    said that the village or town of King-te-ching has furnished the emperors of
                    China with porcelain since the year 442 of the Christian era; and that it is an
                    object of so much attention to the Chinese government, that the manufacture is
                    carried on under the superintendence of one or two mandarins sent from
                    court.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">History of the Manufacture of Porcelain in China.</hi></p>
                <p>The fullest account which has as yet been received in Europe of the manufacture
                    of Chinese porcelain, has been given by Father D’Entrecolles, a Catholic
                    missionary, who lived for some time in the village or town where the principal
                    manufactory was established. The account which has been given by the Jesuit of
                    this village, and of the manufacture of porcelain, is extremely interesting.</p>
                <p>This village or town, which is celebrated as producing the best porcelain of
                    China, is in the province of Kiang-si, and is said to be a league and a half in
                    length, containing not less than 1,000,000 of inhabitants. Other manufactories,
                    indeed, have been established in different parts of the Chinese empire, and
                    particularly in those places which are convenient for the European trade, as in
                    the provinces of Fo-kien and Canton; but the porcelain produced at these is said
                    to be held in inferior estimation. A Chinese emperor wishing to have a
                    manufacture of porcelain under his own inspection at Pekin, ordered workmen to
                    be collected for the purpose, with all the necessary materials and implements;
                    but after erecting furnaces and other expensive operations, the attempt failed,
                    so that, in the time of D’Entrc-colles, King-te-tching continued to be the most
                    celebrated place in China for beautiful porcelain; and from this it was
                    transported to all parts of the world.</p>
                <p>The chief ingredients which enter into the composition of fine porcelain are
                    petuntse and kaolin, two kinds of earth from the mixture of which the paste is
                    obtained. The petuntse is of a pure white, and, when fully prepared, is in the
                    form of an impalpable powder, so that it is very fine to the touch. The kaolin,
                    he observes, is intermixed with small shining particles. These materials arc
                    carried to the manufactory in the shape of bricks. The petuntse originally
                    consists of the fragments of rock dug out from certain quarries, and reduced to
                    powder; and the colour of the stone which answers the purpose best, according to
                    the Chinese, inclines somewhat to green. The fragments of rock are broken to
                    pieces with a large iron club; they are then put into mortars, and by means of
                    levers headed with hard stone, strongly secured with iron, they are reduced to
                    the state of fine powder. The levers, it is scarcely necessary to observe, are
                    moved either by the labour of men, or by water. The powder, which is afterwards
                    collected, is then thrown into a large vessel full of water, which is strongly
                    agitated with an iron shovel. When this mixture has been allowed to settle for
                    some time, a substance resembling cream rises to the top, which is skimmed off,
                    and poured into another vessel also filled with water. The water in the first
                    vessel is again agitated, and the frothy substance which rises to the surface is
                    collected as before, and the same operation is repeated till it appear that
                    nothing remains but a coarse sediment which falls to the bottom by its own
                    weight. This sediment is then carefully collected, and again subjected to the
                    process of pulverization.</p>
                <p>The fluid in the second vessel is allowed to remain at rest till a sediment is
                    produced, forming a kind of crust at the bottom; and when the water above seems
                    to be quite transparent, it is poured off by gently inclining the vessel, that
                    the sediment may not be disturbed. The paste is then put into large moulds, and
                    allowed to dry slowly; but before it becomes quite hard, it is divided into
                    small square cakes, which are sold by the hundred. This is the substance which
                    is called by the Chinese <hi rend="italic">petuntse,</hi> and the name is said
                    to be derived from the colour and form of this paste.</p>
                <p>The kaolin, the other substance which is employed in the fabrication of
                    porcelain, requires fewer operations in its preparation than the former, as it
                    is found in nature in a state almost ready for the manufacturer. Of this
                    substance it is said, that there are extensive mines in certain mountains, the
                    external strata of which are composed of a kind of red earth. The kaolin is
                    found in these mines in small lumps, and it is formed into bricks by being
                    subjected to a similar process with the petuntse.</p>
                <p>The fine porcelain, it has been observed, derives its fabric and texture from the
                    kaolin. It is to this that the qualities which it possesses of resisting the
                    most powerful heat is owing; whilst its strength and consistency is obtained by
                    fusion with the petuntse, which enables it to resist the action of the more
                    powerful agents. D’Entrecolles relates an anecdote which he received from a rich
                    Chinese merchant, that the English and Dutch having purchased a quantity of
                    petuntse, conveyed it to Europe for the purpose of manufacturing<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537965" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7965-0430"/> porcelain; but having
                    procured none of the kaolin, the attempt failed. They wanted, added the Chinese
                    with a smile, to form a body, the flesh of which would support itself without
                    bones.</p>
                <p>It is said that the Chinese have latterly discovered a new substance which may be
                    employed in the composition of porcelain. This stone is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hoa-chè,</hi> the first part of the word signifying glutinous, because it is of
                    a saponaceous quality. Porcelain made with this substance is very rare, and
                    bears a much higher price than any other. The grain is extremely fine, and the
                    painting with which it is ornamented, when compared with that of common
                    porcelain, appears to exceed it as much as vellum surpasses paper. This variety
                    of porcelain, it is added, is also remarkable for its lightness. It is besides
                    much more brittle, and it is found very difficult to hit upon the proper degree
                    of heat for tempering it. This substance, we are farther informed, is but rarely
                    employed in the fabrication of the body of the porcelain; the reason of which
                    perhaps is, the scarcity and high price of this precious article, in consequence
                    of which the workman is contented with making it into a fine size, into which
                    the vessel is immersed when it is dry, that it may receive a coat before.it is
                    painted and glazed; and by this process he finds that he can commmunicate to the
                    ware a very high degree of beauty. The previous processes employed in the
                    preparation of this substance are similar to those which are followed in the
                    preparation of kaolin. When hoa-chè is extracted from the mine, it is washed in
                    rain or river water, for the purpose of separating a yellowish earth with which
                    it is contaminated. It is then reduced to powder, thrown into a vessel filled
                    with water, and then formed into cakes. The hoa-chè prepared in this manner,
                    without the addition of any other earth, is said to be alone sufficient in the
                    fabrication of porcelain. It is employed, as has already been noticed, as a
                    substitute for kaolin; but, on account of its scarcity, it is much dearer. The
                    price of the former is three times that of the latter, and from this
                    circumstance the value of porcelain made with hoa-chè is much higher than that
                    which is manufactured with kaolin.</p>
                <p>The principal ingredients in the fabrication of porcelain are petuntse and
                    kaolin; but to these must be added the glaze or varnish, or, as it is called in
                    the account given of Chinese porcelain, the oil, on which depend its splendour
                    and whiteness. This varnish is of a whitish colour, and is obtained from the
                    same kind of stone which yields the petuntse; but for this purpose the whitest
                    stone is always preferred. The glaze is obtained by a process similar to that
                    which is followed in the preparation of petuntse. The stone is first washed and
                    reduced to powder; it is then thrown into a vessel filled with,water, and after
                    being purified, a frothy matter rises to the surface. To 100 pounds of this
                    matter, one pound of a substance called che-kao, is added. This latter is a
                    saline substance, somewhat like alum, which is put into the fire, and allowed to
                    remain till it become red hot, when it is reduced to powder. By the addition of
                    this substance the glaze acquires a greater degree of consistence; but at the
                    same time a proper degree of fluidity-must be preserved. The glaze prepared in
                    this manner is not employed alone. Another glaze is mixed with it, which is
                    obtained from lime and ashes; to 100 pounds weight of which is also added one
                    pound of che-kao, or the aluminous substance mentioned above. When the two
                    substances are mixed, it is necessary to attend that they be nearly of the same
                    consistence, and the workman ascertains this point by,dipping into each of them
                    some cakes of petuntse; and by a close examination of their surfaces after they
                    are drawn out, he is able to judge of the consistence of the fluids. The
                    proportions of the two which are usually employed, are ten parts of the glaze
                    obtained from the stone, to one of that which is prepared from the lime and from
                    ashes.</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of the Chinese porcelain, the first process, after the
                    separate preparation of the materials, is a second purification of the petuntse
                    and kaolin; and when these are found to be in a state of sufficient purity, the
                    workmen proceed to mix the two ingredients together. The proportions employed
                    for the finer kinds of porcelain are equal parts of kaolin and petuntse; for an
                    inferior kind, four parts of kaolin to six of petuntse are employed; and in some
                    kinds of porcelain, only one part of the former is added to three of the latter.
                    This is the smallest proportion of kaolin which is employed in the Chinese
                    manufactories. When the proportions are fixed, and the mixture finished, the
                    mass is thrown into a large pit, which is well paved and cemented. It is then
                    trodden upon, and kneaded till it become hard. This is the most fatiguing part
                    of the labour, for it must be continued without intermission. From the mass
                    prepared in this manner the workmen detach different pieces, which they spread
                    out upon large slates, where they knead and roll them in all directions, taking
                    care that no vacuum be left, and that there be no intermixture of any foreign
                    body. The whole work would be entirely spoiled by the addition of a hair, or a
                    particle of sand. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hen the paste has been
                    properly prepared, the porcelain, when exposed to heat in the furnace, retains
                    its form without becoming soft, or entering into fusion, and becomes
                    semitransparent, without exhibiting cracks or superficial fissures; but when
                    there is any defect in the mixture or preparation, the porcelain cracks, and
                    becomes warped, or melts in the furnace.</p>
                <p>The paste being thus prepared, the next operation is to form the vessels for
                    which it is designed. All kinds of plain ware are formed with the wheel. When a
                    cup, for instance, has undergone this operation, the outside of the bottom is
                    quite round. The workman first gives it the requisite height and· diameter, and
                    it comes from his hands almost the moment he has received it. Great dexterity
                    and expedition are absolutely necessary, on account of the low price of labour
                    in these manufactories. A workman, it is said, scarcely receives a farthing per
                    board, each board containing no less than twenty-six pieces. The cup then passes
                    to a second workman, by whom the base is formed; after which it is delivered to
                    a third, who applies it to the mould, and gives it the proper form. When it is
                    taken off the mould, it must be carefully turned,and not pressed more to one
                    side than the other; for without this necessary precaution it would become
                    warped or disfigured. The business of the fourth workman is to polish it with
                    the chisel, especially round the edges, and diminish the thickness, in order to
                    give it the proper degree of transparency. Having at length passed through the
                    different hands from whom it receives its form and various ornaments, it then
                    comes to the last workman, who forms the bottom with a chisel. It is wonderful,
                    we are told, to see with how much dexterity and expedition the workmen convey
                    the vessels from one to another; and it is added, that a single piece of
                    porcelain,' before it is completely finished, must pass through the hands of no
                    fewer than seventy different workmen. It <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> is indeed,
                    we may observe, to this minute division of labour that its low price is owing;
                    and on the same circumstance depend the remarkable dexterity and expedition
                    which have already been noticed.</p>
                <p>In the execution of large works of porcelain, different parts are first formed
                    individually; and when all the pieces are finished, and nearly dry, they are put
                    together and cemented with a paste formed of the same substance, and softened
                    with water. Some time afterwards the seams are polished with a knife on both
                    sides of the vessel, so that when it is covered with a varnish, or glazed, they
                    are so completely concealed, that the least trace of them is not perceptible. It
                    is in this way that spouts, handles, rings, and other parts of a similar nature,
                    are united. And in this way, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537978"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-7978-0431"/>particularly are fabricated those pieces which arc
                    formed upon moulds, or by the hand, such as embossed works, grotesque images,
                    idols, figures of trees or animals, and busts. All these are formed of four or
                    five pieces joined together, which are afterwards brought to perfection by means
                    of instruments proper for carving, polishing, and finishing the different traces
                    which the mould has left imperfect. Flowers and ornaments which are not in
                    relief, are either engraved, or the impression is made by means of a stamp; but
                    ornaments in relief are prepared separately, and added to the pieces of
                    porcelain to which they are destined.</p>
                <p>The piece of porcelain being prepared according to the operations now described,
                    is next conveyed to the painter; and in this art it is to be observed that the
                    Chinese workmen follow no certain rule, and seem to be unacquainted with any of
                    the principles of perspective. Their knowledge is the effect of practice, guided
                    often by a whimsical imagination. The labour of painting porcelain in the
                    Chinese manufactories is also divided amongst a great number of hands. The
                    business of one man, for instance, is solely limited to the tracing out the
                    first coloured circle with which the brim of the vessel is adorned; another
                    designs the flowers, and a third paints them. One delineates waters’ and
                    mountains, whilst it is the province of another to draw and paint birds and
                    other animals. Of the painting on Chinese porcelain, it has been observed, that
                    the human figure is often most indifferently executed <hi rend="subscript">
                    s</hi></p>
                <p>A peculiar kind of glaze or varnish, we are informed, is obtained from white
                    flint. This glaze, it is said, has the singular property of making the pieces of
                    porcelain to which it is applied exhibit the appearance of veins distributed in
                    all directions. Vessels glazed with this material seem as if the surface were
                    cracked, without the fragments being separated or displaced. The colour of this
                    glaze is whitish gray; and when it is applied to porcelain having an azure blue
                    ground, it communicates a beautifully-variegated appearance. Vases of Chinese
                    porcelain are sometimes fabricated in a different manner. They are ornamented
                    with a kind of fret-work, which has something of the appearance of fine lace, in
                    the middle of which is placed a cup proper for holding any liquid; which
                    constitutes one body with the surrounding fret-work.</p>
                <p>We are informed that the Chinese workmen formerly possessed the secret of
                    fabricating a kind of porcelain of a much more singular nature. On the sides of
                    the vessel thus formed were painted the figures of fishes, insects, and other
                    animals, which could not be seen unless the vessel was filled with water. It is
                    said that this secret is in a great measure lost; but the following is given as
                    part of the process of preparing this kind of porcelain. The vessel which is to
                    be painted, for the purpose of producing this peculiar effect, must be extremely
                    thin and delicate. When it is dry, the colour is laid on, not upon the outside,
                    however, as is usually the case, but upon the inside of the vessel; and it is
                    laid on pretty thickly. The figures which are painted upon it are usually
                    fishes, as being more characteristic of the element in which they live. When the
                    colour is perfectly dry, it is then coated over with a kind of glaze, composed
                    of porcelain earth, so that the azure is thus enclosed between two layers of
                    earthy matter; and when the glaze becomes dry, the workman pours some oil into
                    the vessel, and putting it upon a mould, applies it to the lathe. Porcelain
                    fabricated in this manner, having received its consistence and body within, it
                    is the object of the workmen to make it as thin as possible on the outside,
                    without penetrating to the colour. The external surface is then dipped into a
                    mixture for glazing, and when it is dry it is baked in a common furnace. This
                    kind of porcelain is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">kia-tsing,</hi>
                    signifying pressed azure. It is supposed that the Chinese do not at present
                    possess the art of making porcelain of this description, which requires a great
                    deal of dexterity and delicate management; and it isadded,that they have
                    imperfectly succeeded in the attempts which have been occasionally made to
                    discover the secret of this curious process.</p>
                <p>The next process in the manufacture of porcelain is baking; but before we
                    describe the method of arranging and managing the furnaces employed for this
                    purpose, we shall give a short account of their construction. The Chinese
                    furnaces for baking porcelain are furnished with a long porch, for the purpose
                    of conveying air, and in some measure as a substitute for bellows. This porch
                    answers the same purpose as the arch of a glass-house; but the furnaces which,
                    as the author from whom the account is taken observes, were formerly only six
                    feet in height, and the same in length, are now constructed upon a much more
                    extensive plan. They are twelve feet in height, and nearly four in breadth; and
                    the roof and sides arc so thick, that the powerful heat which is applied
                    internally does not penetrate to the outside, at least so much as to be
                    inconvenient to bear it on the application of the hand. The dome or roof is in
                    the form of an inverted funnel, having a large aperture at the top by which the
                    smoke escapes. Beside the principal aperture, there are five others of smaller
                    dimensions, which are covered with broken pots in such a manner that the workman
                    can increase or diminish the heat as he finds it necessary. Through these
                    apertures also he is able to see the progress of the baking of the porcelain,
                    and can judge when it is completed. By uncovering the hole which is nearest the
                    principal opening, he opens with a pair of pincers one of the cases containing
                    the pieces of porcelain, and if he perceives a bright fire in the furnace, and
                    all the pieces brought to a red heat, as well as the colours of the porcelain
                    appearing with a full lustre, he concludes that the process is finished. He then
                    diminishes the fire, and entirely shuts up the mouth of the furnace for some
                    time. In the bottom of the furnace there is a deep hearth about two feet in
                    breadth, over which a plank is laid, in order that the workmen may enter to
                    arrange the porcelain. When the fire is kindled on the hearth, the mouth of the
                    furnace is immediately closed up, and an aperture is left only sufficient for
                    the admission of faggots, about a foot in length, but very narrow. The furnace
                    is first heated for a day and a night, after which two men keep continually
                    throwing wood into it, and relieve each other by turns. One hundred and eighty
                    loads are consumed for one baking. As the porcelain is burning hot, the workman
                    employs for the purpose of taking it out, long scarfs or pieces of cloth, which
                    are suspended from his neck.</p>
                <p>Having thus given a concise account of the construction of the Chinese furnaces,
                    we procced now to lay before our read ers an account of the method of baking
                    porcelain which is followed in that country. After the porcelain has received
                    its proper form, its colours, and all the intended ornaments, it is transported
                    from the manufactory to the furnace, which is sometimes situated at the other
                    end of the village already mentioned. In a kind of portico which is erected
                    before it, may be seen vast numbers of boxes and cases made of earth, for the
                    purpose of inclosing the porcelain. Each piece, however inconsiderable it may
                    be, has its own case; and the Chinese workman, by means of this procedure,
                    imitates nature, which, in order to bring the fruits of the earth to maturity,
                    clothes them in a covering, to defend them from the excessive heat of the sun
                    during the day, and from the severity of the cold during the night.</p>
                <p>A layer of fine sand is put into the bottom of these boxes, which is covered over
                    with the powder of kaolin, to prevent the sand from adhering too closely to the
                    bottom of the vessel. The piece of porcelain is then placed upon this bed of
                    sand, and pressed gently down, in order that the sand may take the form of the
                    bottom of the vessel, which does not touch the sides of its case; but thecase
                    has no cover.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537991" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7991-0432"/>
                <p>A second, prepared in the same manner, and containing its vessel, is fitted into
                    the first, so that it entirely shuts it, without touching the porcelain which is
                    bclow; and thus the furnace is filled up with piles of cases, which defend the
                    pieces they contain from the direct action of the fire.</p>
                <p>With regard to small pieces of porcelain, such as teacups, they are inclosed in
                    common cases about four inches in height. Each piece is placed upon a saucer of
                    earth about twice as thick as a crown piece, and equal in breadth to its bottom.
                    These small cases are also sprinkled over with the dust of the kaolin. When the
                    cases are large, the porcelain is not placed in the middle, because it would be
                    too far removed from the sides, and consequently from the action of the
                    fire.</p>
                <p>These piles of cases are put into the furnace, and placed upon a bed of coarse
                    sand six inches in thickness; those by which the middle space is occupied are at
                    least seven feet in height. The two boxes which are at the bottom of each pile
                    remain empty, because the fire acts too feebly upon them, and because they are
                    partly covered by the sand. For the same reason, the case which is placed at the
                    top of each pile is also allowed to remain empty. The piles containing the
                    finest porcelain are placed in the middle part of the furnace; the coarsest are
                    put at its farthest extremity; and those pieces which have the most body and
                    strongest colouring are near its mouth. These different piles are placed very
                    closely in the furnace; and they materially support each other by pieces of
                    earth, which bind them at the top, bottom, and middle, but in such a manner,
                    that a free passage is left for the flame to insinuate itself everywhere around
                    them.</p>
                <p>The Chinese divide their porcelain into several kinds or classes, distinguishing
                    each according to the different degrees of beauty and fineness. The whole of the
                    first or most perfect kind is reserved for the emperor; none of it, we are
                    assured, ever comes into the hands of the public, unless, on account of
                    blemishes or imperfections, it is unworthy of being presented to the sovereign.
                    Many have doubted whether at any time the largest and finest porcelain of China
                    has ever been brought to Europe. None of that kind, at least, is offered for
                    sale at Canton. The Chinese, who are apt to undervalue the productions of other
                    countries, entertain a favourable opinion of the Dresden porcelain, and hold in
                    still higher estimation the porcelain which is produced in the French
                    manufactories.</p>
                <p>The following is a short account of the Chinese porcelain manufactures by Sir
                    George Staunton. “From the river,” says he, “were seen several excavations made
                    in extracting from the sides of the adjoining hills, the petuntse useful in the
                    manufacture of porcelain. This material is a species of fine granite, or
                    compound of quartz, feldspar, and mica, in which the quartz seems to bear the
                    largest proportion. It appears from several experiments, that it is the same as
                    the growan stone of the Cornish miners. The micaceous part, in some of this
                    granite from both countries, often contains some particles of iron, in which
                    case it will not answer the pottefs purpose. This material can be calcined and
                    ground much finer by the improved mills of England, than by the very imperfect
                    machinery of the Chinese, and at a cheaper rate than the prepared petuntse of
                    their own country, notwithstanding the cheapness of labour there.</p>
                <p>“The kaolin, or principal matter mixed with the petuntse, is the growan clay also
                    of the Cornish miners. The wha-she of the Chinese is the English soap-rock; and
                    the she-kan is asserted to be gypsum. It was related by a Chinese manufacturer
                    of that article, that the asbestos, or incombustible fossil stone, entered also
                    into the composition of porcelain. A village, or unwalled town, called
                    Kin-te-chin, was not very far distant from this part of the present travellers
                    route, in which 3000 furnaces for baking porcelain were said to be lighted at a
                    time, and gave to the place at night the appearance of a town on firc. The
                    genius or spirit of that element is indeed, with some propriety, the principal
                    deity worshipped there. The manufacture of porcelain is said to be precarious,
                    from the want of some precise method of ascertaining and regulating the heat
                    within the furnaces, in consequence of which their whole contents are baked
                    sometimes into one solid and useless mass. Mr. Wedgwood’s thermometer, founded
                    on the quality observed by him, of clay contracting in proportion to the degree
                    of fire to which it is exposed, might certainly be of use to a Chinese
                    potter.”</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Inquiries of Peaumur into the Nature of Porcelain.</hi></p>
                <p>The first scientific investigation which was made into the nature of porcelain,
                    was undertaken by the celebrated Reaumur; and the result of his researches was
                    communicated to the French Academy of Sciences in the years 1727 and 1729. It
                    was not the external form or appearance, nor was it the decorations of painting
                    and gilding, which are by no means essential to porcelain, that constituted the
                    object of his inquiries. His examination was particularly directed to the
                    peculiar texture and fabric of this substance, with the view of ascertaining the
                    nature and proportions of its constituent parts. For this purpose, he broke to
                    pieces some of the Japanese, the Saxon, and the French porcelains, and carfully
                    noted the peculiarities and differences in their texture. The grain or texture
                    of the Japanese porcelain appeared to possess a considerable degree of closeness
                    and compactness, with a smooth and somewhat shining aspect. He found that the
                    Saxon porcelain was still more compact, and that it was smooth, and shining like
                    enamel, but had nothing whatever of the granular texture. In his examination of
                    the French porcelain, he observed that it had much of the shining appearance,
                    and that its grain was not so close and fine as that of the oriental porcelain,
                    having some resemblance to the grain or texture of sugar. Such were the
                    observations which occurred to the French philosopher at the commencement of his
                    inquiries into the nature of porcelains; and hence he justly concluded, that
                    they were characterised by very marked differences.</p>
                <p>Proceeding in his investigation, the same philosopher subjected different
                    porcelains to the action of heat; and the result of his experiments with this
                    powerful agent proved, that they might be distinguished by still more decisive
                    characters. It appeared that the porcelain of the East suffered no change from
                    the action of the greatest heat, whereas that of European manufacture underwent
                    fusion at no very high temperature. This remarkable difference between the
                    Chinese and European porcelains, suggested to Reaumur an ingenious thought,
                    which at last led him to the discovery of the true nature of the composition of
                    porcelain. Having observed that all porcelains have some resemblance to glass in
                    some of their general properties, although they are less compact, he considered
                    them as in the state of a semi-vitrified substance. An earthy substance, he
                    observed, may be in a semi-vitrified state in two ways. It may, in the first
                    place, be entirely composed of vitrifiablc or fusible matters; and this being
                    the case, when it is exposed to the action of fire, provided the heat be
                    sufficiently strong and long continued, it will be melted or vitrified. But as
                    this change is not effected instantly, particularly where a violent degree of
                    heat is not applied; and as it passes through different degrees, the progress of
                    which may be more easily observed, according as the heat is managed and
                    regulated, it followed, that by stopping in proper time the application of the
                    heat to porcelain prepared in this way, the ware may be obtained in an
                    intermediate state between those of crude earths and completely vitrified
                    substances; whilst, at the same time, it possesses the semitransparcncy and
                    other distinguishing properties of porcelain. Porcelain of this nature, it is
                    well known, being exposed to a stronger degree of heat, undergoes perfect fusion
                    and complete vitrification. All <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538004"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8004-0433"/>the European porcelains which were subjected to
                    experiment by Reaumur, were found to be of this fusible nature.</p>
                <p>But on the other hand, porcelain may be composed of fusible or vitrifiable
                    matter, mixed in certain proportions with another matter, which is absolutely
                    infusible in the strongest heat to which it can be exposed in the furnace; and
                    hence, if a mixture of this kind be subjected to a heat sufficient to melt
                    entirely the vitrifiable part of its composition, this will enter into fusion;
                    but being mixed with another matter which is infusible, and which consequently
                    retains its consistency and opacity, the whole will form a compound, partly
                    opaque, and partly transparent, or, in other words, a semitransparent mass; that
                    is, a semivitrified substance, or porcelain, but possessing qualities totally
                    distinct from those of the former. For as the fusible part of the latter has
                    been brought to its utmost degree of fusibility during the process of baking,
                    although the compound may be exposed a second time to a still stronger degree of
                    heat, it will not approach nearer to complete vitrification, that is, it will
                    retain all the qualities of perfect porcelain. Reaumur found that the porcelain
                    of the East was distinguished by the properties now described; and hence he
                    concluded, that its component parts were arranged upon the principle above
                    mentioned. This opinion was afterwards confirmed by incontrovertible facts,
                    deduced from a train of the most satisfactory and well directed experiments.</p>
                <p>The ingredients which enter into the composition of the Chinese porcelain,
                    namely, the petuntse and kaolin, were the next object of Reaumur’s inquiries.
                    Having obtained quantities of each, he subjected them separately to a strong
                    heat, and he found that the petuntse entered into fusion, without addition; but
                    it appeared that the kaolin was absolutely infusible. He then mixed the two
                    ingredients, formed into cakes, and exposed them in a furnace to the proper
                    degree of heat; so that by baking they were converted into porcelain exactly
                    similar to that of the Chinese. From these experiments it appeared, that the
                    petuntse of the Chinese was a vitrifiable substance, and that the kaolin was of
                    a different nature, quite refractory, and totally infusible. After this
                    discovery, Reaumur, it would seem, entertained hopes that he might find
                    materials in France, capable of making porcelain, which should possess the same
                    valuable qualities as that of China; but whether hisresearches in the discovery
                    of proper materials in his own country, particularly that which corresponds to
                    the petuntse of the Chinese, were baffled, or whether he was prevented by other
                    avocations from prosecuting his inquiries, does not appear. In his second memoir
                    upon porcelain, however, we find, that he afterwards attempted to compose an
                    artificial petuntse, by mixing vitrifiable stones with such salinebodies aswere
                    capable of rendering them fusible, or even by substituting for this artificial
                    preparation glass ready formed, with the addition of such matters as he supposed
                    might be successfully employed in the place of kaolin. But it would appear that
                    he did not at the time prosecute his inquiries; for the subject was not resumed
                    until the year 1739, when he announced the discovery of a process for converting
                    common glass into a peculiar kind of porcelain, which has been since known by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Peaumur’s porcelain.</hi></p>
                <p>Although it must appear, from the detail now given, that Reaumur was directed in
                    his researches by the true spirit of philosophical inquiry, he seems to have
                    been misled in certain points. One of his errors was relative to the Saxon
                    porcelain, which he confounded with the other fusible porcelains of European
                    manufacture, unless it be supposed that the porcelain of Saxony was formerly
                    composed of entirely fusible or vitrifiable matters, and that it was porcelain
                    of this description which he examined; for it is now certain, that all the
                    porcelain of that country is capable of resisting the most powerful heat, and is
                    therefore equally infusible with that of China or Japan. The appearance of the
                    in ternal texture of the Saxon porcelain may perhaps have led the philosopher to
                    this erroneous conclusion; for when it is broken, the internal surface does not
                    exhibit a granular texture, but is uniform, smooth, shining, and compact, having
                    a great resemblance to white enamel. This appearance, however, so far from
                    proving that the porcelain of Saxony is a fused or vitrified substance, shews
                    that it is not entirely composed of fusible matters. The internal surface of the
                    most fusible porcelains, it is well known to those who are acquainted with the
                    subject, is also the least dense, and the least compact; for no vitreous matter
                    can be internally smooth and dense, without having been in a state of complete
                    fusion.</p>
                <p>The Saxon, like every other porcelain, especially that of China and Japan,
                    contains a fusible substance, which has been in a state of complete fusion
                    during the process of baking. The density and the internal lustre depend chiefly
                    on this fused matter; but it is also certain, that the Saxon porcelain contains
                    a large proportion of a substance which is absolutely infusible, and from which
                    it derives its beautiful white appearance, its firmness and solidity, during the
                    process of baking. It is this infusible substance which is to be considered as
                    the substitute for the kaolin of China, and which possesses the property of
                    contracting its dimensions, whilst it unites with the fusible material. The
                    Saxon porcelain, therefore, is not to be confounded with porcelain manufactured
                    with vitreous and fusible material; for it seems to be equally excellent as that
                    of Japan, and in some of its properties perhaps superior, as will appear from an
                    examination of the qualities which constitute the peculiar excellence of
                    porcelain.</p>
                <p>Reaumur seems likewise to have taken an erroneous view of the nature of the
                    Chinese kaolin. According to his account, this matter is a fine talcky powder,
                    from the mixture of which with petuntse, the porcelain of the East is
                    manufactured. It is not impossible, as has been observed, that a porcelain
                    similar to the Chinese might be produced from a talcky substance of this nature
                    mixed with petuntse; but it is well known to those who are at all familiar with
                    the manufacture of any porcelain, that no vessels can be formed, unless the
                    paste of which they are made possess that degree of ductility and tenacity which
                    renders them fit for being worked upon the lathe, or fashioned in the mould. But
                    substances of a talcky nature, to whatever degree of fineness they may be
                    reduced, never acquire the requisite ductility and tenacity which clays of all
                    earthy substances only possess. But as it appears that the Chinese porcelain has
                    been turned upon the lathe, it is obvious that they must have been formed of a
                    very tenacious paste; and hence it is concluded, that kaolin is not purely a
                    talcky matter, but an infusible clay, which, with the petuntse, a fusible
                    material, forms the ingredients which enter into the composition of Chinese
                    porcelain.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Peculiar Properties of Porcelain.</hi></p>
                <p>It may be worth while now to consider what are the properties which constitute
                    the perfection ofporcelain; and here it is necessary carefully to discriminate
                    between the qualities which are to be regarded as only contributing to the
                    external decoration, and the intrinsic and essential properties in which the
                    fabric and perfection of porcelain consist. Those who have been occupied in
                    experiments upon this subject, have not found itdifficult toform compositions
                    which are very white, beautifully semi-transparent,and covered with a shining
                    glazing, but which are extremely deficient in the more essential properties. It
                    appears, indeed, that they cannot be subjected to the necessary operations in
                    first forming the ware, for want of a proper degree of tenacity, that they are
                    not sufficiently compact, and are quite fusible, subject to break by the sudden
                    application of heat or cold, and from the softness of the glazing, which cracks
                    and becomes rough, are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538017"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8017-0434"/>soon deprived of their lustre. On the other hand,
                    it is by no means difficult to form compositions of pastes, which are very
                    tenacious, and which are capable of being easily worked and well baked, and in
                    the process of bakingwhich acquire the requisite degree of hardness and density;
                    which are infusible, and capable of resisting the effects of sudden changes of
                    heat and cold; and which, in short, possess all the qualities of the most
                    excellent porcelain, excepting its whiteness and transparency. Materials fit for
                    the composition of such porcelains, it will appear, may be found in abundance in
                    most countries; but those fit for the manufacture of the finer and more perfect
                    porcelains, seem to be sparing productions of nature; and therefore the best
                    kind of porcelain, it is presumed, will always be regarded as a valuable and
                    high-priced commodity.</p>
                <p>It may be observed that the potteries called <hi rend="italic">stoneware,</hi>
                    such as the brown made at Lambeth and some other places, and the white formerly
                    made at Burslem in Staffordshire, which were glazed by salt, or muriate of soda,
                    being thrown into the furnace when in a state of high fusion, possess all the
                    essential qualities of the Japanese porcelain; for, excepting the
                    whiteness,onwhich alone the semitransparency depends, if we compare the
                    properties of the Japmese porcelain with those of our stoneware, little
                    difference is found to exist between them. Both seem to possess the same
                    granular texture; both have the same sonorous quality, when struck with a hard
                    body; both have the same density; they possess also the same hardness, by which
                    they strike fire with steel; they can resist the effects of the heat of boiling
                    liquors without breaking, and are equally infusible when subjected to the most
                    violent heat. Hence it is inferred, that if the earth which enters into the
                    composition of stoneware, were free from foreign colouring matters, which
                    prevent the whiteness and semitransparency, and if the vessels were carefully
                    formed and covered with a very fine glaze, they would not be less per-feetthan
                    the porcelain of the East. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Pottery.)</hi> Earths fit
                    for the production of the more perfect kinds of porcelain are supposed to be
                    more rare in Europe than in Japan and China; and hence probably it has happened,
                    that, from the want of these earths, the first manufacturers of the porcelain in
                    Europe confined themselves to an external imitation, by employing only
                    vitrifiable matters with fusible salts, and small quantity of white earth, of
                    which fusible and vitreous porcelains were composed.</p>
                <p>One of the most valuable qualities of porcelain is the property of resisting
                    sudden alternations of heat and cold, in which the European porcelain exceeds
                    that of China or Japan. The quality of porcelain, it is to be observed, is not
                    to be judged of by a slight trial; for as numerous circumstances concur to
                    render a piece of porcelain capable or incapable of resisting the effects of
                    heat or cold, boiling water may be at the same time poured into two vessels, one
                    of which is good porcelain, and the other of an opposite quality, it is not
                    impossible that the former may break, and the latter may remain entire. The true
                    method of discovering what is good porcelain, is to examine several pieces which
                    are in daily use; and it has been found, that in many pieces of porcelain of
                    oriental manufacture, which have been long used, cracks are seen in the
                    direction of their height, which are never perceived in the more perfect
                    porcelains of European manufacture.</p>
                <p>It has long been a very general opinion, that the Japanese porcelain is the most
                    perfect; it has indeed continued to be the object of admiration and emulation,
                    and has been held up as a model for the European manufacturer. But the taste of
                    Europeans having required a porcelain possessing the qualities of transparency
                    and whiteness in a greater degree than that of Japan, the attempts to imitate it
                    have been mostly confined to experiments. It has therefore been erroneously
                    contended that an article equal to the Japan porcelain cannot be produced in
                    Europe. The Saxon porcelain has been considered as inferior to the Japanese, on
                    account of its greater smoothness, lustre, and less granular aspect of its
                    internal texture; qualities in which it ought really to be regarded as superior
                    to the porcelain from Japan.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Porcelain Maìiufactories in different parts of
                    Europe.</hi></p>
                <p>Manufactories of porcelain have been long established in almost every country of
                    Europe, but from the experiments of Reaumur it would appear that the only kind
                    then manufactured was the soft porcelain, <hi rend="italic">ox</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">porcelaine tendre.</hi> It has been seen that the Saxon
                    manufacturers charged him with mistake in classing theirs with the soft
                    porcelain; but by admitting that he might have operated upon an article formerly
                    made by them, it is proved that all European porcelain was originally of this
                    kind. Besides that of Saxony, which was the first established in Europe,
                    porcelain is made to a considerable extent at Vienna, at Frankendal, in the
                    neighbourhood of Berlin, and in other places in the German states. The German
                    porcelains are similar to those of Saxony, and are composed of similar
                    materials, although from certain differences in the proportions, or in the modes
                    of managing the manufactories, considerable differences arise in the porcelains
                    manufactured at different places. When Μ. de la Condamine travelled into Italy,
                    he visited a manufacture of porcelain established at Florence by the Marquis de
                    la Ginor, who was at that time governor of Livorno. The French traveller was
                    particularly struck with the large size of some of the pieces of this porcelain.
                    Statues, and even groups of figures half as large as nature, and modelled from
                    some of the finest antiques, were formed of it. The furnaces, he observed, in
                    which the porcelain was subjected to the process of baking, were constructed
                    with a great deal of ingenuity, and were lined with bricks made of the same
                    materials as those which entered into the composition of the porcelain itself;
                    and hence they were able to resist the effects of high degrees of heat. The
                    paste of the porcelain manufactured at Florence appeared to be extremely
                    beautiful, and to possess all the qualities of the best oriental porcelain. The
                    glazing employed in this manufactory seemed to be inferior in whiteness, a
                    circumstance which is supposed to be owing to the desire of using those
                    materials only which are found in the country.</p>
                <p>It must be allowed that the labours of the French have been crowned with
                    wonderful success in the improvement and perfection of this manufacture. Some
                    time before even Reaumur communicated the result of his inquiries, porcelain was
                    manufactured at St. Cloud, and also in the suburb of St. Antoine at Paris. This
                    porcelain indeed was of the vitreous or fusible kind, but at the same time it
                    possessed no inconsiderable degree of beauty. Since the period to which we
                    allude, extensive manufactories of porcelain have been established at Villeroy,
                    Chantilly, and Orleans, and at those places the manufacture has been brought to
                    a high degree of perfection. But the great seat of the manufacture is now in the
                    Limousin, where the raw materials are found, and whence the porcelain in a white
                    state is sent to Paris and other places on the continent, to be ornamented. The
                    productions of the celebrated royal porcelain manufactory at Sevres, near Paris,
                    on account of the pure shining white, the fine glazing and coloured grounds, the
                    splendour and magnificence of the gilding, and the elegance and taste displayed
                    in the shape and figures, are universally allowed to surpass every thing of the
                    kind which has yet appeared. It must be remarked, however, that this manufactory
                    at Sèvres, wherein the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">porcelain
                    dure”</hi> is produced in so great a degree of perfection, is not carried on
                    with a view to profit, but has received occasional grants of money from the
                    government, as a national concern.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the French porcelain, we may notice the result of some researches
                    which were made on this subject <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538030"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8030-0435"/>by Guettard, and of which an account appeared in
                    the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, for the year 1765. In the neighbourhood
                    of Alençon, Μ. Guettard discovered a whitish argillaceous earth, in which he
                    found that mica considerably predominated. This earth he employed as a
                    substitute for kaolin. The substance which he used instead of the petuntse, he
                    obtained from a hard stone, which is described as a quartzose gritt stone, very
                    abundant in that country, and with which the streets of Alençon are paved. With
                    these materials Guettard instituted a series of experiments on porcelain,
                    previously to the year 1751, and was associated in his inquiries with the Duke
                    of Orleans. For many years the Count de Lauraguais, a member of the Academy of
                    Sciences, was keenly engaged in prosecuting experiments to discover the true
                    nature ofporcelain, and the means by which the manufacture might be improved and
                    perfected. To obtain the object of his researches, which was to produce
                    porcelain that in its essential qualities might be equal to that of eastern
                    countries, he spared no trouble or expense; and it would appear that he was not
                    unsuccessful in his labours; for in the year 1766, when he exhibited some
                    species of porcelain from his manufactory to the members of the Academy of
                    Sciences, the persons who were appointed by that learned body to examine their
                    properties, delivered it as their opinion, that of all the porcelain made in
                    France, that of the Count de Lauraguais approached most nearly in the essential
                    properties of solidity, texture, and infusibility, to that of China and Japan.
                    It is said, however, that it was considerably deficient in whiteness and lustre,
                    when compared with the ancient porcelain of Japan. The great interest, however,
                    created in France in support of this elegant and useful fabric, the continued
                    experiments of the ablest chemists and scientific men, with the discovery of
                    better materials which are abundant in the South of France, gave to that country
                    facilities which enabled her soon to take the lead of the continent and of
                    Britain in the production of this article.</p>
                <p>Porcelain manufactories have long been established at Tournay in Flanders. One of
                    these manufactories furnishes all Flanders with blue and white porcelain. At
                    this manufactory they have a particular process in forming cups and other
                    vessels. They are neither turned on the lathe, nor is the clay compressed in a
                    mould; but after being diluted in water, and when the liquid has acquired a
                    proper consistency, the workmen pour it into moulds, two or three hundred of
                    which are arranged together. λVhen they have filled them all, they return to the
                    first in the row. The liquid part is drawn off by a gentle inclination; the
                    surplus adheres to the side of the vessel, and thus forms the piece which it is
                    intended to make. The piece is detached from the mould by means of a slight
                    stroke; and after being sufficiently dried, it is conveyed to the furnace, to
                    undergo the process of baking.</p>
                <p>In England but little progress was made in the manufacture of porcelain, until
                    towards the end of the last century. At an earlier period there was a
                    manufactory carried on by some Germans at Chelsea, afterwards removed to Derby,
                    of porcelain of a very superior quality; but whence they derived their materials
                    is now uncertain. The porcelain which was then made at Liverpool, and some other
                    places, was of an inferior kind, and manufactured so thin, in order to procure
                    transparency, as to render it in a great degree unserviceable. This porcelain
                    was made of the clays from Devonshire, to which a frit, described hereafter, was
                    added to improve the colour of the body, and to create that degree of
                    transparency which was required by the public as a principal attribute of
                    porcelain.</p>
                <p>About the year 1768, the discovery in Cornwall ofmines of clay and stone similar
                    to those used in France and Germany, and which are believed to be the kaolin and
                    petuntse of the Chinese, soon enabled the English manufacturer to improve his
                    porcelain, by discontinuing the use of frit, or glass, as a component part of
                    the basis or body of the ware, and substituting a mixture of the fusible and
                    infusible earths as the basis of his porcelain, as had been done, at a much
                    earlier period, in Germany and France. And thus the English porcelain, in many
                    of its essential qualities, particularly in the beauty and richness of its
                    paintings and gildings, as well as the elegance of its forms, has become little,
                    if at all inferior, to that of any other country.</p>
                <p>There are in England a number of manufactories of porcelain, at Derby, at
                    Worcester, at Coalbrookdale, and at Rotherham, in Yorkshire. But the principal
                    site of this manufacture is now in the Staffordshire Potteries, where it is
                    produced in large quantities, at various manufactories.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Different Processes in the Manufacture of
                    Porcelain.</hi></p>
                <p>The basis of those porcelains which were respectively known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">vitreous, fusible,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> porcelain,
                    was in part composed of what was called a <hi rend="italic">frit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that is to say, a mixture of alkalis and siliceous earths,
                    brought into fusion, which, forming an opaque glass, was ground very fine, and
                    mixed with an infusible earth or clay, in quantity sufficient to produce a
                    degree of fusion, and consequent transparency of the whole body, but not so much
                    as to prevent the ductility necessary for the formation of the articles to be
                    made. The basis of the porcelains now generally made is composed of a mixture of
                    infusible and fusible earths, in those proportions which, on the application of
                    intense heat, produce that transparency and semi-vitrification which is required
                    as the distinguishing properties of porcelain.</p>
                <p>Up to a certain point, the operations and manipulations are the same in all
                    cases. The clay or infusible earth having been separated by washing from the
                    mass of decomposed granite, of which it forms a part, is mixed with a portion of
                    the fusible earth, finely livigated into aliquid of the consistence of cream,
                    which, after being passed through the finer silk lawns, is placed on kilns to
                    evaporate the superfluous water, until the mass becomes a soft tenacious paste,
                    ready for the operations of the workman. It is then taken to the thrower, to be
                    fashioned on his wheel; and having obtained a sufficient degree ofhardness to
                    preserve its form, is transferred to the lathe to be more correctly shaped, and
                    the surface made even. It next has handles, feet, and other requisites added,
                    and is then ready to receive its first firing. To effect this, it is, when
                    sufficiently dry, put into a case made of earthenware, and placed in the
                    furnace, that it may be subjected to the process of baking. These casesareknown
                    amongst the English potters by the name of <hi rend="italic">seggars</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">saggars,</hi> and they are generally formed of a coarser kind of
                    clay; but this clay must possess the property of resisting the action of heat
                    necessary for the baking of porcelain, without being fused. The porcelain
                    contained in the cases is thus protected from the smoke of the burning fuel. The
                    whiteness of the porcelain depends greatly on the purity of the clay of which
                    the <hi rend="italic">saggars</hi> are made, so that being of a more compact
                    texture, the smoke is more effectually excluded. These cases are arranged in the
                    furnace or kiln in piles, one upon the other, to the top of the furnace.</p>
                <p>À small fire is first made, that the furnaces may be gradually heated; and it is
                    increased more and more until the process of baking is completed, that is, until
                    the porcelain shall have acquired a proper degree of hardness and transparency.
                    To ascertain this point, much attention is necessary, by taking out of the
                    furnace from time to time, and examining, small pieces of porcelain placed for
                    that purpose in some cases, which have lateral openings in the walls of the
                    furnace to render them accessible. When it appears, from the examination of
                    those pieces, that the porcelain is sufficiently baked, the fire is no longer to
                    be supplied with fuel; the furnace is allowed to cool gradually, and the
                    porcelain is afterwards taken out.</p>
                <p>But at this point of the process of baking, or firing, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538043" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8043-0436"/>modes adopted in France, and
                    on the continent generally, arc materially different from the practice in this
                    country; in fact, are totally reversed. In England the first, or biscuit firing,
                    is employed to produce, by an intense heat, the required degree of transparency
                    and vitrification; whilst in France but a small degree of heat is applied,
                    sufficient only to harden <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dégourdir</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> the ware, so that it may bear the
                    manipulation necessary before the glazing, without breaking, the transparency
                    and strength being obtained at the second operation of firing, which, like the
                    English biscuitfiring, requires an intense heat to accomplish that object.</p>
                <p>Unglazed porcelain has the appearance of white marble, having nothing of that
                    shining surface which it acquires by covering it with the vitreous composition
                    called glaze, and is said to be in the state of <hi rend="italic">biscuit.</hi>
                    For particular purposes, the porcelain is sometimes allowed to remain in this
                    state, and particularly when it is employed in smaller and finer pieces of
                    sculpture, where the fineness of the workmanship and the sharpness of the
                    figures are wished to be preserved, as it is well known that these will be
                    greatly injured by being covered with a coat of glazing. The celebrated
                    manufactory of Sevres has long been distinguished for figures or small statues,
                    and even for larger works, as ornamental vases, &amp;c., which are left in the
                    state of biscuit. The English manufactories are probably not inferior in the
                    delicacy and accuracy of execution of ornamental productions of this kind.</p>
                <p>The next operation in the manufacture of porcelain is the process of glazing.
                    This process consists in covering the porcelain with a thin coat of vitreous or
                    fusible matter, which adds greatly to its beauty, by its lustre or shining
                    appearance. In preparing and applying the materials fit for glazing porcelain,
                    it has been found that the same mixture will not admit of general application;
                    for it appears, that what forms a fine glazing for one kind of porcelain, will
                    not answer the same purpose when applied to another. In the former it may have
                    all the necessary requisites, but in the latter it may crack in many places, may
                    have no lustre, and may contain bubbles, or be apt to scale oft’. The first
                    thing, then, is to prepare a glaze which shall be suited to the nature of the
                    porcelain for which it is intended. The glazing must be appropriated to each
                    kind of porcelain, that is, to the ingredients which enter into its composition,
                    or to the degree of hardness or density of the ware. The materials of which the
                    glazing is composed are prepared by previously fusing together all the
                    substances of which they consist, and thus forming a vitreous mass. This mass of
                    vitrified matter must be finely ground in a mill, and the vitreous powder thus
                    obtained be mixed with a sufficient quantity of water, so that the liquor shall
                    have the consistence of cream of milk. The pieces of porcelain are to be covered
                    with a thin coating of this matter, which is done by immersing them hastily in
                    the liquid, and as they greedily imbibe the water, there remains on the surface
                    a uniform covering of the glazing materials. This covering, which, it must be
                    observed, should be very thin, in a short time becomes so dry, that it does not
                    adhere to the fingers when the pieces are handled. When they are sufficiently
                    dry, they are replaced in the fiirnace in the same manner as in preparing the
                    biscuit, and the heat is continued till the glazing be completely fused; but the
                    degree of heat necessary for that purpose is far inferior to that which is
                    requisite in baking the paste. As before noticed, however, this does not apply
                    to the French porcelains, the glazing of which is effected by a higher degree of
                    heat than what is applied to the paste or body.</p>
                <p>The glaze used for the soft porcelain possessed great advantages in the execution
                    of the more delicate paintings and decorations, by its property of assisting to
                    flux and fix with more certainty the metallic oxides of which the colours are
                    composed. The old Sèvres chinais of this description. But at that royal
                    manufactory, under the able direction of Μ. Brogniat, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >porcelaine</hi><hi rend="italic">dure,</hi> now the only kind made there, has
                    been so much improved, as to admit of its being embellished by paintings of the
                    most delicate and brilliant colours and superb grounds, with gilding equal, if
                    not superior, to the old Sevres.</p>
                <p>The pieces of porcelain which are intended to remain white are now finished, but
                    those which are to be ornamented with painting and gilding must go through
                    various other operations. The colours which are employed in painting porcelain
                    on the glaze are similar to those which are applied in the painting of enamel.
                    They are all composed of metallic oxides or calces, combined with a very fusible
                    vitreous matter. The different colours are obtained from different metals. The
                    oxides of iron afford a red colour; gold, precipitated by means of tin,
                    furnishes a purple and violet colour; copper, precipitated from its solution in
                    acids by means of an alkali, gives a fine green; cobalt, or when combined with
                    vitreous matter, <hi rend="italic">zaffar,</hi> as it is called, yields a fine
                    blue. Earthy matters which are slightly feruginous, produce a yellow colour; and
                    brown and black colours are obtained from iron in different states, and from
                    manganese. The oxide of chrome, which has but lately come into use, has
                    furnished artists with greens and some other colours, of a brilliancy and
                    fixedness in the fire not before known. These colours are applied to the ware by
                    the painters according to the requisite pattern, and it is again conveyed to the
                    furnace, and the colours are vitrified, to give them the proper degree of
                    fixation and lustre. In the common kind of porcelain, once or twice burning is
                    sufficient, but in the finer decorations the colours must be laid on several
                    times, and as often fired before the full effect can be produced. This process
                    is similar to that practised by enamel-lers on copper, &amp;c.; but the blue
                    colour from cobalt is much used for painting on the biscuit ware before
                    glazing.</p>
                <p>The discovery of a method of imitating the painted patterns of the Chinese by
                    impressions taken from engraved copper plates, was of great importance, as it
                    enabled the European manufacturers to compete with the cheap labour of the
                    Chinese. This discovery is due to a manufacturer at Liverpool, where porcelain
                    was formerly made. The process is as follows. The pattern being engraved on a
                    copper plate of the size wanted, it is charged with the colour to be used, which
                    is mixed with boiled linseed oil; the plate is then placed on a hot stove, and a
                    piece of thin tissue paper, previously primed with a solution on one side of
                    soft soap, is laid upon the plate, and both passed through the rollars of the
                    press as in ordinary printing. The impression is then taken off, and transferred
                    on to the ware. After being well rubbed with a roller of flannel, to cause the
                    colour and oil to adhere to the ware, the piece is then put into lukewarm water,
                    where the paper, by the action of the soap, leaves the ware and the colour upon
                    it. The ware is next dried, and subjected to a degree of heat, to evaporate the
                    oils, and the ware is then in a condition for the glazing.</p>
                <p>But when the pieces of porcelain are to be further decorated with gilding, they
                    are pencilled with a mixture of oil and gold, dissolved or thrown down by
                    quicksilver with the aid of heat, and are again introduced into the furnace.
                    Here the gold returns to its solid state, but comes out with a dull surface; and
                    to recover its lustre and usual brilliancy, it is burnished with blood-stones,
                    and other polishing substances. Much care and attention are necessary in the
                    latter part of the process; for if the gold be not sufficiently burned, it will
                    be apt to separate in thin flakes; and if it have been exposed to too great a
                    heat, it is not susceptible of a fine polish. In this manufactory, when pieces
                    of porcelain are to be finished in the highest style, they are frequently
                    returned to the enamel furnace, where the colours are fluxed six or seven
                    different times; and having gone through the processes now described, the
                    porcelain is fit for the market.</p>

                <p>The use of platina in porcelain painting has been recommended by Klaproth; and
                    experiments have been made on the subject by that celebrated chemist, with the
                    view of ascertaining its effects for this purpose. In concluding his
                    observations, he says, “The process which I employ in the application of platina
                    to painting on porcelain is simple and easy. I dissolve crude platina in aqua
                    regia, and precipitate it by a saturated solution of sal-ammoniac in water. The
                    red crystalline precipitate thence produced is dried, and being reduced to a
                    very fine powder, is slowly brought to a red heat in a glass retort. As the
                    volatile neutral salt combined with the platina in this precipitate becomes
                    sublimated, the metallic part remains behind in the form of a gray soft powder.
                    This powder is then subjected to the same process as gold; that is to say, it is
                    mixed with a small quantity of the same flux as that used for gold, and being
                    ground with oil of spike, is applied with a brush on the porcelain; after which
                    it is burned-in under the muffle of an enameller’s furnace, and then polished
                    with a burnishing tool.</p>
                <p>“The colour of platina burnt into porcelain in this manner is a silver white,
                    inclining a little to a steel gray. If the platina be mixed in different
                    portions with gold, different shades of colour may be obtained; the gradations
                    of which maybe numbered, from the white colour of unmixed platina to the yellow
                    colour of gold. Platina is capable of receiving a considerable addition of gold
                    before the transi-. tion from the white colour to yellow is perceptible. Thus,
                    for example, in a mixture of four parts of gold and one of platina, no signs of
                    the gold were to be observed, and the white colour could scarcely be
                    distinguished from that of unmixed platina: it was only when eight parts of gold
                    to one of platina were employed that the gold colour assumed the
                    superiority.</p>
                <p>“I tried in the like manner different mixtures of platina and silver; but the
                    colour produced was dull, and did not seem proper for painting on porcelain.</p>
                <p>“Besides this method of burning-in platina in substance on porcelain, it maybe
                    employed also in its dissolved state; in which case it gives a different result
                    both in its colour and splendour. The solution of it in aqua regia is
                    evaporated, and the thickened residuum is then applied several times in
                    succession to the porcelain. The metallic matter thus penetrates into the
                    substance of the porcelain itself, and forms a metallic mirror of the colour and
                    splendour of polished steel.”</p>

                    Earthenware.</hi></p>
                <p>Convinced that every accurate and scientific investigation into the nature and
                    processes of any important art, will always be deemed of some value to the
                    philosophical observer, or the enlightened manufacturer, we shall introduce the
                    following observations on the principles of the manufacture of porcelain and
                    earthenware.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Observatio7is by Vauquelin.</hi></p>
                <p>According to this celebrated chemist, four things may occasion differences in the
                    qualities of earthenware; first, the nature or composition of the matter;
                    second, the mode of preparation; third, the dimensions given to the vessels;
                    fourth, the baking to which they are subjected. By composition of the matter,
                    the author understands the nature and proportions of the elements of which it is
                    formed. These elements in the greater part of earthen ware, either valuable or
                    common, are silex, argil, lime, and sometimes a little oxide of iron. Hence it
                    is evident that it is not so much by the diversity of the elements that good
                    earthenware differs from bad, as by the proportion in which they arc united.
                    Silex or quartz makes always two-thirds at least of earthenware; argil or pure
                    clay, from a fifth to a third; lime from 5 to 20 parts in the hundred; and iron
                    from 0 to 12 or 15 parts in the hundred. Silex gives hardness, infusibility, and
                    unalterability; argil makes the paste pliable, and renders it fit to be kneaded,
                    moulded, and turned at pleasure. It possesses, at the same time, the property
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> being partially fused by the heat which unites its
                    parts with those of the silex; but it must not be too abundant, or it would
                    render the earthen ware too fusible, and too brittle to be used over the
                    fire.</p>
                <p>Hitherto it has not been proved by experience that lime is necessary in the
                    composition of pottery; and if traces of it are constantly found in that
                    substance, it is because it is always mixed with the other earths, from which
                    the washings and other manipulations have not been able to separate it. When
                    this earth, however, does not exceed five or six parts in a hundred, it appears
                    that it is not hurtful to the quality of the pottery; but if more abundant it
                    renders it too fusible· The oxide of iron, besides the inconvenience of
                    communicating a red or brown colour, according to the degree of baking, to the
                    vessels in which it forms a part, has the property of rendering them fusible,
                    and even in a greater degree than lime.</p>
                <p>As some kinds of pottery are destined to melt very penetrating substances, such
                    as salts, metallic oxides, glass, &amp;c.] they require a fine kind of paste,
                    which is obtained only by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> reducing the earths
                    employed to very minute particles. Others destined for melting metals, and
                    substances not very penetrating, and which must be able to support, without
                    breaking, a sudden transition from great heat to great cold, require for their
                    fabrication a mixture of calcined argil with raw argil. By these means you
                    obtain pottery, the coarse paste of which resembles <hi rend="italic"
                    >lrreche,</hi> or small-grained pudding-stone, and which can endure sudden
                    changes of temperature.</p>
                <p>The baking of pottery is likewise an object of great importance. The heat must be
                    capable of expelling humidity, and agglutinating the parts which enter into the
                    composition of the paste, but not strong enough to produce fusion; which, if too
                    far advanced, gives to pottery a homogeneousness that renders it brittle. The
                    same effect takes place in regard to the fine pottery, because the very minute
                    division given to the earths reduces them nearly to the same state as if this
                    matter had been fused. This is the reason why porcelain strongly baked is more
                    or less brittle, and cannot easily endure alternations of temperature. Hence
                    coarse porcelain, in the composition of which a certain quantity of calcined
                    argil is employed, porcelain retorts, crucibles, tubes, and common pottery, the
                    paste of which ψ coarse, are much less brittle than dishes and saucers formed of
                    the same substance, but ground with more labour.</p>
                <p>The general and respective dimensions of the different parts of vessels of
                    earthenware, have also considerable influence on their capability to stand the
                    fire. In some cases ' the glazing or covering, especially when too thick, and of
                    a nature different from the body of the pottery, also renders them liable to
                    break. Thus, in making some kinds of pottery, it is always essential, first, to
                    follow the best pro portion in the principles; secondly,to give to the particles
                    of the paste, by grinding, a minuteness suited to the purpose for which it is
                    intended, and to all the parts the same dimensions as far as possible; thirdly,
                    to carry the baking to the highest degree that the matter can bear without being
                    fused; and fourthly, to apply the glazing in thin layers, the fusibility of
                    which ought to approach as near as possible to that of the matter, in order that
                    it may be more intimately united.</p>
                <p>Μ. Vauquelin, being persuaded that the quality of good pottery depends chiefly on
                    using proper proportions of the earthy matter, thought it might be of importance
                    to those engaged in this branch of manufacture, to make known the analysis of
                    different natural clays employed for this pur<pb break="no" facs="nls:193538069"

                    order that, when a new earth is discovered, it may be known by a simple analysis
                    whether it will be proper for the same object, and to what kind of pottery
                    already known it bears the greatest resemblance.</p>

                    which are used in Spain for cooling the water intended to be drunk. These
                    vessels consist of 60 parts of calcareous earth, mixed with alumina and a little
                    oxide of iron, and 36½ of siliceous earth, also mixed with alumina and the same
                    oxide. The quantity of iron may be estimated at almost one hundredth part of the
                    whole. This earth is first kneaded into a tough paste, being for that purpose
                    previously diluted with water; then formed into a cake of about six inches in
                    thickness, and left in that state until it begin to crack. It is then kneaded
                    with the feet, the workman gradually adding to it a quantity of sea-salt, in the
                    proportion of seven pounds to a hundred and fifty; after which it is applied to
                    the lathe, and baked in any kind of furnace used by potters. The alcarrezes,
                    however, are only about half as much baked as the better kinds of common
                    earthenware; and being exceedingly porous, water oozes through them on all
                    sides. Hence the air which comes in contact with it, by causing it to evaporate,
                    carries off the caloric contained in the water in the vessel, which is thus
                    rendered remarkably cool.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Observations of Erongniart on the Colours used for
                    Enamelling.</hi></p>
                <p>The art of employing metallic oxides for colouring by fusion different vitreous
                    matters, is of very great antiquity. Every body knows that the ancients
                    manufactured coloured glass and enamel, and that this art was practised in
                    particular by the Egyptians, the first people who in this manner imitated
                    precious stones. The practice of this art in modem times has been carried to a
                    high degree of perfection; but the theory has been neglected. It is almost the
                    only one of the chemical arts in which no attempt has yet been made to apply the
                    new principles of that science. It is well known that all vitrifiable colours
                    have for their basis metallic oxides; but all the metallic oxides are not proper
                    for this purpose; besides, as they are not vitrifiable by themselves, they can
                    scarcely ever be employed alone.</p>
                <p>Highly volatile oxides, and those which adhere little to the great quantity of
                    oxygen they contain, either cannot be employed in any manner, as the oxide of
                    mercury and that of arsenic, or are employed only as agents. The colour they
                    present cannot be depended on, since they must lose it in the slightest heat by
                    losing a part of their oxygen. Such are the puce-coloured and red oxides of
                    lead, the yellow oxides of gold, and some others. Oxides in which the
                    proportions of oxygen are susceptible of varying with too much facility, are
                    rarely employed. The oxide of iron, though black, is never employed for
                    producing that colour; and the green oxide of copper is, under many
                    circumstances, very uncertain. We have said that oxides alone are not
                    susceptible of fusion. However, as they are destined to be applied to thin
                    strata upon vitrifiable substances, they may be attached to them by a violent
                    heat. But, excepting the oxides oflead and bismuth, they would give only dull
                    colours. The violent heat, often necessary to fix them, would change or totally
                    destroy the colours. A flux then is added to all metallic oxides.</p>
                <p>This flux is glass, lead, and silex; glass of borax, or a mixture of both. Its
                    gene&gt;d effect is to give splendour to the colours after their fusion; to fix
                    them upon the article which is painted, by promoting more or less the softening
                    of its surface; to envelope the metallic oxides, and to preserve their colour,
                    by sheltering them from the contact of the air; in a word, to facilitate the
                    fusion of the colour at a low temperature not capable of destroying it.</p>
                <p>But we shall speak here only of the application of metallic colours to vitreous
                    bodies, or to vitreous surfaces. These bodies may be divided into three classes,
                    very distinct by the nature of the substances which compose them, the er- ∙fects
                    produced on them by the colours, and the changes they experience. These crusts
                    are, first, enamel, soft porcelain, and all crusts, enamels, or glass, that
                    contain lead in a notable quantity; secondly, hard porcelain, or porcelain which
                    has a crust of feldspar; thirdly, glass in the composition of which no lead
                    enters, such as common window-glass. We shall here examine in succession the
                    principles of the composition of these colours, and the general phenomena they
                    exhibit on these three kinds of bodies.</p>
                <p>It is well known that enamel is glass rendered opaque by the oxide of tin, and
                    exceedingly fusible by the oxide of lead. It is the oxide of lead, in
                    particular, contained in it, that gives it properties very different from those
                    of the other excipients of metallic colours. Thus all glass and glazing that
                    contain lead, will participate in the properties of enamel·; and what we shall
                    say of one may be applied to the rest with very trifling differences. Such are
                    the white and transparent glazing of stoneware, and the glazing of porcelain
                    called <hi rend="italic">soft glazing.</hi></p>
                <p>Enamel or soft porcelain colours require muchless flux than others, because the
                    glass upon which they are applied becomes sufficiently soft to be penetrated by
                    them. This flux may be either glass of lead and pure silex, called <hi
                    rend="italic">rocaille,</hi> or the same glass mixed with borax. Montamy asserts
                    that glass of lead ought to be banished from among the enamel fluxes; and he
                    employs only borax. He then dilutes his colours in a volatile oil. On the other
                    hand, the painters of the manufactory of Sèvres employ only colours without
                    borax, because they dilute them in gum; and borax does not dilute well in that
                    substance. Brogniart found that both methods were equally good; and it is
                    certain that Montamy was wrong to exclude fluxes of lead, since they are daily
                    employed without any inconvenience, and as they even render the application of
                    colours easier.</p>
                <p>We have said that in the baking of these colours, the crust, softened by the
                    fire, suffers itself to be easily penetrated by them. This is the first cause of
                    the change which they experience. By mixing with the crust they become weaker,
                    and the first heat changes a figure which appeared to be finished into a very
                    light sketch.</p>
                <p>The two principal causes of the changes which colours on enamel and soft
                    porcelain are susceptible of experiencing do not depend in any manner upon the
                    composition of these colours, but upon the nature of the glass to which they are
                    applied. It follows from what has been said, that pain*</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538082" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8082-0439"/>
                <p>ing on soft porcelain has need of being several times retouched, and of several
                    heats, in order that it may be carried to the necessary degree of strength.
                    These paintings have always a certain faintness; but they are constantly more
                    brilliant, and they never are attended with the inconvenience of detaching
                    themselves in scales.</p>
                <p>Hard porcelain, according to the division which Brogniart established, is the
                    second sort of excipient of metallic colours. This porcelain, as is well known,
                    has for its base a very white clay called <hi rend="italic">kaolin,</hi> mixed
                    with a siliceous and calcareous flux, and for its covering feldspar fused
                    without an atom of lead. The same porcelain, which is that of Saxony, is much
                    newer at Sevres than the soft porcelain. The colours applied to it are of two
                    kinds. The first, destined to represent different objects, are baked in a heat
                    very inferior to that which is necessary for baking porcelain. They arc
                    exceedingly numerous and varied. The others, destined to be fused in the same
                    heat as that which bakes porcelain, lay themselves flat, and are much less
                    numerous. The colours of painting are made nearly like those destined for soft
                    porcelain; they only contain more flux. Their flux is composed of glass of lead
                    and borax. When porcelain is exposed to heat in order to bake the colours, the
                    covering of feldspar dilates itself and opens its pores, but does not become
                    soft; and as the colours do not penetrate it, they experience none of those
                    changes which they undergo on soft porcelain. It must however be said that they
                    lose a little of their intensity by acquiring that transparency which is given
                    to them by fusion.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest inconveniences of these colours, especially in the
                    manufactory of Sèvres, is the facility with which they scale off when exposed
                    several times in the fire. To remedy this defect without altering the quality of
                    the paste, Brogniart was of opinion that the crust only ought to be softened by
                    introducing into it more siliceous or calcareous flux, according to the nature
                    of the feldspar. This method succeeded, and being employed, the colours might be
                    exposed two or three times to the fire without scaling, if not overcharged with
                    flux, and laid on too thick.</p>
                <p>The third sort of excipient of vitrifiable metallic colours is glass without
                    lead. The application of these colours to glass constitutes painting on glass;
                    an art very much practised some centuries ago, and which was supposed to be lost
                    because out of fashion; but it has too direct a dependence on painting in enamel
                    and porcelain to be entirely lost.</p>
                <p>The matters and fluxes which enter into the composition of the colours employed
                    on glass are in general the same as those applied to porcelain. Neither of them
                    differ except in their proportions; but there are a great number of enamel or
                    porcelain colours which cannot be applied to glass, where they are deprived of
                    the white ground that serves to give them relief.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Colours in particular.</hi></p>
                <p>After collecting the general phenomena exhibited by each class of vitrifiable
                    colours, considered in regard to the body on which they are applied, we shall
                    now make known the most interesting particular phenomena exhibited by each
                    principal kind of colours employed upon soft porcelain and glass in a porcelain
                    furnace.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Feds, Purples, and Violets, made from Gold.</hi></p>
                <p>Carmine red is obtained by the purple precipitate of cassius. It is mixed with
                    about six parts of its flux; and this mixture is employed directly, without
                    being fused. It is then of a dirty violet, but by baking it acquires a beautiful
                    red carmine colour. It is, however, exceedingly delicate; but a little too much
                    heat and carbonaceous vapours easily spoil it. On this account it is more
                    beautiful when baked with charcoal than with wood.</p>
                <p>This colour and the purple, which is very little different, as well as all the
                    shades obtained from it by mixing it with other colours, really change on all
                    porcelain and in every hand. But it is the only one which changes on hard
                    porcelain. Its place may be supplied by a rose-colour from iron which does not
                    change; so that by suppressing the carmine made with gold, and substituting for
                    it the rose oxide of iron here alluded to, a palette may be exhibited, composed
                    of colours none of which changes in a remarkable manner. This rose-coloured
                    oxide of iron has long been known; but it was not employed on enamel, because on
                    that substance it changed too much. As the painters on enamel, however, have
                    become the painters on porcelain, they have preserved their ancient method.</p>
                <p>It might be believed that, by first reducing to a vitreous matter the colour
                    called <hi rend="italic">carmine</hi> already mixed with its flux, it might be
                    made to assume its last tint. But the heat necessary to fuse this vitreous mass
                    destroys the red colour. Besides, it is remarked that, to obtain this colour
                    very beautiful, it must be exposed to the fire as few times as possible. The
                    carmine for soft porcelain is made with fulminating gold slowly decomposed, and
                    muriate of silver; no tin enters into it, which proves that the combination of
                    the oxide of this metal with that of gold is not necessary to the existence of
                    the purple colour. Violet is also made with purple oxide of gold. A greater
                    quantity of lead in the flux is what gives it this colour, which is almost the
                    same crude or baked. These three colours totally disappear when exposed to a
                    great porcelain heat.</p>
                <p>Carmine and purple give us in glass only tints of a dirty violet. The violet, on
                    the other hand, produces on glass a very beautiful effect, but it is liable to
                    turn blue. We have not been able to discover the cause of this singular
                    change.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fed, Rose, and Frown Colours, extracted from Iron.</hi></p>
                <p>These colours arc made from red oxide of iron prepared with nitric acid. The
                    oxides are further calcined by keeping them exposed to the action of heat; but
                    if heated too much, they pass to brown. Their flux is composed of borax, sand,
                    and minium, in small quantity.</p>
                <p>These oxides give rose and red colours capable of supplying the place of the same
                    colours made with oxide of gold. When properly employed upon hard porcelain,
                    they do not change at all. We have caused roses to be painted with these
                    colours, and found no difference between the baked flower and that not baked,
                    except what might be expected to result from the brilliancy given to colours by
                    fusion.</p>
                <p>These colours may be employed indiscriminately, either previously fused or not
                    fused. In a great heat they in part disappear, or produce a dull brick ground,
                    which is not agreeable. The composition of them is the same both for soft
                    porcelain and for glass They do not change on the latter; but on soft porcelain
                    they disappear almost entirely on the first exposure to heat, and to make any
                    thing remain they must be employed very deep. This singular effect must be
                    ascribed to the presence of lead in the crust or glazing. We assured ourselves
                    of this by a very simple experiment. We placed this colour on window glass, and
                    having exposed it to a strong baking, it did not change. We covered several
                    parts of it with minium; and on again exposing it to the fire, the colour was
                    totally removed in the places where the red oxide of lead had been applied. By
                    performing this operation on a larger scale in close vessels, a large quantity
                    of oxygen gas was disengaged.</p>
                <p>It appears to us that the observation here referred to clearly proves the action
                    of oxidated lead on glass as a destroyer of colour; it is seen that it does not
                    act, as was believed, by burning the combustible bodies, which might tarnish the
                    glass, but by dissolving, discolouring, or volatilizing with it the oxide of
                    iron, which might alter its transparency, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538095"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8095-0440"/><hi rend="italic">Yellows.</hi></p>
                <p>∖ ellows are colours which require a great deal of care in the fabrication, on
                    account of the lead which they contain, and which, approaching sometimes to the
                    metallic state, produces on them dark spots. The yellows for hard and soft
                    porcelain are the same; they are composed of the oxide of lead, white oxide of
                    antimony, and sand.</p>
                <p>Oxide of tin is sometimes mixed with them; and when it is required to have them
                    more lively, and nearer the colour <hi rend="italic">du souci,</hi> red oxide of
                    iron is added, the too great redness of which is dissipated in the previous
                    fusion to which they are exposed by the action of the lead contained in this
                    yellow. These colours, when once made, never change; they disappear, however,
                    almost entirely when exposed to a porcelain heat.</p>
                <p>These yellows cannot be applied to glass, because they are too opaque and dirty.
                    That employed by the old painters on glass has, on the contrary, a beautiful
                    transparency, and is exceedingly brilliant, and of a colour which approaches
                    near to that of gold. The processes which they gave clearly showed that silver
                    formed part of their composition; but, when exactly followed, nothing
                    satisfactory was obtained. Μ. Miraud found means to make as beautiful paintings
                    on glass as the ancients, by employing muriate of silver, oxide of zinc, white
                    argil, and yellow oxide of iron. These colours were applied on glass merely
                    pounded, and without a flux. The oxide of iron brought the yellow to that colour
                    which it ought to have after baking, and contributed with the argil and oxide of
                    zinc to decompose the muriate of silver without deoxidating the silver. After
                    the baking, there remained a dust which had not penetrated into the glass, and
                    which was easily removed.</p>
                <p>This yellow, when employed thicker, gives darker shades, and produces a russet
                    colour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blues.</hi></p>
                <p>It is well known that blues are obtained from the oxide of cobalt. All chemists
                    arc acquainted with the preparation of them. Those of Sèvres, which are justly
                    esteemed for their beauty, are indebted for it solely to the care employed in
                    manufacturing them, and to the quality of the porcelain, which appears more
                    proper for receiving them in proportion to the degree of heat which it can
                    bear.</p>
                <p>Respecting the oxide of cobalt, we may remark a fact which is perhaps not known
                    to chemists; namely, its volatility in a violent heat. It is to this property
                    that we must ascribe the bluish tint always assumed by white in the
                    neighbourhood of the blue.</p>
                <p>The blue of hard porcelain, destined for what is called the ground of a great
                    heat <hi rend="italic">(les fonds au</hi><hi rend="italic">grand feu)</hi> is
                    fused with feldspar; that of soft porcelain has for its flux silex, potash, and
                    lead. It is not volatilized like the preceding; but the heat which it
                    experiences is very inferior to that of hard porcelain. These colours, when
                    previously fused, do not change at all in the application. Blues on glass
                    exhibit the same phenomena as those on soft porcelain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Greens.</hi></p>
                <p>The greens employed in painting are made with green oxide of copper, or sometimes
                    with a mixture of yellow or blue. They must be previously fused with their flux,
                    otherwise they will become black; but after this first fusion they no longer
                    change. They cannot stand a strong heat, as it would make them disappear
                    entirely. Green grounds for a strong heat are composed with the oxides of cobalt
                    and nickel, but a brownish green only is obtained.</p>
                <p>Bluish greens, called <hi rend="italic">celestial blues,</hi> which were formerly
                    colours very much in vogue, can be applied only upon soft porcelain; on hard
                    porcelain they consequently become scaly, because potash enters into their
                    composition. These greens cannot be applied on glass, because they give a dirty
                    colour. To obtain a green on glass, it is necessary to put yellow on one side,
                    and blue, more or less pale, on the other. This colour may be also made by a
                    mixture of blue with yellow oxide of iron.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bistres and Russets.</hi></p>
                <p>These are obtained by mixtures, in different proportions, of manganese, brown
                    oxide of copper, and oxide of iron from ombre earth. They are also previously
                    fused with their flux, so that they do not in any manner change on soft
                    porcelain, since lead has not the same action on oxide of manganese as on that
                    of iron. This colour fades very speedily on glass.</p>
                <p>Russet grounds in a great heat, known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tortoise-shell grounds,</hi> are made in the same manner. Their flux is
                    feldspar; and no titanium enters into their composition, though it is so stated
                    in all printed works. Titanium was not known at the manufactory of Sèvres when
                    Brogniart arrived there. He treated this singular metal in various ways, and
                    never obtained any but grounds of a pale dirty yellow, and very variable in
                    tone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blacks.</hi></p>
                <p>Blacks are the colours the most difficult to be obtained of a very beautiful hue.
                    No metallic oxide alone gives a beautiful black. Manganese is that which
                    approaches nearest to it. Iron gives an opaque, dull, cloudy black, which
                    changes very easily to red; the colour-makers, therefore, to obtain a black
                    which they could not hope for from the best theorist, have united several
                    metallic oxides which separately do not give black, and have obtained a very
                    beautiful colour, which, however, is liable to become sealyand dull. These
                    oxides are those of manganese, the brown oxides of copper, and a little of the
                    oxide of cobalt. The grey is obtained by suppressing the copper, and increasing
                    the dose of the flux.</p>
                <p>The manufactory of Sèvres is the only one which has hitherto produced beautiful
                    blacks in a strong heat. This is owing rather to the quality of its paste than
                    to any peculiar processes, since it does not conceal them. It is by darkening
                    the blue by the oxides of manganese and iron that they are able in that
                    manufactory to obtain very brilliant blacks.</p>
                <p>Having here made known the principles of the fabrication of each principal
                    colour, it may be readily conceived that by mixing these colours together all
                    the shades possible may be obtained. It is evident also that care in the
                    preparation, choice in the raw materials, and a just proportion of doses, must
                    produce in the result, differences very sensible to an eye accustomed to
                    painting. A mere knowledge of the composition of the colours does not give the
                    talent of executing them well.</p>
                <p>From the facts above mentioned, it is therefore seen, 1st, That amongst colours
                    generally employed on hard porcelain one only is susceptible of changing, viz.
                    carmine, and the tints into which it enters; that its place may be supplied by
                    the reds of iron, and that no colour then changes. 2d, That amongst the colours
                    for soft porcelain and enamel, several change in a considerable degree. These
                    are principally the reds of gold and iron, the yellows, the greens, and the
                    browns. They have not been replaced by others, because this kind of painting has
                    been almost abandoned. 3d, That several of the colours on glass change also by
                    acquiring complete transparency. These, in particular, are the yellows and
                    green. 4th, That it is neither by calcining the colours in a higher degree, nor
                    previously fusing them, as supposed by seme, that they are prevented from
                    changing, since these means really alter the changing colours, and produce no
                    effect on the rest. The change which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8108-0441"/>several colours experience upon soft porcelain and
                    upon glass does not depend on the nature of their composition, but rather on
                    that of the body upon which they are applied.</p>
                <p>It follows, then, that, by suppressing from the colours of hard porcelain the
                    carmine of gold, which is by no means indispensably necessary, we shall have a
                    series of colours which do not change, or, in other words, remain unalterable.
                    So much for the colours employed in this manufacture. x. x.</p>
