                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">POLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Reginald</hi></label>, cardinal,
                    and archbishop of Canterbury, a younger son of Sir Richard Pole, Lord Montague,
                    was born at Stoverton Castle, in Staffordshire, in the year 1500. At seven years
                    of age he was sent to a Carthusian monasteryat Shene, near Richmond, in Surrey;
                    and thence, when he was about twelve years old, removed to Magdalen College, in
                    Oxford, where, by the instruction of the celebrated Linacre and Latimer, he made
                    considerable progress in learning. In 1515 he took the degree of bachelor of
                    arts, and was admitted to deacon’s orders some time afterwards; in 1517, he was
                    made prebendary of Salisbury, and in 1519 dean of Wimborne and dean of Exeter.
                    We are not surprised at this young nobleman’s early preferments, when we
                    consider him as the kinsman of Henry VIII. and that he was bred to the church by
                    the king’s special command.</p>
                <p>Being now about the age of nineteen, he was sent, according to the fashion of the
                    times, to finish his studies at Padua, in Italy, where he resided some time in
                    great splendour, having a handsome pension from the king. In 1525 he returned to
                    England, where he was most graciously received at court, and universally admired
                    for his talents and address; but preferring study and sequestration to the
                    pleasures of a court, he retired to the Carthusian convent<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535534" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5534-0247"/> at Shene, where he had
                    continued about two years, when the pious king began to divulge his scruples of
                    conscience concerning his maιτiage with Catharine of Spain. Pole foresaw that
                    this affair would necessarily involve him in difficulties; he therefore
                    determined to quit'the kingdom, and accordingly obtained leave to visit Paris.
                    Having thus avoided the storm for the present, he returned once more to his
                    convent at Shene; but his tranquillity was again interrupted by the king’s
                    resolution to shake off the pope’s supremacy, of which Pole’s approbation was
                    thought indispensably necessary. How he managed in this affair is not very
                    clear. However, he obtained leave to revisit Italy, and his pension was
                    continued for some time.</p>
                <p>The king, having now divorced Queen Catharine, married Anne Boleyn; and being
                    resolved to throw off the papal yoke, ordered Dr Richard Sampson to write a book
                    in justification of his proceedings, which he sent to Pole for his opinion. To
                    this Pole, secure in the pope’s protection, wrote a vehement answer, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Pro</hi><hi rend="italic">Unitate</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiasi-cα,</hi> and sent it to the king, who was so much offended with the
                    contents, that he withdrew his pension, stripped him of all his preferments, and
                    procured an act of attainder to be passed against him. In the mean time, Pole
                    was created a cardinal, and sent in quality of nuncio to different parts of
                    Europe. Henry made several attempts to have him secured and brought to England,
                    but all of them proved abortive. At length the pope fixed him as legate at
                    Viterbo, where he continued till the year 1543, when he was appointed legate at
                    the council of Trent, and was afterwards employed by the pope as his chief
                    counsellor.</p>
                <p>Pope Paul III. having died in 1540, Pole was twice elected his successor, and, we
                    are told, twice refused the papal dignity; the first time, because the election
                    was made in too great haste; and the second, because it was done in the night.
                    Cardinal Maria de Monte obtained the triple crown; and Pole, having kissed his
                    slipper, retired to the convent of Magazune, near Verona, where he continued
                    till the death of Edward VI. in the year 1553. On the accession of Queen Mary,
                    Pole was sent as legate to England, where he was received by her majesty with
                    great veneration, and conducted to the archbishop’s palace at Lambeth, Thomas
                    Cranmer being at that time prisoner in the Tower. He immediately appeared in the
                    House of Lords, where he made a long speech; and this being reported to the
                    Commons by their speaker, both these houses concurred in an humble supplication
                    to be reconciled to the see of Rome. They presented it on their knees to her
                    majesty, who interceded with the cardinal, and he graciously condescended to
                    give them absolution. This business being ended, the legate made his public
                    entry into London, and immediately set about the extirpation of heresy. The day
                    after the execution of Cranmer, which he is falsely said to have advised, he was
                    consecrated archbishop of Canterbury. In the same year, 1556, he was elected
                    chancellor of the university of Oxford, and soon afterwards of Cambridge; both
                    which he visited, by his commissioners. He died of a double quartan ague, in the
                    year 1558, about sixteen hours after the death of the queen, and was buried in
                    the cathedral of Canterbury.</p>
                <p>As to his character, the Catholic writers ascribe to him every virtue under
                    heaven; and even Bishop Burnet is lavish in his praise, attributing the
                    cruelties of Mary’s reign to the advice of Gardiner. In this Mr Hume agrees with
                    the bishop, and represents Pole as the advocate of toleration. By every
                    impartial account, he seems to have been a man of mild manners and of real
                    worth, though undoubtedly a zealous member of the church of Rome. He wrote, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pro</hi><hi rend="italic">Unitate Ecclesiastica,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Ejusdem Potestate,</hi> a Treatise on
                    Justification, and various other tracts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pole,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> that point
                    in the heavens round which the whole sphere seems to turn. It is also used for a
                    point directly perpendicular to the centre of the plane of any circle, and
                    distant from it by the length of a radius.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">PoiΛ&gt;Axe,</hi> a sort of hatchet, nearly resembling a
                    battleaxe, and which is principally employed in sea-fights, to cut away and
                    destroy the rigging of any adversary who endeavours to board.</p>
