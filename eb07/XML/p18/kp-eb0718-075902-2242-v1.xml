                    but one respecting the time and place of whose birth the learned are much
                    divided. Eratosthenes asserts, that in the 48th Olympiad, about 588 years before
                    Christ, when still very young, he was a victor at the Olympic games. Hence Dr
                    Bentley<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dissertation on
                    the Epistles of Phalaris.</p></note> determines the date of his birth to be the
                    fourth year of the 43d Olympiad; whilst Lloyd,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Chron. of Pythagoras.</p></note> who denies
                    that the Olympic victor was the same person with the philosopher, places it
                    about the third year of the 48th Olympiad. Mr Dodwell<note anchored="true"

                    Pythagoras.</p></note> differs from both, and wishes to fix the birth of
                    Pythagoras in the fourth year of the 52d Olympiad. Of the arguments of these
                    learned writers, Le Clerc has given a summary in the <hi rend="italic"

                    whole, it would appear that he was not born earlier than the fourth year of the
                    43d Olympiad, or later than the fourth year of the 52d; but in what particular
                    year of that period his birth took place, cannot with any degree of certainty be
                    ascertained. It is generally believed that he was born in the island of Samos,
                    and that he flourished about five hundred years before Christ, in the time of
                    Tarquin, the last king of Rome.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    number of wonderful stories respecting the descent of Pythagoras from Jupiter,
                    as well as in regard to his birth and early life; and represents him even in his
                    youth as a prodigy of wisdom and manly seriousness. But most of these idle tales
                    confute themselves, and prove nothing but the credulity, carelessness, and
                    prejudice of their author. Of his childhood and early education we know nothing,
                    except that he was first instructed in his own country by Creophilus, and
                    afterwards in Scyrus by Pherecydes. According to the custom of the times, he was
                    made acquainted with poetry and music; eloquence and astronomy became his
                    private studies; and in gymnastic exercises he often bore the palm for strength
                    and dexterity. He first distinguished himself in Greece at the Olympic games,
                    where, besides gaining the prize, he is said to have excited the highest
                    admiration by the elegance and dignity of his person, and the brilliancy of his
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>Soön after his public appearance at these games, Pythagoras commenced his travels
                    in quest of knowledge. He first visited Egypt, where, through the interest of
                    Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, he obtained the patronage of Amasis king of Egypt,
                    by whose influence, combined with his own assiduity, patience, and perseverance,
                    he at length won the confidence of the priests, from whom he learned their
                    sacred mysteries, theology, and the whole system of symbolical learning. In
                    Egypt, too, he became acquainted with geometry and the true solar system; and,
                    before he left that country, he had made himself master of all the learning for
                    which it was so famed am∩ngs the nations of antiquity. He afterwards visited
                    Persia and Chaldaea, where from the Magi he learned divination, the art of
                    interpreting dreams, and the science of astronomy. He is likewise said to have
                    travelled into India, conversed with the Gymnosophists, and acquired from them a
                    knowledge of the philosophy and literature of the East; and such was his ardour
                    in the pursuit of science, that, according to Cicero,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Σ⅛</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Finibus,</hi> fib. iv. sect. 29.</p></note> he crossed many seas, and travelled
                    on foot through many barbarous nations, in prosecution of his researches.</p>
                <p>After Pythagoras had spent many years in gathering information on every subject,
                    especially respecting the nature of the gods, the rites of religion, and the
                    immortality of the human soul, he returned to his native island, and attempted
                    to render his knowledge useful by there instituting a school for the instruction
                    of his countrymen. Failing of success in this laudable undertaking, he repaired
                    to Delos, where he pretended to receive moral dogmas from the priestess of
                    Apollo. He then visited Crete, where he was initiated into the most sacred
                    mysteries of Greece. He likewise repaired to Sparta and Elis, and again assisted
                    at the Olympic games, where in the public assembly he was saluted with the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">sophist</hi> or wise man, which he declined for one more
                    humble, namely, that of <hi rend="italic">philosopher,</hi> or lover of wisdom.
                    Having returned to Samos enriched with mythological learning and esoteric rites,
                    he again instituted a school in that island. His mysterious symbols and oracular
                    precepts rendered this attempt more successful than the former had been; but
                    meeting with some opposition, or being detected in some pious frauds, he
                    suddenly left Samos, and, retiring to Magna Graecia, settled at Crotona.</p>
                <p>Here Pythagoras founded the Italic sect, nor was it long ere his mental and
                    personal accomplishments, the fame of his distant travels, and his Olympic
                    crown, procured him numerous pupils. His bold and manly eloquence and his
                    graceful delivery attracted the most dissolute, and produced a remarkable change
                    in the morals of the people of Crotona. His influence was increased by the
                    regularity of his own example, and its conformity to his precepts. He punctually
                    attended the temples of the gods, and paid his devotions at an early hour; he
                    lived upon the purest and most innocent food, clothed himself like the priests
                    of Egypt, and, by his continual purifications and regular offerings, appeared to
                    be superior in sanctity to the rest of mankind. He endeavoured to assuage the
                    passions of his scholars by means of verses and numbers, and made a practice of
                    composing his own mind every morning, by playing on the harp, and singing along
                    with it the paeans of Thales. To avoid the temptations of ease and the
                    seductions of idleness, bodily exercises also formed a considerable part of his
                    scheme of discipline.</p>
                <p>At Crotona he had a public school for the general benefit of the people, in which
                    he taught them their duty, praising virtue, condemning vice, and particularly
                    instructing them in the duties of social life. Besides this, he had a college in
                    his own house, which he denominated <hi rend="italic">κοινοβιον,</hi> in which
                    there were two classes of students; the <hi rend="italic">εζωτεgικοι,</hi> who
                    were also called <hi rend="italic">auscultantes,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >εσο&gt;τεoικοι</hi> The former of these were neophytes, and were kept under a
                    long probation. A silence of five years was imposed upon them, which Apnleiιιs
                    thinks was intended to teach them modesty and attention; but Clemens
                    Alexandrinus is of opinion that it was for the purpose of abstracting their
                    minds from sen sible objects, and inuring them to the pure contemplation of the
                    Deity. The latter class of scholars were called <hi rend="italic">genuini,
                    perfecti, mathematici,</hi> and, by way of eminence, Pythagoreans. They alone
                    were admitted to the knowledge of the arcana of the Pythagorean discipline, and
                    were taught the use of ciphers and hieroglyphical writings.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542255?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2255-0760"/>
                <p>Clemens observes, that these orders corresponded very exactly to those amongst
                    the Hebrews. For in the schools of the prophets there were two classes; the sons
                    of the prophets, who were the scholars, and the doctors or masters, who were
                    also called <hi rend="italic">perfecti,</hi> and, amongst the Levites, the
                    novices or tyros, who had their quinquennial exercises, by way of preparation.
                    Lastly, even amongst the proselytes there were two orders; <hi rend="italic"
                    >exoterisci,</hi> or proselytes of the gate, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >intrinseci</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ρerfexti,</hi> proselytes of the covenant.
                    It is highly probable, he adds, that Pythagoras himself had been a proselyte of
                    the gate, if not of the covenant. Gale endeavours to prove that Pythagoras
                    borrowed his philosophy from the Jews; and with this view he produces the
                    authorities of many fathers and ancient authors, and even points out traces of
                    Moses in several parts of Pythagoras’s doctrine. But the learned author was, we
                    believe, misled by the Christian Platonists.</p>
                <p>The authority of Pythagoras amongst his pupils was so great that it was even
                    deemed a crime to dispute his word; and their arguments were considered as
                    infallibly convincing, if they could enforce them by adding that “the master
                    said so,” an expression which afterwards became proverbial, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jurare</hi><hi rend="italic">in verba</hi><hi rend="italic">magistri.</hi> This
                    influence over his school was soon extended to the world, and even his pupils
                    themselves divided with their master the applause and approbation of the people;
                    whilst the rulers and the legislators of all the principal towns of Greece, and
                    Sicily, and Italy, boasted of being the disciples of Pythagoras. To give more
                    weight to his exhortations, as some writers mention, Pythagoras retired into a
                    subterranean cave, where his mother sent him intelligence of everything which
                    happened during his absence. After a certain number of months he again
                    re-appeared on the earth with a grim and ghastly countenance, and declared in
                    the assembly of the people that he was just returned from the shades. From
                    similar exaggerations, it has been asserted that he appeared at the Olympic
                    games with a golden thigh; that he could write whatever he pleased in letters of
                    blood on a looking-glass; and that by setting it opposite to the moon, when
                    full, all the characters which were on the glass became legible on the moon’s
                    disc. They also relate, that by some magical words he tamed a bear, stopped the
                    flight of an eagle, and appeared on the same day and at the same instant of time
                    in the cities of Crotona and Metapontum.</p>
                <p>At length his singular doctrines, and perhaps his strenuously asserting the
                    rights of the people against their tyrannical governors, excited <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> spirit of jealousy, and raised against him a powerful
                    party, which soon became so outrageous as to oblige him to fly for his life. His
                    friends withdrew to Rhegium; and he himself, after being refused protection by
                    the Locrians, fled to Metapontum, where he was obliged to take refuge in the
                    temple of the Muses, and where it is said he died of hunger, about 497 years
                    before Christ. Respecting the time, place, and manner of his death, however,
                    there are various opinions, and many think it uncertain when, where, or in what
                    manner he ended his days. After his death his followers paid him the same
                    respect they would have done to the immortal gods; they erected statues in his
                    honour, converted his house at Crotona into a temple to Ceres, appealed to him
                    as a deity, and even swore by his name.</p>
                <p>Pythagoras married Theano of Crotona, or, according to others, of Crete, by whom
                    he had two sons, Telauges and Mnesarchus, who, after his death, took care of his
                    school. He is also said to have had a daughter called Damo.</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> hether he left any writings behind him is
                    disputed. It seems probable, however, that he left none, and that such as went
                    under his name were written by some of his followers. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >golden verses</hi> which Hierocles has illustrated with a commentary, have been
                    ascribed to Epicharmus or Empedocles, and contain a brief summary of his popular
                    doctrines. From this circumstance, and from the mysterious secrecy with which he
                    taught, our information concerning his doctrine and philosophy is very
                    uncertain, and cannot always be depended upon.</p>
                <p>The main purpose of philosophy, according to the system of Pythagoras, is to free
                    the mind from encumbrances, and to raise it to the contemplation of immutable
                    truth and the knowledge of divine and spiritual objects. To bring the mind to
                    this state of perfection is a work of some difficulty, and requires a variety of
                    intermediate steps. Mathematical science was with him the first step to wisdom,
                    because it inures the mind to contemplation, and takes a middle course between
                    corporeal and incorporeal beings. The whole science he divided into two parts,
                    numbers and magnitude; and each of these he subdivided into two others, the
                    former into arithmetic and music, and the latter into magnitude at rest and
                    magnitude in motion, the one comprehending geometry and the other astronomy.
                    Arithmetic lie regarded as the noblest science, and an acquaintance with numbers
                    as the highest good. He considered numbers as the principles of everything, and
                    divided them into scientific and intelligible. Scientific number is the
                    production of the powers involved in unity, and its return to the same. Number
                    is not infinite, but it is the source of that infinite divisibility into equal
                    parts which is the property of all bodies. Intelligible numbers are those which
                    existed in the divine mind before all things. They are the model or archetype of
                    the world, and the cause of the essence of beings. Of the monad, duad, triad,
                    tetrad, and decad, various explanations have been given by different authors;
                    but nothing certain or important is known of them. In all probability numbers
                    were used by Pythagoras as symbolical representations of the first principles
                    and forms of nature, especially of those eternal and immutable essences which
                    Plato denominated ideas; and in this case the monad was the simple root from
                    which he conceived numbers to proceed, and, as such, analogous to the simple
                    essence of Deity, from whom, according to his system, the various properties of
                    nature are derived.</p>
                <p>Music followed numbers, and was held as useful in raising the mind above the
                    dominion of the passions. Pythagoras considered it as a science to be reduced to
                    mathematical principles and proportions, and is said to have discovered the
                    musical chords from the circumstance of several men successively striking with
                    hammers a piece of heated iron upon an anvil. This story Dr Bnrney<note

                    441.</p></note> discredits, but at the same time allows, from the uniform
                    testimony of writers ancient and modern, that he invented the <hi rend="italic"
                    >harmonical cαnοη,</hi> cr monochord. The music of the spheres, of which every
                    one has heard, was a most fanciful doctrine of Pythagoras. It was produced, he
                    imagined, by the planets striking on the ether through which in their motion
                    they passed; wherefore he considered their musical proportions as exact, and
                    their harmony perfect.</p>
                <p>Pythagoras, as we have already seen, learned geometry in Egypt; but, by
                    investigating many new theorems, and by digesting its principles, he reduced it
                    to a more regular science. A geometrical point, which he defines to be a monad,
                    or unity with position, he says corresponds to unity in arithmetic, a line to
                    two, a superficies to three, and a solid to four. He discovered several of the
                    propositions of Euclid; and on discovering the 47th of the first book, he is
                    said to have offered a hecatomb to the gods; but as he was averse to animal
                    sacrifices, this assertion is most probably false.</p>
                <p>Wisdom, according to Pythagoras, is conversant with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193542268?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2268-0761"/> those objects
                    which are naturally immutable, eternal, and incorruptible; and its end is to
                    assimilate the human mind to the divine, and to qualify us to join the assembly
                    of the immortals. Active and moral philosophy prescribes rules and precepts for
                    the conduct of life, and leads us to the practice of public and of private
                    virtue. On these heads many of his precepts were excellent, whilst some of them
                    were whimsical and useless. Theoretical philosophy treats of nature and its
                    origin, and is, according to Pythagoras, the highest object of study. It
                    included all the profound mysteries which he taught, of which but little is now
                    known. God he considers as the universal mind, diffused throughout all things,
                    and the self-moving principle of all things <hi rend="italic">(αυτοματισμός
                    των</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;ιrαvτων),</hi> and of whom every human soul is a

                    is very probable that he conceived of the Deity as a subtile fire, eternal,
                    active, and intelligent; which is not inconsistent with the idea of
                    incorporeality, as the ancients understood that term. This Deity was primarily
                    combined with the chaotic mass of passive matter, but he had the power of
                    separating himself, and since the separation he has remained distinct. The
                    learned Cudworth contends that Pythagoras maintained a trinity of hypostases in
                    the divine nature, similar to the Platonic triad. We cannot say that his
                    arguments appear to have much force; but we think the conclusion which he wishes
                    to establish extremely probable, as Plato certainly drew his doctrine from some
                    of the countries which Pythagoras had visited before him.</p>
                <p>Subordinate to the Deity there were in the Pythagorean creed three orders of
                    intelligences; gods, demons, and heroes, of different degrees of excellence and
                    dignity. These, together with the human soul, were considered as emanations from
                    the Deity, the particles of subtile ether assuming a grosser clothing the
                    farther they receded from the divine fountain. Hierocles defines a hero to be a
                    rational mind united with a luminous body. God himself was represented under the
                    notion of monad, and the subordinate intelligences as numbers derived from and
                    included in unity. Man is considered as consisting of an elementary nature and a
                    divine or rational soul. His soul, a self-moving principle, is composed of two
                    parts; the rational, seated in the brain, and the irrational, including the
                    passions, in the heart. In both these respects he participates with the brutes,
                    whom the temperament of their body and other circumstances allow not to act
                    rationally. The sensitive souI perishes; the other assumes an ethereal vehicle,
                    and passes to the region of the dead, till sent back to the earth to inhabit
                    some other body, brutal or human. It was unquestionably this notion which led
                    Pythagoras and his followers to deny themselves the use of flesh, and to be so
                    peculiarly merciful to animals of every description. Some authors, however, say
                    that flesh and beans, the use of which he also forbade, were prohibited because
                    he supposed them to have been produced from the same putrefied matter out of
                    which, at the creation of the world, man was formed.</p>
                <p>The scantiness and uncertainty of our information respecting Pythagoras renders a
                    regular and complete account of his life and doctrines impossible. Λ modern
                    author,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Monboddo’s
                    Ancient Metaphysics.</p></note> of profound erudition, pronounces him to have
                    been unquestionably the wisest man that ever lived, if his masters the Egyptian
                    priests must not be excepted. This is perhaps saying too much; but that he was
                    one of the most distinguished philosophers of antiquity, or, as Cicero expresses
                    it, <hi rend="italic">vir praestanti</hi><hi rend="italic">sapientia,</hi>
                    appears very evident; and his moral character has never been impeached. The
                    mysterious air which he threw over his doctrines, and the apparent inanity of
                    some of his symbols, have indeed sub jected him to the charge of imposture; and
                    perhaps the charge is not wholly groundless. But when we consider the age in
                    which he lived, and the nature of the people with whom he had to deal, and who
                    would in all probability have resisted more open innovations, even this will not
                    appear so blameable as at first sight we are apt to think it; and it is worthy
                    of notice, that the worst stories of this kind have come down to us in a very
                    questionable shape, and show every appearance of being fabulous.</p>
