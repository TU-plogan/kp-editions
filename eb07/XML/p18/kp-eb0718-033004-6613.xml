                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism</hi> is the doctrine of a plurality of gods, or
                    invisible powers superior to man.</p>
                <p>“That there exist beings, one or many, powerful above the human race, is a
                    proposition,” says Lord Kames,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sketches of the History of Man.</p></note> “universally
                    admitted as true in all ages and among all nations. I boldly call it <hi
                    rend="italic">universal,</hi> notwithstanding of what is reported of some gross
                    savages; for reports that contradict what is acknowledged to be general among
                    men, require more able vouchers than a few illiterate voyagers. Among many
                    savage tribes there arc no words but for objects of external sense; is it
                    surprising that such people are incapable of expressing their religious
                    perceptions, or any perception of internal sense? The conviction that men have
                    of superior powers, in every country where there are words to express it, is so
                    well vouched, that in fair reasoning it ought to be taken for granted among the
                    few tribes where language is deficient.”</p>
                <p>These are judicious observations, of which every man will admit the force who has
                    not some favourite system to build upon die unstable foundation which his
                    lordship overturns. Taking it for granted, then, that our conviction of superior
                    powers has long been universal, the important question is, from what cause it
                    proceeds. The same ingenious author •shows, with great strength of reasoning,
                    that the operations of nature and the government of this world, which to us
                    loudly proclaim the existence of a Deity, are not sufficient to account for the
                    universal belief of superior beings amongst savage tribes. He is therefore of
                    opinion that this universality of conviction can spring only from the image of
                    Deity stamped upon the mind of every human being, the ignorant -equally with the
                    learned. “Nothing less,” he says, “is sufficient; and the original impression
                    which we have of Deity must proceed,” he thinks, “from an internal sense, which
                    may be termed the <hi rend="italic">sense of Deity?</hi></p>
                <p>We have elsewhere expressed our opinion of that philosophy which accounts for
                    every phenomenon in human nature by attributing to it a particular instinct; but
                    to this instinct or sense of Deity, considered as complete evidence, many
                    objections, more than usually powerful, force them selves upon us. All nations,
                    except the Jews, were once polytheists and idolaters. If, therefore, his
                    lordship’s hypothesis be admitted, either the doctrine of polytheism must be
                    true theology, or this instinct or sense is of such a nature as, at different
                    periods of the world, to have misled all mankind. All savage tribes are at
                    present polytheists and idolaters; but amongst savages every instinct appears in
                    greater purity and vigour than amongst people polished by arts and sciences; and
                    instinct never mistakes its object. The instinct or primary impression of
                    nature, which gives rise to self-love, affection between the sexes, love of
                    progeny, &amp;c. has in all nations, and in every period of time, a precise and
                    determinate object, which it inflexibly pursues. How then comes it to pass that
                    this particular instinct, which, if real, is surely of as much importance as any
                    other, should have uniformly led those who had no other guide to pursue improper
                    objects, to fall into the grossest errors and the most pernicious practices? To
                    no purpose are we told, that the sense of Deity, like the moral sense, makes no
                    capital figure amongst savages. There is reason to believe that the feeling or
                    perception, which is called the <hi rend="italic">moral sense,</hi> is not
                    wholly instinctive; but whether it be or not, a single instance cannot be
                    produced in which it multiplies its objects, or makes even a savage express
                    gratitude to a thousand persons for benefits which his prince alone had power to
                    confer.</p>
                <p>For these and other reasons which might easily be assigned, we cannot help
                    thinking, that the first religious principles must have been derived from a
                    source different as well from internal sense as from the deductions of reason;
                    from a source which the majority of mankind had early forgotten, and which, when
                    it was banished from their minds, left nothing behind it to prevent the very
                    first principle of religion from being perverted by various accidents or causes,
                    or, in some extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, from being perhaps
                    entirely obliterated. This source of religion every consistent theist must
                    believe to be revelation. Reason, it is acknowledged, could not have introduced
                    savages to the knowledge of God; and we have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536626"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6626-0331"/>just seen that a sense of Deity is an hypothesis
                    clogged with insuperable difficulties. Yet it is undeniable that all mankind
                    have believed in superior invisible powers; and if reason and instinct be set
                    aside, there remains no other origin of this universal belief than primeval
                    revelation, corrupted, indeed, as it passed by oral tradition from father to
                    son, in the course of many generations. It is no slight support· to this
                    doctrine, that if there really be a Deity,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Sketches of the History of Man.</p></note> it is highly
                    presumable that he would reveal himself to the first men; creatures whom he had
                    formed with faculties to adore and to worship him. To other animals the
                    knowledge of a Deity is of no importance; to man it is of the first importance.
                    Were we totally ignorant of a Deity, this world would appear to us a mere chaos.
                    Under the government of a wise and benevolent Deity, chance is excluded; and
                    every event appears to be the result of established laws. Good men submit to
                    whatever happens without repining, knowing that every event is ordered by Divine
                    Providence; they submit with entire resignation, and such resignation is a
                    sovereign balsam for every misfortune or evil in life.</p>
                <p>^ ’ Admitting, then, that the knowledge of Deity was originally derived from
                    revelation, and that the first men professed pure theism, it shall be our
                    business in the present article to trace the rise and progress of polytheism and
                    idolatry; and to ascertain, if we can, the real opinions of the pagan world
                    concerning that multitude of gods with which they filled heaven, earth, and
                    hell. In this inquiry, though we shall have occasion to appeal to the writings
                    of Moses, we shall attribute to them no other authority than what is due to
                    records of the earliest ages, more ancient and authentic than any others that
                    are now extant.</p>
                <p>Whether we believe, with the author of the book of Genesis, that all men have
                    descended from the same progenitors, or adopt the hypothesis of modern
                    theorists, that there have been successive creations of men, and that the
                    European derives his origin from one pair, the Asiatic from another, the
                    woolly-headed African from a third, and the copper-coloured American from a
                    fourth, polytheism and idolatry will be seen to have arisen from the same
                    causes, and to have advanced nearly in the same order from one degree of impiety
                    to another. On either supposition, it must be taken for granted, that the
                    original progenitors were instructed by their Creator in the truths of genuine
                    theism; and there is no room to doubt that those truths, simple and sublime as
                    they are, would be conveyed pure from father to son as long as the race lived in
                    one family, and were not spread over a large extent of country. If any credit be
                    due to the records of antiquity, the primeval inhabitants of this globe lived to
                    so great an age, that they must have increased to a very large number long
                    before the death of the common parent; who would of course be the bond of union
                    to the whole society, and whose dictates, especially in what related to the
                    origin of his being and the existence of his Creator, would be listened to with
                    the utmost respect by every individual of his numerous progeny.</p>
                <p>Many causes, however, would conspire to dissolve this family, after the death of
                    its ancestor, into separate and independent tribes, of which some would be
                    driven by violence, or would voluntarily wander, to a distance from the rest.
                    From this dispersion great changes would take place in the opinions of some of
                    the tribes respecting the object of their religious worship. A single family, or
                    a small tribe, banished into a desert wilderness, such as the whole earth must
                    then have been, would find employment for all their time in providing the means
                    of subsistence, and in defending themselves from beasts of prey. In such
                    circumstances they would have little leisure for meditation, and being
                    constantly conversant with objects of sense, they would gradually lose the power
                    of meditating upon the spiritual nature of that Being by whom their ancestors
                    had taught them that all things were created. The first wanderers would no doubt
                    retain in tolerable purity their original notions of Deity, and they would
                    certainly endeavour to impress those notions upon their children. But, in
                    circumstances infinitely more favourable to speculation than theirs could have
                    been, the human mind dwells not long upon notions that arc purely intellectual.
                    We are so accustomed to sensible objects, and to the ideas of space, extension,
                    and figure, which they are perpetually impressing upon the imagination, that we
                    find it extremely difficult to conceive any being without assigning to him a
                    form and a place. Hence a learned writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bishop Law, in his Considerations on the Theory, of
                    Religion,</p></note> has supposed that the earliest generations of men, even
                    those to whom he contends that frequent revelations were vouchsafed, may have
                    been no better than anthropomorphites in their conceptions of the Divine
                    Being.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may, it is not conceivable but that the members of those first
                    colonies would quickly lose many of the arts and much of the science which
                    perhaps prevailed in the parent state; and that, fatigued with the contemplation
                    of intellectual objects, they would relieve their overstrained, faculties, by
                    attributing to the Dcity a place of abode, if not a human form. To men totally
                    illitcrate, the place fittest for the habitation of the Deity would undoubtedly
                    appear to be the sun, the most beautiful and glorious object of which they could
                    form any idea; an object, too, from which they could not but be sensible that
                    they received the benefits of light and heat, and which experience must soon
                    have taught them to be in a great measure the source of vegetation. The great
                    spirit, therefore, inhabiting the sun, which they would consider as the power of
                    light and heat, was in all probability the first object of idolatrous
                    adoration.</p>
                <p>From looking upon the sun as the habitation of their god, they would soon proceed
                    to consider it as his body. Of pure mind entirely separated from matter, men in
                    their circumstances could not long retain the faintest notion; but conscious
                    each of power in himself, and experiencing the effects of power in the sun, they
                    would naturally conceive that luminary to be animated as their bodies were
                    animated. They would feel his influence when above the horizon; they would see
                    him moving from east to west; they would consider him when set as gone to take
                    his repose; and those exertions and intermissions of power being analogous to
                    what they experienced in themselves, they would look upon the sun as a real
                    animal. Thus would the Divinity appear to their untutored minds to be a compound
                    being like man, partly corporeal and partly spiritual; and as soon as they
                    imbibed such notions, though perhaps not before, they may be pronounced to have
                    been absolute idolaters.</p>
                <p>When men had once got into this train, their gods would multiply upon them with
                    wonderful rapidity. Darkness and cold they could not but perceive to be contrary
                    to light and heat; and not having philosophy enough to distinguish between mere
                    privations and positive effects, they would consider darkness and cold as
                    entities equally real with light and heat, and attribute these different and
                    contrary effects to different and contrary powers. Hence the spirit or power of
                    darkness was in all probability the second god in the pagan calendar; and as
                    they considered the power of light as a benevolent principle, the source of all
                    that is good, they must have looked upon the contrary power of darkness as a
                    malevolent spirit, the source of all that is evil.</p>
                <p>This we know from authentic history to have been the belief of the Persian Magi,
                    a very ancient sect, who called their good god Yazdun, and also Ormuzd, and the
                    evil god Ahriman. Considering light as the symbol, or perhaps as the body, of
                    Ormuzd, they always worshipped him before <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536639"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6639-0332"/>the fire, the source of light, and especially
                    before the sun, the source of the most perfect light; and for the same reason
                    fires were kept continually burning on his altars. That they sometimes addressed
                    prayers to the Evil Principle, we are informed by Plutarch in his Life of
                    Themistocles; but with what particular rites he was worshipped, or where he was
                    supposed to reside, it is not so evident. Certain it is, however, that the
                    worshippers held him in detestation; and when they had occasion to write his
                    name, they always inverted it, to denote the malignity of his nature. The
                    principles of the Magi, though widely distant from pure theism, were much less
                    absurd than those of other idolaters. It does not appear that they ever
                    worshipped their gods through the medium of graven images, or had any other
                    emblems of them than light and darkness. Indeed we are told by Diogenes Laertius
                    and Clemens Alexandrinus, that they condemned all statues and images, allowing
                    fire and water to be the only proper emblems or representatives of their gods:
                    And we learn from Cicero,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">. De</hi><hi rend="italic">Legibus,</hi> lib. ii. §
                    10.</p></note> that at their instigation Xerxes was said to have burned all the
                    temples of Greece, because the builders of those edifices impiously presumed to
                    enclose within walls the gods, to whom all things ought to be open and free, and
                    whose proper temple is the whole world. To these authorities we may add that of
                    all the historians, who agree, that when the ereed of the Magi was the religion
                    of the court, the Persian monarchs made war upon images, and upon every emblem
                    of idolatry different from their own.</p>
                <p>The Magi, however, were but one sect, and not the largest, of ancient idolaters.
                    The worship of the sun, as the source of light and heat, soon introduced into
                    the calendar of divinities the other heavenly bodies, the moon, the planets, and
                    the fixed stars. Men could not but experience great benefit from those
                    luminaries in the absence of their chief god; and when they had proceeded so far
                    as to admit two divine principles, a good and an evil, it was natural for mifids
                    clouded with such prejudices to consider the moon and the stars as benevolent
                    intelligences, sent to oppose the power of darkness whilst their first and
                    greatest divinity was absent or asleep. It was thus, as they imagined, that he
                    maintained a constant superiority over the Evil Principle. Though to astronomers
                    the moon is. known to be an opaque body of very small dimensions when compared
                    with a planet or a fixed star, yet to the vulgar eye she appears much more
                    magnificent than either. By those early idolaters she was considered as the
                    divinity second in rank and in power; and whilst the sun was worshipped as the
                    king, she was adored as the queen, of heaven.</p>
                <p>The earth, considered as the common mother of all things; the ocean, the waters
                    of which are never at rest; the air, the region of storms and tempests; and
                    indeed all the elements, were gradually added to the number of divinities. Not
                    that mankind in this early age had so far degenerated from the principles of
                    their ancestors as to worship brute matter. If such worship was ever practised,
                    which to us is hardly conceivable, it must have been at a later period, when it
                    was confined to the very lowest of the vulgar, in nations otherwise highly
                    civilized. The polytheists of whom we now treat conceived everything in motion
                    to be animated, and animated by an intelligence powerful in proportion to the
                    magnitude of the body moved.</p>
                <p>This sect of idolaters, which remains in some parts of the East to this day, was
                    known by the name of Tsabaians, which they pretended to have derived from a son
                    of Seth; and amongst the books in which their sacred doctrines are contained,
                    they have one which they call the Book of Seth. We need hardly observe, that
                    these are senseless and extravagant fables. The epithet <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tsabaian</hi> is undoubtedly derived from the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tsaba</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which signifies an host or army;
                    and this class of polytheists was so called, because they worshipped the host of
                    heaven, or the <hi rend="italic">Tsaba lιesemim,</hi> against which Moses so
                    pathetically cautions the people of Israel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Deut. iv. 19.</p></note></p>
                <p>This species of idolatry is thought to have first prevailed in Chaldaea, and to
                    have been that from which Abraham separated himself, when, at the command of the
                    true God, he “departed from his country, and from his kindred, and from his
                    father’s house.” But as it nowhere appears that the Chaldaeans had fallen into
                    the savage state before they became polytheists and idolaters, and as it is
                    certain that they were not savages at the period of the call of Abraham, their
                    early Tsabaism may be thought inconsistent with the account which we have given
                    of the origin of that species of idolatry. If a great and civilized nation was
                    led to worship the host of heaven, why, it may be asked, should that worship be
                    supposed to have arisen amongst savages? Theories, however plausible, cannot be
                    admitted in opposition to ascertained facts.</p>
                <p>True; but we beg leave to reply, that our account of the origin of polytheism is
                    opposed by no fact, because we have not supposed that the worship of the host of
                    heaven arose amongst savages only. That savages, between whom it is impossible
                    to imagine any intercourse to take place, have universally worshipped, as their
                    first and supreme divinities, the sun, moon, and stars, is a faet evineed by
                    every historian and by every traveller; and we have shown how their rude and
                    uncultivated state naturally leads them to that species of idolatry. But there
                    may have been circumstances peculiar to the Chaldaeans, which led them likewise
                    to the worship of the heavenly host, even in a state of high civilization. We
                    judge of the philosophy of the ancients by that of ourselves, and imagine that
                    the same refined system of metaphysics was cultivated by them as by the
                    followers of Descartes and Locke. But this is a great mistake; for so gross were
                    the notions of early antiquity, that it may be doubted whether there was a
                    single man, uninspired, who had any notion of mind as a being distinct and
                    entirely separated from matter. From several passages in the books of Moses, we
                    learn, that when in the first ages of the world the Supreme Being condescended
                    to manifest his presence to men, he generally exhibited some sensible emblem of
                    his power and glory, and declared his will from the midst of a preternatural
                    fire. It was thus that he appeared to the Jewish lawgiver himself, when he spoke
                    to him from the midst of a bush; it was by a pillar of cloud and fire that he
                    led the Israelites from Egypt to the Land of Promise; and it was in the midst of
                    smoke, and fire, and thunderings, that the law was delivered from Mount Sinai.
                    That such manifestations of the divine presence would occasionally be made to
                    the descendants of Noah who settled in Chaldaea soon after the Deluge, must
                    appear extremely probable to every one who admits the authority of the Hebrew
                    Scriptures; and he who questions that authority has no right to make the
                    objection to which we now reply, because it is only from the book of Genesis
                    that we know the Chaldaeans to have been a civilized people when they fell into
                    idolatry. All histories agree in representing the inhabitants of Chaldaea as at
                    a very early period corrupted by luxury, and sunk in vice. When this happened,
                    we must suppose that the moral governor of the universe would withdraw from them
                    those occasional manifestations of himself; and leave them to, their own
                    inventions. In such circumstances, it was not unnatural for a people addicted to
                    the study of astronomy, who had been taught to believe that the Deity frequently
                    appeared to their ancestors in a flame of fire, to consider the sun as the place
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536652" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6652-0333"/>his
                    permanent residence, if not as his body. But when either opinion was firmly
                    established, polytheism would be its inevitable consequence, and the progress of
                    Tsabaism would, in the most polished nation, be such as we have traced it
                    amongst savage tribes.</p>
                <p>From Chaldaea the idolatrous worship of the host of hea- • yen spread itself over
                    all the East, passed into Egypt, and thence found its way into Greece; for Plato
                    affirms,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">In Cratijto.</hi></p></note> that “the first inhabitants of Greece
                    seemed to him to have worshipped no other gods but the sun, moon, earth, stars,
                    and heavens, as most barbarous nations,” continues he, “still do.” That
                    Tsabaism, or the worship of the host of heaven, was the first species of
                    idolatry, besides the probability of the thing, and the many allusions to it in
                    sacred Scripture, we have the positive evidence of the most ancient pagan
                    historians of whose writings any part has been transmitted to us.
                    Herodotus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lib. i. cap.
                    131.</p></note> speaking of the religion of the Persians, says that “they
                    worship the snn, moon, and earth, fire, water, and the winds; and this adoration
                    they have all along paid from the beginning.” He testifies the same thing of the
                    savage Africans, of whom he affirms,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lib. iv. cap. 188.</p></note> that they all worshipped the
                    sun and moon, and no other divinity. Diodorus Siculus, writing of the
                    Egyptians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lib.
                    i.</p></note> tells us that “the first men, looking up to the world above them,
                    and terrified and struck with admiration at the nature of the universe, supposed
                    the sun and the moon to be the principal and eternal gods.” And Sanehoniathon
                    the Phoenician, a more ancient writer than any of these, informs us, in the
                    fragment of his history preserved by Eusebius, that “the two first mortals were
                    Aeon and Protogonus, and their children Genos and Genea, who inhabited
                    Phoenicia; and when they were scorched with the heat, they lifted np their hands
                    to the sun, whom they believed to be the lord of heaven, and called him <hi
                    rend="italic">Baalsamen,</hi> the same whom the Greeks call <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ζευς.”</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto those divinities were worshipped in person, or, as Dr Prideaux expresses
                    it, in their <hi rend="italic">sacella,</hi> or sacred tabernacles; for the
                    votaries of each directed their devotions towards the planet which they supposed
                    to be animated by the particular intelligence whom they meant to adore. But
                    these orbs, by their rising and setting, being as much below the horizon as
                    above it, and their grossly ignorant worshippers not supposing it possible that
                    any intelligence, however divine, could exert its influence except in union with
                    some body, statues or pillars were soon thought of as proper emblems of the
                    absent gods. Sanehoniathon, in the fragment already quoted, informs us, that
                    “<hi rend="italic">Hyspouranios</hi> and his brother <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chisous,</hi> Phoenician patriarchs, erected two pillars, the one to fire, and
                    the other to air or wind, and worshipped those pillars, pouring out to them
                    libations of the blood of the wild beasts hunted down in the chase.” As these
                    early monuments of idolatry were called <hi rend="italic">βαιτυλια,</hi> a word
                    evidently derived from the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">Bethel,</hi> the probability
                    is, that they were altars of loose stones, such as that which was built by
                    Jacob,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Genesis, chap,
                    xxxv.</p></note> and from him received the same name. As his was consecrated to
                    the true God, theirs were consecrated to the host of heaven; and the form of
                    consecration seems to have been nothing more than the anointing of the stone or
                    pillar with oil,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence
                    the proverb of a superstitious man, <hi rend="italic">ιraιτa λιSov λινra^ν
                    νrςtrxvνι</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> he kisses or adores every anointed stone;
                    which Arnobius calls <hi rend="italic">lιιbricataifi lapidan,</hi><hi

                    whom it was intended to represent. When this ceremony was performed, the
                    ignorant idolaters, who fancied that their gods could not hear them except when
                    they were visible, supposed that the intelligences by which the sun and planets
                    were animated took possession, in some inexplicable manner, of the consecrated
                    pillars, and were as well pleased with the prayers and praises offered up before
                    those pillars, as with the devo tions which were addressed towards the
                    luminaries themselves. Hence Sanehoniathon calls them <hi rend="italic"
                    >animated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">living stones, λ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">6ους εμΛ-υχους,</hi> from the portion of the divine
                    spirit which was believed to reside in them; and as they were dedicated to the
                    host of heaven, they were generally erected upon the tops of mountains, or, in
                    countries which, like Egypt, were low and level, they were elevated to a great
                    height by the labour of men.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed that this practice of raising the pillars on <hi
                    rend="italic">high places</hi> proceeded from a desire to make the objects of
                    worship conspicuous and magnificent. But we are strongly inclined to believe,
                    that the erectors of <hi rend="italic">βαιτυ-λικ</hi> had something further in
                    view, and that they thought of nothing less than to bring the sacred stone or
                    pillar as near as possible to the god whom it represented. But whatever there be
                    in this, we know that the practice itself prevailed universally throughout the
                    East; and that there was nothing which the Jewish legislator more strictly
                    enjoined his people to destroy, than the altars, statues, and pillars erected
                    for idolatrous worship upon mountains and high places. “Ye shall utterly
                    destroy,” says he, “all the high places wherein the nations which ye shall
                    possess served their gods, upon the <hi rend="italic">high mountains,</hi> and
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">hills,</hi> and under every green tree. And ye shall
                    overthrow their <hi rend="italic">altars,</hi> and break down their <hi
                    rend="italic">pillars,</hi> and burn their <hi rend="italic">groves</hi> with
                    fire.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Deut, xii
                    23.</p></note></p>
                <p>The mention of <hi rend="italic">groves</hi> by the Hebrew lawgiver brings to our
                    recollection another species of idolatry, which was perhaps the second in order,
                    as men deviating from the principles of pure theism became more and more
                    entangled in the labyrinths of error. The Chaldaeans, Egyptians, and all the
                    eastern nations who believed in a superintending providence, imagined that the
                    government of this world, the care of particular nations, and even the
                    superintendence of groves, rivers, and mountains, in each nation, was committed
                    by the gods to a class of spirits superior to the soul of man, but inferior to
                    those heavenly intelligences which animated the sun, the moon, and the planets.
                    These spirits were by the Greeks called <hi rend="italic">δαιμονες,
                    daemons,</hi> and by the Romans <hi rend="italic">genii.</hi> Timaeus the
                    Loerian, who flourished before Plato, speaking of the punishment of wicked men,
                    says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Be Anima Mundi,</hi> inter scriptores a T. Gale editos.</p></note> all these
                    things has Nemesis decreed to be executed in the second period, by the ministry
                    of vindictive terrestrial daemons, who are overseers of human affairs; to which
                    daemons the Supreme God, the ruler over all, has committed the government and
                    administration of this world, which is made up of gods, men, and animals.</p>
                <p>Concerning the origin of these intermediate beings, scholars and philosophers
                    have framed various hypotheses. The belief of their existence may have been
                    derived from five different sources.</p>
                <p>Firstly, it seems to have been impossible for the limited capacities of those
                    men, who could not form a notion of a God divested of a body and a place, to
                    conceive how the. influence and ageney of such a being could every instant
                    extend to every point of the universe. Hence, as we have seen, they placed the
                    heavenly regions under the government of a multitude of heavenly gods, the sun,
                    the moon, and the stars. But as the nearest of those divinities was at an
                    immense distance from the earth, and as the intelligence animating the earth
                    itself had sufficient employment in regulating the general affairs of the whole
                    globe, a notion insinuated itself into the untutored mind, that these superior
                    governors of universal nature found it necessary, or at least expedient, to
                    employ subordinate intelligences or daemons, as ministers to execute their
                    behests in the various parts of their widely extended dominions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536665" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6665-0334"/>
                <p>Secondly, such an universal and uninterrupted course of action as was deemed
                    necessary to administer the affairs of the universe, would be judged altogether
                    inconsistent with that state of indolence which, especially in the East, was
                    held an indispensable ingredient in perfect felicity. It was this notion, absurd
                    as it is, which made Epicurus deny the providence, whilst he admitted the
                    existence, of gods. And if it had such an effect upon a philosopher who in the
                    most enlightened ages had many followers, we need not surely wonder if it made
                    untaught idolaters imagine that the governor or governors of the universe had
                    devolved a great part of their trouble on deputies and ministers.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, when men came to reflect on the infinite distance between themselves and
                    the gods, they would naturally form a wish that there might somewhere exist a
                    class of intermediate intelligences, whom they might employ as mediators and
                    intercessors with their far-distant divinities. But what men earnestly wish for,
                    they very readily believe. Hence the supposed distance of their gods would,
                    amongst untutored barbarians, prove a fruitful source of intermediate
                    intelligences, more pure and more elevated than human souls.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, these three opinions may be denominated popular; but that which we are
                    now to state, wherever it may have prevailed, was the offspring of philosophy.
                    On this earth we perceive, a scale of beings rising gradually above each other
                    in perfection, from mere brute matter through the various species of fossils,
                    vegetables, insects, fishes, birds, and beasts, up to man. But the distance
                    between man and God is infinite, and capable of admitting numberless orders of
                    intelligences, all superior to the human soul, and each rising gradually above
                    the other till they reach that point, wherever it may be, at which creation
                    stops. Part of this immense chasm the philosophers perceived to be actually
                    filled by the heavenly bodies; for in philosophical polytheism there was one
                    invisible God, supreme over all these; but still there was left an immense
                    vacuity between the human species and the moon, which was known to be the lowest
                    of the heavenly host; and this they imagined must certainly be occupied by
                    invisible inhabitants of different orders and dispositions, which they called
                    good and evil daemons.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, there is yet another source from which the universal belief of good and
                    evil daemons may be derived, with perhaps greater probability than from any or
                    all of these. If the Mosaic account of the creation of the world, the peopling
                    of the earth, and the dispersion of mankind, be admitted as true (and a more
                    consistent account has not as yet been given or devised), some knowledge of good
                    and evil angels must necessarily have been transmitted from father to son by the
                    channel of oral tradition. But this tradition would be corrupted at the same
                    time, and in the same manner, with others of greater importance. When the true
                    God was so far mistaken as to be considered, not as the sole governor of the
                    universe, but only as the self-existent power of light and good, the devil would
                    be elevated from the rank of a rebellious created spirit to that of the
                    independent power of darkness and evil; the angels of light would be transformed
                    into good daemons, and those of darkness into daemons that are evil. This
                    account of the origin of daemonology receives no small support from Plato, who
                    derives one branch of it wholly from tradition. “With respect to those daemons,”
                    says he,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Τιmaus.</hi></p></note> “who inhabit the space between the earth
                    and the moon, to understand and declare their generation is a task too arduous
                    for my slender abilities. In this case we must credit the report of men of other
                    times, who, according to their own account, were the descendants of the gods,
                    and had, by some means or other, gained exact intelligence of that mystery from
                    their ancestors. We must not question the veracity of the children of the gods,
                    even though they should transgress the bounds of probability, and produce no
                    evidence to support their assertions. We must, I say, notwithstanding, give them
                    credit, because they profess to give a detail of facts with which they are
                    intimately acquainted, and the laws of our country oblige us to believe
                    them.”</p>
                <p>Though these daemons were generally invisible, they were not supposed to be pure
                    disembodied spirits. Proclus, in his commentary upon Plato’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus,</hi> tells us, “that every daemon superior to human souls consisted of
                    an intellectual mind and an ethereal vehicle.” Indeed it is very little
                    probable, that those who gave a body and a place to the Supreme God, should have
                    thought that the inferior orders of his ministers were spirits entirely
                    separated from matter. Plato himself divides the class of daemons into three
                    orders; and whilst he holds their souls to be particles or emanations from the
                    divine essence, he affirms that the bodies of each order of daemons are composed
                    of that particular element in which they for the most part reside. “Those of the
                    first and highest order are composed of pure ether; those of the second order
                    consist of grosser air; and daemons of the third or lowest rank have vehicles
                    extracted from the element of water. Daemons of the first and second orders are
                    invisible to mankind. The aquatic daemons, being invested with vehicles of
                    grosser materials, are sometimes visible and sometimes invisible. When they do
                    appear, though faintly observable by the human eye, they strike the beholder
                    with terror and astonishment.” Daemons of this last order were supposed to have
                    passions and affections similar to those of men; and though all nature was full
                    of them, they were believed to have local attachments to mountains, rivers, and
                    groves, where their appearances were most frequent. The reason of these
                    attachments seems to be obvious. Polytheism took its rise in countries scorched
                    by a burning sun; and daemons by their composition being necessarily subject in
                    some degree to the influence of heat and cold, it was natural to suppose that
                    they, like men, would delight in the shady grove and in the purling stream.
                    Hence the earliest altars of paganism were generally built in the midst of
                    groves, or on the banks of rivers; because it was believed that in such places
                    were assembled multitudes of those intelligences, whose office it was to
                    regulate the affairs of men, and to carry the prayers and oblations of the
                    devout to the far-distant residence of the celestial gods. Hence too are to be
                    derived the mountain and river gods, with the dryads and hamadryads, the satyrs,
                    nymphs, and fauns, which held a place in the creed of ancient paganism, and make
                    so conspicuous a figure in the Greek and Roman poets.</p>
                <p>These different orders of intelligences, which, though worshipped as gods or
                    demigods, were yet believed to partake of human passions and appetites, led the
                    way to the deification of departed heroes, and other eminent benefactors of the
                    human race. By the philosophers all souls were believed to be emanations from
                    the divinity; but “gratitude and admiration, the warmest and most active
                    affections of our nature, concurred to enlarge the object of religious worship,
                    and to make man regard the inventors of arts and the founders of society as
                    having in them more than a common ray of the divinity. So that god-like
                    benefits, bespeaking as it were a god-like mind, the deceased parent of a people
                    was easily advanced into the rank of a daemon. When the religious bias was in so
                    good a train, natural affection would have its share in promoting this new mode
                    of adoration. Piety to parents would naturally take the lead, as it was
                    supported by gratitude and admiration, the <hi rend="italic">primum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mobile</hi> of the whole system; and, in those early ages, the <pb

                    the tribe often happened to be the political father of the people, and the
                    founder of the state. Fondness for the offspring would next have its turn; and a
                    disconsolate father, at the head of a people, would contrive to soothe his grief
                    for the untimely death of a favourite child, and to gratify his pride under the
                    want of succession, by paying divine honours to its memory.”<note

                    worship of departed souls, we have the authority of the famous fragment of
                    Sanchoniathon, already quoted, where the various motives for this species of
                    idolatry are recounted in express words. “After many generations,” says he,
                    “came <hi rend="italic">Chrysor</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he invented
                    many things useful to civil life, for which, after his decease, he was
                    worshipped as a god. Then flourished <hi rend="italic">Ouranos</hi> and his
                    sister <hi rend="italic">Ge,</hi> who deified and offered sacrifices to their

                    beasts. Afterwards <hi rend="italic">Kronos</hi> consecrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muth</hi> his son, and was himself consecrated by his subjects.”</p>
                <p>In the reign of Kronos there flourished a personage of great reputation for
                    wisdom, who by the Egyptians was denominated <hi rend="italic">Thoth,</hi> by
                    the Phoenicians <hi rend="italic">Taautos,</hi> and by the Greeks <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermes.</hi> According to Plutarch, he was a profound politician,
                    and chief counsellor of Osiris, then the king, and afterwards the principal
                    divinity, of Egypt; and we are told by Philo Byblius, the translator of
                    Sanchoniathon, “that it was this Thoth or Hermes who first took the matters of
                    religious worship out of the hands of unskilful men, and brought them into due
                    method and order.” His object was to make religion serviceable to the interests
                    of the state. With this view he appointed Osiris and other departed princes to
                    be joined with the stars and worshipped as gods; and being by Kronos made king
                    of Egypt, he was, after his death, worshipped himself as a god by the Egyptians.
                    To this honour, if what is recorded of him be true, he had indeed a better title
                    than most princes; for he is said to have been the inventor of letters,
                    arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and hieroglyphics, and was therefore one of the
                    greatest benefactors of the human race which any age or country has ever
                    produced.</p>
                <p>That the gods of Greece and Rome were derived from Egypt and Phoenicia, is so
                    universally known, that it is needless to multiply quotations in order to prove
                    that the progress of polytheism amongst the Greeks and Romans was the same with
                    that which we have traced in more ancient nations. The following account, given
                    by Hesiod, of the deification of departed heroes, is so just, and in our opinion
                    so beautiful, that we cannot refrain from introducing it in this place.</p>
                <p>The gods who dwell on high Olympus’ hill, First fram’d a golden race of men, who
                    liv’d Under old Saturn’s calm auspicious sway. Like gods they liv’d, their
                    hearts devoid of care, Beyond the reach of pain and piercing woes; Th’
                    infirmities of age nor felt nor fear’d.</p>
                <p>Their nerves with youthful vigour strung, their days In jocund mirth they past,
                    remote from ills.</p>
                <p>Now when this godlike race was lodg’d in earth, By Jove’s high will to demigods
                    they rose, And airy daemons, who benign on earth Converse, the guides and
                    guardians of mankind. In darkness veil’d, they range earth’s utmost bound,
                    Dispensing wealth to mortals. This reward From bounteous Jove awaits illustrious
                    deeds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>E⅛y&lt;⅛&gt; w *H

                <p>The deification of departed heroes and of statesmen was that which in all
                    probability introduced the universal belief of national and tutelar gods, as
                    well as the practice of worshipping those gods through the medium of statues cut
                    into a human figure. When the founder of a state, or any other public
                    benefactor, was elevated to the rank of a god, as he was believed still to
                    retain human passions and affections, it was extremely natural to suppose that
                    he would regard with a favourable eye that nation for which he had done so much
                    upon earth; that he would oppose its enemies, and protect the laws and
                    institutions which he himself had given it. By indulging the same train of
                    sentiment, each city, and even every family of consequence, found <hi
                    rend="italic">Lares</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Penates</hi> amongst their
                    departed ancestors, to whom they paid the warmest adoration, and under whose
                    protection they believed their private affairs to be placed. As those national
                    and household gods were believed to be in their deified state clothed with airy
                    bodies, so those bodies were supposed to retain the form which their grosser
                    bodies had upon earth. The image of a departed friend might perhaps be formed by
                    the hand of sorrowful affection, before the statue or the shrine of a deity was
                    thought of; but when that friend or benefactor became the object of religious
                    adoration, it was natural for his votaries to enliven their devotion by a view
                    of his similitude. Maximus Tyrius tells us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dissert. 38.</p></note> that “there is no race of men,
                    whether barbarian or Grecian, living on the sea-coast or on the continent,
                    wandering in deserts or living in cities, which has not consecrated some kind of
                    symbol or other in honour of the gods.” This is certainly true; but there is no
                    good evidence that the first symbols of the gods were statues of men and women.
                    Whilst the sun and other heavenly bodies continued to be the sole objects of
                    religious worship, the symbols consecrated to them were pillars of a conical or
                    pyramidal figure; and if such pillars are ever called graven images by Moses and
                    other ancient writers, it was probably on account of the allegorical figures and
                    characters, or hieroglyphical writing, with which they were inscribed.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have considered the souls of departed heroes as holding the rank only
                    of daemons or demigods; but they generally rose in the scale of divinities,
                    until they dethroned the heavenly bodies, and became themselves the <hi
                    rend="italic">dii majorum</hi><hi rend="italic">gentium.</hi> This revolution
                    was effected by the combined operation of the prince and the priest; and the
                    first step taken towards it seems to have been the complimenting of their heroes
                    and public benefactors with the name of that being which was most esteemed and
                    worshipped. “Thus a king for his beneficence was called the sun, and a queen for
                    her beauty the moon. Diodorus relates, that Sol first reigned in Egypt, called
                    so from the luminary of that name in the heavens. This will help us to
                    understand an odd passage in the fragment of Sanchoniathon, where it is said
                    that Kronos had seven sons by Rhea, the youngest of whom was a god as soon as
                    born. The meaning probably is, that this youngest son was called after some
                    luminary in the heavens to which they paid divine honours; and these honours
                    came in process of time to be transferred to the terrestrial namesake. The same
                    historian had before told us, that the sons of Genos, mortals like their father,
                    were called by the names of the elements, light, fire, and flame, of which they
                    had discovered the use.”</p>
                <p>“As this adulation advanced into an established worship, they turned the
                    compliment the other way, and called the planet or luminary after the hero, the
                    better to accustom the people, even in the act of planet-worship, to this new
                    adoration. Diodorus, in the passage already quoted, having told us, that by the
                    first inhabitants of Egypt the sun and moon were supposed to be the principal
                    and eternal gods, adds, that the former was called Osiris, and the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193536691" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6691-0336"/> latter Isis. This
                    was indeed the general practice; for we learn from Macrobius, that the Ammonites
                    called the sun Moloch; the Syrians, Adad; the Arabs, Dionysus; the Assyrians,
                    Belus; the Phoenicians, Saturn: the Carthaginians, Hercules; and the Palmyrians,
                    Elagabalus. Again, by the Phrygians the moon was called Cybele, or the mother of
                    the gods; by the Athenians, Minerva; by the Cyprians, Venus; by the Cretans,
                    Diana; by the Sicilians, Proserpine; by others, Hecate, Bellona, Vesta, Urania,
                    Lucina, &amp;c. Philo Byblius explains this practice. ‘ It is remarkable,’ says
                    he, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> that the ancient idolaters imposed on the
                    elements, and on those parts of nature which they esteemed gods, the names of
                    their kings; for the natural gods which they acknowledged were only the sun,
                    moon, planets, elements, and the like; they being now in the humour of having
                    gods of both classes, the mortal and the immortal.’</p>
                <p>“As a further proof that hero-worship was thus superinduced upon the planetary,
                    it is worthy of observation, that the first statues consecrated to the greater
                    hero-gods, or those who were supposed to be supreme, were not of a human form,
                    but conical or pyramidal, like those which, in the earliest ages of idolatry,
                    were dedicated to the sun and planets. Thus the scholiast on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vespae</hi> of Aristophanes tells ns, that the statues of Apollo
                    and Bacchus were conic pillars or obelisks; and Pausanias, that the statue of
                    Jupiter Meilichius represented a pyramid; that of the Argive Juno did the same,
                    as appears from a verse of Phoronis quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus;<note

                    lib. i.</p></note> ' and indeed the practice was universal, as well amongst the
                    early barbarians as amongst the Greeks. But it is well known that the ancients
                    represented the rays of light by pillars of a conical or pyramidal form; and
                    therefore it follows, that when they erected such pillars as representatives of
                    their hero-gods, these latter had succeeded to the titles, rights, and honours
                    of the natural and celestial divinities.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>But though it seems to be certain that hero-worship was thus engrafted on the
                    planetary, and that some of those heroes in process of time supplanted the
                    planets themselves, this was such a revolution in theology as could not have
                    been suddenly effected by the united influence of the prince and the priest. We
                    doubt not the fact that Sol was believed to have reigned in Egypt, and was
                    afterwards worshipped under the name Osiris; but it was surely impossible to
                    persuade any nation, however stupid or prone to idolatry, that a man, whom they
                    remembered discharging the duties of their sovereign and legislator, was the
                    identical sun whom they beheld in the heavens. Osiris, if there was in Egypt a
                    king of that name, may have been deified immediately after his death, and
                    honoured with that worship which was paid to good daemons; but he must have been
                    dead for ages before any attempt was made to persuade the nation that he was the
                    Supreme God. Even then great address would be requisite to render such an
                    attempt successfill. The prince or priest who entered upon it would probably
                    begin with declaring, on the authority of an oracle, that the divine
                    intelligence which animates and governs the sun had descended to earth and
                    animated the person of the renowned legislator; and that, after their laws were
                    framed, and the other purposes served, for which the descent was made, the same
                    intelligence had returned to its original residence and employment amongst the
                    celestials. The possibility of this double transmigration from heaven to earth
                    and from earth to heaven, would without difficulty be admitted in an age when
                    the pre-existence of souls was the universal belief. Having proceeded thus far
                    in the apotheosis of dead men, the next step taken in order to render it in some
                    degree probable that the early founders of states, and inventors of arts, were
                    divine inteíligences clothed with human bodies, was to attribute to one such
                    benefactor of mankind the actions of many of the same name. Vossius, who
                    employed much time and great erudition on the subject, has proved, that before
                    the era of the Trojan wars, most kings who were very powerful, or highly
                    renowned for their skill in legislation, were called Jove; and when the actions
                    of all these were attributed to one Jove of Crete, it would be easy for the
                    crafty priest, supported by all the power and influence of the state, to
                    persuade an ignorant and barbarous people, that he whose wisdom and heroic
                    exploits so far surpassed those of ordinary men must have been the Supreme God
                    in human form.</p>
                <p>This short sketch of the progress of polytheism and idolatry will enable the
                    reader to account for many circumstances recorded of the pagan gods of
                    antiquity, which at first view seem very surprising, and which at length brought
                    the whole system into contempt amongst the philosophers of Athens and Rome. The
                    circumstances to which we allude are the immoral characters of those divinities,
                    and the abominable rites with which they were worshipped. Jupi- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi> ter, Apollo, Mars, and the whole rabble of them, are
                    described by the poets as ravishers of women and notorious adulterers. Hermes or
                    Mercury was a thief, and the god of thieves. Venus was a prostitute, and Bacchus
                    a drunkard. The malice and revenge of Juno were implacable; and so little regard
                    was any of them supposed to pay to the laws of honour and rectitude, that it was
                    a common practice of the Romans, when besieging a town, to evoke the tutelar
                    deity, and to tempt him by a reward to betray his friends and votaries.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>T. Livii, Jib. V. c. 21; and
                    Macrob. <hi rend="italic">Satuτ.</hi> lib. iii c. 9.</p></note> In a word, they
                    were, in the language of the poet,</p>
                <p>Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust, Whose attributes were rage, revenge,
                    and lust.</p>
                <p>This was the natural consequence of their origin. Having once animated human
                    bodies, and being supposed still to retain human passions and appetites, they
                    were believed, in their state of deification, to feel the same sensual desires
                    which they had felt upon earth, and to pursue the same means for their
                    gratification. As the men could not well attempt to surpass the gods in purity
                    and virtue, they were easily persuaded by artful and profligate priests, that
                    the most acceptable worship which could be rendered to any particular deity was
                    to imitate the example of that deity, and to indulge in the practices over which
                    he presided. Hence the worship of Bacchus was performed during the night by men
                    and women mixing in the dark after intemperate eating and drinking. Hence, too,
                    it was the practice in Cyprus and some other countries to sacrifice to Venus the
                    virginity of young women some days before their marriage, in order, as was
                    pretended, to secure their chastity ever afterwards; and, if Herodotus may be
                    credited, every woman amongst the Babylonians was obliged once in her life to
                    prostitute herself in the temple of the goddess <hi rend="italic">Mylitte</hi>
                    or Venus, that she might thenceforward be proof against all temptation.</p>
                <p>The progress of polytheism, as far as we have traced it, has been regular; and
                    the enormous error of forsaking the worship of the true God being once admitted,
                    every subsequent step appears to be natural. It would be no difficult task to
                    prove that it has likewise been universal. Sir William Jones, the learned
                    president of the Asiatic Society, discovered such a striking resemblance between
                    the gods of ancient Greece and those of the pagans of Hindustan,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Asiatic Researches,, vol.
                    i.</p></note> as puts it beyond a doubt that those divinities had the same
                    origin. The Ga-nesa<pb break="no" facs="nls:193536704"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6704-0337"/> of the Hindus he has clearly proved to be the
                    Jamis of the Greeks and Romans. As the latter was represented with two and
                    sometimes with four faces, as emblems of prudence and circumspection, the former
                    is painted with an elephant’s head, the well known symbol amongst the Indians of
                    sagacious discernment. The Saturn of Greece and Rome appears to have been the
                    same personage with the Menu or Satyavrataof Hindustan, whose patronymic
                    isVai-vaswata, or <hi rend="italic">child of the sun</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> a name which sufficiently marks his origin. Amongst the Romans there
                    were many Jupiters, one of whom appears from Ennius to have been nothing more
                    than the firmament personified.</p>
                <p>Aspice hoc sublime candens, quem invocant omnes Jovem.</p>
                <p>But this Jupiter had the same attributes with the Indian god of the visible
                    heavens, called Indra or the king, and Dives-petir, or the lord of the sky,
                    whose consort is Sachi, and whose weapon is <hi rend="italic">vajra</hi> or the
                    thunderbolt. Indra is the regent of winds and showers; and though the East is
                    peculiarly under his care, yet his Olympus is the north-pole, allegorically
                    represented as a mountain of gold and gems. With all his power he is considered
                    as a subordinate deity, and far inferior to the Indian triad Brahma, Vishnu, and
                    Mahadeva or Siva, who are three forms of one and the same godhead. The president
                    having traced the resemblance between the idolatry of Rome and India through
                    many other gods, observes, that “we must not be surprised at finding, on a close
                    examination, that the characters of all the pagan deities melt into each other,
                    and at last into one or two; for it seems a well-founded opinion, that the whole
                    crowd of gods and goddesses in ancient Rome, and likewise in Hindustan, mean
                    only the powers of nature, and principally those of the sun, expressed in a
                    variety of ways, and by a multitude of fanciful names.”</p>
                <p>Nor is it only in Greece, Rome, Egypt, and India, that the progress of idolatry
                    has been from planetary to hero-worship. From every account which modern
                    travellers have given us of the religion of savage nations, it appears that
                    those nations adore, as their first and greatest gods, the sun, moon, and stars;
                    and that such of them as have any other divinities have proceeded in the same
                    road with the celebrated nations of antiquity, from the worship of the heavenly
                    bodies to that of celestial daemons, and from celestial daemons to the
                    deification of dead men. It appears, likewise, that they universally believe
                    their hero-gods and demigods to retain the passions, appetites, and propensities
                    of men.</p>
                <p>That the Scandinavians and our Saxon ancestors had the same notions of the gods
                    with the other pagans whose opinions we have stated, is evident from their
                    calling the days of the week by the names of their divinities, and from the
                    forms of the statues by which those divinities were represented. The idol of the
                    Sun, from which Sunday is derived, amongst the Latins <hi rend="italic">dies
                    Solis,</hi> was placed in a temple, where he was adored and sacrificed to; for
                    they believed that the sun did co-operate with this idol. He was represented
                    like a man half naked, with his face like the sun, holding a burning wheel with
                    both hands on his breast, signifying his course round the world; and by its
                    fiery gleams, the light and heat with which he warms and nourishes all
                    things.</p>
                <p>The idol of the Moon, from which comes our Monday, or <hi rend="italic">dies
                    Lunae,</hi> anciently <hi rend="italic">Moonday,</hi> appears strangely
                    singular, being habited in a short coat like a man. Her holding a moon expresses
                    what she is; but the reason of her short coat and long-cared cap is lost in
                    oblivion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tuisco,</hi> the most ancient and peculiar god of the Germans,
                    represented in his garment of skin, according to their ancient manner of
                    clothing, was, next to the Sun and</p>
                <p>Moon, the idol of highest rank in the calendar of northern paganism. To him the
                    third day in the week was dedicated; and hence has been derived the name
                    Tuesday, anciently <hi rend="italic">Tuisday,</hi> called in Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">dies Martis,</hi> though it must be confessed that Mars does not
                    so much resemble this divinity as he does Odin or Woden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Odin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Woden</hi> was a valiant prince
                    amongst the Saxons, His image was prayed to for victory over their enemies;
                    which, if they obtained, they usually sacrificed to him the prisoners taken in
                    battle. Our Wednesday, anciently <hi rend="italic">Wo-densday,</hi> is derived
                    from his name. The northern histories represent him as the father of Thor, by
                    Friga his wife.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thor</hi> was placed in a large hall, sitting on a bed canopied
                    over, with a crown of gold on his head, surmounted by twelve stars, and holding
                    a sceptre in his right hand. To him was attributed power over both heaven and
                    earth; and, as he was pleased or displeased, he could send thunder, tempests,
                    plagues, earthquakes, or fair and seasonable weather, and cause fertility. From
                    him our Thursday derives its name, anciently <hi rend="italic">Thorsday,</hi>
                    and amongst the Romans <hi rend="italic">dies</hi><hi rend="italic">Jovis,</hi>
                    as this idol may be substituted for Jupiter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Friga</hi> represented both sexes, holding a drawn sword in the
                    right hand and a bow in the left; denoting that women as well as men should
                    fight in time of need. She was generally taken for a goddess; and was reputed
                    the giver of peace and plenty, as well as the cause of love and amity. Her day
                    of worship was called by the Saxons <hi rend="italic">Frigedeag,</hi> now
                    Friday, or <hi rend="italic">dies Veneris;</hi> but the habit and weapons of
                    this figure have a resemblance to those of Diana rather than Venus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seater,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Crodo,</hi> stood upon the
                    prickly back of a perch. He was thin-visaged and long-haired, with a long beard,
                    bare-headed and bare-footed, carrying in his right hand a pail of water, wherein
                    are fruit and flowers, and holding up a wheel in his left, his coat being tied
                    with a long girdle. His standing on the sharp fins of this fish signified to the
                    Saxons, that by worshipping him they should pass through all dangers unhurt; by
                    his girdle flying both ways was shown the Saxons’ freedom; and by the pail with
                    fruit and flowers was denoted that he would nourish the earth. From him, or from
                    the Roman deity Saturn, comes Saturday.</p>
                <p>Such were the principal gods of the northern nations. But these people had at the
                    same time inferior deities, who were supposed to have been translated into
                    heaven for their heroic deeds, and whose greatest happiness consisted in
                    drinking ale out of the skulls of their enemies in the Hall of Odin. But the
                    limits prescribed to the present article do not permit ns to pursue this
                    subject; nor is it necessary that we should do so. The attentive reader of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mythology,</hi> of the histories given in this work
                    of the various divinities of paganism, and of the different nations by whom
                    those divinities were worshipped, will perceive that the progress of polytheism
                    and idolatry has been uniform over the whole earth.</p>
                <p>There is, however, one species of idolatry more wonderful than anything that has
                    yet been mentioned, and of which our readers will certainly expect some account.
                    It is the worship of brutes, reptiles, and vegetables, amongst the Egyptians. To
                    the Greeks and Romans, as well as to us, that superstition appeared so
                    monstrous, that to enumerate every hypothesis, ancient and modern, by which
                    philosophers have endeavoured to account for it, would swell this article beyond
                    all proportion. Animal-worship prevailed at so early a period in Egypt, that the
                    philosophers of antiquity whose writings have descended to us, had little or no
                    advantage over the moderns in pursuing their researches into its origin; and,
                    amongst the modern hypotheses, those of Mosheim and Warburton appear to be as
                    plausible as any that we have seen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is, however, another hypothesis which is worthy of
                    some attention, if it were only for the learning and ingenuity of its author.
                    The celebrated Cudworth infers, from the writings of Philo and other Platonists
                    of the Alexandrian school, that the an <pb break="no" n="338"/>cient Egyptians
                    held the Platonic doctrine of ideas existing from eternity, and constituting, in
                    one of the persons of the godhead, the intelligible and archetypal world. Philo,
                    he observes, did not himself consider those ideas as so many distinct substances
                    and animals, much less as gods; but he mentions others who deified the whole of
                    this intelligible system, as well as its several parts. Hence, when they paid
                    their devotions to the <hi rend="italic">sensible sun,</hi> they pretended only

                    >archetype</hi> of that luminary; and therefore our learned author conceives
                    that the ancient Egyptians, in falling down to bulls, and cows, and crocodiles,
                    meant at first to worship only the divine and eternal <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideas</hi> of those animals. He allows, indeed, that as fevz could entertain
                    any thoughts at all of those eternal ideas, there were scarcely any who could
                    persuade themselves that the <hi rend="italic">intelligible system</hi> had so
                    much reality in it as the <hi rend="italic">sensible things of nature</hi>; and
                    hence he thinks the devotion which was originally paid to the divine ideas had
                    afterwards no higher object than the animals and vegetables of which those ideas
                    were the eternal patterns.</p><p>This hypothesis, however, is more ingenious
                    than satisfactory. There is no evidence that the mysterious doctrine of Plato
                    concerning ideas had anywhere been thought of for ages after animal-worship was
                    established in Egypt. Of the state of Egyptian theology at that early period,
                    Philo, and the other philosophers of the Alexandrian school, had no better means
                    of forming a judgment than we have; and they laboured under many Greek
                    prejudices, which must have prevented them from judging with
                    impartiality.</p><p>It must be confessed, however, that a pretty close
                    approximation is here made to what seems to us to be the true explanation of the
                    origin of animal, worship. The earliest form of idolatry was Tsabaism, or the
                    worship of the host of heaven. Of this there can be no doubt whatever. But the
                    observation of the sun, moon, and stars preceded the adoration of the heavenly
                    host. Astronomy was the most early cultivated of all the sciences, and traces of
                    the ancient classification still remain to attest the circumstances of its
                    origin. The celestial bodies being first observed in pastoral countries, their
                    groups were, from fancied resemblances to the figures of certain known animals,
                    marked out and distinguished by the names of those animals; and, when they
                    became objects of idolatrous worship, it was under the denominations which had
                    thus been applied to them. In process of time, however, when Tsabaism, from a
                    sublime idolatry, descended to a vulgar and degrading superstition, the sign was
                    mistaken for the thing signified; the emblem was confounded with its archetype;
                    and the animals themselves became the objects of that worship originally
                    intended for the celestial signs or heavenly host, represented and classed in
                    the manner already described. Such appears to us to bave been the true origin of
                    animal-worship, at least in Egypt, where almost every sign, emblem, or symbol,
                    has either an astronomical or mythological import; and there can be no doubt
                    that the superstition which excited the ridicule of the Roman satirist was a
                    gross corruption of the earliest form of idolatry known in the world.</p></note>

                    prince and the craft of the priest. The latter contends, with much earnestness
                    and ingenuity, that it resulted from the use of hieroglyphical writing. We are
                    strongly inclined to believe that both these causes contributed to the
                    production of so portentous an effect; and that the use of hiero glyphics as
                    sacred symbols, after they were laid aside in civil life, completed that
                    wonderful superstition which the craft of the priest and the policy of the
                    prince had undoubtedly begun.</p>
                <p>We learn from Herodotus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lib. ii. cap. 65.</p></note> that in his time the number of useful animals
                    in Egypt was so small as to be hardly sufficient for tillage and the other
                    purposes of civil life; whilst serpents and other noxious animals, such as the
                    crocodile, wolf, bear, and hippopotamus, abounded in that country. From this
                    fact Mosheim very naturally concludes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cudworth’s Intellectual System, cap. iv. No. 158.</p></note>
                    that the founders of society and government in Egypt would by every art
                    endeavour to increase the number of useful animals as the number of inhabitants
                    increased; and that with this view they would make it criminal to kill or even
                    to hurt sheep, cows, oxen, or goats, whilst they would wage perpetual war
                    against the noxious animals and beasts of prey. Such animals as were assisting
                    to them in carrying on this warfare would be justly considered as in a high
                    degree useful to society. Hence the most grievous punishments were decreed
                    against killing, or so much as wounding, the ichneumon and ibis; because the
                    former was looked upon as the instinctive enemy of the crocodile, and the latter
                    of every species of serpents. The learned writer, however, observes, that in
                    Egypt, as in other countries, people would be tempted to sacrifice the good of
                    the public to the gratification of their own appetites, and sometimes even to
                    the indulgence of a momentary caprice. He thinks it was found necessary to
                    strengthen the authority of the laws enacted for the preservation of useful
                    animals by the sanctions of religion; and he says, that with this view the
                    priests declared that certain animals were under the immediate protection of
                    certain gods, that some of those animals had a divine virtue residing in them,
                    and that they could not be killed without the most sacrilegious wickedness, and
                    incurring the highest indignation of the gods. When once the idolatrous
                    Egyptians were persuaded that certain animals were sacred to the immortal gods,
                    and had a divine virtue residing in them, they could not avoid viewing those
                    animals with some degree of veneration; and the priests, taking advantage of the
                    superstition of the people, appointed for each species of sacred animals
                    appropriate rites and ceremonies, which were quickly followed with building
                    shrines and temples, and approaching them with oblations and sacrifices, and
                    other rites of divine adoration.</p>
                <p>To corroborate this hypothesis, he observes that, besides the animals sacred over
                    all Egypt, each province and each city had its particular animal to which the
                    inhabitants paid their devotions. This arose from the universal practice amongst
                    idolaters of consecrating to themselves Lares and Penates; and as the animals
                    which were worshipped over the whole kingdom were considered as sacred to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dii</hi><hi rend="italic">majorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gentium,</hi> so the animals the worship of which was confined to particular
                    cities or provinces, were sacred to the Lares of those cities and provinces.
                    Hence there was in Upper Egypt a city called Lycopolis, because its inhabitants
                    worshipped the wolf; whilst the inhabitants of Thebes, or Heliopolis, paid their
                    devotions to the eagle, which was probably looked upon as sacred to the Sun. Our
                    author, however, holds it as a fact which will admit of no dispute, that there
                    was not one noxious animal or beast of prey worshipped by the Egyptians till
                    after the conquest of their country by the Persians. That the earliest gods of
                    Egypt were all benevolent beings, he appeals to the testimony of Diodorus
                    Siculus; but he quotes Herodotus and Plutarch as agreeing that the latter
                    Egyptians worshipped an evil principle under the name of Typhon. This Typhon was
                    the inveterate enemy of Osiris, just as Ahriman was of Ormuzd; and therefore he
                    thinks it in the highest degree probable that the Egyptians derived their belief
                    of two self-existent principles, a good and an evil, from their Per sian
                    conquerors, amongst whom that opinion had prevailed from the earliest ages.</p>
                <p>From whatever source their belief was derived, Typhon was certainly worshipped in
                    Egypt, not with a view of obtaining from him any good, for there was nothing
                    good in his nature, but in hopes of keeping him quiet, and averting much evil.
                    As certain animals had long been sacred to all the benevolent deities, it was
                    natural for a people so besotted with superstition as the Egyptians to
                    consecrate emblems of the same kind to their god Typhon. Hence arose the worship
                    of serpents, crocodiles, bears, and other noxious animals and beasts of prey. It
                    may, indeed, seem at first sight very inconsistent to deify such animals, after
                    they had been in the practice for ages of worshipping others for being their
                    destroyers; but it is to be remembered, that long before the deification of
                    crocodiles, &amp;c. the real origin <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536730"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6730-0339"/>of animal-worship was totally forgotten by the
                    people, if they were ever acquainted with it. The crafty priest who wishes to
                    introduce a gainful superstition, must at first employ some plausible reason to
                    delude the multitude; but after the superstition has been long and firmly
                    established, it is obviously his business to keep its origin out of sight.</p>
                <p>Such is Mosheim’s account of the origin and progress of that species of idolatry
                    which was peculiar to Egypt; and with respect to the rise of animal-worship, it
                    appears perfectly satisfactory. But the Egyptians worshipped several species of
                    vegetables; and it surely could be no part of the policy of wise legislators to
                    preserve them from destruction, as vegetables are useful only as they contribute
                    to animal subsistence. We are, therefore, obliged to call in the aid of
                    Warburton’s hypothesis to account for this branch of Egyptian superstition.</p>
                <p>That learned and ingenious author having proved,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Divine Legation, book iv. sect. 4.</p></note>
                    with great clearness and strength of argument, that hieroglyphical writing
                    preceded the invention of alphabetical characters, and having traced that kind
                    of writing from such rude pictures as those which were in use amongst the
                    Mexicans, through all the different species of curiological, tropical, and
                    symbolical hieroglyphics (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hieroglyphics),</hi> shows, by many quotations from ancient authors, that the
                    Egyptian priests wrapped up their theology in the symbolical hieroglyphics,
                    after alphabetical characters had banished from the transactions of civil life a
                    mode of communicating information necessarily obscure. These symbols were the
                    figures of animals and of vegetables, denoting, from some supposed or imaginary
                    analogy, certain attributes of their divinities; and when the vulgar, forgetting
                    this analogy, ceased to understand them as a species of writing, and were yet
                    taught to consider them as sacred, they could not well view them in any other
                    light than as emblems of the divinities whom they adored. But if rude sculptures
                    upon stone could be emblematical of the divinities, it was surely notunnatural
                    to infer, that the living animals and vegetables which those sculptures
                    represented must be emblems of the same divinities more striking and more
                    sacred. Hence, the learned author thinks, arose that wonderful superstition
                    peculiar to the Egyptians, which led them to worship not only animals and
                    vegetables, but also a thousand chimeras of their own creation, such as figures
                    with human bodies, and the heads or feet of brutes, or with the bodies ofbrutes
                    and the heads and feet of men.</p>
                <p>These two hypotheses combined have been thought to account sufficiently for the
                    idolatry of Egypt, monstrous as it was. We are persuaded that, with respect to
                    the origin of animal-worship, Mosheim is in the right;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To prove that it was merely to preserve and
                    increase the breed of useful animals in Egypt, that the prince and the priest
                    first taught the people to consider such animals as sacred, he argues thus:
                    “Haec ita esse, non ex eo tantum liquet, quod paulo ante observavi, nullas
                    bestias universo Aegyptiorum populo sacras fuisse, praeter eas, quae manifestam
                    regioni utilitatem comparent; sed inde quoque apparet, quod longe major ratio
                    habita fuit lamellarum inter animalia, quam marium. Boves diis immolare licebat,
                    vaccas nullo modo. Canes foeminae contumulabantur, non item mares.”</p></note>
                    and it was a very easy step indeed for people in so good training to proceed
                    upon the crutches of hieroglyphics to the worship of plants, and those chimeras
                    which, as they never had a real existence in nature, could not have been thought
                    of as emblems of the divinity, had they not been used in that symbolical writing
                    which Warburton so ingeniously attempts to explain.</p>
                <p>To this account of the origin of animal-worship we are fullyaware that some
                    objections may occur. Animal-worship, it has been said, was not peculiar to
                    Egypt. The Hindus, it is well known, havé a religions veneration for the cow and
                    the alligator; but there is no evidence that in India the number of useful
                    animals was ever so small as to make the interference of the prince and the
                    priest necessary for their preservation; neither does it appear that the Hindus
                    adopted from any other people the worship of a self-existent principle of
                    evil.</p>
                <p>To this, however, it may be answered, that there is every reason to believe that
                    animal-worship was introduced into India by a colony of Egyptians at a very
                    remote period. That between these two nations there was an early intercourse, is
                    universally allowed. And although the learned president of the Asiatic Society
                    has laboured to prove, that the Egyptians derived all that wisdom for which they
                    were Aimed, as well as the rudiments of their religious system, from the natives
                    of Hindustan, he does not appear to us to have laboured with success. To examine
                    his arguments at length would swell this article beyond its due proportion; and
                    we have noticed some of them elsewhere (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philology).</hi> At present we shall only observe, that Sesostris undoubtedly
                    made an inroad into India, and conquered part of the country, whilst we nowhere
                    read of the Hindus having at any time conquered the kingdom of Egypt. Now,
                    though the victors have sometimes adopted the religion of the vanquished, the
                    contrary has happened so much more frequently, and is in itself a process so
                    much more natural, that this single circumstance affords a very strong
                    presumption that the Egyptian monarch would rather impose his gods upon the
                    Hindus than adopt theirs and carry them back with him to Egypt. Animal-worship
                    might likewise be introduced into Hindustan by those vast colonies of Egyptians
                    . who took refuge in that country from the tyranny and oppression of the
                    shepherd kings. That such colonies did settle on some occasion or other in
                    India, seems undeniable, from monuments still remaining in that country, with
                    forms which could hardly have occurred to a native of Asia, though they are very
                    natural as the workmanship of Africans.</p>
                <p>We may admit that the Hindus have never adopted from the Persians or Egyptians
                    the worship of an independent principle of evil, and yet dispose of the other
                    part of the objection with very little difficulty. It will be seen by and by,
                    that the Brahmins believe a kind of triad of hypostases in the divine nature, of
                    which one is viewed as the Destroyer, and known by several names, such as Siva
                    and Iswara. When animal-worship was introduced into Hindustan, it was not
                    unnatural to consider the alligator as emblematical of Iswara; and hence in all
                    probability it is that the Hindus believe that a man cannot depart more happily
                    from this world than by falling into the Ganges, and being devoured by one of
                    those sacred animals. Upon the whole, the animal-worship of the Hindus, instead
                    of militating against our account of this monstrous superstition as it prevailed
                    in Egypt, seems to lend no small support to that account, as there was
                    unquestionably an early intercourse between the two nations, and as colonies of
                    Egyptians settled in India.</p>
                <p>Having thus traced the rise and progress of polytheism and idolatry as they
                    prevailed in the most celebrated nations of antiquity, we now proceed to inquire
                    into the real opinions of those nations concerning the nature of the gods whom
                    they adored. And here it is evident from the writings of Homer, Hesiod, and the
                    other poets, who were the principal theologians amongst the Greeks and Romans,
                    that though heaven, earth, hell, and all the elements, were filled with
                    divinities, there was yet one who, whether called Jove, Osiris, Ormuzd, or by
                    any other title, was considered as supreme over all the rest. “Whence each of
                    the gods <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536743" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6743-0340"/>was
                    generated,” says Herodotus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and what are their forms, is a thing that was not known till very lately; for
                    Hesiod and Homer were, as I suppose, not above four hundred years my seniors;
                    and these were they who introduced the theogony amongst the Greeks, and gave the
                    gods their several names.” Now Hesiod,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vers. 104-112.</p></note> towards the beginning of his
                    Theogony, expressly invokes his muse to celebrate in suitable numbers the
                    generation of the immortal gods who had sprung from the earth, the dark night,
                    the starry heavens, and the salt sea. He calls upon her likewise to say, “in
                    what manner the gods, the earth, the rivers, ocean, stars, and firmament, were
                    generated, and what divine intelligences had sprung from them of benevolent
                    dispositions towards mankind.” From this invocation, it is evident that the poet
                    did not consider the gods of Greece as self-existent beings. Neither could he
                    look upon them as creatures; for of creation the ancient Greeks had no
                    conception (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics)</hi>; but he
                    considered them as emanations coeval with the earth and heavens, from some
                    superior principles; and by the divine intelligences sprung from them, there
                    cannot be a doubt but that he understood benevolent daemons. The first
                    principles of all things, according to the same Hesiod, were Chaos, and
                    Tartarus, and Love, of which only the last being active, must undoubtedly have
                    been conceived by this father of Grecian polytheism to be the greatest and only
                    self-existing god. This, we say, must undoubtedly have been Hesiod’s belief,
                    unless by Tartarus we here understand a self-existent principle of evil; and in
                    that case his creed will be the same with that of the ancient Persians, who, as
                    we have seen, believed in the selfexistence of Ahriman as well as of Ormuzd.</p>
                <p>Hesiod is supposed to have taken his theology from Orpheus; and it is evident
                    that his doctrine concerning the generation of the gods is the same with that
                    taught in certain verses<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Argonautica,</hi> p. 17, edit. Steph.</p></note> usually
                    attributed to Orpheus, in which Love and Chaos are thus brought together. “We
                    will first sing,” says the poet, “a pleasant and delightful song concerning the
                    ancient Chaos, how the heavens, earth, and seas were formed out of it; as also
                    concerning that all-wise Love, the oldest and self-perfect principle, which
                    actively produced all these things, separating one from another.” In the
                    original passage, Love is said to be not only <hi rend="italic">τrοXvμητις,</hi>
                    of much wisdom or sagacity, and therefore a real intelligent substance; but also
                    to be <hi rend="italic">πgεσβuτατος</hi> and <hi rend="italic">αυτοτελής,</hi>
                    the oldest and self-perfect, and therefore a being of superior order to the
                    other divinities, who were generated together with the elements over which they
                    were conceived to preside.</p>
                <p>With the theology of Homer our readers of all descriptions are so well
                    acquainted, that we need not swell the article with quotations to prove that the
                    father of epic poetry held Jove to be the father of gods and men. But the
                    doctrine of the poets was the creed of the vulgar Greeks and Romans; and
                    therefore we may conclude that those nations, though they worshipped gods and
                    lords innumerable, admitted but one, or at the most two, self-existent
                    principles, the one good and the other evil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Plutarch is commonly supposed, and we think justly, to have
                    been a believer in two self-existent principles, a good and an evil. His own
                    opinion, whatever it was, he declares (de <hi rend="italic">Iside et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Osiridé)</hi> to have been most ancient and universal, and derived
                    from theolo-gers and lawgivers, by poets and philosophers. “Though the original
                    author of it be unknown, yet,” says he, “it has been so firmly believed
                    everywhere, that traces of it are to be found in the sacrifices and mysteries
                    both of the barbarians and the Greeks. There is a confused mixture of good and
                    evil in everything, and nothing is produced by nature pure. Wherefore it is not
                    one only dispenser of things, who, as it were, out of several vessels,
                    distributes these several liquors of good and evil, mingUng them together, and
                    dashing them as he pleases; but there are two distinct and contrary powers or
                    principles in the world, one of them always leading, as it were, to the right
                    hand, but the other tugging the contrary way. For if nothing can be made without
                    a cause, and that which is good cannot be the cause of evil, there must needs be
                    a distinct principle in nature for the production of evil as well as
                    good.”</p><p>That this is palpable Manicheism appears to us so very evident as
                    to admit of no dispute. It appeared in the same light to the learned Cudworth;
                    but that author labours to prove that Plntarch mistook the sense of Pythagoras,
                    Empedocles, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, and Plato, when he attributed to them the
                    same opinions which were held by himself. Mosheim, on the other hand, has placed
                    it beyond a doubt, that whatever was Plutarch’s belief respecting the origin of
                    evil, and the existence of two independent principles, it was taken implicitly
                    from the writings of Plato. But the chancellor of Göttingen, actuated by the
                    same motives with Cudworth, wishes to persuade his readers that by Plato and
                    Plutarch nothing active was understood by their evil principle, but only that
                    tendency to confusion which was then deemed inseparable from matter. But that
                    something more was meant seems undeniable. For immediately after the words which
                    we have quoted, Plutarch proceeds to affirm that the wisest men declare <hi
                    rend="italic">ίιου;</hi><hi rend="italic">uνmι ìus xaíamo ivτιτιχνnit,</hi>
                    “that there are two gods, as it were, of contrary trades or crafts,” of which
                    one is the author of all good and the other of all e vil. See Mosheim’s ,edition
                    of Cudworth’s Intellectual System, lib. i. cap. 4, § 13.</p></note> It does not
                    indeed appear that in the system of vulgar paganism the subordinate gods were
                    accountable to their chief for any part of their conduct, except when they
                    transgressed the limits of the provinces assigned them. Venus might conduct the
                    amours of heaven and of earth in whatever manner she pleased; Minerva might
                    communicate or withhold wisdom from any individual with or without reason; and
                    we find, that in Homer’s battles the gods were permitted to separate into
                    parties, and to support the Greeks or Trojans, according as they favoured the
                    one or the other nation. Jove indeed sometimes called them to order; but his
                    interference was thought partial, and an instance of tyrannical force rather
                    than of just authority. The vulgar Greeks, therefore, although they admitted but
                    one, or at most two, self-existent principles, did not consider the inferior
                    divinities as mediators between them and the supreme, but as gods to whom their
                    worship was on certain occasions to be ulti-timately directed.</p>
                <p>The creed of the philosophers seems to have been different. Such of them as were
                    theists, and believed in the administration of Providence, admitted of but one
                    god, to whom worship was ultimately due; and they adored the subordinate
                    divinities as his children and ministers, by whom the course of Providence was
                    carried on. With respect to the origin of those divinities, Plato is very
                    explicit, where he tells us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Timceus,</hi></p></note> that “when all
                    the gods, both those who move visibly round the heavens, and those who appear to
                    us as often as they please, were generated, that God, who made the whole
                    universe, spoke to them after this manner: Ye gods of gods, of whom I myself am
                    father, attend.” Cicero teaches the very same doctrine with Plato concerning the
                    gods;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tiuc. Quest,</hi> lib. i. c, 29, and <hi rend="italic">De Nat. Dcorum,</hi>
                    passim.</p></note> and Maximus Tyrius, who seems to have understood the genius
                    of polytheism as thoroughly as any man, gives us the following clear account of
                    that system as received by the philosophers. “I will now more plainly declare my
                    sense by this similitude: Imagine a great and powerful kingdom or principality,
                    in which all agree freely and with one consent to direct their actions according
                    to the will and command of one supreme king, the oldest and the best; and then
                    suppose the bounds and limits of this empire not to be the river Halys, nor the
                    Hellespont, nor the Meotian Lake, nor the shores of the ocean; but the heavens
                    above and the earth beneath. Here, then, let that great king sit immoveable,
                    prescribing to all his subjects laws, in the observance of which consists their
                    safety and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536756" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6756-0341"
                    />happiness. The partakers of his empire being many, both visible and invisible,
                    are gods; some of them that are nearest and immediately attending on him, are in
                    the highest regal dignity, feasting as it were at the same table; others, again,
                    are their ministers and attendants; and a third sort are inferior to them both:
                    And thus you see how the order and chain of this government descends down by
                    steps and degrees from the Supreme God to the earth and men.” In this passage we
                    have a plain acknowledgement of one Supreme God, the sovereign of the universe,
                    and of three inferior orders of gods, who were his ministers in the government
                    of the world; and it is worthy of observation, that the same writer calls these
                    intelligences <hi rend="italic">όεους,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dεou
                    τrαιδας</hi><hi rend="italic">και</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;pιλoυς,</hi> gods,
                    the sons and friends of gods. He likewise affirms, that all ranks of men, and
                    all nations on earth, whether barbarous or civilized, held the same opinions
                    respecting one Supreme Numen, and the generation of the other gods.</p>
                <p>“If,” says he, “there were a meeting called of all these several professions, a
                    painter, a statuary, a poet, and a philosopher, and all of them were required to
                    declare their sense concerning <hi rend="italic">the god</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> do you think that the painter would say one thing, the statuary another,

                    nor the Greek, nor the Hyperborean. In other things we find men speaking very
                    discordantly, all men as it were differing from all. But amidst this war, and
                    contention, and discord, you may find everywhere, throughout the whole world,
                    one uniform law and opinion, that there is <hi rend="smallcaps">one God,
                    the</hi> KING AND <hi rend="smallcaps">father of all,</hi> and many gods, the
                    sons of God, who reign with God. These things both the Greek and the barbarian
                    affirm, both the inhabitants of the continent and of the sea-coast, both the
                    wise and the unwise.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>This account of philosophical polytheism receives no small support from the
                    Asiatic Researches of Sir William Jones. “It must always be remembered,” says
                    that accomplished scholar, “that the learned Indians, as they are instructed by
                    their own books, acknowledge only one Supreme Being, whom they call <hi
                    rend="italic">Brahm,</hi> or the Great One, in the neuter gender. They believe
                    his essence to be infinitely removed from the comprehension of any mind but his
                    own; and they suppose him to manifest his power by the operation of his divine
                    spirit, whom they name <hi rend="italic">Vishnu,</hi> the pervader, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Nerayan,</hi> or moving on the waters, both in the masculine
                    gender; whence he is often denominated the <hi rend="italic">first male.</hi>
                    When they consider the divine power as exerted in creating or giving existence
                    to that which existed hot before, they call the deity <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brahma</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when they view him in the light of
                    destroyer, or rather changer of forms, they give him a thousand names, of which
                    Siva, Iswara, and Mahadeva are the most common; and when they consider him as
                    the preserver of created things, they give him the name of Vishnu. As the soul
                    of the world, or the pervading mind, so finely described by Virgil, we see Jove
                    represented by several Roman poets; and with great sublimity by Lucan in the
                    well-known speech of Cato concerning the Ammonian oracle, ‘ Jupiter is wherever
                    we look, wherever we move.’ This is precisely the Indian idea of Vishnu; for
                    since the power of preserving created things by a superintending providence
                    belongs eminently to the godhead, they hold that power to exist transcendently
                    in the preserving member of the triad, whom they suppose to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >everywhere always,</hi> not in substance, but in spirit and energy.” This
                    supreme god Brahm, in his triple form, is therefore the only self-existent
                    divinity acknowledged by the philosophical Hindus. The other divinities are all
                    looked upon either as his creatures or his children, and of course are
                    worshipped only with inferior adoration.</p>
                <p>It was upon this principle of the generation of the gods, and of their acting as
                    ministers to the Supreme Numen, that all the philosophers of Greece, who were
                    not atheists, worshipped many divinities, though they either openly condemned or
                    secretly despised the traditions of the poets respecting the amours and
                    villanies of Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and the rest of the tribe. It was the same
                    principle sincerely admitted, and not an ill-timed jest, as has been absurdly
                    supposed, that made Socrates, after he had swallowed the poison, request his
                    friend to offer a votive cock for him to Aesculapius.</p>
                <p>But a theogony was not peculiar to the Greeks, Romans, and the Hindus; it formed
                    part of every system of polytheism. Even the Egyptians themselves, the grossest
                    of all idolaters, believed in one self-existing God, from whom all their other
                    divinities descended by generation. This appears probable from the writings of
                    Horus Apollo, Jamblicus, Porphyry, and many other ancient authors; but if the
                    inscription on the gates of the temple of Neith, in Sais, as we have it from
                    Plutarch and Proclus, be genuine, it will admit of no doubt. This famous
                    inscription, according to the last of these writers, was to this purpose: “I am
                    whatever is, whatever shall be, and whatever has been. My veil no man has
                    removed. The offspring which I brought forth was the Sun.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Persian Magi, as we have seen, believed in two self-existent principles, a
                    good and an evil. But if Diogenes Laertius deserves to be credited, they held
                    that fire, earth, and water, which they called gods, were generated of these
                    two. It was observed in the beginning of this article, that the first object of
                    idolatrous worship was probably the sun, and that this species of idolatry took
                    its rise in Chaldaea or Persia. But when it became the practice of eastern
                    monarchs to conceal themselves wholly from their people, the custom, as implying
                    dignity, was supposed to prevail in heaven as well as on earth; and Zoroaster,

                    from the sun as the sun is removed from the earth.” According to this
                    modification of Magianism, the sun was one of the generated gods, and held the
                    office of prime minister or vicegerent to the invisible fountain of light and
                    good. Still, however, a self-existent principle of evil was admitted; but though
                    he could not be destroyed or annihilated by any power, it was believed that he
                    would at last be completely vanquished by Ormuzd and his ministers, and rendered
                    thenceforward incapable of producing any further mischief.</p>
                <p>From this short view of polytheism, as we find it delineated by the best writers
                    of antiquity, we think ourselves warranted to conclude that the whole pagan
                    world believed in but one, or at most two, self-existent gods, from whom they
                    conceived all the other divinities to have descended in a manner analogous to
                    human generation. It appears, however, that the vulgar pagans considered each
                    divinity as supreme and unaccountable within his own province, and therefore
                    entitled to worship which rested ultimately in himself. The philosophers, on the
                    other hand, seemed to have viewed the inferior gods as accountable for every
                    part of their conduct to him who was their sire and sovereign, and to have paid
                    to them only that inferior kind of devotion which the church of Rome pays to
                    departed saints. The vulgar pagans were sunk in the grossest ignorance, from
                    which statesmen, priests, and poets, exerted their utmost<pb break="no"

                    emerging; for it was a maxim which, however absurd, was universally received,
                    that “there were many things true in religion,<note anchored="true"

                    which it was not convenient for the vulgar to know; and some things which,
                    though false, it was yet expedient that they should believe.” The polytheism and
                    idolatry of the vulgar, therefore, were their misfortune rather than their
                    fault. But the philosophers were wholly “without excuse;<note anchored="true"

                    but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
                    Professing themselves wise, they became fools, and worshipped and served the
                    creature more than the Creator, who is God blessed for ever.” <hi
