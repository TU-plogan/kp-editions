                <p><label type="entry">POLYNESIA</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polynesia</hi> is a name given by several early writers on
                    geography, but first, we believe, by De Barros, to the numerous islands
                    scattered over the Pacific Ocean, or, as it was usually called, the Great South
                    Sea. It is the name which is now applied by most modern geographers to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sixth</hi> great division of the earth’s surface; a division which
                    will probably appear, on examination, less arbitrary than some others; for
                    whether we consider it in a political, physical, or moral point of view, the
                    separation from America on the one hand, and from Australasia and the Asiatic
                    islands on the other, is marked by very strong and distinct features. A
                    considerable portion of the two last, for instance, have, ages ago, been invaded
                    and taken possession of by foreigners, and many of them have more recently been
                    colonized by Europeans. No colonies have yet been planted in Polynesia, with the
                    exception of that on one of the Ladrone Islands by Spaiu. Of late, however, many
                    of these islands have been visited by European missionaries, for the purpose of
                    spreading amongst the natives the light of the gospel.; and in many cases their
                    efforts have been so far successful that they have established permanent
                    settlements in these islands, and have instructed the natives, not only in the
                    doctrines of the Christian religion, but in all the mechanical arts and other
                    improvements of civilized society. The inhabitants have no political connection
                    with any of the other divisions of the earth, and little or none exists between
                    any two of its groups or separate islands, each being governed by its own
                    chiefs, and confining its friendships or hostilities to some neighbouring group
                    or island.</p>
                <p>Physically considered, the line of separation is almost as distinct as their
                    political seclusion. If a line be drawn in a south-easterly direction along the
                    eastern extremity of the Philippine Islands, Mindanao, Papua or New Guinea, New
                    Ireland, and Solomon’s Archipelago, and from thence continued southerly along
                    the eastern shores of the New Hebrides and New Zealand, this line will mark with
                    sufficient precision the separation of the Asiatic islands (mostly to the
                    northward of the equator) and Australasia (to the southward of the equator) from
                    Polynesia. Besides, the geological structure of the islands which constitute the
                    last-mentioned divisions is, generally speaking, essentially different,
                    consisting chiefly of lofty mountains of primary or secondary formation,
                    partaking of the same structure as those on the continent of Asia, with which
                    some of them indeed may probably have once been connected, their rugged sides
                    presenting as it were a broken barrier to the Great Pacific; whereas Polynesia
                    exhibits a series of low, flat islands, scarcely rising above the level of the
                    sea, which, with the exception of a few of the larger groups of volcanic
                    formation, arc the labours of minute sea animals, and are usually distinguished
                    by the name of Coral Islands or Reefs.</p>
                <p>In a moral point of view, the distinctive character of the Polynesians is as
                    strongly marked as the physical structure of the islands which they inhabit. In
                    the Eastern Archipelago, or the Asiatic islands, and in Australasia, two
                    distinct races of· men have been traced, the <hi rend="italic">black</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">broum.</hi> In the archipelago, and more particularly in
                    the Philippine Islands, a few individual families of the negro race were
                    discovered by the early European visitors; in New Guinea and the Papuan Islands
                    the whole population appears to consist of this race. They differ in some
                    respects from the negroes of the western coast of Africa, resembling rather
                    those which are found on the eastern coast, particularly in the hair, which is
                    strongly twisted into small tufts, and very different from that of the negro of
                    Guinea.</p>
                <p>None of these negroes have been discovered on any of the islands of Polynesia,
                    all the inhabitants being of the <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> race, and
                    evidently derived from the same common stock to which the Tartars, the Chinese,
                    the Japanese, and the Malays, owe their origin. In this opinion Sir William
                    Jones, Dr Buchanan, Dr Hunter, Mr Marsden, and Sir Stamford Raffles, unanimously
                    concur. This race, modified, of course, by the circumstances of climate,
                    occupations, and habits, may thus be described :—Their persons short, squat, and
                    robust; their lower limbs large and heavy; their arms fleshy; hands and feet
                    small; face somewhat of a lozenge shape, the forehead and chin rather sharpened,
                    but broad across the cheek-bones, which are high, and the cheeks hollow; the
                    eyes black, small, narrow, and placed obliquely in the head, the external angle
                    being the highest; nose broad, but not flat, and nostrils open and circular;
                    mouth rather wide; hair harsh, lank, and quite black.</p>
                <p>Dispersed as the Polynesians are, and rarely and purely: accidental as any
                    communication between distant islands must be, it is perfectly certain that the
                    different dialects spoken, from the shores of India and Africa to those of
                    America, are the derivatives of one common language, which, according to
                    Marsden, still forms the primitive portion of the Malay language, mixed as it
                    now is with Sanscrit and Arabic. “The Malayan,” says this learned and accurate
                    writer, “is a branch or dialect of the widely extended language prevailing
                    throughout the islands of the archipelago to which it gives name, and those of
                    the South Sea, comprehending, between Madagascar on the one side and Easter
                    Island on the other, both inclusive, the space of full two hundred degrees of
                    longitude. This consideration alone is ' sufficient to give it claim to the
                    highest degree of antiquity, and to originality, as far as that term can be
                    applied.”</p>
                <p>Not less remarkable is the general accordance of the Polynesians in manners,
                    superstitions, and religious observances. The conversion of the Malays of the
                    archipelago to Mahommedanism has obliterated nearly their ancient faith, but
                    enough still remains on some of the Asiatic islands, and still more on the
                    Asiatic continent, to trace the source whence the Polynesians have derived their
                    notions and practices on matters of this kind.</p>
                <p>These preliminary observations on the physical form, features, language, and
                    religion of the Polynesians, are made with a view to assert their common origin,
                    and may be taken as a general description of the natives of the various groups
                    of islands which are scattered over the surface of the vast Pacific Ocean. These
                    groups are exceedingly different in their extent, both as to number and size, as
                    well ’ as in their composition. Sometimes single islands are met with,
                    surrounded by rocky reefs. These islands and reefs are dispersed, as already
                    observed, over the whole of the Pacific Ocean, but chiefly between the thirtieth
                    degree of northern and the thirtieth degree of southern latitude. The following
                    classification will be found to embrace the greater part of those islands which
                    are comprehended under the geographical division Polynesia:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In the Northern Hemisphere.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The Marian or Ladrone Islands.</p>
                <p>2. The Carolinas, including the Pellew Islands.</p>
                <p>3. The Sandwich Islands. &lt;</p>
                <p>4. The numerous reefs and coral islands scattered over the Pacific in both
                    hemispheres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In the Southern Hemisphere.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The Friendly Islands, including the group of the Tonga Islands.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536431" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6431-0316"/>
                <p>2. The Navigators’ Islands.</p>
                <p>3. The Society Islands.</p>
                <p>4. The Georgian Islands, including Otaheite or Tahiti, and the great range
                    extending as far as Pitcairn’s Island.</p>
                <p>5. The Marquesas.</p>
                <p>6. Easter Island.</p>
                <p>IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.</p>
                <p>1. The Ladrone Islands were first discovered by Magelhaens on the 6th of March
                    1521. This name, by which they are generally known, was given to them by the
                    Spaniards on account of the thievish disposition of the natives. They also
                    called them Islas de los Velos Latinas, in reference to the sails of their
                    canoes. By some they were called Los Jardinas (the Gardens), and by others
                    Dosprazeres (the Delightful Islands); and when missionaries were first sent
                    thither in 1668, under the patronage of Mary-Anne of Austria, queen of Philip,
                    they took the name of Las Marianas, in honour of that lady. They consist of four
                    larger and several smaller islands. The former are called Saypan, Tinian, Zarpan
                    or Rosa, and Aguigan, or rather Guahan. Saypan has a lofty peak, evidently
                    volcanic, but the rest are of a moderate height, and are surrounded by rocks of
                    coral formation. They lie between latitude 13° and 15½° N., longitude about 144°
                    E.</p>
                <p>On approaching these islands, Magelhaens perceived that they were inhabited, and
                    the natives presently came off to the ships with cocoa-nuts, yams, and rice.
                    They were stout, well-made people, of a pale-yellow complexion, long black hair,
                    and their teeth dyed red or black; an apron of the bark of a tree was their only
                    covering, a lance pointed with a fish-bone their only weapon. Their boats had
                    lat-teen or shoulder of mutton sails, with outriggers to prevent their
                    upsetting, and they sailed with great swiftness. The captain-general was so
                    delighted with the appearance of the country, that he intended to refresh his
                    crew amongst them; but such numbers of the inhabitants flocked on board his
                    ships, and were so addicted to thieving, that, being under the necessity of
                    driving them away by force, hostilities ensued, and several of the natives were
                    killed. Magelhaens had one of his boats stolen, which so exasperated him that he
                    landed with ninety of his people, set fire to their houses, which were of wood,
                    and carried off all the provisions he could find.</p>
                <p>The expedition of Loyosa, commanded, after his death, by Sebastian del Cano, and
                    at his decease by Alonzo de Salazar, touched at the Ladrone Islands in 1526, and
                    being received in the most friendly manner, procured water and provisions in
                    plenty for the sickly squadron. To the great surprise of the Spaniards, a
                    countryman of theirs, named Gonzalo de Vigo, came to them from one of the
                    islands, having deserted from one of the ships of Magelhaens; two others, he
                    said, had deserted at the same time, but were put to death by the natives. They
                    found no quadrupeds on the island, but plenty of excellent fruits, fish, and
                    rice. The only birds were turtle-doves, of which the islanders appeared to be so
                    fond, that they kept them in cages, and taught them to speak.</p>
                <p>In 1565, the Ladrone Islands were again visited by Lopez de Legaspe∙ Whilst the
                    ships were yet two leagues from the shore, the natives came off in their canoes,
                    but kept at a distance from the ships. The general put knives and other articles
                    on a plank, and floated it off, and the natives showed fruits, patting their
                    bellies, and pointing to the shore, to induce the Spaniards to land. This they
                    did the following day on the island of Guahan, and exchanged bits of iron for
                    provisions; but notwithstanding the regulations made by Legaspe in order to
                    prevent quarrels, skirmishes took place, and one of the seamen, who had strolled
                    into the woods, being found murdered, the Spaniards landed’in force, set fire to
                    their houses and canoes, wounded several of the natives, and hung upon the spot
                    three wounded prisoners.</p>
                <p>No kind of aiīimal was found on the island, nor would the natives taste any other
                    animal food except fish. “But that which caused most admiration,” says Friar
                    Gaspar, “was, that they would drink salt water, and were such expert swimmers,
                    and passed so much of their time in the water, that, as among other animals,
                    some are amphibious, in like manner it seemed as if these people were in their
                    nature amphibious.”</p>
                <p>In 1588, our countryman Candish or Cavendish came in sight of the Ladrones, and
                    sailed along the coast of Guahan, from which a number of canoes came off with
                    fruits and vegetables, which were exchanged for pieces of iron; but the natives
                    became so troublesome, that, in order to get rid of them, Cavendish ordered
                    muskets to be fired at them.</p>
                <p>In 1600, Olivier Van Noort made the Ladrone Islands, and stopped near Guahan for
                    two days, from which island above two hundred canoes came off to the ships with
                    fish, fruits, and rice, to exchange for iron; and fowls are also mentioned, for
                    the first time, in this voyage. In the same year, the Santa Margarita, a Spanish
                    ship, having lost her captain and many of her crew by sickness, anchored off
                    Saypan, and was taken possession of by the natives, who killed some of the crew,
                    and took others of them on shore, where they were kindly treated, and such as
                    survived were afterwards taken off by a Spanish ship which had been sent for the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>In 1616, Spilbergen made the Ladrone Islands, and stopped two days to traffic
                    with the natives for provisions of fruit, fowls, and fish, in exchange for bits
                    of iron. In 1625, the fleet under Prince Maurice of Nassau refreshed at Guahan,
                    and were supplied by a hundred and fifty canoes, with immense quantities of
                    cocoa-nuts, yams, bananas, rice, ‘and fowls, which were of infinite service, as
                    the scurvy had made such havoc among the crews, that in some of the ships they
                    had scarcely strength enough to manage the sails.</p>
                <p>In the year 1668, the Spaniards established a mission on the island Guahan,
                    consisting of P. Servitores and five other fathers, with several lay-assistants,
                    most of them natives of the Philippine Islands, and well acquainted with the
                    Tagul language, the same as that spoken by the natives of the Ladrone Islands.
                    For some time the chiefs of the islands behaved with great kindness to the
                    Jesuits, and gave them ground for building a church. From this seat of the
                    mission the fathers spread themselves amongst the other islands, where they were
                    received with equal kindness. In short, P. Servitores says, that in the first
                    year they had baptized more than thirteen thousand islanders, and instructed
                    twenty thousand, in the eleven islands which they had visited. As usual,
                    however, the imprudent zeal of the missionaries ruined their cause, by shocking
                    the prejudices of the natives. These simple people took it into their heads
                    that, as an infant had died shortly after being baptized, its death had been
                    occasioned in consequence of that ceremony; and such was the terror of mothers
                    on seeing a missionary approach, that they seized their children and ran off
                    with them into the woods. This opinion gathered ground from the eagerness of the
                    Jesuits to get hold of infants for the purpose of baptizing them, and more than
                    one of these holy fathers fell martyrs to their imprudent zeal. Several murders
                    ensued; and, as the Spaniards had taken care to strengthen the mission with a
                    body of troops well armed, with the obvious intention of taking possession of
                    the Ladrones as an important outpost to the Philippine Islands, after a great
                    number of the natives had been put to death, the rest submitted to the yoke of
                    the Spaniards; though most of the missionaries suffered in the contest, and last
                    of all Servitores, who was killed by the man to whom he had been the greatest
                    benefactor, because the missionary insisted on baptizing his child. Thus, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193536444" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6444-0317"/> at the age of
                    forty-five, this pious and good man, for such he certainly was, fell by the hand
                    of an assassin, after having, as we are told, “established the faith in thirteen
                    islands, founded eight churches, established three seminaries for the
                    instruction of youth, and baptized nearly fifty thousand of the islanders.” From
                    this time constant revolts and massacres ensued, and the most inhuman cruelties
                    were inflicted on the unhappy islanders; so that, in 1681, the island of Guahan,
                    which, on the first landing of the Spaniards, counted forty thousand inhabitants
                    (some accounts make them more), had become so completely depopulated, that it
                    was found necessary to bring inhabitants from the northern islands to cultivate
                    the soil.</p>
                <p>In the year 1685, the ship of John Eaton, the bucaneer, touched at Guahan, the
                    crew of which quarrelled with the natives, and killed some of them. Having
                    satisfied the Spanish governor that it was done in their own defence, “he gave
                    us toleration,” says Cowley in his narrative, “to kill them all if we
                    could.”...“We took four of these infidels prisoners,” continues the narrator,
                    “and brought them on board, binding their hands behind them; but they had not
                    been long there, when three of them leaped overboard into the sea, swimming away
                    from the ship, with their hands tied behind them. However, we sent the boat
                    after them, and found a strong man, at the first blow, could not penetrate their
                    skins with a cutlass; one of them had received, in my judgment, forty shots in
                    his body before he died; and the last of the three that was killed had swam a
                    good English mile first, not only with his hands behind him, as before, but also
                    with his arms pinioned.” We are told by the late Captain Burney, that it is
                    stated in Cowley’s manuscript in the British Museum, that “the boat coming up
                    with them, our carpenter, being a strong man, thought with his sword to cut off
                    the head of one of them, but he struck two blows before he could fetch
                    blood.”</p>
                <p>In 1686, Dampier touched at Guahan, and states the number of natives not to
                    exceed a hundred. He gives a particular description of their “flying proas,”
                    with their outriggers, which, he says, “sail the best of any boats in the world;
                    that he tried the swiftness of one by his log, and that she ran twelve knots out
                    before the half-minute glass was half out.” “I believe,” says Dampier, “she
                    would run twenty-four miles an hour.” Woodes Rogers, who visited the Ladrones in
                    1710, states it as his opinion that one of these proas would sail at the rate of
                    twenty miles an hour.</p>
                <p>In the month of August 1742, Commodore Anson anchored before the island of
                    Tinian. It was deserted, but cattle to the number of at least ten thousand, hogs
                    and fowls, were running about wild. Cocoa-nuts in innumerable quantities,
                    bread-fruit, oranges, limes, water-melons, and other tropical fruits, were in
                    the greatest abundance. The island swarmed with rats, and the flics, mosquitoes,
                    and ticks or bugs, were very troublesome; but it was a paradise to the crew of
                    the Centurion, in the horrible state of scurvy in which they arrived. Though now
                    deserted, Tinian, on the arrival of the Spaniards, is said to have contained
                    thirty thousand inhabitants. Ruins of buildings, consisting of pyramidal pillars
                    of considerable dimensions, were met with in all parts of the island.</p>
                <p>Commodore Byron anchored in the year 1765 before Tinian, and found the island
                    overgrown with large trees and underwood, amongst which were most of the
                    tropical fruits. He complains bitterly of the bad anchorage, brackish water, and
                    venomous insects, from which they suffered so severely, that “we were afraid,”
                    he says, “to lie down in our beds and though his crew recovered fast from the
                    scurvy, he lost two by fevers, being the first deaths in his ship since leaving
                    England. “I am indeed of opinion,” says the commodore, “that this is. one of the
                    most unhealthy spots in the world, at least during the season in which we were
                    here ;” yet it was in the same month that it had been visited by the
                    Centurion.</p>
                <p>The latest account of these islands is that of Lieutenant Kotzebue, who visited
                    Guahan in 1817. No canoes nor proas, nor happy islanders, greeted his approach;
                    the whole race of natives had long been extirpated. “We looked,” he says, “in
                    vain for a canoe or a man on the shore; and it almost seemed as if we were off
                    an uninhabited island. The sight of this lovely country deeply affected me.
                    Formerly these fertile valleys were the abode of a nation, who passed their days
                    in tranquil happiness; now only the beautiful palm groves remained to overshadow
                    their graves; a deathlike silence everywhere prevailed.” Soon, however, a person
                    appeared from the Spanish governor, and piloted the ship into the harbour; and
                    after this, Kotzebue proceeded to the town of Agana, situated upon a beautiful
                    plain, some hundred paces from the shore, in the midst of fine palm groves, some
                    of the houses being built of coral rock, others of bamboo. It has a church and a
                    convent, and two fortresses, one to protect the town from the seawards, and the
                    other to keep the Indians in awe. The town contains about 200 houses, and 1500
                    inhabitants, who derive their origin from Mexicoand the Philippines. The
                    population of the island is about five thousand souls. “There is but one man and
                    his wife,” says Kotzebue, “on the whole island of the original stock; with the
                    death of these two people, the race of the old Ladrones will be totally
                    extinguished.” “The present race,” says Chamisso, “no longer know the sea, are
                    no mariners, no swimmers; they have ceased to build boats. They now scarcely
                    hollow out, without skill, the trunks of trees to fish within the breakers.” All
                    the other islands to the north of Guahan arc entirely uninhabited, and overrun
                    with wild cattle, hogs, and goats, which afford a supply to the American vessels
                    trading to the Sandwich Islands and the north-west coast of America. Indeed it
                    is said that some of these people have been allowed to settle themselves in
                    Agrigan, on condition of acknowledging their allegiance to Spain, and that they
                    are peopling the island by kidnapping the natives of the Sandwich Islands.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Carolinas,</hi> or Caroline Islands—In 1686, a Spanish
                    ship, being near the meridian of the Ladrones, fell in with an island, which her
                    commander, Don Francisco Lazeano, named La Carolina, in honour of the kiug of
                    Spain, Carlos II. This island has given the name to a very extensive chain
                    spreading over a space of not less than six degrees of latitude and twenty-five
                    degrees of longitude, the western extremity being the group of the Palaos or
                    Pellew Islands, in latitude 7° north, longitude I35° east, and the easternmost
                    island, that of Hogolen, in latitude 9° north, longitude 155° east. The whole
                    group, as far as is known, which, however, is very imperfectly, consists of at
                    least a hundred and fifty separate islands, and may be nearly twice as many,
                    besides various coral rcefs with islets upon them. Yet, numerous as they are,
                    being somewhat out of the direct and usual route of the Spaniards in their
                    voyages from South America to the Philippines, they had the good fortune to
                    escape any intimate connection with them; a connection which has proved equally
                    baneful to others, whether established by the cross or the sword, by their
                    professions of friendship or avowals of hostility. Go-bien, the historian of the
                    desolating progress of the Spaniards in the Ladrones, says that Quiroga, the
                    governor, made search for the island of Carolina, “wishing to extend the faith
                    to its infidel inhabitants, and, for that purpose, sent some soldiers, and with
                    them the chanionis (or chief), Don Alonzo Soon; but after a fruitless search,
                    and much pains, they returned without finding the object of their research.”</p>
                <p>. Some of these islands, however, and especially those towards the western
                    extremity of the group, had been seen by various navigators long before that of
                    Carolina was noticed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193536457"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6457-0318"/> and named by Lazeano. The Portuguese, Da Rocha,
                    fell in with islands in 9° or 10° north latitude, in 1526, which he named
                    Sequeira, after his pilot; and, in 1628, Saavedra, a Spaniard, in his passage to
                    the Philippines, discovered islands in latitude 11°, which he named Los Reyes.
                    In 1579, our countryman Drake saw some islands, to which he gave the name of the
                    Islands of Thieves, which, from his description, have been supposed to be the
                    Pellew Islands. In 1595, one of the islands, in about 6° north, was seen by
                    Mendana; but two proas full of people, driven by the violence of the wind from a
                    group of islands in the east, as far as Samal, roused the attention of the
                    College of Jesuits at Manilla, who made several unsuccessful attempts to
                    establish missions on those islands, which the wrecked natives described to
                    consist of thirty-two in number. In the year 1710, the two fathers, Duberron and
                    Cortel, embarked in the San Trinidad, with a crew of eighty-six men, to
                    establish themselves on the Pellew Islands. They landed on Sonsorol, with the
                    quartermaster and ensign of the troops, in all sixteen persons; but the ship
                    being driven off by the current, made for another of the islands, called
                    Panloque, at the supposed distance of fifty leagues from the Sonsorolles. On
                    approaching the island, several boats came of f; and some of the Palaos people
                    swam from them to the ship, and coming on board, attempted to steal whatever
                    they could lay their hands on. In consequence of this, they were ordered away;
                    and having reached their boats, began to shoot arrows at the ship, which were
                    answered by a discharge of musketry. The ship now returned to the Sonsorolles to
                    inquire after the two missionaries and the boat; but the strong winds ‘and
                    currents would not suffer them to anchor, nor could they see or hear anything of
                    their companions, though they stood in towards the shore within cannon shot. A
                    storm coming on, left them no alternative except “to return to Manilla, with the
                    sorrowful news of what had happened.” What became of the missionaries was never
                    ascertained. The following year, however, P. Serano departed from Manilla, in a
                    ship fitted out for the purpose, in search of the two fathers and their
                    companions; but she foundered three days after she departed from Manilla, and
                    every person on board perished, except one Spaniard and two Indians, who brought
                    back the melancholy intelligence.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses</hi> is a letter and
                    chart from P. Juan Antonio Cantova, a missionary at Guahan, addressed to the
                    king of Spain’s confessor in 1722, in which is given a more particular account
                    of the Carolinas than any which had before or has since been published. It
                    states that, in the preceding year, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> bark, with eleven
                    men, seven women, and six children, arrived on the east side of Guahan; and
                    that, two days after, another canoe, with four men, one woman, and child, came
                    to the opposite side of the island. The two parties, on being brought together,
                    recognised each other with great joy. It appeared they had been dispersed by a
                    gale of wind, and driven about for twenty days, without knowing where they were.
                    Cantova thus describes them: They wore a garment open at die sides, but covering
                    the shoulders and breast, and extending down to the knees. The women had a piece
                    of cloth round the waist, falling, like a petticot, to the middle of the leg.
                    Their hair was curly, the nose large, the eyes large and penetrating, and the
                    beards of the men moderately thick. Some had the pure colour of the Indians;
                    others were apparently of a mixed breed between Spaniards and Indians, and
                    others between a negro and an Indian. Cantova succeeded in learning their
                    language, and obtained from them the following particulars respecting their
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The Carolinas are divided into five provinces. Beginning at the east, the first
                    is named Cittac; the principal island, Hogolen. is much larger than Guahan; its
                    inhabitants are negroes, mulattoes, and whites. There are eighteen principal
                    islands in this province, besides a multitude of smaller ones. The second
                    province consists of about twenty-six islands, of which Ulee and Lamurree are
                    the principal ones. The third province consists of a grbup of islands, of which
                    Feis is the principal, being very populous and fertile; but the chief of the
                    group resides at Mogmog, and all the proas which approach this island lower
                    their sails in token of respect to this chief. Of the fourth province, Yap is
                    the principal island, about a hundred and twenty miles in circuit, very
                    populous, and fruitful. The fifth province is the most westerly, and is named
                    Panleu (the Palaos, or Pellew Islands), of which there are seven principal
                    islands. It is remarkable that the inhabitants of these islands so far differ
                    from the Carolinians in general, and from the account given of them in the
                    romance of Mr Keats, drawn up by that ingenious gentleman from the documents
                    furnished by Captain Wilson, that they are represented as a most barbarous race,
                    both men and women going entirely naked, and feeding on human flesh. We are told
                    by the naturalist of Kotzebue’s expedition, that a Spaniard, who had lived nine
                    months on the Pellew Islands, and whom they met with at Cavite, gave him a
                    horrible account of the natives; that they were wholly without shame, that
                    husbands lend their wives for a mere trifle, that the women are without modesty,
                    and that they certainly eat human flesh; a great part of which was confirmed by
                    a native of the Carolinas, who had been at the Pellew Islands.</p>
                <p>Cantova further learned from the islanders, that to the eastward were a great
                    number of other islands, the inhabitants of which pay adoration to the shark;
                    that most of them are negroes, and of savage dispositions. It is supposed that
                    Cantova returned with these islanders in the year 1722, though no account of any
                    such voyage is on record; but in 1731 he embarked for the islands of the third
                    province, in company with another father, of the name of Walter, from which the
                    former never returned. The latter, however, returned to procure certain articles
                    of which they stood in need, was driven to the Philippines, re-embarked in 1732,
                    and was wrecked. Walter again embarked in May 1733, along with forty-four
                    persons. On the ninth day they approached the, island, and fired cannon to
                    inform Cantova of their arrival, but no boat appeared. Standing within a
                    musket-shot of the shore, they observed that their former habitation had
                    disappeared, as well as the cross which had been erected near the sea-shore.
                    Four small canoes at length approached the vessel, bringing cocoa-nuts. On
                    inquiring after Cantova and his companions, the islanders were evidently
                    embarrassed, and said they were gone to Yap. Being fearful, by their manner,
                    that the good father had fallen by the hands of the barbarians, and willing to
                    be satisfied on this head, they seized one of the islanders, upon which the rest
                    swam ashore. After the strongest assurances that no harm should be done to him,
                    provided he would tell the truth, he confessed that shortly after the departure
                    of Walter, the natives put the Father Cantova to death, and all his companions,
                    fourteen in number. Cantova, it seemed, from this man’s account, went, with his
                    interpreter and two soldiers, to the island Mogmog, to baptize, whilst the rest
                    remained at Falalep. He had scarcely set his foot on shore when he was
                    surrounded and pierced through and through with lances, the natives crying out
                    that he was come to take away the old law, and give them a new one. They gave
                    his body a decent burial, but the bodies of his companions were put into a
                    canoe, which was then turned adrift upon the ocean. The same people then went
                    over to the island of Falalep, and put to death the remainder of the’ companions
                    of Cantova.</p>
                <p>Since that time, little or no information has been procured respecting the
                    Carolinas, with the exception of that which is contained in the narrative of Mr
                    Keats, from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536470" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6470-0319"
                    />materials of Captain Wilson, who, when commander of the Antelope packet, in
                    the service of the East India Company, was wrecked on Oroolong, one of the
                    Pellew Islands. Whatever their general character may be, the crew of the
                    Antelope found them a friendly, hospitable, and humane people. They were stout,
                    well made, rather above the middle size, and their colour approaching to a deep
                    brown; their hair long, some wearing it loose, and others turned up. The men
                    were entirely naked; the women contented themselves with two little aprons or
                    fringes, made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut husk, about ten inches deep and
                    seven wide, one of which was worn before, and the other behind. Both sexes were
                    tattooed; the men had one ear perforated, the women both, and they wore beads,
                    tortoise-shell, or leaves, as suited their fancy; the cartilage of the nose was
                    also bored, and a little sprig or blossom of some plant was generally stuck in
                    the hole; their teeth were dyed black by a paste prepared of certain herbs,
                    which, it is pretended, caused severe sickness for five days, the time required
                    to complete the operation.</p>
                <p>Fish and cocoa-nuts are the chief articles of food, but the islands afford an
                    abundant supply of yams, plantains, oranges, lemons, bread-fruit, carambola, and
                    the areca-nut; the sugar-cane grew wild. No quadruped, except rats, was found on
                    the islands; of birds, the pigeon was the most abundant, and the domestic fowl
                    ran wild in the woods. The natives were wholly unacquainted with the use of
                    salt. Their usual beverage consisted of the milk of the cocoa-nut. Their houses
                    were of bamboo and plank, raised upon stones from the ground. The husk of the
                    cocoa-nut supplied them with nets and cordage, and the tortoise-shell with hooks
                    to catch fish. Their knives were made of mother-of-pearl, shells, or split
                    bamboo; the cocoa-nut served them for cups, the plaintain leaf for plates, and
                    the fibres of this plant for mats to sleep on. Their weapons were spears of
                    wood, darts, and slings. Their boats were canoes made of the trunks of large
                    trees, and some of them sufficiently capacious to hold from twenty to thirty
                    persons. In the day-time they seemed to live as much in the water as on shore,
                    and both sexes were admirable swimmers. The women mixed freely with the other
                    sex, and their conduct was not strictly inquired into by their husbands. They
                    seemed to have little sense of any religious duties, except in the ceremonies
                    attending the burial of the dead, which takes place in spots set apart for that
                    purpose, and with great solemnity; but they have some faint notion that the soul
                    survives the body. Their graves very much resembled those in a country
                    church-yard of England, some having earth heaped up in the same manner, and
                    others covered with flat tombstones, and protected by fences of wicker-work.</p>
                <p>The larger of the Pellew Islands are of a moderate height, rising into beautiful
                    hills, well clothed with forest trees. The natural history still remains
                    unknown, but being about the same parallel and of the same formation with the
                    numerous group visited by Kotzebue, the plants and animals are in all
                    probability much the same. The smaller islands are the productions of the
                    coral-making animals, with which the larger are also surrounded to a great
                    distance from their shores.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Sandwich Islands</hi> This fine group of islands in the
                    Northern Pacific had the good fortune to escape the visits of the old
                    navigators, and the discovery of them was reserved for Captain Cook, who first
                    touched at them in the year 1778, and lost his valuable life there in 1779. Μ.
                    Fleurieu, in his introduction to Marchand’s Voyage, is disposed to dispute this
                    claim, and to assign the first discovery of these islands to Mendana, for no
                    other reason but that it appears he passed at no great distance from Owyhee, but
                    without seeing it, on his return voyage in 1568; and because he finds an island
                    named Mesa laid down on the nineteenth parallel of latitude, on the obscure and
                    unauthenticated chart of Galion de Manille. It is almost unnecessary to add,
                    that the name by which they are now known was given to them by Captain Cook, in
                    honour of the Earl of Sandwich, under whose naval administration geography was
                    enriched with many important discoveries.</p>
                <p>According to Captain King, the group consists of eleven islands. But the
                    missionaries only enumerate ten; and they reduce the population below the
                    estimate of former voyagers. The following is the estimated length, breadth, and
                    superficial contents of these islands. The names are given according to the
                    orthography of the missionaries.</p>

                <p>These measurements, as given by Kotzebue, agree within a few toises with those of
                    Marchand. The whole group is of volcanic origin, and on the summit of Mouna
                    Wororai is an immense crater. The last eruption from the side of this mountain
                    took place in 1801. The chain of mountains runs from the north-west point of
                    Owyhee, over the islands Mowhee, Morotoi, and Woahoo. On Mowhee is a peak as
                    high nearly as that of Wororai, but the latter is the only volcano in a state of
                    activity.</p>
                <p>These islands, though volcanic, are surrounded by coral reefs, and the plains
                    next the sea, which are raised only a few feet above it, were once of the same
                    description, and covered with water. These plains are generally naked and
                    sunburnt, but the valleys amongst the mountains are beautifully picturesque and
                    fertile, and the sides of the hills are covered with magnificent forests. The
                    most fertile and best cultivated of the group is Woahoo, on which is the safe
                    and capacious harbour of Hana-rura, protected by a coral reef through a break of
                    which lies the entrance to it. In one of the mountains a diamond mine was
                    supposed to exist, but the products turned out to be only quartz crystals. In
                    the Pearl River of this island oysters have been found containing pearls, but
                    none of much value.</p>
                <p>Amongst the indigenous plants mentioned by Chamisso, the naturalist of Kotzebue’s
                    expedition, are the acacia, me-trosideros, pandanus, santalum, aleurites,
                    dracoena, amomi-um, curcuma, tacca. The families of rubiaceae, contortae, and
                    urticae, predominate. From the latter, as well as from the paper mulberry <hi

                    tree, the bread-fruit, sugar-cane, yam, batatos, and the taro-root <hi
                    rend="italic">{Arum</hi><hi rend="italic">esculentum),</hi> of indigenous
                    growth; besides which have been introduced the tobacco plant, the melon, and
                    water-melon, rice, and the vine, the last of which will unquestionably thrive
                    well on the sides of the volcanic mountains; also cucumbers, cabbages, beans,
                    and the cloth plant, together with a few oranges and pine-apples. The
                    cultivation of the taro-root has the greatest share of attention bestowed on it;
                    and, in fact, it constitutes a considerable portion of the food of the people.
                    The fields or ponds in which this root is planted are enclosed with stones in
                    the form of regular squares, from a hundred to two hundred feet each side; these
                    squares are connected by sluices to convey the water from one to the other,
                    pretty much in the same manner that the Chinese manage their rice-fields. “I
                    have seen,” says Kotzebue, “whole mountains covered with such fields, through
                    which the water gradually flowed; each sluice formed a small cascade, which ran
                    through avenues of sugar-cane, or banana, into the next pond, and afforded an
                    extremely picturesque prospect.”</p>
                <p>A convict from New South Wales has taught the people of these islands the art of
                    distilling ardent spirits from sugarcane, and a plant called the tee-root (the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dracaena</hi><hi rend="italic">terminalis).</hi> And, as every
                    chief has now his still, it is probable that the use of the pernicious <hi
                    rend="italic">kava</hi> will give way to that of the almost equally pernicious
                    spirituous liquors. This <hi rend="italic">kava</hi> is the liquor or juice of a
                    root of the pepper tribe <hi rend="italic">{Piper methysticum),</hi> chewed and
                    spit out into a large bowl, and then diluted with water, and this exquisite
                    beverage is prepared for the sole use of the king and the nobles, the women
                    being prohibited from tasting it. The baneful effects of this liquor have been
                    noticed by most voyagers; the bodies of those who swallow it are, in process of
                    time, covered with a white scurf, their eyes become red and inflamed, their
                    limbs emaciated, and their whole frame trembling and paralytic.</p>
                <p>When Captain Cook first discovered these islands, the only quadrupeds upon them
                    were hogs, dogs, and rats. They have now horses, asses, horned cattle, many of
                    them running wild in the mountains, and goats. Hogs are exceedingly abundant.
                    “They are so large,” says Kotzebue, “that the whole crew could not eat one in
                    two days ;” and the flavour, from being fed on sugar-cane, is very superior to
                    European pork. Fowls, ducks, and geese, are equally abundant.</p>
                <p>The Sandwich Islands, though last discovered, have been more frequently visited
                    by Europeans and Americans, and particularly by the latter, than any other group
                    of islands in the whole range of Polynesia; and they have made greater advances
                    in civilization than any other of the Polynesian islands. They were indebted for
                    this superiority to the enterprising character of their monarch, Tamehameha I.,
                    who seems fully to have appreciated the advantages of European improvements.
                    When Captain Vancouver visited these islands in 1792, the king being‘desirous of
                    having a vessel of European construction, this able navigator laid down the keel
                    of one, which was speedily finished. Ten or twelve years after this, when Mr
                    Turnbull visited the islands, he Had a naval force of twenty vessels or upwards,
                    from twenty-ty-five to fifty tons, which traded amongst the islands. He had
                    built a house for himself, after the European manner, with windows of glass, and
                    he imitated the English in his dress. By means of English and American seamen
                    and artificers, some of whom deserted from ships touching there, and others
                    obtained regular permission to remain on the islands, most of the trades
                    exercised in Europe were partially introduced into the Sandwich Islands.</p>
                <p>The attention of Tamehameha, though he was a decided reformer, was chiefly
                    directed to the improvement of his dress and dwelling, to the building of forts
                    for the protection of his islands, and to the training of his soldiers in the
                    European mode of discipline. But he was not equally solicitous for intellectual
                    improvements; and he adhered most tenaciously to the faith and to all the
                    customs of his forefathers. In a visit to the Morai, pointing to the large
                    wooden statues, he said to Kotzebue, “These are our gods, whom I worship.
                    Whether I do right or wrong I do not know, but I follow my faith, which cannot
                    be wicked, as it commands me never to do wrong.” Such sentiments do honour to
                    the savage; and the man who entertains them is capable of being instructed in
                    better things.</p>
                <p>During his reign, also, the women continued to be degraded and despised; and,
                    notwithstanding the frequent intercourse with strangers, and the improvements
                    which undoubtedly have been introduced, the sex do not appear to have gained a
                    single step in the estimation of the men, or lost any part of their grossness of
                    behaviour since they were first visited by Captain Cook. That “offensively
                    conspicuous wantonness,” which Vancouver deplores, and to which he found no
                    parallel in the whole of Polynesia, appears to have suffered no abatement. When
                    Campbell, the seaman, was on the island of Woahoo, the king’s brother died, on
                    which occasion, as part of the general mourning, a public prostitution of the
                    women took place. The captain of a ship then in the harbour remonstrated with
                    the king, who coolly observed, it was their custom, and he could not prevent it.
                    The women, too, it seems, are more addicted to drinking than the men. The
                    governor of Woahoo invited Kotzebue and his officers to witness a dance of the
                    natives, at which he was not present, but sent an apology to say, that his lady
                    was so drunk that he could not leave her. The women are also great smokers of
                    tobacco, and continue it sometimes till they fall down senseless.</p>
                <p>Though the women are so far degraded that they cannot eat in the same house with
                    their lords and masters, and must not taste at all of certain articles, yet if
                    the latter be sick, they must howl and make lamentations, tear their hair,
                    lacerate their cheeks; and if he should die (provided he be a Jcrrie, Eree, or
                    noble), the favourite wife must die with him. The victims, both men and women,
                    who are to be sacrificed at the death of Tamehameha, are well known; nor is it
                    concealed even from themselves, and they glory in the distinction. “I have
                    myself,” says Kotzebue, “seen one of the devoted victims in Woahoo, a man who
                    was always cheerful and happy.” On the death of the king, these people will be
                    led bound into the royal Morai (temple and burning place), where, after the
                    prescribed ceremonies, they will suffer death at the hands of the priests. The
                    ancient system of idolatry was calculated to operate on the fears of its
                    votaries. “Its requisitions,” says one of the missionary writers,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Evangelical Magazine, No. 37,
                    January 1826, p. 30.</p></note> “were severe, and its rites cruel and bloody.
                    Grotesque and horrid wooden figures, animals, and the bones of chiefs, were the
                    objects of worship. Human sacrifices were offered whenever a temple was to be
                    dedicated, or a chief was sick, or a war was to be undertaken, and these
                    occasions were frequent. The apprehensions which the people have of a future
                    state were undefined and fearful. The lower orders expected to be slowly
                    devoured by evil spirits, or to dwell with the gods in burning mountains. The
                    several professions, such as that of the fisherman, the tiller of the ground,
                    and the builder of canoes and houses, had each their presiding deities.
                    Household gods are also kept, which the natives worshipped in their habitations;
                    the volcanoes had moreover a superintending power. One merciful provision,
                    however, had existed from time immemorial, and that was sacred enclosures,
                    places of refuge, into which those who <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536496"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6496-0321"/>fled from war or from any violent pursuer might
                    enter and there be safe.”</p>
                <p>To violate the sanctity of the Morai is one of the greatest crimes of which a man
                    can be guilty. Campbell was present at the execution of a man who had committed
                    this offence, in getting drunk and running out of the Morai during <hi
                    rend="italic">tabboo</hi> time. He was taken back to the Morai, where his eyes
                    were put out; in this state he remained two days, when he was strangled and his
                    body exposed before the image of Etooah, or Eatooah, the principal deity, who,
                    according to their belief, is the creator of the universe, and who afterwards
                    destroyed it by an inundation that covered the whole earth except Mouna Roa, on
                    the top of which one single pair had the good fortune to save themselves, from
                    whom the present race of men, that is, the Sandwich Islanders, sprung.</p>
                <p>That singular superstition by which the king, the nobles, and the priests, under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">tabboo,</hi> have contrived to render sacred and
                    inviolable whatever they may wish to appropriate to their own use, and which is
                    in universal operation through the whole of Polynesia, is practised to a great
                    extent in the Sandwich Islands. By means of it, a whole people are contented to
                    be robbed of their property, and to suffer any privations that may be imposed on
                    them, without murmuring. When their houses are <hi rend="italic">tabbooed</hi>
                    they dare not enter them; when their <hi rend="italic">taro-roots</hi> or their
                    hogs are tabbooed, they surrender them without a struggle; but in return, it
                    must be owned, they are not scrupulous in appropriating to themselves whatever
                    is not <hi rend="italic">tabbooed.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the customs which they in veterately retain, is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tattooing</hi> the body; this operation being also universal amongst the
                    islanders of the Pacific. The hands and arms of the women, in particular, are
                    marked with peculiar elegance of figure, and many of the w omen have the tip of
                    the tongue tattooed. Contrary, however, to the common practice of the islanders,
                    they do not paint their bodies, nor wear ornaments of any kind in the ears; but
                    the women decorate their hair, which is cut short, with wreaths of flowers, and
                    wear necklaces, bracelets, and anklets of shells, coral, and other substances.
                    The common dress of the men is the <hi rend="italic">maro</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> a piece of cloth about a foot wide, which, passing between
                    the legs, is tied round the waist; that of the women is a short petticot,
                    reaching about half-way down the thigh. The chiefs, on days of ceremony, and on
                    particular occasions, wear cloaks made of the most beautiful feathers, with an
                    elegantly-shaped helmet to correspond. They are ambitious, however, to appear in
                    the dress of Europeans, to enable them to do which, great quantities of old
                    laced coats are carried out to the Sandwich Islands as articles of commerce.</p>
                <p>The character of these islanders, like that of all savages in their natural
                    state, is stained with every degrading vice. The missionaries who were stationed
                    in the island, and who had the best opportunities of estimating the dispositions
                    of the natives, describe them as lamentably debased; being in the continual
                    practice of theft, treachery, drunkenness, gross licentiousness, and
                    infanticide, and strangers to every social and domestic virtue. Polygamy is the
                    common custom; and murder by poison is believed by the natives to be very
                    frequent. Great improvements have, however, been effected by the instructions of
                    the missionaries, who have persevered in this, as in the other islands, with an
                    enthusiasm that has at length been crowned with success, and has laid the
                    foundation of a great moral change in the condition of these barbarous
                    islanders. The system of idolatry, so far as it was connected with the
                    government, was abolished by Rhio-Rhio, or Tamehameha II., the son and successor
                    of Tamehameha L, who laid the foundation of social improvement amongst his
                    subjects. This took place in 1819, beforeany Christian missionaries came in to
                    his dominions. He was induced to adopt this policy from various causes, namely,
                    a desire to improve the condition of his wives, who were subject, along with all
                    other females, to many inconveniences, from the operation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tabboo</hi> already explained. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>
                    Several foreigners and intelligent chiefs advised the change; and the report of
                    what had been done by Pomare, king of Otaheite, in the Georgian Islands, had
                    great weight with him. Some disturbances took place in consequence of the
                    abolition of idolatry; but the insurgents were defeated, and peace was restored.
                    In 1820, missionaries were, after some difficulty, allowed to settle, some at
                    Kairua, but the greater number at Honororu, on the island of Oahu or Woahoo.
                    They had to encounter difficulties, moral as well as physical, in their
                    ignorance of a rude unwritten language, which they mastered, however, by
                    perseverance, and constructed an alphabet, and finally a grammar and
                    spellingbook, which was in great demand amongst the natives. In the year 1822
                    they had made such proficiency that Mr Ellis began to preach in the native
                    language; and six missionary stations were established, at each of which a
                    church was erected, and worship regularly celebrated on the Sunday. In 1824, the
                    king and queen of the Sandwich Islands embarked, amidst the sighs and tears of
                    their subjects, on a voyage to Great Britain, where they died the same year.
                    Their bodies, with their surviving attendants, were brought to the Sandwich
                    Islands in the Blonde frigate, under the command of Lord Byron. Kamkeoli, the
                    brother of the king, was unanimously acknowledged as his successor, under whose
                    protection the missionaries continued their labours, often under great
                    discouragements, in establishing schools, planting churches, training native
                    teachers and missionaries, and in instructing the people in industry and the
                    mechanical arts. The church at Oahu was resorted to by great numbers. It
                    contains only seven hundred, and two thousand were often assembled without
                    doors. According to late accounts, sixty-three schools, containing 1583
                    scholars, and under the superintendence of native teachers, had been visited;
                    besides others in the vicinity of Honororu. Spelling-books to the amount of
                    thirteen thousand had been distributed amongst the people. Amongst those who
                    paid attention to the instructions of the missionaries, numbers made an open
                    profession of the Christian faith; and amongst all a stricter morality
                    prevailed. They became more humane, more industrious and honest; the females no
                    longer, as formerly, resorted for prostitution to British ships; they adopted a
                    different dress, after the European fashion, and many were baptized. This sudden
                    change, however, appears to have been owing as much to the love of novelty as to
                    the influence of a purer faith; and, accordingly, it has been found in this, as
                    in the other islands, that the gloss of novelty having worn off, many of the
                    wholesome restraints imposed upon their unbridled passions have been thrown off,
                    and they have relapsed into their former barbarous and profligate habits. Still
                    the seeds of civilization have been scattered far and wide, and in due time, we
                    may be assured, they will bear fruit. The people may relapse to a certain
                    degree, but they will never sink to their former state of barbarism. There is no
                    doubt, in short, that since the missionaries have established themselves in
                    these islands, and our ships of war have frequented them, a great change has
                    taken place in the habits and moral character of the natives. “I was glad,” says
                    Captain Bruce of the Imogene, “that, at the spot where the intrepid navigator
                    Cook met his untimely end, his memory is cherished with the greatest veneration,
                    and that the prevalence of Christianity is now general throughout the island.”
                    The same observation will apply to the Society Islands, and indeed to all those
                    where the missionaries have established themselves. The odious part of the
                    habits and manners of the people is fast disappearing.</p>

                    facs="nls:193536509" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6509-0322"/>from the various tracts of
                    ships, it is known that the whole of that part of the Pacific lying between the
                    equator and the tenth degree of north latitude, and from the Pellew Islands to
                    180° longitude, being at least forty-five degrees of longitude, is completely
                    studded with low coral islands and reefs in countless numbers, some of them
                    inhabited, and others not; and in different stages, from the circular reef, with
                    islets rising upon it like the beads of a necklace, with a lagoon in the centre,
                    to the complete consolidation, into one firm island. About the tenth parallel,
                    and proceeding easterly from the Carolinas, we have Button, Tindall, Watt’s, and
                    Gilbert’s Islands; and about the longitude 175° east, a whole group, extending
                    to the southward of the equator, named on some charts “Lord Mulgrave’s Range,”
                    on others “Scarborough’s Range some of the individual islands of which are
                    Smith’s, Allen’s, Gillespie’s, Toulmin’s, Hopper’s, Chatham’s, Calvert’s,
                    Robertson’s, Arrowsmith’s, Daniel’s, Marshall’s, Pott’s, near to which are
                    Kingmill’s Group and Byron’s Island, all of coral formation.</p>
                <p>Various accounts have been given by Cook, Forster, Flinders, and others, of the
                    progressive formation of these low specks of land, with which the Pacific is
                    studded; but the best and most satisfactory is that by Kotzebue and the
                    naturalist Chamisso. They not only saw the Lord Mulgrave’s chain of islands,
                    which extend from 1° to 12° north, of which Gilbert’s Islands form the northern
                    and Marshall’s Island the southern extremity, but they discovered and examined
                    minutely many other groups and detached islands. Between the eighth and tenth
                    degrees of north latitude, and between longitude 188. 48. and 190. 46., they
                    encountered no less than six distinct groups, to which they understood the
                    natives applied the name of Radack; and they learned that to the westward were
                    nine other groups, and three detached islands, called Ralick, besides four
                    groups to the southward. The Radack chain probably includes those which were
                    seen by Captain Marshall in 1788, and to which he gave the name of Chatham and
                    Calvert Islands, though Kruzenstcm thinks that these arc the same as the Ralick
                    chain. It is not of much importance in a geographical point of view, whatever it
                    might be for the benefit of navigation.</p>
                <p>The small size of Kotzebue’s vessel gave him the advantage of sailing through the
                    openings in the circular reefs, and of examining the lagoons within them. From
                    his account, it would seem that the coral-making animals do not commence their
                    labours at the very depth of the ocean, as has been supposed, but on rocky
                    shoals, the summits, in all probability, of submarine mountains, round which
                    they lay the foundation of their extraordinary fibres, forming an united chain,
                    irregular in shape, but generally approaching, more or less, to a circle. The
                    greatest depth at which they are able to derive a sufficient degree of light and
                    heat for their operations has not yet been ascertained; but we know that marine
                    animals have been drawn up in a living state from the depth of a thousand
                    fathoms, and from a temperature very little above that of the freezing point.
                    The outer edge of the reef exposed to the surf of the sea is the first that
                    shows itself above the water; in process of time it becomes indurated, breaks,
                    and crumbles, by the action of the sea, and at length forms a sort of barrier,
                    within the sloping sides of which the living animals arc seen carrying on their
                    operations. Those observed by Chamisso were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubipora</hi><hi rend="italic">musica,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Millepora
                    caerulea, obsticho-pora, actimas,</hi> and various kinds of the polypus. He
                    found the living branches of the <hi rend="italic">lythophytes</hi> generally
                    attached to the dead stems; many of the latter, however, crumbled into sand,
                    which, accumulating on the inner declivity, constitutes no inconsiderable part
                    of the surface of the new islands that rise out of this reef, and are gradually
                    united into one island, having in its centre a salt-water lake, that alternately
                    grows up by a silent and slow progress, till what was at first a chain of
                    islets, has become one connected mass of land. The progress towards a state fit
                    for the habitation of man has been well described by Chamisso.</p>
                <p>“As soon as it has reached such a height that it remains almost dry at low water,
                    at the time of ebb, the corals leave off building higher; sea-shells, fragments
                    of coral, seahedgehog shells, and their broken-off prickles, arc united by the
                    burning sun, through the medium of the cementing calcareous sand, which has
                    arisen from the pulverization of the above-mentioned shells into one whole or
                    solid stone, which, strengthened by the continual throwing up of new materials,
                    gradually increases in thickness, till it at last becomes so high that it is
                    covered only during some seasons of the year by the high tides. The heat of the
                    sun so penetrates the mass of stone when it is dry, that it splits in many
                    places, and breaks off in flakes. These flakes, so separated, are raised one
                    upon another by the waves at the time of high water. The always active surf
                    throws blocks of coral (frequently of a fathom in length, and three or four feet
                    thick) and shells of marine animals between and upon the foundation stones;
                    after this, the calcareous sand lies undisturbed, and offers to the seeds of
                    trees and plants, cast upon it by the waves, a soil upon which they rapidly
                    grow, to overshadow its dazzling white surface. Entire trunks of trees, which
                    are carried by the rivers from other countries and islands, find here, at
                    length, a resting place, after their long wanderings; with these come some small
                    animals, such as lizards and insects, as the first inhabitants. Even before the
                    trees form awood, the real sea-birds nestle there; strayed land-birds take
                    refuge in the bushes; and, at a much later period, when the work has been long
                    since completed, man also appears, builds his hut on the fruitful soil formed by
                    the corruption of the leaves of the trees, and calls himself lord and proprietor
                    of this new creation.”</p>
                <p>IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Friendly Islands.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    Friendly Islands, amongst which may also be included the Feejee Islands, were
                    first discovered by Abel Jansen Tasman in 1643, to three of which he gave the
                    names of Amsterdam, Middleburgh, and Rotterdam. The first of these islands is
                    that which was afterwards visited by Captain Cook, and described by him under
                    the name of Tongataboo; more properly, as we since learn from Mr Mariner, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tonga,</hi> the annexed word <hi rend="italic">Tabboo,</hi> so
                    extensively used throughout Polynesia, being expressive only of its sacred
                    character. From the inhabitants of this island Tasman received yams, cocoa-nuts,
                    bananas, hogs, and fowls, in exchange for iron, nails, beads, and pieces of
                    linen. They had also plenty of sugar-canes. Women as well as men swam off to the
                    ship, -and it was observed that all the elder dames had the little finger of
                    both bands cut off, but the young women had not. They wore round the middle a
                    covering of mat-work, which reached down to their knees; the rest of the body
                    naked. None of the men would taste wine, and they were ignorant of the use of
                    tobacco; they had no arms of any kind, which led Tasman to conclude that they
                    lived in perpetual peace and friendship.</p>
                <p>Tasman next touched at Ammomooka, or, as he called it, Amsterdam Island, in the
                    hope of meeting with better water than on the first, where it was bad and
                    scanty. On landing, they perceived some sixty or seventy persons sitting quietly
                    on the shore, who had no arms of any kind, and appeared to be a harmless and
                    peaceable people. There were, besides, many women and children, the former
                    clothed like those on Amsterdam Island; but they were of a larger size, and as
                    strong in their bodies and limbs as the men. The party was shown to a piece of
                    fresh water not a mile from the shore, about a quarter of a mile in
                    circumference, and about a musket-shot from the north side of the island, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193536522" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6522-0323"/> where there was a
                    good sandy bay. Here they watered their ships, and received abundance of
                    provisions, the same in kind as those of the other island. The inhabitants are
                    described as being great thieves, but very friendly. They have large vessels
                    with masts, sails, and outriggers, as well as canoes, and on going into the
                    interior of the island it was observed that all their plantations were laid out
                    in neat and regular order. “There was not,” says Captain Cook, “an inch of waste
                    ground; the roads occupied no more space than was absolutely necessary; the
                    fences did not take up above four inches each, and even this was not wholly
                    lost, for in many were planted some useful trees or plants. It was everywhere
                    the same; change of place altered not the scene; nature, assisted by a little
                    art, nowhere appears in more splendour than here.” The missionaries, too, in
                    1797, found these islands in as high a state of cultivation and beauty as they
                    appeared to Tasman and to Cook.</p>
                <p>A woful difference in their peaceable habits, according to Mr Mariner, has taken
                    place since the visits of these Europeans. In 1799 a revolution took place, and
                    from that time bloody wars and most savage slaughter have desolated these
                    beautiful islands. They were first commenced, as it would appear, by a most
                    atrocious savage, in whom the kingly power was vested, who not only practised
                    the most barbarous cruelties on his subjects, but seized upon the sacred or
                    ecclesiastical power, which had always, as in Japan, been kept separate from the
                    secular arm. The sacred spell being thus broken, which rested solely on public
                    opinion, a complete revolution followed, and from that hour these once happy
                    islands have been the scene of slaughter, famine, and every species of horror
                    and misery. We must not, however, give implicit credit to all that has been
                    stated by Dr Martin, the writer of Mariner’s account of these islands, but
                    rather consider it as a romantic exaggeration of facts and descriptions, similar
                    to that of the Pellew Islands by Mr Keats. There are shades of difference merely
                    between the inhabitants of these and of the neighbouring islands.</p>
                <p>In 1833, missionaries were detached from Tahiti, the centre of all the
                    settlements in the South Seas, to these islands. They experienced on their
                    arrival difficulties and discouragements from the barbarous inhabitants; but by
                    perseverance they expect to obtain a footing, and to introduce amongst them the
                    blessings of civilization, as well as into the other islands among these
                    seas.</p>
                <p>The Harvey Islands<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Miwiojiary Chronicle for September 1826.</p></note> are situated between 19°
                    and 22° south latitude, and 160° west longitude, and are between 500 and 600
                    miles south-west by west from Otaheite or Tahiti. They consist of the island
                    Manaia or Mangeca, a small island containing only 1000 or 1500 inhabitants;
                    Rarotonga, a much larger island, containing from 6000 to 7000 inhabitants;
                    Aitutake; Mantii or Mante; Mitiaro, a very small island; Atui. Three of these
                    islands are not laid down in any chart. The missionaries, when they first
                    visited them, met with every discouragement, and could scarcely preserve
                    themselves and their wives from the violence of the king. Two missionaries,
                    however, visited these islands in 1823, and two native teachers were also left
                    in 1824; and in the course of two months they had made a hundred and twenty
                    converts. In 1825, these islands were visited by missionaries from this country,
                    and it was found that great progress had been made in civilizing and instructing
                    the inhabitants. Many had learned to read; whilst their idolatrous and cruel
                    practices, such as infanticide, had been abolished. More decent clothing had
                    been adopted by the women, who were no longer so ready to offer themselves for
                    prostitution to crews of foreign vessels when they arrived. An attempt that was
                    made to plant the Christian religion in the Feejee Islands had failed. But a
                    vessel from New South Wales having touched at La-gebain 1829 or 1830, the
                    captain had a friendly conversation with the chief, who requested that a
                    missionary might be sent. A teacher, accordingly, set sail from Otaheite, and
                    landed on these islands in 1830.</p>
                <p>In 1830, two missionary teachers were left on the Friendly Islands, in which,
                    though distinct, the Feejee Islands have been included. They were kindly
                    received, but were informed by the king that he could not embrace Christianity
                    until after he had consulted with all the chiefs of the other islands; that they
                    had been erecting a most extensive Morai, about seventy-six feet in height, all
                    of stone, which had given way three times, and which misfortune they ascribed to
                    the power of the new God. Oiìe chief converted by native missionaries, expressed
                    his adherence to the Christian faith, amidst the scoffs, jeers, and even threats
                    of his countrymen.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Navigators Islands.</hi> —To the north-east of the Feejee,
                    Tonga, or Friendly Islands, are situated the Bauman: or Navigators’ Islands. The
                    first name was given to them after Captain Bauman, of the Teinhoven, by Jacob
                    Roggewein, by whom they were discovered, in 1722; and the latter name was
                    conferred by Bougainville, who passed them in 1768. La Perouse likewise visited
                    these islands, and is of opinion that they are not the same as Bauman’s Islands,
                    because their geographical position does not agree with that assigned to them by
                    Roggewein. Burney, however, has no doubt that they are identical, the only
                    difference being in their supposed longitude, which, in the time of Roggewein,
                    was frequently set down erroneously by several degrees.</p>
                <p>These islands form an archipelago, consisting, according to La Perouse, of ten in
                    number, of which Maouna, Oyo-lava, and Pola are the largest and most beautiful.
                    The parallel of 14° south latitude, and the meridian of 190°, pass through the
                    centre of the group. According to the missionaries, these islands, which they
                    also designate as the Samoa Islands, are eight in number, four in the windward
                    group, and four in the leeward group, two much larger than Otaheite, two others
                    noble islands, and the remaining four small, though full of inhabitants. To the
                    largest they gave the appellation of Savai and Upola. They are said by La
                    Pérouse to be volcanic, but surrounded by coral reefs. Roggewein describes the
                    hills and valleys as affording a delightful prospect. The natives came off in
                    boats neatly made and carved, bringing fish, cocoa-nuts, and plantains. They arc
                    said to have white skins, but tanned by the sun, to be gentle in their manners
                    towards each other, lively and good-humoured; their bodies were neither painted
                    nor marked, and they were clothed from the waist downwards; the cultivated
                    grounds were all enclosed; and, in short, they are described by the writer of
                    Roggewein’s voyage as the most civilized and honest people they had met with
                    amongst the islands of the South Sea. We may conclude, indeed, from his account,
                    that they were equally well cultivated, and the inhabitants equally mild and
                    peaceable, with those of the Friendly Islands.</p>
                <p>Very different, however, is the account given of them by La Pérouse. Ferocious in
                    the highest degree, he describes them as utterly destitute of gratitude and
                    every good moral feeling; that a look of disdain is stamped on all their
                    countenances; and that they are eternally fighting with each other, so that
                    their bodies are covered with sears occasioned by the blows of clubs. Tall in
                    stature, their limbs are of colossal proportions; and their bodies are tattooed
                    to such a degree as to make them appear clothed, though they have only a girdle
                    of sea-weeds round their loins, which reaches to the knee. The size of the women
                    corresponds with that of the men, and their whole behaviour is represented as
                    highly indeeent and disgusting. They had no desire for iron, preferring their
                    own adzes and other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536535"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6535-0324"/>tools made of basalt. Their huts were made with
                    great nicety, and all their wood-work was highly polished and carved. Their
                    matting and cloth were exceedingly beautiful; the latter woven with thread made
                    from the nettle, and a species of flax. The sails of their boats or canoes were
                    made of this cloth. The islands are so intersected with creeks that they travel
                    from place to place almost universally in canoes, which have outriggers to
                    prevent them from upsetting.</p>
                <p>All the islands were clothed with trees up to the very summit of the hyls, many
                    of them laden with fruit. The villages are ranged along the margin of the
                    streams which fall from the mountains, and are built in the midst of groves of
                    cocoa, banana, guava, and other fruit-trees common to the South Sea Islands. The
                    woods abound with wild pigeons and turtle-doves, which are tamed by the natives,
                    and kept about their houses in flocks of many hundreds. Sugar-cane grows
                    abundantly and without culture. Their animals are pigs, dogs, and the domestic
                    fowl; these, and the fish, which they catch with great expertness, afford them
                    an abundant supply of food. These islands were visited for the first time by the
                    missionaries in 1830, who placed eight teachers on the large island of Savai.
                    They were kindly received by the chiefs; and they considered that their
                    prospects of civilizing these islands, and of reclaiming them from idolatry,
                    were very favourable. A fierce war was waging at the time the missionaries
                    landed, between the islands of Upola and Savai, which they interposed with their
                    counsels to appease; and the chiefs promised that they would terminate it, and
                    come and learn from the missionary teachers the word of God. These islands were
                    visited, in 1834, by five missionaries from Otaheite. They were kindly received
                    by the natives, who still continued to express the strongest desire for their
                    instructions, and several of whom had made an open profession of the Christian
                    faith.. Four additional missionaries arrived in these islands at the close of
                    the year 1835; and as their reception was friendly, they had commenced their
                    labours amidst a population of 50,000, with every prospect of success.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Society Islands.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The first
                    account of these islands is given in the voyage of Jacob Roggewein, who touched
                    at Ulietea in the year 1722; at least it is conjectured by Burney, on probable
                    grounds, that the Verquickking or Recreation Island of that navigator is the
                    same. On sending a boat on shore, the inhabitants assembled on the beach, and
                    advanced into the water armed with lances to oppose their landing. The
                    Hollanders fired upon them, and having dispersed them, landed on the beach, and
                    the inhabitants returned in a friendly manner, and brought them cocoa-nuts and
                    other articles of food. The Hollanders then advanced up a valley towards the
                    mountains; but some thousands of the natives coming out of the glens and
                    crevices, made signs to them to return. The Hollanders, however, paid no regard,
                    but proceeded, upon which showers of stones were hurled at them, by which some
                    were killed and others wounded. These volleys were answered by a discharge of
                    musketry, which killed many of the islanders, who, nevertheless, continued the
                    action, and finally drove the Dutchmen into their boats. Many of the latter
                    subsequently died of the wounds they had received, in consequence of the bad
                    state of their constitutions, being severely affected with the scurvy.</p>
                <p>Captain Cook visited these islands in 1769, and again in 1777. They consist of
                    six in number (besides small coral islets), the names of which are Ulietea and
                    Otaha (both encompassed by the same coral reef), Huaheine, Bolabola, Tubai, and
                    Maurua. They extend from about 16° ’ to 17° south latitude, and from 151° to
                    152° west longitude. The climate, the productions, and the inhabitants, resemble
                    so nearly those of Otahcite, that the same description will apply to both. The
                    surfaces of all the islands are uneven and hilly, but not mountainous; and the
                    hills are finely wooded. The inhabitants, like those of the Navigators’ Islands,
                    are generally of a larger stature than the Otahci-tans. The late Sir Joseph
                    Banks measured one of the natives of Huaheine, and found him to be six feet
                    three inches and a half in height; and the women are described as generally more
                    handsome and somewhat fairer than those of Otaheite. Bolabola differs from the
                    rest of the islands by having a lofty double-peaked mountain near its centre,
                    apparently volcanic. In Ulietea there is a large Morai, in which a number of
                    jaw-bones are kept as trophies of war. The coral reefs which everywhere surround
                    these islands form numerous safe and commodious harbours for shipping, and
                    refreshments of hogs, fowls, plantains, cocoa-nuts, and yams, are generally to
                    be had in great abundance.</p>
                <p>In these islands, the missionaries, though long disappointed, and though their
                    lives were frequently endangered by the contests and revolutions which agitated
                    the country, at last succeeded, by their perseverance and intrepidity, in
                    establishing stations in Huaheine, Ulietea or Raiatea, Taha or Otaha, and
                    Borabora or Bolabola. It was about the year 1817 that a missionary, Williams,
                    landed in Raiatca, where he has laboured ever since with perseverance and
                    fidelity. The inhabitants of Taha are strongly attached to their ancient
                    idolatrous worship. They opposed the introduction of Christianity, and even went
                    to war with the king of Raiatea because he had agreed to renounce idolatry. But
                    they were worsted in the contest, and the king was taken prisoner. Instead,
                    however, of being put to death, as formerly, with cruel tortures, he was
                    humanely treated, which made such a deep impression on his mind that he embraced
                    Christianity; and in 1824, in Raiatea, 178 children had been baptized, and 140
                    taught to read. In Hua-hcine, missionary stations were also established, and the
                    preachers laboured with success in the conversion of the natives. In 1830, at
                    the public examination of the schools, 370 children were present, all very
                    neatly dressed in European cloth; and many of the chiefs and parents were
                    present on the occasion. The same success attended the efforts of the
                    missionaries in Borabora. But the progress of this moral reformation experienced
                    some serious interruption. The indolent dispositions of the people, from habit
                    or from the heat of the climate, indisposed them to industry; and, from the
                    introduction of spirits, both in Raiatea, Borabora, Huaheine, and in the other
                    islands, they relapsed into all their gross excesses. One of the old chiefs, who
                    had favoured the introduction of the missionaries, having died, his successor,
                    who had resided at Huaheine, was much addicted to intemperance; and a person
                    from Botany Bay having brought ashore a cask of spirits, the slumbering appetite
                    was rekindled, and the people, encouraged by their chief, gave way to almost
                    universal dissipation; and though the introduction of spirits had been
                    prohibited before, they now began to erect stills for distillation in various
                    quarters. The missionaries did all they could to repress this flood of
                    dissipation; and they succeeded at last in putting a stop for a time to the use
                    of spirits. In Borabora and Maupiti, the chief, Mai, desirous of having more
                    than a single wife, left the missionary settlement, attended by a great part of
                    his people; and at their new settlement they abandoned the profession of the
                    Christian religion, and commenced the distillation of ardent spirits. The
                    missionaries, however, do not relax in their labours; though the encouragements
                    are not so great as could be desired, yet they hazard everything, even life
                    itself, in the hope of spreading their doctrines among distant nations. They so
                    far prevailed, that the people agreed to give up the use of spirits; and a law
                    was enacted, inflicting a heavy penalty on any one who should be found engaged
                    in distillation.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> Otaheite is the chief island of this vast group, which
                    extends <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536548" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6548-0325"/>over
                    fifteen degrees of longitude, in the direction of southeast. The extreme point
                    is Pitcairn’s Island, lately become interesting on account of the discovery of
                    the descendants of the mutineer Christian and some of his associates. The
                    natives of this vast chain of islands, and particularly of Otaheite, may
                    probably be considered as the most civilized, but, at the same time, the most
                    sensual people in all Polynesia. It was first discovered by Quiros in 1606, and
                    received from him the name of Sagittaria. The natives received the strangers
                    with great kindness, gave them cocoa-nuts and other fruits, and a general
                    interchange of civilities and presents soon took place. This good understanding
                    remained uninterrupted, and the Spaniards, for once, left the island without
                    having quarrelled with the inhabitants. In their zeal, however, they committed
                    an act which, if discovered, might have been attended with unpleasant
                    circumstances. The place at which they first landed was uninhabited, but in
                    passing through a wood they discovered a Morai, in which they concluded “the
                    enemy of mankind resided ;” and, under this impression, cut down a tree, which
                    they formed into a cross, and planted in the midst of the sacred building.</p>
                <p>In 1765, Commodore Byron discovered two low islands to the northward of Otaheite,
                    which, in honour of his majesty, he named George’s Islands, one of which,
                    afterwards visited by Cook, is called Tiookea. The natives of these islands were
                    very dark coloured, robust, and apparently ferocious; and their bodies were
                    marked with the figure of a fish.</p>
                <p>In 1767, Captain Wallis touched at Otaheite, and went through the ceremony of
                    taking possession of the island in the name of his sovereign; but the flag was
                    removed by the natives in the night. Various squabbles occurred between the
                    seamen and the natives, who, however, behaved on the whole with great kindness
                    and hospitality. Most of the quarrels were owing to the licentious intercourse
                    of the seamen with the native women. In 1768, Μ. de Bougainville visited
                    Otaheite, and was most hospitably received; in return for which several murders
                    were committed by the French seamen. Captain (then Lieutenant) Cook anchored in
                    Matavai Bay in April 1769. It is from this and his several subsequent visits,
                    together with a missionary voyage in the ship Duff, commanded by Captain Wilson,
                    1796- 1798, that Otaheite is so well known to us.</p>
                <p>The island consists of two peninsulas, connected by a low isthmus, about three
                    miles in width, covered with brushwood. The larger, Otaheite Nove, is about
                    ninety miles in circumference, and nearly circular; the smaller, Tiaraboo, is
                    about thirty miles; the whole nearly surrounded by a low belt of land, from a
                    furlong to a mile in width, which is prolonged by a gradual rise to the valleys,
                    which run up to the foot of the lofty central mountain. These valleys and their
                    intermediate ridges are beautiful, clothed with a great variety of trees to
                    their very summits; in the valleys are mostly met with clear streams of water,
                    which, in the rainy season, become mountain-torrents. The island, being
                    surrounded with coral reefs, is dangerous to approach, and the only safe harbour
                    is that of Matavai, on the northern side, in latitude 17. 30. south, longitude
                    149.13. west. This too is not free from danger from December to March. The
                    climate is delightful, the thermometer seldom rising above 80° in summer, and
                    ranging from 62° to 72° in winter.</p>
                <p>The island is so fertile as to produce everything in abundance, and without toil,
                    for the sustenance of man. The bread-fruit is here superior to that which grows
                    on the other islands. The fruit affords them a most nutritive food, either for
                    present use, or made into a paste called <hi rend="italic">mahie,</hi> which
                    will keep till the following season; the trunk supplies them with timber for
                    their buildings and canoes. It exudes a gum, which serves for pitch; and from
                    the inner bark is manufactured a substantial cloth. They reckon no less than
                    thirty varieties of this most useful tree, which, with the different exposures
                    to the trade-winds, and the difference of elevation above the sea, afford to the
                    natives a bread-fruit harvest at almost all seasons of the year. The cocoa-nut,
                    next to the bread-fruit, supplies them with meat, drink, cloth, and oil. Of
                    plantains, they reckon fifteen different sorts. Yams and sweet potatoes,
                    taro-root of different kinds, and various other edible roots and fruits, are
                    most abundantly produced; to which our missionaries have added the pine-apple,
                    the grape, and various culinary vegetables of Europe; but the natural and
                    spontaneous productions of the soil, and the consequent indolence of the people,
                    are unfavourable to their success.</p>
                <p>The animals found on the island are hogs, dogs, and rats. Several attempts have
                    been made to introduce the horse, and horned cattle, sheep, and goats, but
                    without success. The latter are so disliked for their smell and the mischief
                    they did to their plantations, that they drove them into the mountains, where
                    they run wild. The breed of cats has succeeded, and they are found to be
                    extremely useful; and rabbits have been introduced, but we know not with what
                    success. Common poultry are abundant, and the woods supply vast quantities of
                    wild pigeons and parrots. The tropical bird builds its nest in the steep cliffs,
                    and as its long feathers are highly valued, it is taken on the ncst by lowering
                    down a man seated across a stick, by a rope, to the depth of thirty or forty
                    fathoms; in which situation, by means of a long pole, he swings himself from
                    side to side, examining all the holes as he descends, in order to take the bird
                    on her nest. The shores abound with sea-fowl, and the sea with excellent fish,
                    which they take with great expertness by hook and line, or by the net. Dolphins
                    are caught at a distance from the shore, by baiting the hook with a real or
                    artificial fiying fish. Their fishing-tackle displays the <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> greatest ingenuity, and can only be exceeded by their skill in using
                    it. Their hooks are made of pearl-shells, bone, and hard wood. The coast abounds
                    with lobsters, crabs, and various kinds of shell-fish.</p>
                <p>The colour of the natives is that of olive, or light copper. The men are above
                    the middle size; the chiefs are almost uniformly tall, muscular, and well
                    limbed, measuring from five feet nine inches to six feet four inches, and
                    continue healthy and vigorous to a good old age. The women of the upper ranks
                    are likewise tall, with limbs finely turned. Their skins are soft and delicate;
                    their eyes black, sparkling, and full of expression; their teeth beautifully
                    white and even; their hair jet black, and generally ornamented with flowers; and
                    in their gait they are firm, but easy and graceful. From a custom of compressing
                    the face when infants, they can scarcely be called beauties; yet, according to
                    the account of Captain Wilson, they possess feminine graces in an eminent
                    degree; “their faces never being darkened with a scowl, or covered with a cloud
                    of sullenness or suspicion.” They are affable and engaging; mild, gentle, and
                    unaffected; courteous to each other and to strangers. The whole of the body to
                    the middle of the leg is clothed; but there is a singular custom which compels a
                    woman to uncover her shoulders and breasts in the presence of a chief, or in
                    passing a Moral or sacred place. The lower classes have always been described as
                    extremely licentious, but Captain Cook says they have been much calumniated. “It
                    is too true,” say the writers of the Missionary Voyage, “that, for the sake of
                    gaining our extraordinary curiosities, and to please our brutes, they have
                    appeared immodest in the extreme. Yet they lay the charge wholly at our door,
                    and say the Englishmen are ashamed at nothing, and that we have led them to
                    public acts of indecency never before practised amongst themselves.” It must be
                    admitted, however, that the most abandoned conduct is freely indulged by the
                    women of the Arreoy society, who, to the crime of unbounded licentiousness, add
                    that of mur∙</p>

                <p>dering their children the moment they are born. In recent accounts, however, it
                    is stated that this horrible practice has been abolished, and that Christianity
                    is making a rapid progress amongst these interesting islanders. As wives, the
                    Otaheitan women are tenderly affectionate to their husbands and children,
                    nursing and attending the latter with the utmost care. They never, on any
                    occasion, strike a child. A melancholy instance of the fidelity and affection of
                    one of these women is given in the Missionary Voyage. “The history of Peggy
                    Stewart marks a tenderness of heart that never will be heard without emotion.
                    She was daughter of a chief, and taken for his wife by Mr Stewart, one of the
                    unhappy mutineers of the Bounty. They had lived with the old chief in the most
                    tender state of endearment; a beautiful little girl had been the fruit of their
                    union, and was at the breast when the Pandora arrived, seized the criminals, and
                    secured them in irons on board the ship. Frantiewith grief, the unhappy Peggy
                    flew with her infant in a canoe to the arms of her husband. The interview was so
                    affecting and afflicting, that the officers on board were overwhelmed with
                    anguish; and Stewart himself, unable to bear the heart-rending scene, begged she
                    might not be admitted again on board. She was separated from him by violence,
                    and conveyed on shore in a state of despair and grief too big for utterance.
                    Withheld from him, and forbidden to come any more on board, she sunk into the
                    deepest dejection; it preyed on her health, she lost all relish for food and
                    life, rejoiced no more, and pining under a rapid decay of two months, fell a
                    victim to her feelings, dying literally of a broken heart.”</p>
                <p>The Otaheitans are generouseven to a fault; they seem to be utterly unable to
                    resist importunities, and always ready to share their last morsel with thch'
                    neighbours. Poverty is no reproach, but affluence with covetousness brings
                    contempt on the possessor. Should any one, indeed, refuse to share his property
                    in eases of distress, the chances are that it will be destroyed, and his house
                    pulled down over his head. The office of king is hereditary in one family; the
                    chiefs resemble our ancient barons; under them are the vassals, and below them
                    the <hi rend="italic">vUleins</hi> or labourers. The king and queen enjoy many
                    privileges, one of which is, to be carried about everywhere on men’s shoulders;
                    and the reason of this is, that whatever soil they tread upon becomes sacred,
                    and belongs to them; so also, if they enter a house, it is rendered sacred, and
                    becomes their property. Their domestics and attendants are also <hi
                    rend="italic">raa,</hi> or sacred, and for thieving, plunder, and all manner of
                    licentiousness, they are said to be the worst on the island.</p>
                <p>In the Missionary Voyage an account is given of the ceremony of investing the new
                    sovereign with the royal <hi rend="italic">maro,</hi> when each chief of the
                    island, amounting to nearly one hundred, brings one, two, or three human
                    victims, to offer up on the occasion. They are brought before the sovereign in a
                    lifeless state, having first been stoned to death, or knocked on the head with
                    clubs. From each of these victims the priest scoops out an eye, and presents it
                    to the king on a plantain leaf, and the bodies are then earned away and interred
                    in the Morai. The reason assigned for this oblation is, that the head being
                    accounted sacred, and the eye the most precious part, it is presented to the
                    king as the head and eye of the people. During the presentation, the king holds
                    his mouth open, as if devouring it, whereby it is imagined he receives
                    additional wisdom and discernment. The royal <hi rend="italic">niaro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and the sacred canoes which brought the human
                    sacrifices, are then deposited in the Morai; after which a series of feasts
                    begin, which continue for two months. These abominable rites, if not entirely
                    abolished, have in a great degree ceased by the influence of the
                    missionaries.</p>
                <p>In their language and their deities may be traced their Hindu origin; and though
                    their religion is a tissue of superstitious and brutal ceremonies, they never
                    draw near to their Eatova with carelessness and inattention. Captain Cook
                    testifies to the decorous conduct of an Otaheitan on such occasions: “He is all
                    devotion; he approaches the place of worship with reverential awe, uneovers when
                    he treads on sacred ground, and prays with a fervour that would do honour to a
                    better profession.”</p>
                <p>The early visits of the European navigators to these islands produced no
                    advantages whatever to the inhabitants, who were only contaminated by· the
                    vices, without participating in the blessings, of civilized life. But, in later
                    years, the visits of the missionaries to this and the other islands were solely
                    for the purpose of improving the inhabitants, and of spreading among them the
                    light of knowledge and of truth. A great improvement has in consequence taken
                    place in the manners as well as in the morals of these savages. It was in the
                    year 1796 that the London Missionary Society sent out their first missionaries
                    to Otaheite, and to the South Seas. Their object was to communicate the
                    knowledge of Christianity to the natives, who gladly received them, as well as
                    several others who were afterwards sent out in the year 1800. The missionaries
                    were, however, involved in serious trouble in 1799, from the thievish habits and
                    riotous dispositions of the natives; and several of them were compelled to take
                    refuge in New South Wales, whence they afterwards returned to Otaheite. Their
                    prospects were for a long time uncertain and precarious; and they laboured with
                    very little success to draw the attention of the natives from their cruel rites
                    and superstitions to the purer faith of the gospel. About the year 1814, they
                    began, however, to make some eon-verts. In the neighbouring island of Eimeo,
                    about fifty persons voluntarily renounced idolatry, and embraced Christianity.
                    These first converts were continually increased by new accessions, until the
                    great body of the inhabitants, as well as those in seven or eight of the
                    neighbouring islands, embraced Christianity, and renounced their former impure
                    and idolatrous rites. They now assemble regularly for public worship, as
                    decently attired as they can afford, in congregations of four or five hundred,
                    and occasionally seven or eight hundred persons. Their imitation of the European
                    dress is not, however, always the most successful. They are extremely fond of
                    gaudy colours; and the east-off clothes of soldiers are in particular request.
                    Sometimes a coat is worn without a shirt or any other article of European
                    apparel; and frequently not fitting, the effect is rather ludicrous. Along with
                    religion, they are also instructed in all the mechanical trades of Europe; they
                    are taught to read, write, and to east accounts, the natives with singular
                    industry teaching each other. Great numbers have been taught to read in the
                    Tahitian language, which the missionaries have reduced to writing; and the
                    Scriptures have also been translated into the native language of the island, in
                    which language also the missionaries began to preach in 1824. A great
                    reformation has followed the propagation of Christianity throughout the island.
                    The bloody, ferocious, and profligate practices of the Arreoy societies have
                    been abolished; the crime of infanticide has disappeared; and human sacrifiées
                    are also abandoned, with many other idolatrous and degrading superstitions and
                    practices. Many of the other improvements of civilized life have been adopted.
                    The dwellings of the chiefs have been enlarged and beautified; a distinct house
                    has been assigned to each family, in place of their being, as formerly, all
                    crowded into one house. Land has been cultivated, and the sugar-cane raised in
                    some districts; and the cotton cultivation has also been commenced. This island
                    is now frequently visited by European ships, and civilization is advancing.</p>
                <p>It was in the year 1815 that idolatry was formally abolished in this island,
                    under the influence of Pomare, the king, who, though his character was defective
                    in many points, being <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536574"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-6574-0327"/>addicted to intemperance and other vices, was
                    nevertheless steady in his friendship to the missionaries, and protected them in
                    their efforts to introduce civilization into the country. He was anxious also to
                    be instructed in reading and writing; and his example has contributed to diffuse
                    a desire for knowledge among others. Schools have been established by the wives
                    of the missionaries, where instruction is given in sewing, in reading, and
                    writing. In these accomplishments many of the females have made considerable
                    proficiency; and, siβce 1815, reading and writing has become general among the
                    natives. A great change has also been made in the costume; the English dress
                    has, as far as possible, been invariably adopted, by the women especially, who
                    appear with frills round their necks, with caps on their heads, and stockings
                    and shoes on their feet; and their other garments are also of European
                    materials. The men, however, showed great awkwardness in first adopting the
                    European costume; sometimes -wearing stockings on their arms, or thrusting their
                    arms through the legs of a pair of pantaloons, and wearing them on their
                    shoulders, or wearing a coat without a shirt, as observed by the Russian
                    navigators, or wearing a shirt on the outside of the dress. The progress of
                    improvement, however, is begun, and will advance; and in time society in these
                    islands will assume the aspect of civilized life. Pomare, the king of Otaheite,
                    and the first convert to Christianity, which he professed in 1812, was born
                    about the year 1774. He died in the year 1821, and was immediately succeeded by
                    his son Pomare IIL, who was crowned with no small pomp in 1824, being then only
                    four years of age. Shortly after his coronation he was placed at the South Sea
                    academy in the island of Eimeo, under the care of Mr and Mrs Orsmund, for the
                    purpose of receiving, with the children of the Missionaries, an English
                    education. He died in 1827, of a lingering disorder, then prevalent in the
                    islands, and was succeeded by a daughter of Pômare II., who still reigns. The
                    monarchy is despotic, nor does it afford any adequate security for life or
                    property. Even Pomare, notwithstanding all his apparent religious zeal,
                    occasionally plundered his subjects, and seized their property by main force. A
                    long era of moral improvement must elapse before any proper form of civil order,
                    or anything like free institutions, can be established in these islands.<note

                <p>The missionaries accordingly experienced, after the gloss of novelty had worn
                    off' their religion, a considerable defection of their proselytes; and for a
                    time their fair prospects of usefulness were overcast. At first the natives
                    appeared zealous in their attachment to the Christian creed, and schools and
                    congregations multiplied in all quarters. The same success attended the efforts
                    of the missionaries in the neighbouring islands of Eimeo and Huaheine. In a
                    short time, however, the people began to relapse into their former course of
                    licentiousness, and other evil practices; and the letters of the missionaries
                    themselves contain a full and candid account of these defections. Many of the
                    converts, they observe, grew weary of the restraints which Christianity imposed
                    on their passions; and the introduction of ardent spirits, the licentious
                    example and the debauchery of the European sailors when vessels touched at the
                    islands, the propagation of delusions among the people by visionaries, and
                    finally a bloody war which broke out in Otaheite, completed the corruption and
                    the defection of many converts. Another difficulty has arisen from the previous
                    irregular and indolent habits of the natives. “A state of society,” it is
                    observed, “more dissolute, and opposed to steady application and industry, than
                    that which prevailed among them prior to the renunciation of idolatry, cannot
                    well be imagined ∙, and although the general and continued operation of those
                    propensities which heathenism had nurtured and matured was restrained almost
                    universally when the islanders first professed Christianity, numbers being
                    influenced by the excitement of feeling in favour of the new religion, which
                    then appeared to pervade all classes, many afterwards relapsed into their former
                    evil practices, and have remained destitute of everything connected with
                    Christianity excepting the name. These found, as might have been expected, their
                    former inclinations too strong to be restrained by the feeble resistance which
                    public opinion interposed; and though they did not revive the worship of the
                    idols or cruelties of human sacrifices, they returned, in a great degree, to
                    their former indolence and vices.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See the Evangelical Magazine, and also the Missionary
                    Chronicle for September 1832, p. 407. In the Evangelical Magazine for November
                    1833, the difficulties of the missionaries are very fairly stated. “The
                    difficulties,” it is observed, “attending the progress of the work in which our
                    brethren are engaged have been frequently stated to the friends of the society.
                    These have arisen from the natural indolence and fickleness of the natives, the
                    effects of their former notorious licentiousness, which so many attempts have
                    been made to revive; and the appearance of gross and visionary heresies, whereby
                    a number of individuals, disaffected towards the requirements of the gospel,
                    have sought, by pretended supernatural revelation, to counteract or destroy the
                    effects which the word of God was producing among the people, in elevating the
                    tone of moral feeling, and improving their social character and habits. In
                    recent years, difficulties more formidable than any produced by these causes
                    have arisen from other quarters; the increasing number of ships resorting to the
                    islands for refreshments and traffic, and, with the increase of commerce,
                    consequent profligacy, from the increased intercourse of seamen with the most
                    depraved portions of native society; and the large importations of ardent
                    spirits in English and American vessels, chiefly the latter, consisting of what
                    is denominated New England rum, many vessels conveying this, and, with the
                    exception of fire-arms and ammunition, no other article of barter with which to
                    traffic among the natives. The activity and perseverance manifested in promoting
                    the sale and use of these pernicious drugs, by hawking them about the islands,
                    inducing the chiefs to engage in trade, and the establishment, by foreigners who
                    have left ships touching at the islands, of a number of grog-shops on the shore,
                    have occasioned the missionaries much perplexity and distress. By the retail of
                    ardent spirits, these houses become the greatest pests in the country, the
                    resort of the most abandoned in the islands, and the most indolent and depraved
                    among the crews of the shipping, proving alike seductive and injurious to all
                    within their influence, and exhibiting, in the conduct of foreigners, scenes of
                    outrage and bloodshed unknown amongst the natives since their renunciation of
                    paganism.”</p></note> The missionaries have spared no pains to counteract this
                    tendency to vice. They have established throughout the island temperance
                    societies, and have prevailed on the chiefs to restrain the importation of
                    spirits. The Queen Pomare, and most of the chiefs, who show an ardent desire for
                    the instruction of the people, have joined these societies, and have
                    countenanced the efforts of the missionaries, who have in some degree succeeded
                    in stemming the torrent of profligacy which was inundating these countries, and
                    was fast sweeping away all traces of that purer morality which had been planted
                    among the natives. “The demon of intemperance,” says one of the missionaries,
                    “which brought moral sterility and desolation, nipping and stunting the young
                    plants of promise, has again disappeared; our fears have been dispelled.”<note

                    taken place, a letter, dated April 1836, mentions that there are two thousand

                    great number have learned to write; and that the schools and chapels are well
                    attended. In the different islands there are thirty-nine stations, thirty-seven
                    schools, seven thousand scholars, and thirty-nine congregations consisting of
                    twenty-two thousand attendants. A letter from one of the missionaries<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193536587" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6587-0328"/> mentions that he
                    had seen Queen Pomare in the midst of a group of little girls, teaching them
                    words of one and two syllables.</p>
                <p>One most important benefit which has been conferred upon these islands, and a
                    great step in the progress of improvement, has been the commencement of trade
                    and manufactures. A number of natives have been taught to spin, and to weave the
                    cotton into cloth, to make soap and salt, to prepare tobacco, to manufacture
                    sugar; also a knowledge of rope-making, turnery, carpentry, and the art of
                    working in iron. Some are employed as smiths, others in the preparation of lime,
                    and in the construction of neat and comfortable dwcllings, and also in boat and
                    ship-building, in which many of them are adepts.</p>
                <p>They have also begun to carry on commerce. A number of small vessels, built by
                    the natives, of from twenty to thirty-five tons burden, are employed in fetching
                    from a group of islands, situated two or three hundred miles eastward, cargoes
                    of pearl-shell, which they dispose of to the English and American traders. The
                    last returns of the trade to Otaheite mention 154 arrivals in 1836 at the port
                    of Honolu, the capital, of which eighty are brigs and schooners belonging to the
                    country, fifty-six to the United States, and seventeen to Great Britain.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Marquesas</hi> —This cluster of islands was discovered
                    by Alvarodc Mendana in 1595, and named by him Las Marquesas de Mendoca, in
                    honour of the viceroy of Peru. Four only are described by Quiros the pilot,
                    under the names of La Dominica, Santa Christina, San Pedro, and La Madalena. The
                    Spaniards anchored in a port of Santa Christina, to which they gave the name of
                    Madre de Dios, well protected from the trade-wind, and which has two excellent
                    streams of fresh water flowing into it. The people are described as being an
                    elegant race; the women in particular as remarkably beautiful, their complexions
                    and general appearance being said to excel those of the women of Lima. Their
                    dress consisted of a cloth made of the leaves of a palm-tree, with which they
                    were covered from the breast downwards; and so civilly disposed were they, that
                    a beautiful native woman seated herself by the side of Donna Isabel, the wife of
                    Mendana, arid began to fan her. But the Spaniards, as usual, found means to
                    quarrel with the natives, and to drive them with their fire-arms into the
                    woods.</p>
                <p>The produce of the islands was hogs, fowls, fish, cocoa-nuts, sugar-canes,
                    plantains, and the bread-fruit, which is described for the first time by the
                    writer of this voyage.</p>
                <p>Subsequent discoveries have made us nearly as well acquainted with the Marquesas
                    as with Otaheite. Captain Cook visited them in 1774, and Captain Wilson in 1797.
                    From these we know that they consist of eight in number, besides some smaller
                    islands to the westward, which being seen by an American master of the name of
                    Ingraham, he called them Washington’s Islands. They had previously been seen,
                    however, by Marchand in 1789, and may fairly be grouped as part of the
                    Marquesas. The centre of the group may be reckoned in about the latitude of 9.
                    30. south, and longitude 139. 30. west.</p>
                <p>The manners, the religious ceremonies, the Morais, and the general appearance of
                    the natives, are so similar to those of Otaheite, that a description of them
                    would amount to little more than a repetition of what has already been said.
                    They have all the good qualities of the natives of that island, and most of
                    their bad ones; but, owing probably to a more restricted communication with
                    strangers, a greater degree of simplicity was observable in their manners, on
                    the first arrival of the missionaries amongst them, than in the people of
                    Otaheite. Scarcely had they anchored in Resolution Bay (Madre de Dios), when two
                    women, though it was dark, swam off to the ship, in the hope of meeting a
                    favourable reception, calling out in a piteous tone, when they found they could
                    not be admitted on board, <hi rend="italic">Waheené, waheene!</hi> “We are
                    women, we are women.” The next morning the visit was repeated, and is thus
                    described in the Missionary Voyage:</p>
                <p>“Our first visitors from the shore came early; they were seven beautiful young
                    women, swimming quite naked, except a few green leaves tied round their middle;
                    they kept playing round the ship for three hours, calling <hi rend="italic"
                    >Waheene,</hi> until several of the native men had got on board; one of them,
                    being the chief of the island, requested that his sister might be taken on
                    board, which was complied with. She was of a fair complexion, inclining to a
                    healthy yellow, with a tint of red in her cheek; was rather stout, but
                    possessing such symmetry of features, as did all her companions, that as models
                    for the statuary and painter their equals can seldom be found.” Captain Wilson
                    says, that an Otaheitan woman which they had on board was far eclipsed by the
                    Marquesan woman; but she was shocked to see a woman quite naked walking the
                    deck, and threw over her a dress of Otaheitan cloth; but as for the rest of
                    these females, the goats, it seems, soon stripped them of their green leaves,
                    and left them in a state of complete nudity. On shore the women clothe
                    themselves in decent habits.</p>
                <p>The Marquesans are so far superior to the Otaheitans, that they sacrifice hogs
                    only to their deities, and never men. Their houses, canoes, their dress, and the
                    cultivation of their land, are at least equal to those of Otaheite, and they
                    have none of those infamous Arreoy societies. Captain Porter of the American
                    frigate Essex, after brutally massacring a number of these people upon the most
                    frivolous pretext, charges them with cannibalism, though, from his own account,
                    there does not appear to be the slightest ground for so injurious an imputation.
                    To all unprejudiced navigators they have appeared as an amiable people,
                    entertaining a great respect for old age, fond of their children instead of
                    murdering them, as in Otaheite and Some other islands, and living in peace and
                    harmony with each other, and with their families.</p>
                <p>These islands were visited by the missionaries, several of whom have settled
                    amongst the natives. But it does not appear that their labours, though zealously
                    pursued, havè hitherto been attended with the desired success. The state of the
                    people, it is said in the Missionary Magazine for April 1837, “is not that of
                    open opposition or enmity against the gospel, but of apathy and unconcern,
                    strengthened by deeply-rooted habits of worldliness and vice ;” and the journals
                    of the missionaries entirely agree with this account. It is with difficulty that
                    they procure, at their several stations, a congregation of above eight persons
                    on Sundays; sometimes they amount to twenty, but generally they pay little
                    attention to the instructions of their teacher, and scarcely preserve decorum
                    during the worship, conversing with each other about their ordinary concerns,
                    and pursuing all their worldly occupations after the worship is finished. The
                    missionaries are, however, resolved to persevere in their plans, in the hope
                    that they may, as in the other islands, succeed in time in making an impression
                    on the barbarous natives.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    had been taught by a native of the Sandwich Islands, proved an additional
                    obstacle to the success of the missionaries, as their eagerness to plunge into
                    this vice shut their ears to all spiritual instruction.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Easter Island.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This small
                    island, not thirty miles in .length, is only deserving of notice from its
                    solitary position, its great distance from any of the islands of the Pacific,
                    its comparative proximity to the coast of South America, and its being inhabited
                    by a race of men who differ no more from the rest of the Polynesians than they
                    do from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536600" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6600-0329"/>one
                    another; having the same language, the same features, the same religious
                    notions, and Morais constructed as they generally are in other islands. On the
                    platforms of the latter are erected shapeless and uncouth masses of stone,
                    carved in imitation of the human bust, with rude faces four or five feet in
                    length, set on trunks of ten or twelve feet in height. Kotzebue, the last
                    visiter to this island, looked, however, in vain for any traces of these statues
                    on the spots where they are described by Cook and La Pérouse.</p>
                <p>This island is supposed to have been discovered by the bucaneer Davis, in 1687,
                    although some have contended for the Dutch Admiral Roggewein being the
                    discoverer,.and he it was who gave it the name of Paaschen or Easter Island,
                    having first seen it on the day of that feast. Its latitude is 27. 5. south, and
                    longitude 109. 46. west.</p>
                <p>It is not remarkably fertile; but few trees are found on it, and no running
                    stream. The natives are very industrious in raising food for their support,
                    which consists chiefly of bananas, taro-roots, sugar-canes, sweet potatoes, and
                    yams. By some navigators they are described as a very savage people, and by
                    others as a mild and amiable race. The fact is, that their conduct has always
                    corresponded with the treatment thôy received from strange visiters. Thus their
                    decided hostility to Kotzebue, when he attempted to land on the island, was
                    explained on his arrival at the Sandwich Islands. An American, commanding a
                    schooner called the Nancy, from New London, had observed a vast multitude of
                    seals on the shores of the small uninhabited island of Massafuero, to the
                    westward of Juan Fernandez; and thinking it might turn out an excellent
                    speculation, if a small establishment were formed on the island, to carry on the
                    fishing, he set about the means of carrying this project into effect. His own
                    crew was but just sufficient to navigate the vessel, and, there being no
                    anchorage off the island, no part of it could be spared to catch seals. The
                    brutal wretch therefore proceeded to Easter Island, and landing at Cook’s Bay,
                    seized and carried off twelve men and ten women to people his new colony. For
                    the first three days they were confined in irons, and were not released till
                    fairly out of sight of land, when the first use they made of their liberty was
                    to jump overboard, choosing rather to perish in the waves than to be carried
                    away they knew not whither, or for what purpose. The women, who were with
                    difficulty restrained from following them, were carried to Massafuero, but what
                    ultimately became of these poor creatures Μ. Kotzebue does not relate. No
                    wonder, then, that such base and inhuman practices should have driven the
                    natives to acts of hostility against all foreign intruders.</p>
                <p>Since this general view of the Polynesian Islands was prepared, every voyager
                    across the Pacific has made the discovery of additional groups of coral islands
                    or reefs, or single islets just emerging above the surface of the ocean. The
                    progressive increase of these wonderful fabrics would seem to require <hi
                    rend="italic">time</hi> only to choak up the whole Pacific. The reflections made
                    by Kotzebue, on viewing these new creations, are as just as they are natural.
                    “The spot on which I stood filled me with astonishment, and I adored in silent
                    admiration the omnipotence of God, who had given, even to those minute animals,
                    the power to construct such a work. My thoughts were confounded, when I
                    considered the immense series of years that must elapse before such an island
                    can rise from the fathomless abyss of the ocean, and become visible on the
                    surface. At a future period they will assume another shape; all the islands will
                    join and form a circular slip of earth, with a pond or lake in the circle; and
                    this form will again change, as these animals continue building, till they reach
                    the surface, and then the water will one day vanish, and only one great island
                    be visible. It is a strange feeling to walk about on a living island, when all
                    below is actively at work. And to what corner of the earth can we penetrate
                    where human beings are not already to be found? In the remotest regions of the
                    earth, amidst mountains of ice, under the burning suri of the equator, nay, even
                    in the middle of the ocean, on islands which have been formed by animals, they
                    are met with.”</p>
                <p>But not to islands alone are the operations of these zoophytes confined. Flinders
                    found the coral reefs extending for seven hundred miles along the eastern coast
                    of Australia, and Torres Strait is nearly choked up with them, and must in time
                    become unnavigable. As Captain Fitzroy crossed the Pacific in the Beagle, it is
                    to be hoped that his attention has been drawn to this curious and interesting
                    subject; and that in his forthcoming work, or that of Mr Darwen, who accompanied
                    him, the public will receive additional information respecting these little
                    animals and their operations. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
