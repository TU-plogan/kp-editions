                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PRAYER</label>, a solemn address to God, which, when it is of
                    any considerable length, consists of <hi rend="italic">adoration, confession,
                    supplication, intercession,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thanksgiving.</hi></p>
                <p>By <hi rend="italic">adoration</hi> we express our sense of God’s infinite
                    perfections, his power, wisdom, goodness, and mercy; and acknowledge that our
                    constant dependence is upon Him by whom the universe was created and has been
                    hitherto preserved. By <hi rend="italic">confession</hi> is meant our
                    acknowledgment of our manifold transgressions of the divine laws, and our
                    consequent unworthiness of all the good things which we enjoy at present, or
                    expect to be conferred upon us hereafter. In <hi rend="italic">supplication</hi>
                    we entreat our omnipotent Creator and merciful Judge, not to deal with us after
                    our iniquities, but to pardon our transgressions, and by his grace to enable us
                    to live henceforth righteously, soberly, and godly, in this present world; and
                    by Christians this intreaty is always made in the name and through the mediation
                    of' Jesus Christ, because to them it is known that there is none other name
                    under heaven given unto men whereby they may be saved. To these supplications
                    for mercy, we may likewise add our prayers for the necessaries of life, because
                    if we seek <hi rend="italic">first</hi> the kingdom of God, and his
                    righteousness, we are assured that such things shall be added unto us. <hi
                    rend="italic">Intercession,</hi> signifies those petitions which we offer up for
                    others, for friends, for enemies, for all men, especially for our lawful
                    governors, whether supreme or subordinate. And <hi rend="italic"
                    >thanksgiving</hi> is the expression of our gratitude to God, the giver of every
                    good and perfect gift, for all the benefits enjoyed by us and others, for the
                    means of grace, and for the hope of glory. Such are the component parts of a
                    regular and solemn prayer, adapted either for the church or for the closet. But
                    an ejaculation to God, conceived on any emergency, is likewise a prayer, whether
                    it be uttered by the voice, or suffered to remain a mere affection of the mind;
                    because the being to whom it is addressed discerneth the thoughts of the
                    heart.</p>
                <p>That prayer is a duty which all men ought to perform with humility and reverence,
                    has been generally acknowledged as well by the untaught barbarian as by the
                    enlightened Christian; and yet to this duty objections have been made by which
                    the understanding has been bewildered in sophistry and affronted with jargon.
                    “If God be independent, omnipotent, and possessed of every other perfection,
                    what pleasure, it has been asked, can he take in our ac knowledgment of these
                    perfections? If he knows all things past, present, and future, where is the
                    propriety of our confessing our sins unto him? If he is a benevolent and
                    merciful Being, be will pardon our sins, and grant us what is needful for us
                    without our supplications and entreaties; and if he be likewise possessed of
                    infinite wisdom, it is certain that no importunities of ours will prevail upon
                    him to grant us what is improper, or for our sakes to change the equal and
                    steady laws by which the world is governed.</p>
                <p>Shall Durning Aetna, if a sage requires Forget to thunder, and recal her fires?
                    On air or sea new motions be imprest, O blameless Bethel, to relieve thy breast?
                    When the loose mountain trembles from on high, Shall gravitation cease, if you
                    go by?</p>
                <p>Or some old temple, nodding to its fall, For Chartres’ head reserve the hanging
                    wall?</p>
                <p>Such are the most plausible objections which are usually made to the practice of
                    prayer; and though they have been set off with all the art of the metaphysical
                    wrangler, and embellished with all the graces of the poetry of Pope, they appear
                    to us such gross sophisms as can operate only on a very unthinking head, or on a
                    very corrupt heart. For if God certainly exists, and there is not a mathematical
                    theorem capable of more rigid demonstration, it is obvious that no man can think
                    of such a Being without having his mind strongly impressed with the conviction
                    of his own constant dependence upon him; nor can he “contemplate the heavens,
                    the work of God’s hands, the moon and the stars which he has ordained,” without
                    forming the most sublime conceptions that he can of the Divine power, wisdom,
                    and goodness. But such conviction, and such conceptions, whether clothed in
                    words or not, are to all intents and purposes what is meant by adoratiòn; and
                    are as well known to the Deity <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538940"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8940-0505"/>whilst they remain the silent affections of the
                    heart, as after they are spoken in the beginning of a prayer. Our adoration,
                    therefore, is not expressed for the purpose of giving information to God, who
                    understands our thoughts afar off; but merely, when the prayer is private,
                    because we cannot think any more than speak without words, and because the very
                    <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of words that are well chosen affects the heart,
                    and helps to fix our attention. And as the Being who sees at once the past,
                    present, and to come, and to whom a thousand years are but as one day, stands
                    not in need of our information; so neither was it ever supposed by a man of
                    rational piety, that he takes pleasure on his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> account
                    in hearing his perfections enumerated by creatures of yesterday; for being
                    independent, he has no passions to be gratified, and being self-sufficient, he
                    was as happy when existing alone as at that moment “when the morning stars sang
                    together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.” Adoration is therefore
                    proper only as it tends to preserve in our minds just notions of the Creator and
                    Governor of the world, and of our own constant dependence upon him; and if such
                    notions be useful to ourselves, who have a part to act in the scale of
                    existence, upon which our happiness depends, a proposition which no theist will
                    controvert, adoration must be acceptable to that benevolent God, who, when
                    creating the world, could have no other end in view than to propagate
                    happiness.</p>
                <p>By the same mode of reasoning, it will be easy to show the duty of <hi
                    rend="italic">confession</hi> and <hi rend="italic">supplication.</hi> We are
                    not required to confess our sins unto God, because he is ignorant of them; for
                    he is ignorant of nothing. If he were, no reason could be assigned for our
                    divulging to our judge actions deserving of punishment. Neither are we required
                    to cry for mercy, in order to move him in whom there is no variableness, neither
                    shadow of turning. The Being that made the world, governs it by laws that are
                    inflexible, because they are the best; and to suppose that he can be induced by
                    prayers, oblations, or sacrifices, to vary this plan of government, is an
                    impious thought, which degrades the Deity to a level with man. One of these
                    inflexible laws is the connection established between certain dispositions of
                    mind and human happiness. We are enjoined to pursue a particular course of
                    conduct under the denomination of virtue, not because our virtuous actions can
                    in any degree be of advantage to him by whom we are created, but because they
                    necessarily generate in our own minds those dispositions which are essential to
                    our ultimate happiness. A man of a malignant, arrogant, or sensual disposition,
                    would have no enjoyment in that heaven, where all are actuated by a spirit of
                    love and purity; and it is doubtless for this reason amongst others, that the
                    Christian religion prohibits malice, arrogance, and sensuality, among her
                    votaries, and requires the cultivation of the opposite virtues. But a person who
                    has deviated far from his duty cannot think of returning, unless he be
                    previously convinced that he has gone astray. Such conviction, whenever he
                    obtains it, will necessarily impress upon his mind a sense of his own danger,
                    and fill his heart with sorrow and remorse for having transgressed the laws
                    established by the most benevolent of all Beings for the propagation of
                    universal felicity This conviction of error, this sense of danger, and this
                    compunction for having transgressed, are all perceived by the Deity as soon as
                    they take place in the mind of the sinner; and he is required to <hi
                    rend="italic">confess</hi> his sins, only because the act of confession tends to
                    imprint more deeply on his mind his own unworthiness, and the necessity of
                    returning immediately into the paths of that virtue of which all the ways are
                    pleasantness, and all the paths are peace.</p>
                <p>In the objection, it is taken for granted, that if God be a benevolent and
                    merciful Being, he will pardon our sins, and grant us what is needful for us,
                    whether we supplicate him or not; but this is a gross and palpable mistake,
                    arising from the objector’s ignorance of the, end of virtue and the nature of
                    man. Until a man be sensible of his sins and his danger, he is, for the reason
                    already assigned, incapable of pardon, because his disposition is incompatible
                    with the happiness of the blessed. But whenever he acquires this conviction, it
                    is impossible for him not to form a mental wish that he may be pardoned; and
                    this wish being perceptible to the all-seeing eye of his Judge, forms the sum
                    and substance of a supplication for mercy. If he clothe it in words, it is only
                    for a reason similar to that which makes him adore his Creator and confess his
                    sins in words, that just notions may be more deeply imprinted on his own mind.
                    The same reasoning holds good with respect to those prayers which we put up for
                    temporal blessings, for protection and support in our journey through life. We
                    are told by high authority, that “the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon
                    him, to all that call upon him in truth.” This, however, is not because he is
                    attracted or delighted by their prayers and entreaties, but because those
                    prayers and entreaties fit such as öfter them for receiving those benefits which
                    he is at all times ready to pour upon all mankind. In his essence God is equally
                    present with the righteous and with the wicked, with those who pray, and with
                    those who pray not; for “the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the
                    evil and the good.” But as the atmosphere equally surrounds every person upon
                    this globe, and yet in its state of greatest purity does not affect the
                    asthmatic as it affects those who are whole; so the Divine presence, though
                    essentially the same everywhere, yet does not protect the impious as it protects
                    the devout, because the impious are not in a state capable of the Divine
                    protection. The end for which God requires the exercise of prayer as a duty, is
                    not his benefit, but ours; because it is a mean to generate in the petitioner
                    such a disposition of mind as must render him a special object of that love and
                    that providential care which extend over the whole creation.</p>
                <p>That part of the objection which results from the consideration of the fixed laws
                    of nature, and which the poet has so finely illustrated, presents, it must be
                    confessed, consider·, able difficulties; but none which to us appear
                    insurmountable. If, indeed, we suppose that in the original constitution of
                    things, when the laws of nature were established, a determinate duration was
                    given to the top of the mountain and the nodding temple, without any regard to
                    foreseen consequences, it would undoubtedly be absurd and perhaps impious to
                    expect the law of gravitation to be suspended by the prayers of a good man, who
                    should happen to be passing at the instant decreed for the fall of these
                    objects. But of such a constitution there is so far from being evidence, that it
                    appears not to be consistent with the wisdom and goodness of the Author of
                    nature. This world was undoubtedly formed for the habitation of man and of other
                    animals. If so, we must necessarily suppose, that in the establishing of the
                    laws of nature, God adjusted them in such a manner as he saw would best serve
                    the accommodation of those sentient beings for whose accommodation alone they
                    were to be established. Let it then be admitted, that all the human beings who
                    were ever to exist upon this globe, with all their thoughts, words, and actions,
                    were at that important moment present to the divine intellect, and it will
                    surely not be impossible to conceive that in consequence of the foreseen danger
                    and prayers of a good man, the determinate duration of the mountain and the
                    tower might be either lengthened or shortened to let him escape. This idea of
                    providence, and of the efficacy of prayer, is thus illustrated by Mr. Wollaston.
                    “Suppose Μ (some man) certainly to <hi rend="italic">foreknow,</hi> by some
                    means or other, that, when he should come to be upon his death-bed. L w ould <hi
                    rend="italic">petition</hi> for <hi rend="italic">particular legacy,</hi> in a
                    manner so earnest and humble, and with such a good disposition, as would render
                    it proper to grant his request; and upon this, Μ makes his <hi rend="italic"
                    >last will,</hi> by which he devises to L that which was to be asked, and then
                    locks up the <hi rend="italic">will</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and all this
                    many years <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538953" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8953-0506"
                    />before the death of Μ, and whilst L had yet no expectation or thought of any
                    such thing. When the time comes, the <hi rend="italic">petition</hi> is made and
                    <hi rend="italic">granted</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> not by making any <hi
                    rend="italic">new</hi> will, but by the old one already made, and without
                    alteration; which legacy had, notwithstanding that, never been left, had the
                    petition never been preferred. The grant may be called the effect of a future
                    act, and depends as much upon it as if it had been made after the act. So, if it
                    had been foreseen, that L would not <hi rend="italic">so much as ask,</hi> and
                    he had been therefore left out of the will, this <hi rend="italic"
                    >praeterition</hi> would have been caused by his carriage, though much later
                    than the date of the will. In all this nothing is hard to be admitted, if Μ be
                    allowed to foreknow the case. And thus the <hi rend="italic">prayers</hi> which
                    good men offer to the <hi rend="italic">all-knowing</hi> God, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">neglect of prayers</hi> by others, may find fitting effects <hi
                    rend="italic">already</hi> forecasted in the course of nature.”</p>
                <p>This solution of the difficulty presents indeed to the mind a prodigious scheme,
                    in which all things to come are, as it were, comprehended under one view, and
                    estimated and compared together. But when it is considered what a mass of
                    wonders the universe is in other respects; what an incomprehensibly great and
                    perfect being God is; that he cannot be ignorant of any thing, no not of the
                    future wants and deportments of particular men; and that all things which derive
                    their existence from him must be consistent with one another, it must surely be
                    confessed that such an adjustment of physical causes to moral volitions is
                    within the compass of infinite power and perfect wisdom.</p>
                <p>To that part of a prayer which we have termed intercession, it has been objected,
                    that “to intercede for others is to presume that we possess an interest with the
                    Deity upon which their happiness and even the prosperity of whole communities
                    depends.” In answer to this objection, it has been observed by an ingenious and
                    useful writer (Mr. Paley), that “how unequal soever our knowledge of the Divine
                    economy may be to a complete solution of this difficulty, which may require a
                    comprehension of the entire plan, and of all the ends of God’s moral government,
                    to explain it satisfactorily, we can yet understand one thing concerning it,
                    that it is, after all, nothing more than the making of one man the instrument of
                    happiness and misery to another; which is perfectly of a piece with the course
                    and order that obtain, and which we must believe were intended to obtain, in
                    human affairs. Why may we not be assisted by the <hi rend="italic">prayers</hi>
                    of other men, as well as we are beholden for our <hi rend="italic">support to
                    their labour</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> WTry may not our happiness be made in
                    some cases to depend upon the intercession as it certainly does in many upon the
                    good offices of our neighbours? The happiness and misery of great numbers we see
                    oftentimes at the disposal of one man’s choice, or liable to be much affected by
                    his conduct; what greater difficulty is there in supposing, that the prayers of
                    an individual may avert a calamity from multitudes, or be accepted to the
                    benefit of whole communities.”</p>
                <p>These observations may perhaps be sufficient to remove the force of the
                    objection, but much more may be said for the practice of mutual intercession. If
                    it be one man’s duty to intercede for another, it is the duty of that other to
                    intercede for him; and if we set aside the particular relations which arise from
                    blood, and from particular stations in society, mutual intercession must be
                    equally the duty of all mankind. But there is nothing (we speak from our own
                    experience, and appeal to the experience of our readers), which has so powerful
                    a tendency to generate in the heart of any person good-will towards another, as
                    the constant practice of praying to God for his happiness. Let a man regularly
                    pray for his enemy with all that seriousness which devotion requires, and he
                    will not long harbour resentment against him. Let him pray for his friend with
                    that ardour which friendship naturally inspires, and he will perceive his
                    attachment to grow daily and daily stronger. If, then, universal benevolence, or
                    charity, be a disposition which we ought to cultivate in ourselves, mutual
                    intercession is undeniably a duty, because nothing contributes so effectually to
                    the acquisition of that spirit which an apostle terms the end of the
                    commandment.</p>
                <p>When it is said, that by interceding for kings, and all in authority, Ave seem to
                    consider the prosperity of communities as depending upon our interest with God,
                    the objector mistakes the nature and end of these intercessions. In the
                    prosperity of any community consists great part of the happiness of its
                    individual members; but that prosperity depends much upon the conduct of its
                    governors. When, therefore, individuals intercede for their governors, the
                    ultimate object of their prayers must be conceived to be their own good.</p>
                <p>Having evinced the duty of adoration, confession, supplication, and intercession,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">ave</hi> need not surely waste our readers’ time with a
                    formal and laboured vindication of thanksgiving. Gratitude for benefits received
                    is so universally acknoAvledged to be a virtue, and ingratitude is so detestable
                    a vice, that no man who lays claim to a moral character will dare to affirm that
                    Ave ought not to have a just sense of the goodness of God. <hi rend="smallcaps"
