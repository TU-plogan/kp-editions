                <p><label type="entry">PLAUTUS</label>, Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Attius,</hi> the
                    father of Roman comedy, was born of humble parents, in the Umbrian village of
                    Sar-sina. He flourished during the second Punic war; and his death happened <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 184, when Terence had reached his ninth year. Of his
                    private circumstances we are entirely ignorant; but fortune, which had blessed
                    him with extraordinary talents, does not appear to have been very bountiful in
                    worldly goods. To gain a livelihood, he was compelled to have recourse to the
                    most laborious employments; yet still he contrived to write comedies, by the
                    sale of which he added something to his enjoyments. The number of comedies
                    composed by Plautus, or at least known under his name, was, according to Aulus
                    Gellius, about one hundred and thirty, of which L. Aelius considered only
                    twenty-five as genuine productions. Gellius imagines that the others, if they
                    were not composed by Plautus, belong at least to the poets of that period, and
                    had been read and amended by him; so that in this manner they had acquired his
                    style and character. Varro considered as genuine only twenty-one, which were
                    hence called <hi rend="italic">Varronianae</hi><hi rend="italic">∙</hi> and
                    perhaps a few others, from their similarity of style. Changes in the text and in
                    the arrangement, which were brought about at the will of the aediles, to whom he
                    sold the plays, and even of the actors who were employed in performing them,
                    became still more frequent after the death of the poet. The substitution, too,
                    of the plays of another unknown poet, Plautius, for those of Plautus, has
                    increased <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532882" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2882-0043"/>the
                    difficulty of distinguishing the genuine productions of the poet from those
                    erroneously ascribed to him. Thus we find grammarians and critics, such as
                    Aelins, Volcatius, Se-digitius, Claudius, and Aurelius, writing treatises
                    respecting the genuine pieces of Plautus. The number of comedies which have been
                    preserved, though by no means quite perfect, amounts, according to Varro, to
                    twenty. The <hi rend="italic">Quero-</hi><hi rend="italic">lus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Aulularia,</hi> written in prose, though found in the manuscripts
                    of Plautus, and even cited by Servius as belonging to him, is considered by some
                    as of a later date, probably of the time of the younger Theodosius. Vossius and
                    Tirlemont considered Claudius Rutilius Nnmatianus as the author, whilst Vincent
                    was rather inclined to suppose it the production of Phaedrus, the cclcbrated
                    writer of fables. All the manuscripts of Plautus which have yet been discovered,
                    with the exception of the Palimpsest of the Ambrosian Library, seem to be of a
                    recent date, and must have flowed from a common source, as the same passages arc
                    corrupt in all.</p>
                <p>It is usually supposed that we are indebted to the grammarian Priscian for the
                    order in which we find these twenty plays arranged; and he, too, is the author
                    of the short arguments prefixed to each comedy in some of the old manuscripts.
                    The purity of the language proves their remote antiquity, even though we be
                    inclined to think that Plautus is not the author. The plays are found generally
                    in the following arrangement. <hi rend="italic">Amphitrus,</hi> called by
                    Plautus himself in the prologue a tragi-comedy, because gods and princes are the
                    principal characters, and tragic events arc brought upon the comic stage; it has
                    been imitated by Boccacio, Molière, and Dryden. <hi rend="italic">Asinaria,</hi>
                    in imitation of the Greek play <hi rend="italic">'Oναγgος</hi> of Demophilus,
                    exhibiting in strongly-marked characters the corruption of Greek manners. <hi
                    rend="italic">Aulularia,</hi> one of the best, distinguished by its Roman
                    colouring; but its end is wanting: it is the foundation of Molière’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Avare.</hi><hi rend="italic">Captivi,</hi> according to the
                    opinion of the poet himself, one of his most successful efforts, which is
                    recommended particularly by the moral feeling that pervades it. The subject is
                    more grave, and the coarse licentiousness and extravagance which disgust us in
                    his other plays are here thrown into the back-ground, whilst a purely moral
                    character steps forward, without any diminution in the comic vigour and genius
                    of the poet, who must have written it in the latter years of his life. <hi
                    rend="italic">Curculio,</hi> from the name of the parasite who acts the chief
                    part. <hi rend="italic">Casina,</hi> in imitation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kλη-gουμενοι of</hi> Diphilus. <hi rend="italic">Cistellaria. Epidicus,</hi> a
                    play highly thought of by the author. <hi rend="italic">Chrysalus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacchides,</hi> in which the prologue and beginning are wanting:
                    the copy which Lascaris pretended to have found in Sicily is not considered as
                    genuine, being probably the work of Petrarch. <hi rend="italic">Phasma,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Mostellaria,</hi> in modern times imitated by Reynard and
                    Addison. <hi rend="italic">Menaechmus,</hi> also imitated by Reynard, and even
                    by Shakspeare in some parts. <hi rend="italic">Miles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gloriosus,</hi> one of his most successful pieces, which reminds us of
                    Holbein’s Bramarbas. <hi rend="italic">Mercator,</hi> in imitation of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> E <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> αnosoς of Philemon.
                    <hi rend="italic">Pseudolus,</hi> one of the favourites of the poet, as appears
                    from Cicero. <hi rend="italic">Paenulus,</hi> represented probably about 191,
                    and therefore to be numbered amongst the latest plays of Plautus. This is proved
                    by the labour he has bestowed upon it, the superior manner in which it
                    delineates character, and the skilful arrangement of the whole. It is remarkable
                    for the introduction of Carthaginian words, the only monument of the language
                    which remains, with the exception of coins and inscriptions; and it has
                    therefore been frequently referred to by the learned of ancient and modern
                    times. <hi rend="italic">Persa,</hi> from which Pliny quotes some verses that
                    are not found in the play which has come down to us. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pudens,</hi> a beautiful play, in imitation of the Greek of Diphilus. <hi
                    rend="italic">Stichus. Trinummus,</hi> in imitation of the of Phile mon: after
                    the <hi rend="italic">Captivi,</hi> it is the most remarkable play, both in
                    regard to the design of the whole, and the delineation of character, as well as
                    in the skilful arrangement of individual parts. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Truculentus,</hi> also a favourite of the poet. Besides these, we have likewise
                    the names and fragments of many other comedies.</p>
                <p>These comedies belong to the class of <hi rend="italic">Comoediae Palìiatae,</hi>
                    and are so far to be considered as free imitations of the works of die Greek
                    comedians of the new school; yet it would be doing injustice to the talents of
                    Plautus to suppose that he imitated slavishly the Greek originals, and copied
                    their works without asserting his own intellectual powers, or making changes
                    both in relation to the form and design of the whole, as well as of its
                    individual parts. The bold manner in which he made use of the Greek materials,
                    by which the poet was able to bring into play his natural genius and vein of
                    comic humour, and the frequent introduction of Roman characters and customs,
                    even into the midst of Greek plays, distinguished Plautus from the polished
                    Terence, who adhered much more closely to the Greek originals. It marks him as
                    the genuine poet of the people, who knew how to create a popular drama, and
                    thereby to furnish amusement for the lower ranks of life. He sold his plays to
                    the aediles, and therefore must have written them expressly for the diversion of
                    the people. We need scarcely doubt that the poet would have taken a still wider
                    range, and have exhibited still more of the true national character of the
                    Romans, if he had not had before his eyes the fate of Naevius, to warn him from
                    the dangerous path on which he was entering. The entire loss of the Greek
                    originals prevents us from being able to decide how much of his materials the
                    poet borrowed, and how far he imitated them in the design and conduct of his
                    plays. Plautus must have made more use of the productions of the Attic comic
                    writers than of those of the Sicilian poets. Yet Epicharmus and some others he
                    had evidently read with much care, and may also have imitated them, as he
                    certainly did in respect to Theocritus. The prologue, which is generally thought
                    to have been wanting to the Greek comedy, was peculiar to him and his imitators.
                    The poet was chiefly distinguished by the raciness of his wit, and the original
                    and spirited manner in which he treated his subjects. But as it was' not the
                    higher and more polished classes of society for whom he wrote, but rather for
                    those in humble life, from which he himself had sprung, we may expect to find in
                    his' comedies much low buffoonery, as well as many words and expressions bearing
                    a double meaning; and here and there he oversteps the bounds of modesty and
                    decency, which may however be forgiven, in return for the rich vein of humour
                    which will always stamp Plautus as one of the most original of the comic poets
                    of Rome. For this reason, however, much caution ought to be*used in introducing
                    the young to an acquaintance with the writings of Plautus.</p>
                <p>The language of Plautus is natural and forcible, though not always harmonious and
                    musical. Neither is it free from a certain harshness and ruggedness, apparent in
                    the use of old forms of words and expressions, which became obsolete in later
                    times, though we may ascribe this to the still uncultivated state of the
                    language. The form of the ’ verse is not regular; indeed the prosody and metre
                    are both treated with so much carelessness, that we are almost inclined to
                    believe that the poet either refused to submit to the trammels of a regular
                    metre, or was unacquainted with the laws and rules of prosody. Yet of late a
                    more minute examination of his writings, and a more profound study of the
                    principles of Latin prosody and metrical laws, have led writers to take a
                    different view of the subject. Many of the ancients bestowed unmeasured praise
                    on the language of Plautus; yet we need not be surprised at the less favour- ∙
                    able opinion pronounced by Horace, whose taste was formed upon a purer Greek
                    model.</p>
                <p>The earliest edition of Plautus is that of Venice, 1472; and the best is that
                    published by Brunck, Bipont, 1788, in three vols. 8vo.</p>
