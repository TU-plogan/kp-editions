                <p><label type="entry">PRIESTLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, LL.D.and
                    F. R. S.,a natural phi losopher and theologian, was born upon the 24th of March
                    1 <hi rend="underline">773,</hi> at Field-head, in the parish of Bristall, in
                    the west riding of Yorkshire. His father was a cloth-manufacturer, and both his
                    parents were respectable Calvinistic dissenters. A strong desire of reading was
                    one of the first passions which this philosopher exhibited, and which probably
                    induced his parents and friends to change their mind respecting his destination,
                    and, instead of bringing him up as a tradesman, to qualify him for some learned
                    profession. He acquired a knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in the school
                    of an eminent teacher at Bartlcy; and, at the age of nineteen, he became a
                    theological student in the academy of Da ventry. When about the age of
                    twenty-two, he was made choice of as assistant minister to the Independent
                    congregation of Needham Market, in Suffolk. Having resided at Needham for about
                    three years, he received an invitation to become pastor of a small flock at
                    Namptwitch, in Cheshire, which he accepted. Here he opened a day school, in the
                    management of which he displayed that turn for research, and that spirit of
                    improvement, which were afterwards destined to form such prominent features in
                    his character. His reputation as a man of extraordinary talents and diligent
                    inquiry, soon spread amongst his professional brethren; and when Dr. Aitken was
                    chosen to succeed the reverend Dr. Taylor as professor of divinity at
                    λVarring-ton, the vacant department of belles lettres was assigned to Mr.
                    Priestley.</p>
                <p>His literary career may probably be said to have commenced at Warrington; and the
                    extent, as well as the originality of his pursuits, were soon announced to the
                    world by a variety of valuable publications. Much of his attention about this
                    period was taken up with general politics, on which he delivered a number of
                    lectures. Although it was reasonable to think that his time would be
                    sufficiently occupied by his academical and literary employments, yet his
                    unwearied activity and industry found means to accomplish the first great work
                    in philosophy which laid a foundation for his future fame,</p>
                <p>Havinglongamused himselfwith an electrical machine, and felt himself interested
                    in the progress of discovery in that branch of physics, he undertook a history
                    of electricity, with an account of its present state. This work made its first
                    appearance at Warrington in the year 1767, and was so well received by the
                    learned world, that it went through a fifth edition in quarto, in the year 1794.
                    It is justly deemed a valuable performance, and its original experiments are
                    allowed to be very ingenious.</p>
                <p>About the year 1768, he was chosen as pastor of a large and respectable
                    congregation of Protestant dissenters at Leeds, which led him to give a very
                    large share of his attention to theological subjects. His mind is said to have
                    been from childhood strongly impressed with sentiments of piety and devotion;
                    and although he changed most of those religions sentiments in which he had been
                    instructed, for such as he regarded more rational and consistent with truth, his
                    piety and devotion never deserted him. He was at the head of the moderate
                    Unitarians, whose leading tenet is the proper humanity of Christ; confining
                    every species of religious worship and adoration to the one Supreme Being. Some,
                    we believe, have charged him with a design to subvert the Christian religion;
                    but, since zeal for Christianity, as a divine dispensation, and the most
                    valuable of all gifts bestowed upon the human race, was his ruling passion, such
                    an imputation cannot, in fairness, be admitted.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">History and Present State of Discoveries relating to
                    Vision, Light, and Colours,</hi> appeared in 1772, in two volumes quarto. This
                    is allow ed to be a performance of great merit and lucid arrangement; but it did
                    not bring him such a large share of popularity as his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Electricity,</hi> because it is probable that he was scarcely qualified to
                    explain the more abstruse parts of the science. In the year <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539291" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9291-0532"/>1770, he quitted the town of
                    Leeds for a situation entirely different f rom that which he had held there. His
                    philosophical writings and the recommendation of Dr. Price had made him
                    favourably known to the Earl of Shelburne, who held out to him such advantageous
                    proposals for residing with him, that a regard for his family did not permit him
                    to reject them. The domestic tuition of Lord Shelburne’s sons having been
                    previously committed to a man of merit, they received no instructions from Dr.
                    Priestley further than some courses of experimental philosophy. He also attended
                    his Lordship in a visit to Paris, where he had an opportunity of seeing some of
                    the most celebrated men of science in that country, whom he astonished by
                    asserting a firm belief in revealed religion, which had been presented to their
                    minds in such colours, that they thought no man of sense could hesitate in
                    rejecting it as an idle fable.</p>
                <p>In the year 1775, he published his <hi rend="italic">Examination</hi> of Dr. Reid
                    on the Human Mind; Dr. Beattie on the Nature and Immutability of Truth; and Dr.
                    Oswald’s Appeal to Common Sense. The design of this volume was to refute the
                    doctrine of Common Sense, said to be employed as the test of truth by the
                    metaphysicians of Scotland. He never intentionally misrepresented either the
                    arguments or the purposes of an opponent; but he measured the respect with which
                    he treated him by that which he conceived for him in his own mind. In the year
                    1777, he published his disquisitions relating to <hi rend="italic">Matter and
                    Spirit,</hi> in which he gave a history of the philosophical doctrine respecting
                    the soul, and openly supported the material system, which makes it homogeneous
                    with the body. This subjected him to more odium than any of his other
                    productions. As he materialized spirit so he in some measure spiritualized
                    matter, by assigning to it penetrability and several other subtle qualities.
                    About the same period he became the champion of philosophical necessity; a
                    doctrine not less obnoxious to many than the former, on account of its supposed,
                    or rather inevitable, effects on morality. So astonishing was the versatility of
                    his mind, that he at the same time carried on that course of discovery
                    concerning aeriform bodies, which has rendered his name so illustrious amongst
                    philosophical chemists. A second volume was published in 1775, and a third in
                    1777. Some of his most memorable discoveries were those of nitrous and
                    dephlogisticated or pure air; of the restoration of vitiated air by vegetation;
                    of the influence of light on vegetables; and of the effects of respiration on
                    the blood.</p>
                <p>The name of Priestley was by these means spread throughout all the countries of
                    Europe, and honours were heaped upon him by scientific bodies in various parts.
                    The term of“his engagement with Lord Shelburne having expired, Dr. Priestley
                    found himself at liberty to choose a new situation, and retired with a pension
                    for life of L.150 a-year. He chose the vicinity of the populous town of
                    Birmingham, which was then the residence of several men of science, such as
                    Watt, Withering, Bolton, and Keir, whose names are well known to the public.
                    Here he was invited to become pastor of a dissenting congregation, an offer
                    which he accepted about the latter end of the year 1780. Soon after this
                    appeared his Letters to Bishop Newcome, <hi rend="italic">On the Duration of
                    Christ’s Ministry,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">History of the Corruptions of
                    Christianity,</hi> works which were afterwards followed by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Early Opinions.</hi> He displayed his attachment to freedom by his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay on the First Principles of Government,</hi> and by an
                    anonymous pamphlet on the <hi rend="italic">State of Public Liberty</hi> in this
                    country; and he evinced a warm interest in the cause of America at the time of
                    its unfortunate quarrel with the mother country.</p>
                <p>On the 14th of July, 1791, the celebration of the anniversary of the destruction
                    of the Bastille, by a publicdinner, at which Dr. Priestley was not present, gave
                    the signal for those riots which have brought lasting disgrace on the town of
                    Birmingham, and in some degree upon the national cha racter. Amidst the
                    conflagration of places of worship and of private dwellings, Dr. Priestley was
                    the great object of popular rage; his house, library, manuscripts, and
                    apparatus, were given as a prey to the flames; he was hunted like a criminal,
                    and experienced not only the furious outrages of a mob, but the most unhandsome
                    treatment from some who ought to have supported the character of gentlemen and
                    friends of good order. He now lay under a load of public odium and suspicion,
                    and, besides, he was constantly harassed by the petty malignity of bigotry. It
                    was not to be wondered at, therefore, that he looked for an asylum in a country
                    to which he had always shewn a friendly attachment, and which, he supposed, was
                    in full possession of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty. In the
                    year 1794, he took leave of his native country, and embarked for North America.
                    He took up his residence in Northumberland, a town in the interior of the state
                    of Pennsylvania, which he selected on account of the purchase of landed property
                    in its neighbourhood; otherwise its remoteness from the sea-ports, its want of
                    many of the comforts of life, and of all the helps to scientific pursuit,
                    rendered it a peculiarly undesirable abode for one of Dr. Priestley’s habits and
                    employments. The loss of his amiable wife, and of a most promising son, as well
                    as repeated attacks of disease, severely tried the fortitude and resignation of
                    this ill-fated philosopher.</p>
                <p>In America he was received with general respect, and the angry contests of party
                    were not able wholly to deprive him of the esteem due to his character. He was
                    heard as a preacher by some of the most distinguished members of Congress; and
                    he was offered, but declined, the place of chemical professor of Philadelphia.
                    It became his great object to enable himself, in his retirement at
                    Northumberland, to renew that course of philosophical experiment, and especially
                    that train of theological writing, which had occupied so many of the best years
                    of his life. By numerous experiments on the constitution of airs, he became more
                    and more fixed in his belief of the phlogistic theory, and in his opposition to
                    the new French chemical system, of which he lived to be the only opponent of any
                    celebrity. By the liberal contributions of his friends in England, he was
                    enabled to commence the printing of two extensive works, upon which he was
                    zealously bent, a <hi rend="italic">Church History,</hi> and an <hi
                    rend="italic">Exposition of the Scriptures</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    during the progress of his final decline, he unremittingly urged their
                    completion.</p>
                <p>Since an illness which seized him at Philadelphia, in the year 1801, he never
                    recovered his formerstate of health. His complaint was constant indigestion, and
                    a difficulty of swallowing food of any kind. But during this period of general
                    debility, he was busily employed in printing his <hi rend="italic">Church
                    History,</hi> in writing the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the
                    Scriptures,</hi> and in making new and original experiments. During this period,
                    likewise, he composed his pamphlet <hi rend="italic">of Jesus and Socrates
                    Compared,</hi> and reprinted his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Phlogiston.</hi></p>
                <p>From about the beginning of November 1803, till the middle of January 1804, his
                    complaint grew more'Serious; yet, by judicious medical treatment and strict
                    atterltion to diet, he, after a time, seemed to be, if not regaining strength,
                    at least not getting worse; and his friends fondly hoped that his health would
                    continue to improve as the season advanced. He, however, considered his life as
                    very precarious. Even at this time, besides his miscellaneous reading, which was
                    at all times very extensive, he read through all the works which are quoted in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Comparison of the different Systems of Grecian
                    Philosophers with Christianity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> composed that work;
                    and transcribed the whole of it in less than three months, thus leaving it ready
                    for the press.</p>
                <p>In the last fortnight of January, his fits of indigestion became more alarming
                    than ever, his legs swelled, and his weakness increased. Within two days of his
                    death he became so weak, that he could walk but a little way, and that with <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193539304" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9304-0533"/> great difficulty.
                    He was fully sensible that he had not long to live, yet he talked with
                    cheerfulness to all who called for him. He dwelt upon the peculiarly happy
                    situation in which it had pleased the Divine Being to place him in life; the
                    great advantage he had enjoyed in the acquaintance and friendship of some of the
                    best and wisest men of the age in which he lived; and the satisfaction he
                    derived from having led an useful as well as a happy life. On the 9th of
                    February 1804, he breathed his last, so easily, that those who were sitting
                    close to him did not immediately perceive his exit. He had put his hand to his
                    face, which prevented them from observing the last moment of his being.</p>
                <p>In the constitution of Dr. Priestley’s mind, great ardour and vivacity of
                    intellect were united with a mild and placid temper. With a zeal for the
                    propagation of' truth which nothing could subdue, he joined a calm patience, and
                    an unruffled serenity of temper, which rendered him proof against
                    disappointments. The rights of private judgment were rendered sacred to him by
                    every principle of his understanding, and his heart would not have suffered him
                    to injure his bitterest enemy. He was naturally disposed to be cheerful, and
                    when his mind was not occupied with serious thoughts, he could unbend, with
                    playful ease and negligence, in the private circle of friends; but in large and
                    mixed companies, he commonly spoke little. In the domestic relations of life he
                    was uniformly kind and affectionate; his parental feelings were those of the
                    tenderest and best of fathers; and not even malice itself could ever fix a stain
                    upon his private conduct, or impeach his integrity.</p>
