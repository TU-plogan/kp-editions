                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PRESBYTERIANS</label>, Protestants, so called from their
                    maintaining that the government of the church appointed in the New Testament was
                    by presbyteries, that is, by associations of presbyters or elders, all possessed
                    of equal powers, without any superiority among them either in office or in
                    order.</p>
                <p>The presbyterians believe, that the authority of their ministers to preach the
                    gospel, to administer the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s supper, and to
                    feed the flock of Christ, is in no respect inferior to the authority possessed
                    by the ministers of any other church. They oppose the independent scheme of the
                    common rights of Christians by the same arguments which are used for that
                    purpose by the episcopalians, (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Episcocacy).</hi> They
                    affirm, however, that in the church, as established by Christ and his apostles,
                    there is no order superior to that of presbyters; that all ministers are equal
                    by their commission; that <hi rend="italic">presbyter</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bishop,</hi> though different words, are of the same import; and that prelacy
                    or diocesan episcopacy was gradually established upon the primitive practice of
                    making the <hi rend="italic">moderator</hi> or president of the presbytery a
                    permanent officer.</p>
                <p>These positions they maintain against the episcopalians by the following
                    scriptural arguments. They observe, that the apostles planted churches by
                    ordaining bishops and deacons in every city; that the ministers which in one
                    verse are called bishops, are in the next perhaps denominated presbyters; that
                    we nowhere read in the New Testament of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, in any
                    one church; and that therefore we are under the necessity of concluding <hi
                    rend="italic">bishop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">presbyter</hi> to be two names
                    for the same church officer. This is apparent from Peter’s exhortation to the
                    <hi rend="italic">elders</hi><hi rend="italic">ον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >presbyters</hi> who were among the Jewish Christians. “The <hi rend="italic"
                    >elders</hi> (presbyters) which are among you I exhort, who am also an <hi
                    rend="italic">elder,</hi> and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a
                    partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is
                    among you, taking the <hi rend="italic">oversight</hi> thereof <hi rend="italic"
                    >(iitiaκοπ∙ουντeς,</hi> acting as <hi rend="italic">bishops</hi> thereof,) not
                    by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of <pb break="no"

                    beingnonns over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Peter v. 1, 2, 3.</p></note>
                    From this passage it is evident, that the presbyters not only fed the flock of
                    Christ, but also governed that flock with episcopal powers; and that the apostle
                    himself, as an officer of the church, was nothing more than a presbyter or
                    elder. The identity of the office of bishop and presbyter is still more apparent
                    from Heb. xiii. 7. 17. and 1 Thess. v. Γ2; for the bishops are there represented
                    as governing the flock, speaking to them the word of God, watching for their
                    souls, and discharging various offices, which it is impossible for any man to
                    perform to more than one congregation.</p>
                <p>From the last cited text it is evident, that the bishops <hi rend="italic"
                    >(προϊστάμενους)</hi> of the Thessalonian churches had the pastoral care of no
                    more souls than they could hold personal communion with in God’s worship; for
                    they were such as all the people were to <hi rend="italic">know, esteem,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">love,</hi> as those that not only were <hi rend="italic"
                    >over them,</hi> but also “closely laboured among them, and admonished them.”
                    But diocesan bishops, whom ordinarily the hundredth part of their flock never
                    hear nor see, cannot be those bishops by whom that flock is admonished, nor can
                    they be, wiiat Peter requires the bishops of the Jewish converts to bc, <hi
                    rend="italic">ensamples to the flock.</hi> It is the opinion of Dr. Hammond, who
                    was a learned divine, and a zealot for episcopacy, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >elders</hi> whom the apostle Janies desires<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Chap. v. 14.</p></note> the sick to call for, were of the
                    highest permanent order of ecclesiastical officers; but it is self-evident that
                    those elders cannot have been diocesan bishops, otherwise the sick must have
                    been often beyond the reach of the remedy proposed to them.</p>
                <p>There is no passage of Scripture on which the episcopalian is more ready to rest
                    his cause, than the alleged episcopacy of Timothy and Titus; of whom the former
                    is said to have been bishop of Ephesus, and the latter bishop of Crete; yet the
                    presbyterian thinks it as clear as the noonday sun, that the presbyters of
                    Ephesus were supreme governors under Christ of the Ephesian churches, at the
                    very time that Timothy is pretended to have been their proper diocesan.</p>
                <p>In Acts XX. 17, seq. we read, that “from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and called
                    the elders (presbyters) of the church. And when they were come to him, he said
                    unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner
                    I have been with you, at all seasons. And now I know that ye all, among whom I
                    have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. Wherefore I
                    take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I
                    have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take heed therefore
                    unto yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
                    overseers, (6⅛ισκ0τrous∙, <hi rend="italic">bishops'),</hi> to feed the church
                    of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after
                    my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
                    Also of your ownselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away
                    disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
                    years, I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now,
                    brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his grace,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>From this passage, it is evident that there was in the city of Ephesus a
                    plurality of pastors of equal authority, without any superior pastor or bishop
                    over them; for the apostle directs his discourse to them all in common, and
                    gives them equal power over the whole flock. Dr. Hammond indeed imagines, that
                    the elders whom Paul called to Miletus were the <hi rend="italic">bishops of
                    Asia,</hi> and that he sent for them to Ephesus, because that city was the
                    metropolis of the province. But were this opinion well-founded, it is not
                    conceivable that the sacred writer would have called them the elders of the
                    church of <hi rend="italic">Ephesus,</hi> but the elders of the <hi
                    rend="italic">church in general,</hi> or the elders of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >churches in Asia.</hi> Besides, it is to be remembered, that the apostle was in
                    such haste to visit Jerusalem, that the sacred historian measures his time by
                    <hi rend="italic">days;</hi> whereas it must have required several months to
                    call together the bishops or elders of all the cities of Asia; and he might
                    certainly have gone to meet them at Ephesus in less time than would be requisite
                    for their meeting in that city and proceeding thence to him at Miletus. They
                    must therefore have been either the joint pastors of one congregation, or the
                    pastors of different congregations in one city; and as it was thus in Ephesus,
                    so was it in Philippi; for we find the apostle addressing b.is epistle “to all
                    the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.”
                    From the passage betore us it is likewise plain, that the presbyters of Ephesus
                    had not only the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> but the whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >power</hi> of bishops given to them by the Holy Ghost; for they are enjoined to
                    do the whole work of bishops, <hi rend="italic">ποιμαίνεις την εκκλησίαν
                    του</hi><hi rend="italic">Qεου,</hi> which signifies, to <hi rend="italic"
                    >rule</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> the church of God. Hence it is
                    evident, that the apostle makes the power of <hi rend="italic">governing</hi>
                    inseparable from that of <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >watching;</hi> and that according to him, all who are preachers of God’s word,
                    and watchmen of souls, are necessarily rulers or governors of the church,
                    without being accountable for their management to any prelate, but only to their
                    Lord Christ, from whom their power is derived.</p>
                <p>It appears therefore that the apostle Paul left: in the church of Ephesus, which
                    he had planted, no other successors to himself than <hi rend="italic"
                    >presbyter-bishops,</hi> or presbyterian ministers, and that he did not devolve
                    bis power upon any prelate. Timothy, whom the episcopalians allege to have been
                    the first bishop of Ephesus, was present when this settlement was made;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts xx. <hi rend="italic"
                    >5.</hi></p></note> and it is surely not to be supposed, that, had he been their
                    bishop, the apostle would have devolved the whole episcopal power upon the
                    presbyters before his face. If ever there was a season fitter than another for
                    pointing out the duty of this supposed bishop to his diocese, and the duty of
                    his presbyters to him, it was surely when Paul was taking his final leave of
                    them, and discoursing so pathetically concerning the duty of <hi rend="italic"
                    >overseers,</hi> the coming of ravenous wolves, and the consequent hazard of the
                    flock. In this farewell discourse, he tells them that “he had not shunned to
                    declare unto them all the counsel of God.” But with what truth could this have
                    been said, if obedience to a diocesan bishop had been any part of their duty
                    either at the time of the apostle’s speaking or at any future period? He foresaw
                    that ravenous wolves would enter in among them, and that even some of themselves
                    should arise speaking perverse things; and if, as the Episcopalians allege,
                    diocesan episcopacy was the remedy provided for those evils, is it not strange,
                    passing strange, that the inspired preacher did not foresee that Timothy, who
                    was standing beside him, was destined to fill that important office; or if he
                    did foresee it, that he omitted to recommend him to his future charge, and to
                    give him proper instructions for the discharge of his duty?</p>
                <p>But if Timothy was not bishop of Ephesus, what, it may be asked, was his office
                    in that city? For that he resided there for some time, and was by the apostle
                    invested with authority to ordain and rebuke presbyters, are facts about which
                    all parties are agreed, and which indeed cannot be controverted by any reader of
                    Paul’s epistles. To this the presbyterian replies with confidence, that the
                    power which Timothy exercised in the church of Ephesus was that of an
                    evangelist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tim. iv.
                    5.</p></note> and not a prelate. But, according to Eusebius, the work of an
                    evangelist was, “to lay the foundations of the faith in barbarous nations, and
                    to constitute among them <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9200-0525"/>pastors; after which he passed on to other
                    countries.” Accordingly we find, that Timothy was resident for a time at
                    Philippi and Corinth,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Phil. ii. 19. 1 Cor. iv. 17; xvi. 10, 11.</p></note> as well as at Ephesus,
                    and that he had as much authority over those churches as over that of which he
                    is said to have been the fixed bishop. “Now, if Timotheus come, see that he may
                    be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. Let
                    no man therefore despise him.” This text might lead us to suppose, that Timothy
                    was bishop of Corinth as well as of Ephesus; for it affords a more plausible
                    ground than that on which his episcopacy of the latter church is chiefly built.
                    The apostle says, “I besought thee<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Tim. i. 3.</p></note> to abide still at Ephesus when I went
                    into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
                    doctrine.” But had Timothy been the permanent bishop of that city, there would
                    surely have been no necessity for <hi rend="italic">beseeching</hi> him to abide
                    with his flock. It is likewise to be observed, that the first epistle to
                    Timothy, which alone was written to him during his residence at Ephesus, was of
                    a date prior to Paul’s meeting with the elders of that church at Miletus; for in
                    the epistle he hopes to come to him shortly, whereas he tells the elders at
                    Miletus, that they should see his face no more. This being the case, it is
                    evident that Timothy was left by the apostle at Ephesus only to supply his place
                    during his temporary absence at Macedonia, and that he could not possibly have
                    been constituted permanent bishop of that church, since the episcopal powers
                    were afterwards committed to the presbyters by the Holy Ghost in his
                    presence.</p>
                <p>The identity of the office of bishop and presbyter being thus clearly
                    established, it follows, that the presbyterate is the highest permanent office
                    in the church, and that every faithful pastor of a flock is successor to the
                    apostles in every thing in which they were to have any successors. In the
                    apostolic office there were indeed some things peculiar and extraordinary, such
                    as their immediate call by Christ, their infallibility, their being witnesses of
                    our Lord’s resurrection, and their unlimited jurisdiction over the whole world.
                    These powers and privileges could not be conveyed by imposition of hands to any
                    successors, whether called presbyters or bishops; but as rulers or
                    office-bearers in particular churches, we have the confession of “the very
                    chiefest apostles,” Peter and John, that they were nothing more than presbyters
                    or labouring pastors. This being the case, the dispute, which has been so warmly
                    agitated, concerning the validity of presbyterian ordination, may be soon
                    decided; for if the ceremony of ordination be at all essential, it is obvious
                    that such a ceremony performed by presbyters must be valid, as there is no
                    higher order of ecclesiastics in the church by w hom it can be performed.
                    Accordingly, we find, that Timothy himself, though said to be a bishop, was
                    ordained by the laying on of the hands of a presbytery. At that ordination
                    indeed St. Paul presided, but he could preside only as <hi rend="italic">primus
                    in paribus;</hi> for we have seen that, as permanent officers in the church of
                    Christ, the apostles themselves were no more than presbyters. If the apostles’
                    hands were imposed for any other purpose, it must have been to communicate those
                    <hi rend="italic">charismata</hi> or miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, which
                    were then so frequent, but which no modern presbyter or bishop will pretend to
                    give, unless his understanding be clouded by the grossest ignorance, or
                    perverted by the most frantic enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>But if the office of bishop and presbyter was originally the same, how, it will
                    be asked, came diocesan episcopacy to prevail so universally, as it is confessed
                    to have done, before the conversion of Constantine, and the civil establishment
                    of Christianity in the Roman empire? To give a satisfactory answer to this
                    question is certainly the most arduous task which the advocate for presbytery
                    has to perform; but the difficulties attending this task are not
                    insurmount-table.</p>
                <p>From many passages in the New Testament,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Acts xi. 29; xiii, 1, 2, 3; xv. Tit. i. v.</p></note> it is
                    evident, that when the apostles planted churches in different cities, they
                    generally settled more than one pastor in the same church, to feed and govern it
                    with joint authority. The propriety of this constitution is obvious. In those
                    days, when the disciples of Christ were persecuted for their religion, and often
                    obliged to meet in the “night for fear of the Jews,” they could not with any
                    degree of prudence assemble in large numbers; and therefore, had there been no
                    more than one pastor in a city, the Christian converts, though, when assembled,
                    they might have amounted to but a small congregation, could not all have enjoyed
                    the benefit of public worship on the same day; at least it is obvious that they
                    could not possibly have assembled for this purpose so often as their want of
                    instruction, and the duty of “breaking of bread and of prayer,” required them to
                    meet. It was therefore with great wisdom that the apostles ordained several
                    presbyters in the same church; but as these presbyters would have occasion to
                    meet frequently, and to deliberate on the state of the flock which it was their
                    duty to feed, and over which they had all equal authority, they would be under
                    the necessity of electing one of their own number to be president or <hi
                    rend="italic">moderator</hi> of the presbytery, that order might be preserved,
                    and all things done with decency. At first there is reason to believe that those
                    presidents held their office no longer than while the presbyteries sat in which
                    they were elected. Among the apostles themselves there was no fixed president.
                    Peter indeed appears to have been most frequently admitted to that honour; but
                    there is one very memorable occasion on record, when James, the Lord’s brother,
                    presided in an assembly of apostles, elders, and brethren, held at Jerusalem, to
                    determine the question concerning the necessity of circumcising the Gentiles,
                    and commanding them to keep the law of Moses. <supplied cert="medium"

                <p>Upon this model were the primitive presbyteries formed. They consisted of several
                    presbyters possessed of equal powers, who at their meetings appointed one of
                    their own number to discharge the office of moderator or temporary president;
                    but to this president they gave no prelatical powers or negative voice over the
                    deliberations of his brethren; for, as Jerom informs us, the church was then
                    governed <hi rend="italic">communi presbyterorum concilio,</hi> “by a common
                    council of presbyters.” It appears however that when an apostle, an apostolical
                    man, or an evangelist, fixed his residence in any city, and took upon himself
                    the pastoral care of part of the flock, his co-presbyters, from respect to his
                    singular gifts, made him their constant and fixed moderator. Hence Timothy,
                    during his abode at Ephesus, was moderator of the presbytery; and hence, too,
                    Mark the evangelist, who resided many years in Alexandria, has been called the
                    first bishop of that church, though he appears to have been nothing more than
                    permanent moderator. We advance this upon the authority of Jerom, one of the
                    most learned fathers of the Christian church, who informs us, that upon the
                    death of the evangelist, the presbyters of Alexandria, for more than two hundred
                    years, chose their bishops from their own number, and placed them in the
                    episcopal chair, without dreaming that they ought to be raised to a higher order
                    by a new consecration; “presbyteri unum ex se electum in excelsiori gradu
                    collocatum, episcopum nominabant.” As this practice of making the moderator of
                    the presbytery of Alexandria a permanent officer, was thought a good expedient
                    to guard the infant churches against schisms and divisions, those churches
                    gradually adopted it. For, as Jerom tells us, “postquam <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539213" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9213-0526"/>unusquisque eos quos
                    baptisaverat, suos putabat esse, non Christi, in toto orbe decretum est, ut unus
                    de presbyteris electus, superponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis ecclesiae cura
                    pertincret, et schismatum semina tollerentur.”</p>
                <p>The advantages which, in displaying his talents and authority, the perpetual
                    president or speaker of any assembly has over his colleagues in office, are so
                    obvious, that when the practice of electing their moderators for life became
                    universal among the presbyteries of the primitive church, it is easy to conceive
                    how ambitious men might so magnify the difficulties and importance of their
                    station, as to introduce the custom of filling it by a new consecration of the
                    bishop elect. But when this was done, diocesan episcopacy, with all its powers
                    and prerogatives, would follow as a matter of course, until “by little and
                    little,” as Jerom expresses himself, “the whole pastoral care of the flock was
                    devolved upon one man.”</p>
                <p>Our limits will not permit us to trace more minutely the rise and progress of
                    this ecclesiastical usurpation, as the Presbyterian calls it; but the reader who
                    wishes for fuller information, after studying the remains of the four first
                    centuries of the Christian church, may consult, “An Inquiry into the
                    Constitution, Discipline, and Worship, of the Primitive Church,” written by Lord
                    King, chancellor of England. As an impartial lover of truth, he will do well to
                    consult also a book entitled, “An original Draught of the Primitive Church,”
                    which was published as an answer to the Inquiry; and he may read with much
                    advantage to himself, “A Letter from a Parochial Bishop to a Prelatical
                    Gentleman,” with “An Apology for the Church of Scotland,” both written by Mr.
                    Willison of Dundee, and both evincing considerable learning, and great
                    ingenuity, • in their pious author. But during our own age, the ρres-byterian
                    cause has been most ably maintained by Dr. ‘ Campbell, in his “Lectures on
                    Ecclesiastical History,” and *by Dr. Mitchell, in his “Presbyterian

                <p>Of the churches at present formed upon this model, we believe, that without
                    incurring the imputation of national prejudice, we may safely affirm the church
                    of Scotland to be the most efficient. Her mode of worship is simple and solemn;
                    her established faith agreeable to the confessions of most of the other
                    Protestant churches; her judicatories are calculated to maintain the rights of
                    the people; and her pastors are eminently distinguishedby their fidelity and
                    zeal. In this respect, a gradual and very perceptible change has taken place in
                    the course of the passing century. We cannot more properly conclude this article
                    than with a short view of her constitution, as being that in which our
                    Presbyterian readers are undoubtedly most interested.</p>
                <p>No one is ignorant, that from the first dawn of reformation among us, till the
                    era of the revolution, there was a perpetual struggle between the court and the
                    people for the establishment of an Episcopal or a Presbyterian form of church
                    government. The former model of ecclesiastical polity was patronised by the
                    house of Stewart on account of the support which it gave to the prerogatives of
                    the crown; the latter was the favourite of the majority of the people, perhaps
                    not so much on account of its superior claim to apostolical institution, as
                    because the laitv are mixed with the clergy in ecclesiastical judicatories, and
                    the two orders, which under episcopacy are kept so distinct, incorporated into
                    one body. In the Scottish church, every regulation of public worship, every act
                    of discipline, and every ecclesiastical censure, which in other churches flows
                    from the authority of a diocesan bishop, or from a convocation of the clergy, is
                    the joint work of a certain number of clergymen and laymen acting together with
                    equal authority, and deciding every question by a majority of votes. The laymen
                    who thus form an essential part of the ecclesiastical courts of Scotland, are
                    called <hi rend="italic">ruling elders</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hold the
                    same office, as well as the same name, with those brethren<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> 2Actsxv</hi> · ’ ’
                    ’</p></note> who joined with the apostles and elders at Jerusalem in determining
                    the important question concerning the necessity of imposing upon the Gentile
                    converts the ritual observances of the law of Moses. These lay-elders Paul
                    enjoined Timothy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tim. V.
                    17.</p></note> to account worthy of double honour, if they should rule well, and
                    discharge the duties for which they were separated from the multitude of their
                    brethren. In the church of Scotland every parish has several of those
                    lay-elders, who are, or ought to be, grave and serious persons, chosen from
                    among the beads of families, of known orthodoxy, and steady adherence to the
                    worship, discipline, and government of the church. Being solemnly engaged to use
                    their utmost endeavours for the suppression of vice and the cherishing of piety
                    and virtue, and to exercise discipline faithfully and diligently, the minister,
                    in the presence of the congregation, sets them apart to their office by solemn
                    prayer; and concludes the ceremony, which is sometimes called ordination, with
                    exhorting both elders and people to their respective duties.</p>
                <p>The kirk-session, which is the lowest ecclesiastical judicatory, consists of the
                    minister and those elders of the congregation. The minister is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex officio</hi> moderator, but has no negative voice over the decision of the
                    session; nor indeed has he a right to vote at all, unless when the voices of the
                    elders are equal and opposite. He may indeed enter his protest against their
                    sentence, if he think it improper, and appeal to the decision of the presbytery;
                    but this privilege belongs equally to every elder, as well as to every person
                    who may believe himself aggrieved by the ] roceedings of the session. The
                    deacons, whose proper office is to take care of the poor, may be present in
                    every session, and offer their counsel on all questions that come before it; but
                    except in what relates to the distribution of alms, they have no decisive vote
                    with the minister and elders.</p>
                <p>The next judicatory is <hi rend="italic">the presbytery,</hi> which consists of
                    all the pastors within a certain district, and one ruling elder from each
                    parish, commissioned by his brethren to represent, in conjunction with the
                    minister, the session of that parish. The presbytery treats of such matters as
                    concern the particular churches within its limits; as the examination,
                    admission, ordination, and censuring of ministers; the licensing of
                    probationers, rebuking of gross or contumacious sinners, the directing of the
                    sentence of excommunication, the deciding upon references and appeals from
                    kirk-sessions, resolving cases of conscience, explaining difficulties in
                    doctrine or discipline; and censuring, according to the word of God, any heresy
                    or erroneous doctrine which hath either been publicly or privately maintained
                    within the limits of its jurisdiction. Partial as we may be thought to our own
                    church, we frankly acknowledge that we cannot altogether approve of that part of
                    her constitution which gives an equal vote, in questions of heresy, to a plain
                    mechanic and his educated pastor. In presbyteries, the only prerogatives which
                    the pastors have over the ruling elders, are the power of ordination, and the
                    privilege of having the moderator chosen from their body.</p>
                <p>From the judgment of the presbytery, an appeal lies to the provincial synod,
                    which commonly meets twice a-year, and which exercises over the presbyteries
                    within the province a jurisdiction similar to that which is vested in each
                    presbytery over its several kirk-sessions. Of these synods <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539226" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9226-0527"/>there are in the church of
                    Scotland fifteen, which are composed of the members of the several presbyteries
                    within the respective provinces which give names to the synods.</p>
                <p>The highest authority in the church is the general assembly, which consists of a
                    certain number of ministers and ruling elders delegated from each presbytery,
                    and of commissioners from the universities and royal burghs. A presbytery in
                    which there are fewer than twelve parishes, sends to the general assembly two
                    ministers and one ruling elder: if it contain between twelve and eighteen
                    ministers, it sends three of these, and one ruling elder: if it contains between
                    eighteen and twenty-four ministers, it sends four ministers and two ruling
                    elders: and of twenty-four ministers, when it contains so many, it sends five
                    with two ruling elders. Every royal burgh sends one ruling cider, and Edinburgh
                    two. Their election must be attested by the kirk-sessions of the respective
                    burghs. Every university sends one commissioner from its own body. The
                    commissioners are annually chosen, six weeks before the meeting of the assembly:
                    and the ruling elders are often men of the first eminence in the kingdom for
                    rank and talents. In this assembly, which meets once a-year, the king presides
                    by his commissioner, who is always a nobleman; but he has no voice in their
                    deliberations. The order of their proceedings is regular, though sometimes the
                    number of members creates <hi rend="italic">a</hi> confusion, which the
                    moderator, who is chosen from among the ministers, to be the chairman or speaker
                    of the house, has not sufficient authority to prevent. To the general assembly
                    appeals are brought from all the other ecclesiastical courts of Scotland; and in
                    questions purely religious, no appeal lies from its determinations. In the
                    subordination of these assemblies, parochial, presbyterial, provincial, and
                    national, consists the external order, strength, and stedfastness, of the church
                    of Scotland.</p>
