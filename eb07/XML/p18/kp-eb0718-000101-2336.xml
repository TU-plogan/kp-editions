                <p><label type="entry">PLATA, LA</label>.</p>
                <p>LA PLATA is the name of an extensive tract of country in South America, extending
                    from the eastern declivities of the Chilian Andes, to the great rivers Paraguay,
                    Parana, and La Plata. During the latter period of Spanish domination, it formed
                    the viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, or Buenos Ayres, having then annexed to
                    it Bolivia or Upper Peru, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. By subsequent
                    changes these have been erected into independent states, and the remaining
                    territory has been constituted a republic under the name of the Argentine
                    Republic, or the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. It is a federal state,
                    consisting of a number of provinces, of which Buenos Ayres is the head. Before
                    describing this country, we shall briefly glance at its past history.</p>
                <p>To the Spaniards belongs the honour of first discovering this part of the South
                    American continent. In the year 1515, Juan Dias de Solis or Salis, having been
                    furnished by the court of Spain with two ships for the purpose of exploring
                    Brazil, arrived, on his voyage thither, at the mouth of the Rio dc la Plata.
                    Touching on the north coast between Maldonado and Monte Video, he took formal
                    possession of the land in name of his sovereign; but, thrown off his guard by
                    the deceitful friendship of the natives, he was slain, along with a few
                    attendants who had followed him on shore. The coast was immediately abandoned by
                    the survivors on board of the vessels; but in the year 1526 a fresh expedition,
                    under the celebrated Sebastian Cabot, then in the service of Spain, entered the
                    river, and cast anchor opposite the present site of Buenos Ayres. This took
                    place at the time when a Spanish captain called Garcia was making discoveries in
                    other parts of the same river. Advancing about a hundred and twenty leagues
                    upwards, Cabot discovered a fine river flowing into the main stream. Up this he
                    sailed with his fleet, and disembarking his men, built a fort, in which he left
                    a garrison; whilst he himself, with his remaining followers, pursued his
                    discoveries still farther up the river. The Indians with whom he came in contact
                    exhibited abundance of gold and silver plates, particularly the latter, brought
                    by them from the eastern parts of Peru; but the circumstance led Cabot to
                    believe that mines of •the precious metals existed in the country in which he
                    then was, and accordingly he gave the name of Rio de la Plata, or River of
                    Silver, to the noble stream by which it was watered. The Spaniards soon
                    determined on colonizing this valuable acquisition; and, to prevent any
                    interference on the part of the other nations of Europe, Don Pedro de Mendoza,
                    with two or three thousand followers, was sent from Spain to secure the
                    possession, and establish a relationship between it and the mother country. He
                    landed upon the western shore of the La Plata in the year 1535, and founded the
                    city of Buenos Ayres, which he so named from the salubrity of the climate.
                    Pursuing his way into the interior, he conquered all the country as far as
                    Potosi, at which mines of silver were discovered nine years afterwards. The
                    first settlers at Buenos Ayres were most unfortunate; their town was burned by
                    the Indians, and after suffering every privation, they were shortly afterwards
                    compelled to abandon the place. Previously to this event, Assumption, the
                    capital of Paraguay, had been founded; and thither the wretched remains of the
                    expedition retreated. A second armament was fitted out, and an attempt made to
                    rebuild the town, in 1542; but it was overwhelmed by a calamity similar to that
                    which had overtaken the former. The chief attention of the Spaniards was for
                    some time directed to forming settlements in Paraguay, in order to facilitate
                    their communication with the mines of Peru, where Pizarro and his successors
                    were gathering in a golden harvest. Contentions with the Indians were frequent
                    and bloody, for the inhabitants of the vast plains upon either bank of the La
                    Plata proved much more difficult to subdue than the timid and tractable
                    Peruvians.</p>
                <p>It was not until the year 1580 that the Europeans succeeded in their attempts to
                    found a town upon the site chosen by Mendoza. Before this period, however, they
                    had established themselves at Santa Fe, Mendoza, and some other places in the
                    interior; so that, as Dr Southey observes, the history of this part of South
                    America differs from that of any other colony in one remarkable circumstance:
                    The first permanent settlement was formed in the heart of the country, and the
                    Spaniards colonized from the interior towards the sea. But they were not
                    permitted quietly to enjoy the success of their third attempt to found Buenos
                    Ayres.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532349" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2349-0002"/>
                <p>Stimulated by the recollection of their previous triumphs in demolishing the
                    works of the invaders on the same ground, the Indians once more attacked it, and
                    were so far successful as to set fire to the tents and temporary erections of
                    the settlers. Their leader, however, being slain, they were compelled to retreat
                    with loss; and before they were in a condition to renew the work of demolition,
                    the town was so well fortified and garrisoned as to bid defiance to their
                    efforts. Again the leader of the savages fell, and his force was completely
                    defeated and put to flight. From this period the city began to prosper, and the
                    ship which carried to Castille the intelligence of its refoundation took home a
                    cargo of sugar, and the first hides with which Europe was supplied from the wild
                    cattle which now began to overspread the country, and soon produced a total
                    change in the manners of all the adjoining tribes. The immense pampas of La
                    Plata appear to have been originally stocked with cattle from a few which had
                    been brought by the earliest settlers; and so rapidly had they multiplied, that,
                    about the year 1610, no less than a million is said to have been driven from the
                    country in the neighbourhood of Santa Fe into Peru.</p>
                <p>In the year 1620 Buenos Ayres was erected into a bishoprie; but for nearly two
                    centuries it continued to be a place of little note, and comparatively scanty
                    population. From the first period of the colonization of this country till the
                    year 1778, the government was dependent on that of Peru, although the chief of
                    Buenos Ayres had the title of captain-general. A false idea of what constitutes
                    wealth led Spain to estimate the value of her possessions by the number and
                    richness of their mines of gold and silver; and Buenos Ayres being deficient in
                    these, its more solid advantages of a fertile soil and a salubrious climate were
                    consequently overlooked. The pernicious system of political economy practised by
                    Spain towards her colonies was the main cause why this city remained for such a
                    length of time almost entirely unknown to Europeans. Apprehensive lest
                    commodities might be introduced into Peru by way of Buenos Ayres, and thus
                    prejudice the sale of the eargoes imported by the fleets which they sent to
                    Panama, the early traders solicited and obtained from the government the
                    prohibition of every kind of commerce by the Rio de la Plata. Those whom this
                    measure most nearly affected put in a strong remonstrance against it, and were
                    so far successful that, in 1602, permission was granted them to export for six
                    years, in two vessels belonging to themselves, and on their own account, a
                    certain quantity of flour, tallow, and jerked beef, but only to two ports. Upon
                    the expiration of the term an indefinite prolongation was soli- . cited, with an
                    extension to all kinds of merchandise, and liberty to trade also with other
                    ports. This application was vehemently opposed; but notwithstanding, in the year
                    1618, the inhabitants of the shores of the Rio de la Plata were authorized to
                    fit out two vessels, not exceeding one hundred tons burden each. Several other
                    vexatious restrictions were imposed on them; and, to prevent any traffic with
                    the interior of Peru, a custom-house was established at Cordova del Tucuman,
                    where a duty of fifty per cent, was levied upon all imports. This custom-house
                    was also designed to prevent the transmission of the precious metals from Peru
                    to Buenos Ayres, even in payment for mules fur- . nished by the latter city. By
                    an order of 1622 this permis- . sion was prolonged for an indefinite period;
                    and, with a view to promote the prosperity of the country, a royal audience was
                    established at Buenos Ayres in 1665.</p>
                <p>Under such a miserable system of policy, it is not surprising that the provinces
                    of the Rio de la Plata languished in indigence and obseurity. But the resources
                    of so extensive and fertile a territory could not remain for ever concealed. As
                    the population and wealth of the country increased, the continual remonstrances
                    of the people at last opened the eyes of the Spanish government to the
                    importance of the colony, and a relaxation took place in the system of
                    commercial monopoly, which had hitherto been rigorously adhered to. Indeed the
                    absurd restrictions had been followed by their natural consequence, smuggling;
                    and to such a height was the contraband trade carried, that, in order to put a
                    stop to it, the government of Castille gave permission to register ships to sail
                    under a license from the council of the Indies at any time of the year. The
                    flota which hitherto had embarked from Spain once a year, and was the only
                    legitimate means of communication with America, dwindled away from 15,000 to
                    2000 tons of shipping; and in 1748 it sailed for the last time to Cadiz, after
                    having carried on the trade of Spanish America for two centuries. The
                    register-ships now supplied the market with European commodities at a cheaper
                    rate and at all seasons of the year; and from that time Buenos Ayres gradually
                    rose into importance. Other relaxations in the mercantile system followed soon
                    afterwards. In the year 1774 a free trade was permitted between several of the
                    American ports; and this was subsequently followed by additional liberties.</p>
                <p>The improvements which took place in Buenos Ayres by this enlargement of its
                    commercial relations were frequently interrupted by circumstances which carry us
                    back to an early period of its history. The Spaniards and Portuguese have, by a
                    singular coincidence, been destined to be rivals, not only in the Old, but in
                    the New world. The neighbouring territory of Brazil belonged to Portugal, and
                    bitter hostilities frequently took place between the two countries. It is
                    computed that, in the hostile incursions which the Brazilians made into the
                    Spanish possessions in this quarter of America, they destroyed upwards of four
                    hundred towns and villages. These marauders, born of Portuguese, Dutch, French,
                    Italian, and Brazilian women, were called Mamelucos. Their principal object was
                    to carry into slavery the Indians whom the Jesuits had partially civilized; and
                    in exercising their inhuman trade they committed the most horrid enormities. It
                    is asserted, that in one hundred and thirty years two millions of Indians were
                    slain or carried into captivity by the Mamelueos of Brazil, and that more than
                    one thousand leagues of country, as far as the river Marañon, were almost
                    depopulated. It may well be believed that the settlements of the Rio de la Plata
                    did not escape the same cruel devastation. But it does not appear that the acts
                    of these marauders were authorized by the government which they professed to
                    obey; for repeated decrees were passed in favour of the oppressed Indians.
                    These, however, were seldom or never observed; and governors and others, who
                    profited by the captivity and sale of the native tribes, winked at the traffic.
                    But the rivalry and animosity of the Portuguese were productive of other evils
                    besides those consequent on hostile incursions. We have alluded to an extensive
                    contraband trade, originating, in the first instance, in the blind poliey of
                    Spain. This was chiefly carried on by the Portuguese, who were enabled, by means
                    of the immense and thinly-inhabited territory of the Banda Oriental, to organize
                    a system of smuggling which ultimately almost annihilated legitimate commerce.
                    But the government having gained over Artigas, one of the most daring of the
                    contrabandists, were at length enabled, with his assistance, to crush the
                    illicit trade, and to put an end to the atrocities which it had inflicted on the
                    country.</p>
                <p>In the year 1778, the provinces of the Rio de la Plata, Paraguay, Tucuman, Los
                    Chareos, and Chiquito, were erected into a viceroyalty, of which Buenos Ayres
                    was constituted the capital. At the same time it was thrown open to free trade
                    of every description, even with the interior of Peru; and such was the effect of
                    this wholesome measure, that the number of vessels trading with South America
                    was at onee augmented from fifteen to one hundred and seventy. They kept
                    gradually increasing from year to year; and, in 1796, sixty-three vessels from
                    Old Spain alone <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532362" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2362-0003"
                    />arrived in the single port of Buenos Ayres, with cargoes valued at nearly
                    three millions of piastres; and fifty-one sailed from it for the mother country,
                    fourteen to the Havannah, and eleven to the coast of Africa. The value of the
                    exports was about five millions and a half of piastres, including upwards of
                    four millions in gold and silver. During the war which broke out between Great
                    Britain and Spain, the trade of this colony suffered severely; indeed for a time
                    it was all but annihilated. Immense quantities of hides and other native
                    productions, pent up in the warehouses of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, were
                    allowed to rot, there being no outlet for them; whilst at the same time many
                    kinds of European goods rose to exorbitant, prices, or were not to be procured
                    at any cost. This situation of affairs afforded the people of the United States
                    of North America an opportunity of carrying on a contraband trade, by which the
                    inhabitants of the provinces of the Rio de la Plata were supplied with European
                    commodities; and this traffic was connived at by the Spanish government. The
                    fortune of war, however, in a few years placed Buenos Ayres for a short time in
                    the hands of the British, and an end was put to the trade with the great western
                    republic.</p>
                <p>In the year 1806, a British squadron, under the command of Sir Home Popham,
                    appeared in the Rio de la Plata. From this armament a body of troops was landed,
                    for the purpose of taking the capital. The British force was small, but, by the
                    culpable negligence of the viceroy, the Marquis de Sombre Monte, who does not
                    appeal· to have made any attempt to defend this important city, General
                    Beresford accomplished his object on the 26th of June. This rash and
                    unauthorized enterprise was fortunate in the first instance, but exceedingly
                    disastrous in its issue. The viceroy having retired to Cordova, Don Santiago
                    Liniers, a Frenchman in the service of Spain, put himself at the head of all the
                    troops he could collect on both banks of the Plata, and on the 12th of August
                    attacked the city at several points. So vigorous and successful was the assault,
                    that the British general and his troops were compelled to surrender themselves
                    prisoners of war. The disgraceful retreat of the viceroy having completely
                    alienated from him the esteem of those over whom he ruled, they accordingly
                    stripped him of his authority, and made the most strenuous efforts to obtain the
                    office for Liniers, but without success. He was covered with honours, but a new
                    viceroy arrived from Spain. Never was there a more favourable opportunity for
                    these provinces entirely throwing off the yoke of the mother country; but no
                    spirit of revolt existed in the country. The fact is, that, at the period of
                    this invasion, Spain nowhere possessed more faithful subjects than those who
                    peopled the banks of the Rio de la Plata. There cannot be a doubt, however, that
                    this successful repulse of an enemy common to both, taught the people of Buenos
                    Ayres “a deep lesson ;” and it ought to be regarded as the first step to that
                    revolution in which the power of Spain in America was completely overthrown.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, British reinforcements arrived from the Cape of Good Hope,
                    whence the original expedition had sailed; and Sir Home Popham, after making an
                    unsuccessful attempt on Monte Video, took Fort Maldonado, at the mouth of the
                    river Plata. But the intelligence of the first capture of Buenos Ayres was so
                    well received by the British public, that government resolved on maintaining
                    possession of the banks of the Plata; and an armament was therefore fitted out
                    for effectually reducing the country. The first body of troops, which were
                    commanded by Sir Samuel Auchmuty, enabled the British to undertake the conquest
                    of Monte Video, which was carried by storm in February 1807. In May following,
                    General Whitelocke arrived at the head of a formidable force; and about a month
                    afterwards these were joined by a further reinforce ment under General Crawford.
                    The army now amounted to 8000 men, and the chief command was confided to General
                    Whitelocke, a man destitute alike of courage and ability. The reduction of
                    Buenos Ayres was now resolved upon; but if the British had acquired sufficient
                    local and political knowledge of the coun!⅜y, they would never have attempted
                    the conquest of that city. The attacking army sailed up the river, and,
                    disembarking below the capital, marched towards it, but met with a reception
                    which was little anticipated. The inhabitants of Buenos Ayres had made every
                    preparation for a desperate resistance. The streets were intersected by deep
                    ditches, defended by cannon, and the windows and house-tops were thickly planted
                    with armed men. No sooner had the British troops begun to penetrate the streets
                    in columns, than they were assailed by grape and musketry, under which they
                    perished in great numbers, without being able to retaliate on the citizens. The
                    cool, determined valour of the troops, and the heroic energy of the leaders of
                    the several columns, were exerted in vain. About one third of the British army
                    was either killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, without any material advantage
                    having been gained. In these circumstances, it would have been madness to
                    persist in such a mode of operation; and next day an armistice was concluded. A
                    convention followed, the terms of which were, that the British should evacuate
                    the possessions on the Plata in two months, and that all prisoners taken on both
                    sides should be restored. By this capitulation, Monte Video, which might have
                    been safely maintained against any enemy, and which would have afforded a secure
                    dépôt for our manufactures, was alsö lost.</p>
                <p>But the events which were now passing on the continent of Europe were destined to
                    change completely the aspect of affairs in South America. The unprincipled
                    invasion of Spain by Napoleon in 1808 had placed that country in a situation
                    extremely critical. Ferdinand VII., in concert with the emperor, had intrigued
                    to wrest the sceptre from the feeble hands of his father; the French everywhere
                    overran the Peninsula, and numerous petty juntas were formed. These began to
                    extend their authority to the colonies, and despatched several mandates to the
                    New World, demanding implicit obedience to the resolutions which they contained.
                    As far as possible, the provinces of the Rio de la Plata conformed to their
                    dictates, and sent money and supplies of various kinds to repel the attempts of
                    the French, a nation peculiarly offensive to them.</p>
                <p>Whilst the public mind at Buenos Ayres was thus kept in a state of excitement by
                    the aggression of Napoleon, the transfer of the court of Lisbon to the Brazils
                    inspired the princess regent of Portugal with the ambition of establishing
                    herself in a similar manner at Buenos Ayres. Her father and her brother having
                    at Bayonne renounced their right to the crown of Spain, she despatched
                    emissaries to La Plata to assert her contingent claim, and to concert measures
                    for her residence in the capital. Her proposals were received with enthusiasm,
                    not only by the people, but also by the most influential persons of the country.
                    But when her projects were on the point of being crowned with success, they were
                    rendered abortive by the arrival, in May 1809, of the viceroy Cisneros, who,
                    having touched at Monte Video in ascending the river Plata, there concerted
                    measures with the governor-general, Elio, who, like himself, was a staunch
                    supporter of the rights of Ferdinand. In the mean time Napoleon, having turned
                    his attention to the colonies of Spain, had, like the princess already
                    mentioned, sent an emissary to Buenos Ayres to gain over the inhabitants.
                    Liniers, whom the course of events had brought prominently forward, is said to
                    have secretly favoured the interests of France; but he was deposed from all
                    authority, and banished to Cordova. In no instance was Napoleon successful in
                    seducing the American colonies from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2375-0004"/>Spam, although it is perfectly evident that the
                    doubtful nature of their allegiance, thus brought palpably before them, was well
                    calculated to afford a plausible pretext for their adopting measures to secure
                    their own individual independence, should circumstances hold out a well-grounded
                    hope of success. These were not long in arriving.</p>
                <p>Cisneros, the new viceroy, exerted himself to the utmost to fulfil the orders of
                    the court of Madrid, and to close the ports of the Plata against British
                    traders, who, in spite of reiterated prohibitions, continued to land their
                    goods. An intelligent native of the name of Don Mariano Moreno addressed a
                    pamphlet to the viceroy, demonstrating the necessity of re-modelling antiquated
                    institutions, no longer compatible with national prosperity. The enlightened
                    views of Moreno, though strongly opposed by the privileged merchants of Cadiz
                    and Buenos Ayres, were generally favoured by his countrymen, and the necessity
                    of a relaxation of the prohibitory system, as the only means of replenishing the
                    exhausted treasury, at length compelled the reluctant acquiescence of
                    Cisneros.</p>
                <p>From this period the principal supporters of the Princess Cariota changed their
                    views, and formed plans of ultimately setting up the standard of independence.
                    After some political struggles, they succeeded in deposing the viceroy, and, on
                    the 25th of May 1810, named <hi rend="italic">&amp; junta gubernativa,</hi>
                    composed of nine members, with Don Cornelio de Saavedra as their president, and
                    Dean Funes and Don Mariano Moreno as their secretaries.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Memoirs of General Miller, vol. i. p.
                    60.</p></note></p>
                <p>Moreno, the secretary, possessing a genius fitted for the times, became the life
                    and soul of the new government. As the eyes of the people in the provinces were
                    opened to the daring nature of the step which had been taken, the authority of
                    the junta became more and more circumscribed, and was soon reduced to the limits
                    of Buenos Ayres. Monte Video did not recognise it at all. As the port of this
                    city contained a naval dépôt, there were there concentred a greater number of
                    civil and military officers, who, being Spaniards, immediately took alarm, and
                    decisive measures were adopted to prevent the heresy from spreading beyond the
                    limits of Buenos Ayres, if not to crush it there. But the Creoles viewed the
                    matter very differently. They assembled at the municipality, and unanimously
                    resolved that it was expedient to join the party in the capital. But this wise
                    resolution was rendered abortive by the precaution of the governor, Elio, and by
                    the address and intrigue of an individual, Dr Obes by name, whose ambition was
                    the original cause of the misfortunes which befell the Banda Oriental. He
                    succeeded in drawing over many of his countrymen to his own views; and
                    ultimately an answer was transmitted to Buenos Ayres, the purport of which was,
                    that the Monte Videans could not give in their allegiance to an authority not
                    appointed in a legitimate way by the nation. But Moreno was nothing dismayed by
                    this intelligence, and his measures became more decisive as the emergency
                    increased. He succeeded in expelling the viceroy and the oidores from the
                    country; and had not the junta itself become infected by schism, such a man at
                    the head of affairs would have soon brought matters to an issue. It became
                    impossible for the junta to exist in its then disjointed state. Moreno and his
                    party withdrew; and he having accepted a mission to England, unfortunately died
                    on his passage.</p>
                <p>The people of Buenos Ayres having so far succeeded in establishing their
                    independence, considered themselves powerful enough to proselytize in the
                    provinces. A division of patriots under Ocampo was sent against Cordova, where a
                    formidable faction opposed to the new order of things had been organized by
                    Liniers; and this leader was taken prisoner and shot, along with several other
                    influential persons. Such severe measures, however, not harmonizing with the
                    moderate views of Saavedra and the junta, Ocampo was recalled, and the chief
                    command intrusted to Don Antonio de Balcarce. The history of La Plata is now for
                    some years closely interwoven with that of Upper Peru. In September 1811 the
                    junta gubernativa at Buenos Ayres was dissolved, and Saavedra the ex-president
                    compelled to fly. An executive was thereupon vested in the hands of a
                    triumvirate, Don Manuel Sarratea being its head. Monte Video still stoutly
                    maintained the sinking cause of Spain; the effort was unavailing. Twice the
                    soldiers of the fortress, in attacking the soldiers of Buenos Ayres, were driven
                    back. In one of these the noted Artigas displayed his characteristic heroism,
                    and at the head of his brave Gauchos performed prodigies of valour in the
                    patriot cause. But he had long displayed symptoms of insubordination. About this
                    period he withdrew from the command of Rondeau, and, in acting independently,
                    evinced ever afterwards great dislike to the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres. In
                    October 1812 another change was effected in the government, and in the January
                    following a sovereign constituent assembly was convened at Buenos Ayres. It was
                    not until now that the Spanish flag and cockade were abolished, and replaced by
                    the bicoor. Now also the coinage bore the republican arms. The assembly elected
                    an executive consisting of three individuals, and Don Carlos Alvear was chosen
                    president of the assembly. But this form of government was as short-lived as any
                    that had preceded it. On the 31 st of December 1813 it was abolished, and Señor
                    Posadas was elected supreme director of the republic, with a council of seven to
                    act along with him.</p>
                <p>Monte Video, which still held out for the mother country, was soon afterwards
                    taken, when between 5000 and 6000 royalist troops laid down their arms, and an
                    immense quantity of military stores was likewise given up. But the refractory
                    Artigas, who had assumed the title of chief of the Banda Oriental, demanded
                    possession of the place, which being refused, he in a short time took it by
                    force, and retained possession of the fortress until a Brazilian army ejected
                    him in the year 1817. The mutations and changes which the government of Buenos
                    Ayres underwent we need not follow; and the civil dissensions by which the
                    country was afflicted are equally endless and uninteresting. In 1816 a new
                    congress met at Tucuman, which named Pueyrrcdon director of the republic; in
                    July it declared the countries .on the Plata independent, and, having
                    transferred its sessions to Buenos Ayres, issued a declaration,<note

                    document describes the cruelties which the united provinces of the Rio de la
                    Plata, as well as other parts of America, had endured, whilst under the yoke of
                    Spain, and the motives which led them to shake it off.</p>
                <p>The republic now assumed the title of the United Provinces of South America, and
                    on the 3d of December 1817 it proclaimed a <hi rend="italic">reglamento
                    prow,sorio,</hi> as preliminary to a constitution. The congress chosen in
                    compliance with the <hi rend="italic">reglamenü)</hi> was opened in February
                    1819, and on the 25th of May the new constitution was published; but it
                    afterwards underwent many important changes. It was on the model of that of the
                    United States, and secured personal freedom and equality, liberty of conscience
                    and of the press, and the right of suffrage. The country, however, still
                    continued in a disturbed state, and these troubles were increased by the
                    intrigues of France and Austria to impose upon the natives of Buenos Ayres a
                    Bourbon or an Austrian prince; but the latter were happily defeated by the good
                    sense and patriotism of the people, notwithstanding the an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532388" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2388-0005"/>archy which had reduced them
                    to the brink of destruction. To enumerate the factions which successively got
                    the upper hand at Buenos Ayres, or to describe their various intrigues to
                    maintain themselves in power, would be to draw a most disgusting picture of the
                    reign of anarchy. Numerous successive governors seized upon office, and retained
                    it but for a few weeks, and in some instances for a still shorter period. These
                    rapid changes were generally preceded by sanguinary struggles, and followed by
                    banishments and proscriptions; but in no instance was confiscation of property
                    resorted to, so far had public opinion wrought an improvement. In October 1833
                    an attempt was made to effect a revolution in Buenos Ayres, and in June of the
                    year following the government resigned spontaneously. The internal provinces
                    were as usual the theatre of petty dissensions and skirmishes. In March 1835 the
                    chamber elected General Don Rosas governor and captain-general of the province
                    of Buenos Ayres for five years; giving him extraordinary powers, whilst he was
                    at liberty to resign whenever he might judge fit, and only restricting him in
                    one point, by obliging him to maintain and uphold the Catholic religion. The
                    peace of the republic was disturbed throughout the year by petty insurrections,
                    and by an attempt in the province of Tucuman to foment a revolution in favour of
                    the Unitarians; but it was completely put down, and during the year 1836 the
                    republic remained in a comparatively tranquil state. It is worthy of record,
                    that on the 4th of December Spain acknowledged the independence of La Plata, and
                    of all the other provinces in America which formerly belonged to her. Since
                    then, up to the present time (1838), no event of any moment has occurred, with
                    the exception of a declaration of war against Peru; but a peace was concluded
                    between the two powers before any blood was shed on either side.</p>
                <p>La Plata is situated between 20° and 38° or 39° of south latitude, and between
                    55° 36' and 7l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> of west longitude. Its extreme
                    length is about 1400 miles, and in breadth it varies from 500 to 800. It is
                    bounded on the north by Bolivia; on the east by Paraguay, Uruguay, and the
                    Atlantic Ocean; on the south by Patagonia and the Atlantic Ocean; and all along
                    its western limits, the lofty ranges of the Andes separate it from Chili. In the
                    northwest, the eastern declivities of the Andes project a considerable way
                    forwards, so that this district, which comprises the provinces of Salta,
                    Tucuman, Santiago, Mendoza, San Juan, Rioja, and Catamarca, is a high and rugged
                    tableland. All the rest of La Plata constitutes one continuous plain, perhaps
                    the most extensive and uniform in the whole world. The geology of this country
                    presents little variety, and almost nothing that is interesting. Rocks are
                    seldom seen, except in the mountainous region. Some gypsum occurs in the
                    vicinity of Buenos Ayres, and limestone is said to occur in several places. The
                    stones used in paving the streets, or in building, are brought from the island
                    of Martin Garcia, at the mouth of the Uruguay, or as ballast in vessels from
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Of the rivers, the principal is that which gives name to the region. The country,
                    however, is traversed by several other large streams, the general bearing of
                    which is to the south-east. Passing over the Pilcomayo, the Bermijo or Rio
                    Grande, and the Salado, which have been described in the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Paraguay</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Parana,</hi> the next in
                    importance is the Saladillo. The course and extent of this river are very
                    imperfectly known. It appears to rise in the mountainous parts of Cordova, and
                    after traversing the province of Buenos Ayres, it falls into the sea at Rosas,
                    in the bay of Samborombon. The Tercero, which also rises in the province of
                    Cordova, and falls into the Parana, has been proved to be navigable for barges
                    as high as the Pass of Fe-reira, about thirty leagues below the city of
                    Cordova.</p>
                <p>Considerable light has recently been thrown on the hydrography of the southern
                    portion of the Argentine Republic, by the publication of a journal kept by La
                    Cruz, a Chilian gentleman, who, in the year 1806, undertook the command of an
                    expedition which had for its object the discovery of a more direct means of
                    communication between the southern provinces of Chili and Buenos Ayres, than the
                    old one by Mendoza. An abridged account of the hydrographical facts which have
                    resulted from this expedition we shall give in the language of an able
                    writer.</p>
                <p>“As we retrace his (La Cruz’s) route, proceeding from east to west (from the
                    frontiers of Buenos Ayres towards the Andes), the first considerable body of
                    water which we meet with is the Desaguadero of the Diamante, in the middle of
                    the continent, fifteen leagues north of the lake in which it terminates, and
                    which is many leagues farther south than has been hitherto supposed. We next
                    find, at a very short distance, the Chadileubu, which rises in the cordillera of
                    Melalgué, and flows into the Desaguadero. Proceeding some leagues farther, we
                    come on the Cobuleubu, or Rio Colorado, making a bold circuit eastward through
                    the Pampas, as it descends from the Andes near Maule, before it turns southwards
                    to the sea. As we approach the Cordillera, we arrive at the Cudileubu and the
                    Neuquen, the latter receiving the Tocoman and Reingui-leubu, all considerable
                    rivers, the united waters of which, under the name of Mucum-leubu, flow
                    southwards into the Rio Negro. The Neuquen and Cobuleubu both appeared to him to
                    be navigable downwards from the place where he crossed them.</p>
                <p>“Respecting the Limayleubu, which La Cruz frequently made the object of his
                    inquiries, the accounts of the Indians were positive and distinct. All concurred
                    in stating it to be the greatest river with which they were acquainted on the
                    eastern side of the Andes; that it was nowhere fordable, and that it received
                    the Neuquen, Cudileubu, and all the other rivers of the Eastern Andes northwards
                    to the sources of the Rio Colorado. It issues, according to them, from a
                    beautiful lake called Alomini, of great size; for the cacique Manguel had
                    travelled a day and a half along its shores. It is situated between the
                    Cordilleras Miguen and Quenuco, and has an island in the middle of it. The river
                    Limayleubu is small at first, but is soon swelled by the accession of a great
                    many streams, of which the last in order, as named by the Indians, is the
                    Naguelguapi. This river springs, they said, not from a lake, but from a morass
                    of the same name. Besides the lake" Alomini, the Indian chiefs also knew a lake
                    called Guechulauguen, situated farther south, and the waters of which flow into
                    the Limayleubu.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>This account differs somewhat from those which were previously given by Falkner
                    the Jesuit and others, and which have found their way into all geographies, and
                    vitiated all maps, thus giving rise to extreme confusion. The conclusions to be
                    deduced from the statements of La Cruz we give in the language of the writer
                    just quoted.</p>
                <p>“Thus it appears to us to be clearly established that the main branch of the Rio
                    Negro rises in the lake Alomini, situated in the Cordilleras, east of Villarica;
                    and that, issuing thence under the name of Limayleubu, and being joined by
                    numerous streams, among others by the Naguelguapi, mentioned by Falkner, it soon
                    becomes a great river, of considerable width, and nowhere fordable. It
                    afterwards receives the Cariguenague, coming from the north, and lower down, the
                    Mucumleubu, itself a great river; the numerous tributaries to which were crossed
                    by La Cruz.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532401" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2401-0006"/>
                <p>The latter river is evidently the Sanguel, or Reed River of Falkner. These united
                    waters proceed southwards a short way, till, meeting the southern branch of the
                    Rio Negro, they turn eastward to the ocean.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Numerous rivers take their rise in the eastern declivities of the Andes, and,
                    after irrigating considerable tracts of country, are either absorbed by the soil
                    or flow into inland lakes. Amongst these may be mentioned the Rio Dolce, which
                    originates in the lofty mountains of Tucuman, and, after watering the capital of
                    the same name, passing near Santiago del Estero, capital of the province so
                    named, and traversing Cordova, is lost in a salt lake situated in that province,
                    and called “lagunas saladas de los Porongos.” Lakes are distributed over the
                    whole expanse of the Pampas, and some of them are of considerable size, one in
                    Entre Rios being one hundred miles in length; but they cannot be said to
                    correspond in grandeur to the other features of this region. The soil is almost
                    everywhere impregnated with fossil salt; and the water of most of the lakes and
                    pools is brackish and disagreeable to the taste. So plentifully is this saline
                    matter distributed, that whole tracts of country are covered with its
                    efflorescence. But a want of water is universally experienced; for,
                    notwithstanding the number of lakes and inferior rivers, many of them disappear
                    during the dry season. A growth of rushes overspreads their bottoms, serving as
                    lairs for the pumas, who lie in wait for the cattle that, perishing of thirst,
                    fly to the green stagnant water which lies on the marly surface, is as thick as
                    refuse oil, and swarms with myriads of mosquitos.</p>
                <p>The soil of this vast territory is a rich mould, perfectly free from stones, not
                    one being seen on its surface for many hundred miles together. Though an
                    uninteresting level, devoid of picturesque scenery, it is divided into regions
                    different in climate and in produce. On leaving Buenos Ayres, and proceeding in
                    a westerly direction, the first of these regions is covered for the space of 180
                    miles with clover and thistles, or artichokes; the second region, which extends
                    for 450 miles, produces grass; and the third, which reaches the base of the
                    cordillera, is a grove of low trees and shrubs. The first region varies in a
                    striking manner with the seasons of the year. In winter the leaves of the
                    thistles are large and luxuriant, and the whole surface of the country has the
                    rough appearance of a turnip field. The clover in this season is extremely rich
                    and strong, and amongst it the wild cattle graze at liberty. In spring the
                    clover disappears, the leaves of the thistles droop along the ground, and the
                    country has still the appearance of a rough crop of turnips. But in less than a
                    month the whole region becomes a luxuriant wood of thistles in full bloom, and
                    reaching ten or even eleven feet in height. Summer, however, is not over before
                    another change takes place. The thistles suddenly lose their verdure and sap,
                    their heads droop, the stems become black and dead, and being levelled by the
                    pampero or hurricane, they are rapidly decomposed, when the clover rushes up,
                    and all again becomes a sea of verdure. The second and third of these regions
                    present nearly the same appearance throughout the year; for the trees and shrubs
                    are evergreens, and the immense plain of grass only changes its colour from
                    green to brown. Not a weed is to be found throughout its vast extent; and over
                    its ever-verdant and luxuriant surface innumerable herds of cattle range at
                    large. The region of wood is equally remarkable. The trees are not crowded; but
                    in their growth such beautiful order is observed, that the traveller can gallop
                    between them in every direction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Rough Notes taken during some rapid journeys across the
                    Pampas and among the Andes. By Captain F. B. Head</p></note></p>
                <p>The tropical climate which prevails in the northern districts disappears more and
                    more towards the south, so that snow and ice are not unknown. Upon the east
                    coast the air is humid; rain, thunder, and violent storms are not unfrequent;
                    but in the western district the atmosphere is so free from vapour, that at
                    mid-day the planet Venus is often distinguishable in the heavens, and the
                    drought is so great that dead bodies are actually parched into mummies. The
                    climate of the Pampas is subject to a great difference of temperature in winter
                    and summer, although the gradual changes are very regular. The winter is about
                    as cold as November is in England, and the ground at sunrise is invariably
                    covered with white frost; but the ice is very thin. In summer the sun is
                    oppressively hot; and not only is manual labour suspended during the middle of
                    the day, but even the wild horses and cattle are exhausted by it. The only great
                    irregularity in the climate is the pampero, or south-west wind, which sweeps
                    these plains with a velocity and a violence which it is impossible to withstand.
                    These periodical visitations, however, produce beneficial effects, the weather
                    being particularly agreeable after they have exhausted their fury; and, taken as
                    a whole, the Pampas may be said to enjoy as beautiful and as salubrious an
                    atmosphere as the most healthy parts of Greece and Italy, and without being
                    subject to malaria. With regard to humidity, the atmosphere is not uniform at
                    places under the same latitude. In the provinces of Mendoza and San Luis, or in
                    the regions of wood and grass, the air is very dry, and there is no deposition
                    of dew at night. But in Buenos Ayres a considerable quantity of moisture
                    prevails in the atmosphere, probably from the vicinity of the place to the
                    ocean.</p>
                <p>The productions are gold and silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron (of which large
                    masses are often found), saltpetre, selenite (which is used instead of glass for
                    windows and lanthorns), marine salt, barrero (a loam impregnated with salt, and
                    greedily devoured by sheep and oxen); and there are also numerous mineral
                    springs, besides the saline lakes already mentioned, from which salt can be
                    procured. In some parts of La Plata there are wooded tracts consisting of palms,
                    cedars, and other trees; but from the Rio de la Plata to the Straits of
                    Magelhaens, as well as throughout the most part of the Pampas, we find neither
                    tree nor shrub. Of fruits there are sugar, vines, and others; of grains, wheat
                    and maize are especially cultivated; melons, pumpkins, beans, potatoes, and
                    vegetables of all sorts, are raised; as also rice, manioc, and a shrub
                    resembling aloe, from the fibres of which ropes and cordage are made; ricinus,
                    earth almonds, flax, hemp, rhubarb, indigo, vanilla, ipecacuanha, tobacco,
                    cotton; monkshood, with which the Indians poison their arrows; St John’s wort,
                    capaiva, and others.</p>
                <p>This country has long been celebrated for the abundance of its cattle, oxen,
                    horses, sheep, goats, asses, mules, and swine. The horses are both wild and
                    tame, and the number of them, as well as that of the cattle, is immense. The
                    inhabitants of the Pampas who superintend the herds are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gauchos,</hi> an account of whom will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Buenos Ayres.</hi> Amongst the wild animals may be mentioned
                    many species of large wild cats, the jaguar, cougar, chibi-guazo; puma, which
                    may be said to represent the lion in the new world; different kinds of
                    pole-cats, the zorillo, tajassu, tapir, armadillo, marten, wild dog, guanaco;
                    chameleon, sometimes of an enormous size; monkey, deer, hare, rabbit, elk,
                    rigua; many species of serpents, as the boa, rattlesnake, great waterserpent,
                    viper, adder; crocodile, mosquito, wasp, ant, and so on. Amongst the birds of
                    this country may be mentioned the white raven, the gold-coloured sparrow, the
                    partridge as large as a domestic fowl, the ostrich, pigeon, wild turkey goose,
                    and some others. There are seven kinds of bees <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532414" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2414-0007"/>of which several produce
                    honey that has a very considerable, and sometimes alarming effect, when taken in
                    large quantities. Of fish there are sea-bream and gold-fish; crawfish, perch,
                    shad; whales and seals, which yield train oil and fish-bone for exportation;
                    sharks, eighteen thousand of their skins being annually exported; and
                    turtles.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants present the same national diversities here as in the other states
                    of South America. Their number has been variously cstimated at from half a
                    million to nearly three millions; a sufficient proof of the uncertainty which
                    prevails regarding the exact amount of the population of La Plata. In the Weimar
                    Almanack for 1838 they are stated at 2,024,995, viz. Creoles of Spanish descent,
                    600,000; Mestizoes, 600,000; Indians, “fideles,” 800,000; negroes, 25,000. Of
                    aboriginal Indians there are numerous nations; but, as will be seen, the whole
                    do not comprise a population at all commensurate with the varieties of distinct
                    tribes. The Indians of the Pampas are said not to exceed eight or ten thousand
                    souls.</p>
                <p>La Plata consists of the following provinces, most of which have a capital city
                    of the same name: Buenos Ayres, Cordova, Entre Rios, Corrientes, Catamarca,
                    Mendoza or Cuyo, Rioja, Salta, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, San Juan, San
                    Luis, Tucuman, and Tarija. Missioncs is sometimes reckoned a province of La
                    Plata, but it now belongs to Paraguay. Buenos Ayres, the capital, having already
                    been described, we shall pass on to the other provinces.</p>
                <p>Cordova is bounded on the north by Santiago, on the south by the Indian territory
                    and Buenos Ayres, on the east by Santa Fe, and on the west by San Luis. It
                    extends about 110 leagues from north to south, and about the same distance from
                    east to west. This is a fine province, the soil being rich and fertile, and well
                    irrigated. It is pretty thickly set with trees, possesses excellent pasturage,
                    and abounds in fine clover. Cordova, the capital of the province, is
                    picturesquely situated in a deep valley, beside a river surrounded by mountains,
                    in lat. 31. 15. south, long. 62. 40. west. It was founded in 1573, and became a
                    place of considerable importance in the time of the Jesuits. In 1804 and 1810
                    attempts were made to render the river Tercero, which passes near Cordova,
                    navigable from this point to its junction with the Parana; but the commerce of
                    the country was too limited, labour too dear, and overland carriage too easy and
                    cheap, to render this an eligible speculation, so that the attempt was
                    abandoned. The population of the whole province has been estimated at
                    315,000.</p>
                <p>Entre Rios is situated between the two great rivers Parana and Uruguay, and is
                    bounded on the north by the province of Corrientes, and on the south by Buenos
                    Ayres. It possesses several peculiar advantages, and is one of the most fertile
                    and pleasing provinces in the whole republic. Embraced on all sides but one by
                    the two great rivers just named, it is easily accessible by shipping; and being
                    thus insulated, it is protected from the incursions of the Indians. It is
                    copiously irrigated, and the soil is distinguished for its fertility. Wood is
                    abundant, but small in size. The pastures are extensive; but the wild cattle,
                    which formerly abounded, are much reduced in number. There are two small towns
                    in the province, each of which is dignified with the name of city; one is
                    Badaja, opposite to Santa Fe, on the Parana, the other is Villa del Arroyo de la
                    China, on the Uruguay. Farther south, and nearer to Buenos Ayres, there are two
                    other towns, called respectively Gualeguay and Gualeguaychu, but they are still
                    smaller than the two former. The great natural advantages of Entre Rios must
                    ultimately raise it into a place of considerable importance. At present the
                    population is computed at 105,000.</p>
                <p>Corrientes is situated to the north of Entre Rios, and forms a continuation of
                    that province, being also situated between the rivers Parana and Uruguay. On the
                    north it is bounded by the state of Paraguay. It has an average breadth of about
                    two hundred miles, and its length may exceed that, though the boundary line
                    between it and Entre Rios has not been laid down with accuracy. The territory of
                    Corrientes is intersected by several rivers, some of which are navigable for a
                    considerable distance. Besides the celebrated lake Ybera, there are in the
                    province numerous sheets of water, by which it is rendered one of the most
                    fertile countries on the face of the globe. Corrientes, the capital, is
                    admirably situated on the banks of the Parana, near its junction with the
                    Paraguay. It is a very ancient city, but the population is inconsiderable. That
                    of the whole province is estimated at 140,000.</p>
                <p>Santa Fe is situated between the river Parana and Cordova, which constitute its
                    boundaries on the east and the west. On the south it is bounded by Buenos Ayres,
                    and on the north by Santiago del Ostero. This fertile country is irrigated by
                    numerous rivers, some of which are of considerable size. The chief employment of
                    the inhabitants consists in the breeding of vicumras and horses, the skins of
                    which animals are conveyed to Buenos Ayres. Santa Fe, the capital, is situated
                    on the western part of the Parana, at about eighty leagues from Buenos Ayres,
                    and has risen to importance by becoming a dépôt for goods on the river. The
                    inhabitants of the town amount to about 4000, and those of the province to about
                    52,500.</p>
                <p>San Luis is bounded on the east by the provinces of Buenos Ayres and Santa Fe, on
                    the west by Mendoza, on the south by the territory of the Pampas Indians, and on
                    the north by Cordova. This province is reckoned about a hundred leagues in
                    extent from north to south, and from fifty to sixty in breadth from east to
                    west. The soil is uniformly productive, and the climate is salubrious, but the
                    inhabitants are very indolent, and agriculture is not pursued to any extent. San
                    Luis, the capital, is a very ancient town, and the only place of any importance
                    in the journey between Buenos Ayres and Mendoza. It is situated in a fertile
                    valley at the foot of a range of hills, and the entrance to it is through long
                    lanes, having dead mud-walls on either side. The population of the town has been
                    estimated at 15,000, and that of the province at 103,000.</p>
                <p>Mendoza or Cuyo is a well-irrigated and fertile plain, bounded on the east by San
                    Luis, on the west by the cordillera of the Andes, on the north by San Juan, and
                    on the south by the Indian territory. From north to south it extends about a
                    hundred and fifty leagues, and from east to west rather more than a hundred
                    leagues. The inhabitants of this province are very industrious, and they raise
                    wheat and maize for exportation. Their chief occupation, however, is the
                    cultivation of vines and clover grass. A considerable quantity of wine is made,
                    in which article an extensive trade is carried on, and also in brandy and dried
                    fruits. One of the most productive branches of commerce is the transport of maté
                    to the various provinces of the republic. Mendoza, the capital of the province,
                    is a large town, situated in an extensive and well-cultivated plain at the foot
                    of the Andes, between 32° and 33° of south latitude. Its most remarkable feature
                    is a fine <hi rend="italic">alameda,</hi> or public promenade, of great length
                    and beauty. The town covers a considerable space of ground, as there is
                    generally a vineyard, orchard, and garden attached to every house. The
                    population of the city is estimated at 16,000. There are several other towns of
                    some note, such as San Carlos, to the south, in the valley of Uco; Coricoto, to
                    the east; and another in the same direction, eleven leagues from the city,
                    called Los Barriales. Over the whole country there are numerous establishments
                    and farms for breeding cattle and prosecuting various agricultural operations.
                    The population of the entire province may be estimated at 103,335.</p>
                <p>San Juan is situated to the north of Mendoza, extending <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532427" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2427-0008"/>about a hundred and twenty
                    leagues from north to south, and about the same distance from west to east,
                    terminating, like Mendoza, at the foot of the Andes. The country is remarkably
                    fertile, producing wheat, maize, olives, and vines, in abundance. The produce of
                    the olive plantations is much esteemed in Buenos Ayres; but the natives direct
                    their attention chiefly to the cultivation of the vine, which grows luxuriantly,
                    and to the making of wines and brandies, which they export in large quantities
                    as far as Potosi, Buenos Ayres, Santa Fe, and a great portion of the eastern
                    side of the Rio de la Plata. The city of San Juan, situated in latitude 31. 15.
                    south, and longitude 68. 35. west, was founded as early as 1560, and is
                    consequently one of the most ancient places in the republic. It is now
                    considered as the town which most closely follows Buenos Ayres in the march of
                    social reform. The mines of gold and silver which were said to enrich this
                    province have never yet been discovered. The population of the city of San Juan
                    is estimated at 19,000, that of the whole province at 103,330.</p>
                <p>Rioja is situated to the north of San Juan, and also at the foot of the Andes. It
                    is about one hundred and forty leagues in length, by nearly the same in breadth.
                    Like the other provinces in this region, it is a mountainous tableland; and it
                    shares with Mendoza and San Juan in the growth of vines, wheat, and maize.
                    Rioja, the capital, is a small and unimportant city, situated in latitude 28.30.
                    south, and longitude 68. 35. west, two hundred and ninety leagues from Buenos
                    Ayres. It contains about 3000 inhabitants; and the population of the entire
                    province is reckoned at 87,500 souls.</p>
                <p>Catamarca is a tract of country extending about one hundred leagues in length and
                    nearly as much in breadth. It is situated near the foot of the Andes, under the
                    twenty-eighth degree of south latitude, and is bounded by Tucuman and Salta on
                    the north and east, by the Andes on the west, and by Rioja on the south. It
                    consists of a mountainous table-land, but is noted for an extensive and fruitful
                    valley, called the Valley of Catamarca. The temperature of this district is of
                    the most genial description, and the country produces cotton of a very superior
                    quality. The city of Catamarca is situated about sixty leagues south-east of
                    Tucuman, in latitude 27. 45. south, and longitude 66. 0. west. It was founded
                    more than a century and a half ago, and stands in the beautiful valley which
                    bears its name. It contains about five thousand inhabitants. The other towns in
                    this province are unimportant. The population of the whole province is estimated
                    at 105,000 souls.</p>
                <p>Tucuman, one of die most important and fertile provinces in the republic, is
                    situated in the twenty-seventh degree of south latitude, having Salta on the
                    north, and Santiago on the south and south-west, and extending fifty-eight
                    leagues from north to south, and about fifty leagues from east to west. The rice
                    which is called <hi rend="italic">de castilla</hi> grows here in abundance, and
                    is of a very superior quality. The other productions are, wheat, maize, ground
                    pistachio-nuts, and tobacco, of which thousands of bales are exported to
                    Cordova, San Luis, San Juan, Mendoza, and other cities. Fruits of various sorts
                    are abundant; and potatoes here attain an enormous size. To the west of the city
                    is a delightful mountain, of great height, from which sixteen rivers descend to
                    fertilize and beautify the surrounding territory. These streams unite and form
                    the river Santiago del Estero. Along all the lower parts of this mountain are
                    immense clusters of trees, and amongst them many of bitter oranges. The city is
                    surrounded by these woody tracts, which occupy a space of fifteen leagues. The
                    trees sometimes attain an extraordinary size, and the timber is of the best
                    quality used in America. Tucuman, the capital of the province, is a straggling
                    city, situated in 26. 5Ò. of south latitude, and 64. 35. of west longitude. The
                    houses in ge neral are of an inferior description; but the place is memorable
                    from its having taken a distinguished part in the revolutionary struggle. The
                    inhabitants, who amount to ten or twelve thousand, are described as hospitable,
                    honourable in their dealings, of a mild disposition, and much inclined to
                    labour. The other towns are Monteros, Suares, Chiqui-ligasta, Rio Chico Francas,
                    and Burroyaco, each of which constitutes a large parish, at the same time that
                    it contains minor parishes. The population of the whole province is estimated at
                    140,000 souls.</p>
                <p>Salta is situated to the north of Tucuman, and is of considerable extent. Its
                    western part belongs to the great range of the Cordilleras, and is rich in
                    metals. Here are found gold and silver, copper, iron of various qualities,
                    sulphur, alum, vitriol; and there are also indications of the existence of tin
                    and quicksilver. Many branches of mountains, off-shoots from the colossal chain
                    of the Andes, extend into the province, from which proceed pleasant and
                    beautiful valleys, intersected by numerous streams which irrigate and fertilize
                    the country. In one of the intervals between the low collateral branches of the
                    Andes is situated the capital. To the eastward of the city the country becomes
                    flat, and continues so to the borders of the Bermijo and Parana. The city of
                    Salta, the capital of the province, is situated in lat. 24. 15. south, and long.
                    64. 0. west, on the great road leading from Buenos Ayres to Lima by the way of
                    Potosi. It was founded in 1582, and has long been a place of some consideration
                    in this thinly-peopled region. The population amounts to about 9000 souls. The
                    other towns in the province are Caldeva, Rosania de la Frontera, Rosario de
                    SerriIIos, Chicona, Atua, and a few small villages. The population of the whole
                    province is estimated at 140,000 souls.</p>
                <p>Santiago del Estero is situated between Tucuman and Cordova, being south of the
                    former and north of the latter. It is of great extent in all directions, and is
                    one of the most fertile of these provinces. Agriculture is the chief occupation
                    of the inhabitants of Santiago. Wheat produces eighty fold, and it requires
                    little or no aid from art to raise this heavy crop. All kinds of grain may here
                    be brought to perfection, yet the inhabitants are slow to avail themselves of
                    the advantages presented by nature. The city of Santiago, situated on the road
                    to Bolivia through Cordova, in 27. 55. south latitude, and 63. 20. west
                    longitude, is thinly peopled, and of little importance. The river Santiago runs
                    close past it in its course to the great lake by which its waters are absorbed.
                    The population of the whole province is estimated at 210,000 souls. This
                    province, along with those of Tucuman and Cordova, are all bounded on the east
                    by that vast territory called Grand Chaco, extending hence to the river Parana.
                    It is the native country of the Abipones, and once contained 2,000,000 of
                    aboriginal inhabitants. The Spaniards formed several establishments here, but
                    their cruelties drew down upon them the vengeance of the Indians, who effected
                    their extirpation. The inhabitants of the Grand Chaco, although now very much
                    reduced in number, still retain their independence.</p>
                <p>Tarija is the most northerly province in the Argentine Republic, and consequently
                    borders upon Bolivia, to which it in reality belongs, although politically it
                    forms one of the provinces of the Rio de la Plata. It consists of a succession
                    of charming valleys, with a delightful climate and a fruitful soil. Corn, maize,
                    the yerba-maté of Paraguay, the cocoa, flax, and every necessary of life, are
                    produced here in the greatest abundance. No part of America indeed seems to be
                    superior to this district of Tarija; and the reason why it is so little known
                    is, that, possessing no mineral treasures, and being inhabited merely by an
                    agricultural people, the Spanish authorities never deemed it worthy of the
                    slightest attention. To the south-east of this province lies Jujuy, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193532440" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2440-0009"/> which, in the
                    event of Tarija being permanently united with Bolivia, will be erected into a
                    province of the Argentine Republic; indeed some recent writers reckon it such
                    already. It is of much the same character as Tarija, having a very prolific
                    soil, and producing abundance of similar productions. There are some mines of
                    gold in this territory, but they have not been worked to advantage. The city of
                    Jujuy lies on the road from Buenos Ayres to Upper Peru, and is a very old place.
                    The whole district contains from 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Don Juan de Rosas was in 1835 appointed dictator of the republic for five years.
                    There are four principal ministers, one for each of the foreign, home, finance,
                    and war departments. The state religion is the Roman Catholic, which is under
                    the direction of four bishops. The Jesuits, who nearly three fourths of a
                    century ago were expelled from this and other parts of South America, have been
                    allowed to return.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the country, the state of education, and its moral aspect
                    generally, will be found described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Buenos
                    Ayres.</hi></p>
                <p>According to official accounts from Buenos Ayres, the finances stood thus on the
                    7th of April 1836: Income, 11,727,446 dollars; expenditure, 8,439,165 dollars;
                    surplus, 3,288,281 dollars. On account of the public debt, 7,747,000 dollars
                    fall to be deducted, thereby giving rise to a deficiency, which was covered by
                    the sale of 1200 leagues of the states land. It appears, however, that these
                    accounts are little to be depended upon; for, according to the budget for 1837,
                    the income was 12,000,000 dollars, and the expenditure 18,315,124 dollars, thus
                    making a deficit of more than 6,000,000 of dollars. To cover these deficiencies,
                    and wipe out the accumulated debt, it is proposed to obtain a native loan of
                    17,000,000 dollars. Altogether, the accumulated debt of the Argentine Republic
                    amounts to 42,000,000 dollars.</p>
                <p>The constitution of this federal republic has not yet been completely organized.
                    The head state, tb,e seat of the congress or legislative assembly, is Buenos
                    Ayrés. The number of senators amounts to forty-eight, and that of deputies to
                    eighty-eight. The states are all at liberty to manage their own affairs, each
                    having a governor, with subordinate functionaries. In all of them the principle
                    of democracy is recognised, but practically it is more acted upon in some states
                    than in others. Where the governor has great influence, either from his wealth
                    or from other circumstances, he is frequently found to evince a distaste for
                    legislative control. Occasionally, indeed, they openly avow themselves absolute;
                    and as Buenos Ayres can exercise but a feeble authority over those provinces
                    which are situated far in the interior, they are not always called to a strict
                    account of their stewardship.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, it may be observed, that ths union of the provinces forming this
                    republic is far from being perfect. They exercise too much individual
                    independence, and are too jealous of each other, and of the capital in
                    particular, heartily to entertain common views for the general good. They are as
                    yet but weakly cemented together, and a long period will elapse before they are
                    fused into one homogeneous mass. This is no doubt in part owing to their being
                    spread over a vast extent of country; but, when communication between distant
                    parts becomes more easy and frequent, which it will be when the rivers are
                    rendered properly navigable, so as to facilitate commerce, then a more complete
                    amalgamation of the whole may confidently be anticipated. <hi rend="smallcaps"
