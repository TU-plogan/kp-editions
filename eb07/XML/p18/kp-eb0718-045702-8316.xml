                <p><label type="entry">PORTO-SEGURO</label>, a large tract of country in Brazil,
                    situated to the north of Rio and Espiritu-Santo. It was formerly reckoned a
                    province of itself, but at the new provincial division of the country in 1829,
                    it was formed into a comarca of Bahia. Along with Espiritu-Santo, it forms one
                    continuous tract·, presenting such a sameness of natural features, that they
                    have generally been described together. It is separated from Rio de Janeiro on
                    the south, by the river Capabuan or Itabupuana. On the west it borders on Minas
                    Seraes; the river Belmonte separates it from Bahia on the north, whilst its
                    eastern limits are washed by the Atlantic ocean. It has a sea-coast of four
                    hundred miles in length; and the maritime district is the only part of the
                    country as yet peopled by Europeans, or their mixed descendants. “The lofty and
                    naked ridge of middle Brazil,” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538329"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8329-0458"/>says Prince Maximilian, “in the provinces of Minas
                    Geraes, Goyaz, and Pernambuco, is divided from the eastern coast, by a broad
                    tract of high forests, which extend from Rio de Janeiro to the Bay of All-Saints
                    (Bahia) about eleven degrees of latitude, and which are not yet taken possession
                    of by the Portuguese settlers; only a few roads have hitherto been opened, with
                    infinite labour, along the rivers that traverse them. In these forests, where
                    the primitive inhabitants, who are pressed upon at every other point, have till
                    now enjoyed a serene and peaceful abode, we may still find those people in their
                    original state.” In fact the aborigines of Espiritu-Santo and Porto Seguro have
                    been found more difficult to civilize than any other native tribes in this
                    quarter of the world, and the country itself is still in a great measure
                    uncultivated. The civilized people are wholly confined to the coast, and even
                    there they are not perfectly secure from hostile attacks. Yet the salubrity of
                    the climate, and the fertility of the soil, have rendered this district an
                    object of interest with government, so that settlers have been induced to occupy
                    it. The virgin forests with which it is nearly covered, abound with the finest
                    timber, including the cedar, the sassafras tree, and various other resinous and
                    aromatic species; and no province possesses such an abundance of the tree which
                    supplies the Peruvian balsam. “In the provinces of Espiritu-Santo and
                    Porto-Seguro,” says a recent traveller, “are found several kinds of wood suited
                    to cabinet-work and architecture. The Ibirapitanga (Brazil wood) now so
                    necessary in manufactures, and which is beginning to fail in Pernambuco, is met
                    with here,” and, we may add, on the authority of others, in abundance.</p>
                <p>Between the southern limits of the country and the Rio Doce, which separates
                    Espiritu-Santo from Porto Seguro, are situated several towns and villages, and a
                    few military posts, to secure the settlers from the inroads of the savages.
                    About twenty miles north oftheItabnpuana, on the southern bank of the river
                    Itapemirim is a village of the same name, more recently built than the others,
                    and containing some good houses. The inhabitants, who are but few in number,
                    carry on a small trade in sugar, cotton, rice, millet, and timber. The Sera de
                    Itapemirim, from which the river descends, is celebrated for the works for
                    washing gold, called Minas de Castello, five days journey up the Itapemirim.
                    From this place to the frontier of Minas Geraes, a road has been opened through
                    the dangerous wilderness of woods; but it is hazardous to travel along it on
                    account of the savage hordes of Puries and Botucudoes, by which the country is
                    infested. From the village of Itapemirim to the village of Nova de Benevente,
                    the countrypresents alternate woods and meadows, with a stream at intervals, but
                    no river of any size. Benevente stands at the foot of a hill on the northern
                    bank of the Iritiba or Reritigba, called also the Benevente. This place was
                    built by the Jesuits, who here collected a great number of Indians for the
                    purpose of civilizing them; but the hard labour exacted by the crown drove most
                    of them to other quarters. This was the largest establishment on the coast, and
                    the church and convent erected by the missionaries are still seen in the
                    neighbourhood of the town. Between Benevente and the Rio de Espiritu Santo,
                    which gives name to the province, the country is one continuous and magnificent
                    forest, abounding with multitudes of the feathered tribes. The river Espiritu
                    Santo, which is of considerable magnitude at its mouth, rises in the mountains
                    on the frontiers of Minas Geraes, and descending with many windings, through the
                    extensive ancient forests of the Ta-puyas, issues forth at the foot of one of
                    those higher chains of mountains which stretch towards the sea. According to
                    Cazel, the proper name of this river is the Santa Marta. It is stated to be
                    navigable to the first fall, about forty miles up, and the tide ascends twelve
                    miles to the Serra, a river which joins it on the left. Villa Velha, a small and
                    unimportant town, stands on the south bank of the river, not far from its mouth;
                    and about half a league from it, on the opposite side of the bay, is the present
                    capital of Espiritu-Santo, called Villa da Victoria. It is built, according to
                    Cazal, on an amphitheatrical site, on the western side of an island fifteen
                    miles in circumference. It is a pretty neat place, with considerable buildings,
                    constructed in the old Portuguese style. The population of this city is
                    estimated at 12,500.</p>
                <p>From this town to the Rio Doce, the limits of Espiritu-Santo on the north, there
                    are several rivers and small towns; but generally speaking, not only the
                    interior but the seacoast is densely wooded. This province comprehends
                    three-fourths of the captaincy, which, in the year 1534, was assigned to Vasco
                    Fernando Coutinho, as a remuneration for his services in Asia. The Portuguese
                    were repeatedly driven from the colony by the natives, but ultimately they
                    obtained a decisive victory over the savages, and effected a permanent
                    settlement. The Jesuits were the first who succeeded in making peace with the
                    aborigines, and in 1551 they founded the college of Vittoria; but, as we have
                    observed, they made little progress in this quarter.</p>
                <p>The adjoining comarca of Porto Seguro extends from the Rio Doce to the river
                    Belmonte. It lies between 19° 33' and 15° 25' of south latitude, which gives it
                    a length of sixty-five leagues. It was upon this part of the coast that Cabral
                    first set foot, and took possession of Brazil for the crown of Portugal. Some
                    Portuguese having settled here, they intermarried with the natives, so that
                    Pedro Campo Tourinho, its first donatory, found himself, in a few years, the
                    lord of a tolerably well-peopled colony. Santa Cruza town, built on the bay
                    where Cabral cast anchor, soon became considerable and flourished; but the
                    settlement was afterwards transferred to the banks of the Ioâo de Tyba, four
                    miles to the northward, no doubt from this site holding out greater advantages
                    of soil. Besides this place, Tourinho founded the town of St. Amaro, three miles
                    to the south of Porto Seguro, which was subsequently demolished by some of the
                    Indian tribes. After passing through various hands, this captaincy ultimately
                    reverted to the crown in 1758. It was then in a very wretched state, and
                    contained only two towns. The Jesuits, with all their zeal, were able to effect
                    but little, and at the time of their expulsion, they left only two aldeias
                    entirely Indian. As early as 1553, they founded a college in the capital, with a
                    view to prosecute their labours amongst the Indians of the province, but, as in
                    the case of Espiritu-Santo, with very little success.</p>
                <p>The Rio Doce, or sweet river, the most considerable stream between Rio and Bahia,
                    has its origin in the mountains of Minas Geraes, and assumes the name which it
                    bears after the confluence of the Rio Piranga with the Ribeiro do Carmo. It runs
                    through a considerable tract of country, forming several falls in its course.
                    The banks of this river are covered with thick forests, which are the haunt of a
                    great number of different animals. But far more formidable than all those beasts
                    of prey, and the terror of these forests, is the savage Botucudo, the original
                    inhabitant of the country. Some stations have, from time to time, been formed on
                    the beautiful banks of the Doce; but they have never thriven, from being liable
                    to attacks by the savages, so that the country is still very thinly peopled, and
                    no communication is kept up except along the river. From the banks of the Rio
                    Doce to the St. Matthaeus, a dreary uninhabited wilderness extends along the
                    coast. Indeed, for more than a hundred miles the maritime district is a very
                    flat tract of country; the dull monotony which it presents being only here and
                    there relieved by a sheet of water, or small mountain elevation. The district of
                    St. Matthaeus contains about 3000 inhabitants, who cultivate a great deal of
                    mandioc, and export annually 60,000 alquieres of flour, and also planks from the
                    neighbouring forests. The orange, the lemon, and the water-melon, flourish here
                    luxuriantly.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538342" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8342-0459"/>
                <p>The river St. Matthaeus, originally called the Cricare, like the other large
                    streams in this quarter, rises in the mountains of Minas Geraes, and descends
                    through ancient forests peopled by savage tribes, forming various falls, and
                    receiving several rivers in its course. Cazal mentions the large stream of
                    Cotache as joining it on the left margin. Nearly thirty miles from the St.
                    Matthaeus is the Mucuri, at the mouth of which stands the Villa de St. Joze do
                    Portalegre. This place has of late years risen into some importance, from the
                    opening of a road along the banks of the river, to Villa do Principe in Minas
                    Geraes. Almost all the fine species of wood found on the eastern coast of
                    Brazil, abound in the forests of this district. Five leagues to the north of the
                    Mucuri, is the river Peruhipe, four miles from the mouth of which is the town of
                    Villa Vicoa, consisting of about one hundred houses, with a church and camara,
                    pleasantly situated amongst groves of cocoa palms. The inhabitants carry on a
                    trade in mandioc flour, which is exported in small coasting vessels. Ten miles
                    farther north is Caravellao, situated on a river of the same name, about five or
                    six miles from the sea. The river is two miles in breadth, and proportionally
                    deep; and up to the town its banks are beautifully interspersed with
                    plantations. Caravellao is bustling and populous, and carries on a brisk trade
                    in the productions of the country, especially mandioc flour, large quantities of
                    which are annually exported. The port is much frequented by vessels from
                    Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio, and the other towns on the east coast.</p>
                <p>Porto Seguro, the capital of the comarca, is situated at the mouth of the river
                    Buranhem, in lat. 16° <hi rend="italic">40'</hi> south, and long. 40° 12'west.
                    The port, which has given name both to the town and the district, is formed by a
                    ledge of rocks which runs out for about a mile from an extended point of the
                    main, in a direction parallel to the land, presenting a natural mole. This town
                    is less considerable than Caravellao, but may contain a population of about 3000
                    souls. The upper part of it lies on an elevated ridge, but the major portion of
                    the inhabitants are established on the declivity nearer the river, a place more
                    advantageous for carrying on trade. A third part of the town lies close to the
                    mouth of the river. There is little agricultural industry displayed in this
                    country, the greater part of the farina consumed being brought from Santa Cruz.
                    This, with salt fish, constitutes the chief subsistence of the inhabitants.
                    About eighteen miles north of Porto Seguro, is the town of Santa Cruz, already
                    mentioned. It is smaller and less important than the capital, although once in a
                    flourishing condition. Some attention, however, is paid here to agriculture; and
                    farina is exported to various parts of the coast. The most northerly town of
                    Porto Seguro is the Villa de Belmonte, situated on the Rio Grande de Belmonte,
                    which falls into the sea in latitude 15° 40' south. This town was originally an
                    aldeia of christianised Indians, but few of them now remain, and the place has
                    sunk into decay. The whole population of Espiritu Santo, has been reckoned at
                    74,000; that of Porto Seguro is probably not more. But a great part of the
                    country is still in complete possession of several Indian tribes, amongst which
                    the Botucudes, the remains of the once formidable Aymores, are the most
                    conspicuous.</p>
