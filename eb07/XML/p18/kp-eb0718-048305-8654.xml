                    <hi rend="italic">body an</hi> individual point, where, for most purposes, the
                    whole weight may be conceived to reside; and they have called it the <hi
                    rend="italic">centre of gravity.</hi> The learned Englishman, however, believed
                    himself the first to accomplish a demonstration from the nature of gravity.
                    (Scholium to Prop. xv. <hi rend="italic">De Centro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gravitatis.)</hi></p>
                <p>But the same point is admirably connected with other properties and contingencies
                    of the body than its weight; and hence different names have been considered as
                    preferable by many writers, such as <hi rend="italic">centre of inertia·,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>And from viewing a body as composed of physical points, it is found that the
                    relation of this centre to their positions is fertile in some of the most
                    beautiful theorems in the mathematics; whence it has properly received the
                    geometrical designation of the <hi rend="italic">centre of position.</hi></p>
                <p>We here introduce it in this geometrical character; and shall demonstrate very
                    briefly, but we trust sufficiently, a collection ofelegant and most important
                    properties,ofwhich some are virtually proved elsewhere, in a manner more suited
                    to the direct object of their introduction.</p>
                <p>If there be any multitude of distinct points in space, it is clear that a plane
                    may move, parallel to any given plane, until the collective distances of the
                    points on one side of it be equal to those on the other.</p>
                <p>Let a plane thus situated, relatively to a system of points, be called a plane of
                    equidistance.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538667" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8667-0484"/>
                <p>Suppose two planes of equidistance, A and B, perpendi cular to each other. Then,
                    first, we shall find that any plane C which passes through their common section
                    or axis, is also a plane of equidistance to the same system of points. For, let
                    any plane, perpendicular to this axis in 0, cut the planes A, B, C, in the
                    straight lines Aα, BZ&gt;, <hi rend="italic">Cc,</hi> respectively. Then <hi
                    rend="italic">Åa</hi> and B6 are at right angles. Let a perpendicular from any
                    point of the system meet the plane ABC in <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> Draw <hi
                    rend="italic">pq</hi> at right angles to <hi rend="italic">Cc,</hi> and let it
                    be positive when on the same side of the plane C as AO. Also draw <hi
                    rend="italic">ρr</hi> perpendicular to B6, and meeting Cc in s; and let <hi
                    rend="italic">pr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> be positive when on the same
                    sides of the planes B and C respectively as AO. The triangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρqs</hi> being given in species, <hi rend="italic">pq</hi> is as <hi
                    rend="italic">ps,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">aspr-∖-rs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> so that the sum of the <hi rend="italic">ρq</hi> is as the
                    sum of the <hi rend="italic">pr</hi> together with that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rs.</hi></p>
                <p>But the <hi rend="italic">ρr</hi> are the distances of the points of the system
                    from the plane B, which is a plane of equidistance; and therefore their
                    aggregate is nothing. And again, the <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> are as the rO,
                    which are the distances from the plane A; and, having different signs on the two
                    sides, their aggregate is also nothing. Thus the sum of thejuç is nothing; and
                    the plane C is a plane of equidistance.</p>
                <p>Now let 0 move along the axis to make ABC a plane of equidistance. Then shall any
                    plane K which passes through 0 be such a plane.</p>
                <p>For let the plane K cut ABC in the line <hi rend="italic">Cc.</hi> The plane ABC,
                    and the plane C, which cuts it perpendicularly in the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cc,</hi> are planes of equidistance; therefore, by what we have just proved,
                    the plane K which passes through their common axis <hi rend="italic">Cc</hi> is
                    also a plane of equidistance. Thus, to every system of points, there is a point
                    through which every plane is a plane of equidistance. And there cannot be more
                    than one. For if there were two, we might have through them two parallel planes
                    of equidistance, which is manifestly absurd.</p>
                <p>This single point has been called the centre of position.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 1. The difference of the centre of position from any
                    given plane is an average of the distances of the several points of the system;
                    the distances on different sides being distinguished by contrary signs.</p>
                <p>For conceive the parallel plane of equidistance, at the distance D from the given
                    plane. Let the distance of a point of the system from the given plane be denoted
                    by D +&lt;Z. Then <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will vary its sign according as the
                    point of the system and the given plane be on different sides of the plane of
                    equidistance, or on the same side.</p>
                <p>Now if there be <hi rend="italic">p</hi> points in the system, the aggregate of
                    their distances from the given plane will be pD, together with the aggregate of
                    the <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> But the collective <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are
                    nothing; so that it will be ∕&gt;D; or D is the average distance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 2. If the average distances of the points of a sys
                    tem from three planes, perpendicular or inclined to each other, be given, the
                    centre of position is given. For, by the distances of a point from three such
                    planes, its position in space is given.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 3. If the centre of position, and the multitude of
                    points in each of two systems be given , the centre of the united systems is
                    found in the straight line joining the given centres at distances from these
                    reciprocally proportional to the multitudes.</p>
                <p>Let P and Q be the centres of position of two systems of <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> points respectively. Let perpendiculars from P and
                    Q meet any plane of equidistance in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> respectively.</p>
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">p.~PaJ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q Qb</hi> expresses the collective distances of the points of the
                    united systems from the plane of equidistance, consequently the two terms are of
                    opposite signs and equal magnitude.</p>
                <p>And because Pα and Q6 are perpendicular to the same plane, they are parallel: so
                    that Pα, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">bQ,</hi> are in one plane.
                    Let 0 be the intersection of PQ and <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi> Then PO and OQ
                    are as Pα and Q6; and since <hi rend="italic">p . l</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">a-q .</hi> Qó, we have also <hi

                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus every plane of equidistance passes through the same point 0, which is
                    therefore the centre of position.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scholium.</hi> Hence, if we have any points A, B, C, D,
                    &amp;c., bisecting AB in Μ, or making AM=⅛AB; again, making MN to NC as 1 to 2,
                    or MN=⅜MC; and NO to OD as 1 to 3, or NO-— ND, and so on: Then Μ is the centre
                    of position of the two points A and B; N of the three points A, B, C; 0 of the
                    four points A, B, C, D, and so on. And as we have proved that there cannot be
                    more than one centre of position to the same system of points, the ultimate
                    point must be the same in whatever order we take the given points into the
                    operation.</p>

                    the centre of position from the extremities of any straight line is an average
                    of the difference of the squares of the several points of a system from these
                    extremities.</p>
                <p>Let SO be the straight line; A a point of a system whose centre of position is G;

                    the number of points.</p>

                    For as it begins without any motion perpendicular to this direction, the

                    bodies upon each other, (whether by impulsion, attraction, impact, or leverage,)
                    are equal and contrary; so that the aggregate motion, and consequently the
