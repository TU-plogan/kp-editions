                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    terminating in a pointât the vertex; or it is a solid figure, consisting of
                    several triangles, the bases of which are all in the same plane, and have one
                    common vertex.</p>
                <p>Pyramid is also applied to a colossal structure, corresponding in form to the
                    geometrical definition of the solid, and remarkable not only for its magnitude
                    and antiquity, but likewise for the mystery which still overshadows the object
                    contemplated in its construction.</p>
                <p>The number of pyramids scattered over Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia or Meroë, is
                    very great indeed; but by faith e most remarkable are those of Djizch, Sakhara,
                    and Dashour, on a plain to the north of Cairo, in Egypt. The first of these
                    places, which is situated on the western bank of the Nile, and nearly in the
                    latitude of Cairo, is distinguished above the others by possessing the three
                    principal pyramids mentioned by Herodotus, and still justly numbered amongst the
                    wonders of human art.</p>
                <p>The largest of these pyramids, which goes by the name of Cheops (a Greek
                    corruption of the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">Kobts</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Copts},</hi> stands on an elevation upwards of 150 feet above the subjacent
                    plain, and rises to an altitude above the base of about 498 English feet. It is
                    ascended by an uninterrupted series of steps, diminishing from four feet to two
                    and a half in height, as the structure narrows towards the vertex. The breadth
                    of each step is equal toits height Upon the top there is a platform thirty-two
                    feet square, consisting of nine blocks of stone, whereon travellers of all ages
                    and nations have inscribed their <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> names in&lt;
                    their respective languages. This pyramid was explored; first by our.
                    countryman<pb break="no" facs="nls:193542073" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2073-0746"/> Mr
                    Davidgon in 1763, and afterwards with still greater success by Captain Caviglia
                    in 1817. A full account of the adventurous explorations of each will be found in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi> vol. viii. p. 547 <hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">seq.</hi> of the present work. In all of the pyramids
                    the entrances are in the north front, and the descending passages slope at an
                    angle of twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees. This line seems to be nearly
                    directed to the pole, and hence the northern face of the pyramid is almost in
                    the plane of the earth’s equator; a circumstance which goes far to show that the
                    passages in question were intended for the purpose of astronomical
                    observation.</p>
                <p>The second pyramid, called .that of Cephrenes, is stated by Denon'to have a base
                    655 feet each side, and to be 398 feet in height. The pyramids are supposed to
                    have been all coated or cased with stucco made of gypsum and flint; and in fact
                    forty feet of coating still adhere to that of Cephrenes. But the great pyramid
                    has no appearance of having been touched in this way; and on that of Cephrenes
                    the coating was probably never completed, as no indications of it were
                    discovered on removing the sand from its base. In 1816, Belzoni discovered the
                    entrance in the north front of the second pyramid. Advancing along a narrow
                    passage, he found that it terminated in a chamber at the centre of the pyramid,
                    cut out of the solid rock, the dimensions of which he ascertained to be
                    forty-six feet in length, sixteen in breadth, and nearly twenty-four feet in
                    height. This chamber contained a sarcophagus of the finest granite, half sunk in
                    the floor, with the lid drawn to one side and broken, and within were bones,
                    supposed to be those of a bull, mixed with rubbish. An Arabic inscription on the
                    wall proved that it had been explored by the curious of a former age. The
                    dimensions of the pyramid were ascertained to be, the base 684 feet each side,
                    the perpendicular height 456 feet, and the coating from the top to where it
                    terminates 140 feet. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ubi supra?)</hi></p>
                <p>The third pyramid, situated beyond that of Cephrenes, and called by the name of
                    Mycerinus, appears to have been cased with granite, at least fragments of that
                    material were found amongst the rubbish. But it still remains to be opened by
                    some future traveller, Belzoni, with all his enterprise, having failed in the
                    attempt. It is only 280 feet at the base, and 162 in height; and beyond it there
                    is another of still smaller dimensions, having its summit crowned by one large
                    block of stone, as if for a pedestal. The stability of these enormous piles was
                    increased by the stones having been so fixed as to slope inwards, and the
                    perfection of the adjustment may be inferred from this, that not one of them has
                    yet swerved from its position. The structures raised by the ancient Egyptians
                    were intended to last for ever.</p>
                <p>The pyramids of Sakhara are three miles south of those of Djizch, and the
                    pyramids of Dashour are beyond those of Sakhara, whilst more of brick or of
                    stone are scattered over the plain, intermixed with the excavations, cemeteries,
                    and fragments of statues or edifices, which mark out the site of the second
                    capital of the Pharaohs. Some of them are rounded at the top, and resemble
                    hillocks cased with stone. One has steps like that of Cheops, the ranges, six in
                    number, being twenty-five feet in height and eleven feet in width; and the total
                    height is 150 feet. There is another, built also with steps or . ranges, and not
                    much inferior in altitude to that of Cheops. The stones of these pyramids are
                    much decayed, and gradually crumbling into dust, evidently from great age. One
                    of them is built of unburned bricks, containing shells, gravel, and chopped
                    straw, and is altogether in a very mouldering state.</p>
                <p>For some notices of the various opinions stated by travellers as to the purposes
                    for which these extraordinary structures are supposed to have been intended, the
                    reader is again referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt</hi> in this
                    work. The bones found in the chamber of the pyramid of Cephrenes, not to mention
                    other circumstances, seem to have some connection with the worship of the sacred
                    bull Apis; and besides, from the care with which the entrances appear to have
                    been concealed, it is not impossible that there may yet be many undiscovered
                    chambers, both in the pyramid of&gt; Cheops and in that of Cephrenes. It is very
                    remarkable, too, that not a single sculpture or hieroglyph has been discovered
                    in any pyramid which modern enterprise and research have yet explored. <hi
