                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> birth of Plato is nearly coincident with that great
                    epoch of Grecian history, the commencement of the Peloponnesian war. In the
                    first year of that war, the Athenians, having ejected the unhappy people of
                    Aegina, apportioned the island amongst colonists from themselves.<note

                    Amongst these Athenian occupants were Aristo, and Pe-rictione. or Potona, as she
                    is also called, the father and motner of Plato. Their residence, however, in the
                    island was not permanent nor even long, as the intrusive colony was in its turn
                    ejected by the Lacedaemonians, on which occasion his parents returned to
                    Athens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diog. Laert. in

                <p>From these circumstances, it has been commonly supposed that Plato was born in
                    Aegina. They are not, however, sufficient to establish such a conclusion. For a
                    colonization of the kind here described did not necessarily imply residence on
                    the part of those persons to whom the lands were allotted.<note anchored="true"

                    of the recovery of the island by the Lacedaemonians from the hands of the
                    Athenians, mentioned by the contemporary historian. Aegina was still in the
                    occupation of the Athenians in the fifth year of the Peloponnesian war;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. iii. 72.</p></note>
                    and in the eighth year of the war we find that the poor exiles, who had
                    meanwhile obtained a refuge at Thyrea, were there cruelly exterminated by the
                    Athenians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iv. 56,
                    57.</p></note> On the whole, it seems more probable, from the constant
                    designation of Plato as “the Athenian,” without any other addition, though this
                    alone, it must be allowed, is not decisive of the fact, that Athens itself may
                    claim the honour of having been his birthplace.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that his proper name was not that which his fame has
                    immortalized, but Aristocles, after his paternal grandfather.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristocles was also a Spartan

                    who was his master in the exercises of the gymnasium, as characteristic of his
                    athletic frame in his youth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    broad forehead; others, as characteristic of his style of eloquence.</p></note>
                    In this way, being familiarly applied to him, it gradually prevailed, to the
                    entire disuse of his family name.</p>
                <p>The philosopher was connected by descent with the ancient worthies of Athens; on
                    his mother’s side with Solon, and on his father’s with the patriot king

                    is shewn to have been of rank, from its connection with some of “the Thirty,”

                    a divine founder, in the person of the god Neptune.</p>
                <p>A circumstance is related of his infancy, which, though obviously fabulous,
                    cannot properly be omitted in his biography, as a pleasing and appropriate
                    tribute of the imaginative genius of the Greeks to their poet-philosopher.
                    Whilst he was sleeping when a babe, on Mount Hymettus, in a bower of myrtles,
                    during the performance of a sacrifice by his parents to the muses and nymphs,
                    bees, it is said, lighted on him and dropped honey on his lips, thus giving an
                    evident augury of that peculiar sweetness of style by which his eloquence would
                    be distinguished.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>∏

                <p>For the same reason, a similar fancy, which has thrown a poetical ornament over
                    the account of his first devotion to philosophy, must not be passed over in
                    silence. Socrates, it is related, was apprized beforehand, in a dream, of the
                    first visit of the gifted pupil, who was destined to carry philosophy forth on
                    the wings of his genius to its boldest flights. Socrates was telling his dream
                    to some persons around him, how he seemed to see a young swan coming from an
                    altar in the grove of Academus, and first nestling in his bosom, then soaring up
                    on high, and singing sweetly as it rose in the air, when Aristo presented
                    himself, leading his son Plato, whom he committed to the instruction of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193532466" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2466-0011"/> sage. Socrates,
                    it is added, struck by the coincidence, immediately recognized the fulfilment of
                    his dream, and welcomed Plato as the young swan from the altar, represented to
                    him in the vision.</p>
                <p>The accounts of his early education, to which we should naturally have looked
                    with great interest, are extremely meagre. We only know by general notices that
                    he passed through the usual course of education adopted amongst the higher
                    classes of the Greeks. That education was directed to the cultivation at once of
                    the powers of the mind and of the body, under the two great divisions of
                    literature and gymnastics. The youth was delivered to the charge of the
                    grammarian, the teacher of music, and the trainer. From the grammarian he
                    learned the art of reading and writing his own language, and a knowledge of its
                    authors, especially its poets; from the teacher of music, skill in performing on
                    the lyre and the flute, together with the principles of the science of music;
                    from the trainer he acquired strength and expertness in the several exercises of
                    wrestling, and boxing, and running, by which it was intended not only to mature
                    the powers of the body, but to qualify the youth for attaining eminence at the
                    public games. These were the schoolmasters of the accomplished Athenian, and
                    with these he was occupied until he had reached about his twentieth year.
                    Accordingly, the names have been transmitted to us of those who discharged these
                    offices for Plato; of Dionysius, as the grammarian under whom he learned the
                    elements of that command over his own language, and its literary resources,
                    which his matured eloquence so richly displayed; of Draco of Athens, and
                    Metellus of Agrigentum, as his masters in music; and of Aristo the Argive, as
                    his master in gymnastics. It is added that he also studied painting; but the
                    name has not been given of any individual who acted as his preceptor in the
                    art.</p>
                <p>In evidence of his great proficiency in these early studies, it has been stated,
                    that he gave specimens of his genius in every department of poetical
                    composition; that in epic poetry he laboured after the highest excellence, and
                    only abandoned the attempt on comparing his efforts with the poems of Homer, and
                    despairing of reaching so high a standard; that in dramatic poetry, he had
                    prepared a tetralogy, the four plays usually required of an author in order to
                    competing for the prize at the festival of Bacchus, but changed his purpose only
                    the day before the exhibition, in consequence of impressions received from
                    Socrates. And even in gymnastics excellence has been claimed for him; since it
                    has been asserted that he actually entered the lists at the Isthmian games.</p>
                <p>Whatever credit we may give to these particulars, there can be no doubt, that so
                    inquisitive a mind as that of Plato, and so resolute a spirit in the prosecution
                    of its undertakings, received the full benefit of this preliminary culture; and
                    that he was thus amply prepared for entering on the severer discipline of those
                    pursuits which engaged him when he became a hearer of Socrates.</p>
                <p>This preliminary education, in fact, was very imperfect as a discipline of the
                    mind. It gave the youth a forwardness and fluency of knowledge, so that he was
                    fain to fancy himself, when he had scarcely attained manhood, equal to undertake
                    affairs of state, and to serve the highest offices of the government. But it did
                    not form his mind or character. He had yet to learn the nature of man; to study
                    the principles of ethics and politics. This task of instruction devolved on the
                    sophist or the philosopher (as the same person was at first indifferently
                    called), into whose hands the Greek youth was now delivered.</p>
                <p>Plato, accordingly, at the age of twenty years, began to be a regular attendant
                    on the lessons of Socrates. The reputation of Socrates as a teacher in this
                    higher walk of education, now eclipsed that of all other professors of
                    philosophy. He had at once exposed the incompetence of the sophists who preceded
                    him, and superseded them in their office. Plato would be conducted to him by his
                    father, as the account states he was, very much in the way which is depicted
                    under caricature by the comic poet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Aristoph. <hi rend="italic">Nubes.</hi></p></note> as to the
                    most distinguished master of the day, to be qualified for taking on him those
                    public duties to which every citizen of Athens might be called; to enable him to
                    distinguish himself in counsel and argument, and obtain influence and importance
                    in society. From the numbers that resorted to Socrates, as well as to the
                    sophists before him, it is plain that, to obtain instruction in philosophy for
                    its own sake, or to become philosophers themselves, was not the object with
                    which he was sought by the generality. Here and there the spark fell on a
                    kindred genius, and lighted up a flame of philosophy in the breast of a
                    disciple. Thus from the school of Socrates came the founders of several other
                    schools; and, .on the whole, a greater impulse was given by his teaching to the
                    study of philosophy than had ever been felt before in Greece. Still, as Socrates
                    himself did not profess to teach his hearers wisdom, so neither did they in
                    general come to him as learners of wisdom, or as actuated by the pure love of
                    wisdom, but to acquire practical information which their previous studies had
                    not given them. We may imagine such a disciple as Plato first presenting himself
                    amongst the multitude of hearers; how he would be struck by the first
                    observation of the extraordinary manner of Socrates, especially at finding the
                    very person to whom he came to be taught professing that “he knew nothing ;” and
                    that he was only wiser than other men on this account, that, whilst others knew
                    not and presumed they knew, he neither knew nor presumed that he knew. The
                    interest of such a mind as Plato’s could not but be powerfully called forth by
                    so strange an avowal on the part of a man whom he had been led to look up to as
                    the wisest of men. To him it must naturally have prompted the questions, what
                    philosophy might be; what the nature and condition of man; what the criteria of
                    truth and falsehood; and thus have firmly laid hold of those tendencies to
                    speculation which we see fully developed in the mature fruits of his genius.
                    Again and again he is present at the searching investigations carried on in the
                    discussions of which Socrates is the leader; soon he is himself interrogated by
                    Socrates; and we cannot doubt that he is thenceforward irrevocably become, not
                    the disciple of Socrates only, but the disciple and votary of philosophy.</p>
                <p>That Plato was thus won over to philosophy from an early period of his life, is
                    evident from the statement of Aristotle respecting him, that “from his youth he
                    had been conversant with Cratylus, and the opinions of Heraclitus,”<note

                    dialogues (and these supposed to be the earliest in the date of their
                    composition, as written indeed during the lifetime of Socrates), the <hi

                    acquaintance with Pythagorean notions.</p>
                <p>There seems, too, but little room to doubt that he had begun at the same time to
                    study the doctrines of the Ionic school under Hermogenes, as well as those of
                    Parmenides and Zeno. For what he puts into the mouth of Socrates in the <hi

                    outset of his studies, in the conclusions of the school, of which Anaxagoras was

                    here, as in the instance of Anaxagoras, we are disposed to think, depicting, in
                    the person of Socrates, a portion of the history of his own mind.</p>
                <p>Judging indeed from the tenor of his writings, we should conclude that his
                    curiosity was excited, from a very early period, to explore the whole field of
                    philosophy; and that, so far from resting on what he learned from Socrates
                    himself, he applied the lessons of Socrates to the extending and perfecting
                    those researches which he was carrying on at the same time, by means of books,
                    or oral instruction from others.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This evident early devotion of Plato to the pursuit of his
                    whole life, argues the mere calumny of that statement which represents him to
                    have at first sought his fortune by the profession of arms. The calumny is a
                    current one, which has been applied to other philosophers. He has also been
                    absurdly represented as present at the battles of Tanagra and Delium, when he
                    was, in truth, a mere child.</p></note> Socrates was to him the interpreter, and
                    commentator, and critic, of the various philosophical studies in which he was
                    engaged. For this is the view which he has given us of Socrates in his
                    Dialogues. Socrates there seldom or never appears as a didactic expounder of
                    truth. He is presented as the critic of opinions and doctrines and systems, and
                    the judge to whom everything is to be submitted for approval, or rejection, or
                    modification, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>Indeed, so exuberant and energetic a mind could not have been satisfied with
                    being simply a learner in any school. It would eagerly seek the means of
                    comparing system with system, and of examining into points of agreement or
                    disagreement in the theories proposed. The doubts raised by Socrates, the hints
                    thrown out by him, the conclusions to which he pointed, but which he yet left
                    unconcluded, would to such a mind seem as so many points of departure for its
                    own excursions. They naturally suggest that much more must be done than merely
                    to take up what has been said by Socrates, in order to work out, or even rightly
                    to conceive, what had fallen from his lips. For the conversations of Socrates
                    were not framed to convey positive instruction, so much as to set the mind of
                    the hearer a-thinking, and to provoke further inquiry. In the living pictures of
                    them which Plato has drawn, they leave off just at the point where we expect the
                    teacher would proceed to speak out more distinctly, and tell us precisely what
                    his view of the subject is. If these pictures represent (as we may reasonably
                    believe they do) the impressions received by Plato from the conversations of
                    Socrates, what stimulants to inquiry must he have felt in the several
                    particulars which he has so forcibly touched,—in the mingled lights and shadows
                    of the scenes in which the great master occupies the foreground. Well therefore
                    may we conceive that, at the time when he enjoyed the guidance, and control, and
                    encouragement of Socrates, he was laying a broad foundation of erudition for
                    that vast and richly-ornamented fabric of philosophy which the existing
                    monuments of his genius exhibit.</p>
                <p>From Soerates himself this demand of the inquisitive hearer could evidently not
                    be supplied. Socrates was deficient in erudition properly so called. He had
                    studied men rather than books. His wisdom consisted of deep and extensive
                    observation accurately generalized, drawn from passing things, and capable
                    accordingly of ready application to the same course of things; forcibly
                    convincing his hearers by the point and propriety with which it met each
                    occasion, and giving experimental proof of its soundness and truth. Erudition,
                    accordingly, was to be sought elsewhere; and Plato therefore supplied this need
                    from other sources, infusing it into, and blending it with his own speculations,
                    whilst the Socratic spirit mellows the whole mass, and gives unity to the
                    composition.</p>
                <p>The death of Socrates, his tears over which Plato has recorded in that
                    affectionate and interesting memorial of his master’s truth and dignity, the
                    Dialogue of the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> naturally excited alarms for
                    their own safety amongst those who were conspicuous disciples of the martyred
                    sage. They saw, by the violent extremity to which the spirit of intolerance had
                    proceeded, unchecked by any feeling of humanity or regard for truth, that the
                    wisdom, and gentleness, and benevolence of an enlightened philosophy were no
                    securities against the deadly hatred of bigotry. They found that the malignant
                    tongue of priestcraft could stoop to employ any instrument, however mean, for
                    the accomplishment of its purpose; that it could instigate the actor on the
                    scene of civil affairs to do its work of sycophancy, whilst the prompter of the
                    mischief, lurking in ambuscade, wore the mask of concern for the public good,
                    and even arrogated the merit of sanctity, and truth, and tenderness. Persecution
                    has ever been the same. Its essential features are vices of the human heart, not
                    of any particular system of religion. We find it, accordingly, in several
                    recorded instances in the heathen world, displaying itself very nearly as in the
                    dark times of anti-Christian corruption. Athens itself had already furnished
                    examples of its untiring and sure vengeance. In particular, the case of
                    Anaxagoras had been a striking illustration. When not even the power and the
                    eloquence of Pericles could save Anaxagoras from a prison, and expulsion from
                    Athens, on account of his physical speculations; the very philosopher whose
                    system of physics raised an insuperable barrier against atheism, by
                    demonstrating the supremacy of mind; it was but too evident that there was a
                    mysterious agency working in the heart of society, like secret fires in the
                    depths of the earth, capable of awing and paralyzing every other power.</p>
                <p>A more recent experience of the same truth, within the memory of the youngest
                    disciple of Socrates, was in the dark proceedings consequent on the mutilation
                    of the Hermae, the rude images of Mercury erected in the vestibules of private
                    houses as well as in the sacred places of Athens, and on the discovery of the
                    profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries by the mock representation of them in
                    private houses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    Dialogue on Laws, x. p. 117.</p></note> The secret information on which those
                    proceedings were carried on; the indifference shewn at the period of alarm to
                    everything else, even on an occasion of great public interest, but the
                    vindication of the popular superstition; the effect which the charge of being
                    implicated in these outrages had in checking the career of Alcibiades at the
                    moment of his triumph over his political opponents; all shewed, that it was a
                    vain hope to resist the secret arbiters of public opinion on questions of
                    religion. Then came the fearful consummation of this vengeance in the death of
                    Socrates by the poisoned cup; leaving no doubt in the minds of any, that they
                    who would follow his example in boldly and honestly inquiring into current
                    opinions, and declaring their convictions of the truth on matters affecting the
                    conduct of men, must either prepare themselves for exile (which alone was a
                    great punishment in the ancient world),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Socrates himself had the courage to take the latter part of the alternative. To
                    him it was the natural termination of that energetic course which he had from
                    the first adopted. He would have unsaid all his teaching; he would have
                    practically recanted the strong language in which he had, through all his life,
                    been discoursing of the worthlessness of the body and of the present life, and
                    of the immortality and perfection of the soul. His philosophy kept him immured
                    in his prison, and riveted the fetters on his limbs, far more than the
                    condemnation of his judges or the hammer of the jailor. For, as he says of
                    himself in the words in which Plato has naturally expressed his sentiments in
                    the prison, his “sinews and bones would long ago have been at Megara or in
                    Boeotia,” had he not thought it “best,” and firmly fixed his resolution, to
                    abide the issue there.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>But this was not the case with the hearers of Socrates. They were not, like him,
                    placed in a commanding post, from which they could not retreat without being
                    stigmatized as deserters of their profession, and betrayers of the truth. They
                    might with honour and propriety consult for their safety. Whilst, therefore, as
                    is probable, the bulk of those who had attended on the teaching of Socrates
                    simply withdrew from public notice, and retired to their homes at Athens or
                    elsewhere, the principal disciples of the school, —those who were most known as
                    followers and admirers of Socrates,—left Athens, and sought an asylum for
                    themselves and for philosophy at Megara.</p>
                <p>Amongst those whom Socrates drew around him were several individuals of mature
                    age, already trained in some sect of philosophy, and eminent in their own walk
                    of science, yet desirous of availing themselves of the far-famed wisdom of the
                    sage of Athens. Of this class was the philosopher Euclid, from whom the Megaric
                    school derives its existence and celebrity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>'Euclid the mathematician flourished about a century after
                    him.</p></note> As a disciple he belonged to the Eleatic school, and, trained by
                    Zeno, the great master of dialectic before him, had made that science his
                    especial study. He had shewn a singular zeal in attending on the lessons of
                    Socrates; for he continued to go to Athens for that purpose, even when the
                    obnoxious decree of exclusion against Megareans, on pain of death, had been
                    passed by the Athenians; setting out at night-fall on a journey of more than
                    twenty miles from Megara to Athens, and assuming the disguise of female attire
                    that he might pass unnoticed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    vi. 10.</p></note> His conduct on the occasion of the dispersion of the school
                    of Socrates corresponded with this zeal. He received the members of the school
                    with open arms, and gave them a home with him at Megara. There, for a time at
                    least, they gathered themselves, in shelter from the storm which had driven them
                    from Athens. But the school, in fact, was broken up. It had subsisted and been
                    held together by the personal influence of Socrates himself, and with him its
                    principle of vitality, as a body, was gone. He had not laboured to establish a
                    sect or a theory; and he left therefore no particular rallying point, or symbol
                    of union, around which a party might be formed. He was himself the symbol of
                    union to his disciples; bringing together around him the professors and
                    disciples of every different sect. There was yet to arise out of his society one
                    who, richly imbued with his doctrine and method, should rekindle the extinct
                    school with his own spirit, and bid it live again in its genuine offspring; and
                    that individual was Plato. But the times were not yet ripe for this.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Plato was destined to spend severa! years in journeying from
                    place to place, at a distance from the past and the future scene of his
                    philosophical labours. These were doubtless years of great importance to him,
                    for the perfect formation of the peculiar character of his philosophy. In the
                    course of them, we find him visiting Megara, Cyrene, the Greek settlements on
                    the coast of Italy, Sicily, Egypt, “exploring (as Cicero says of him in
                    oratorical language) the remotest lands,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Pythagoras, and other wise men before him, who had enlarged their minds by
                    contemplations pursued in foreign travel. Thus did he singularly combine in his
                    studies the more ancient with the Socratic mode of philosophizing. The method of
                    Socrates was exclusively domestic. He studied mankind within a small compass
                    (the circle of Athens itself), only with a more accurate and searching eye than
                    any one had ever done before him; and therefore drew sound general conclusions
                    from his observations within that range of view. He evidently judged it better
                    thus to restrict the attention, and require men to investigate closely what lay
                    before them, than to encourage them to indulge the prevailing habit of more
                    diffusive and vague observation. This is told us in other words by Plato
                    himself, where he introduces Socrates as a stranger even to the beautiful
                    scenery in the immediate neighbourhood of Athens, and as one who appeared never
                    to have been out of the walls of the city; and as owning that, in his fondness
                    for study, he was content to learn of the men in the city, who could teach him
                    what the fields and the trees could not.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a corrective of desultory and superficial habits of thought and study, was not
                    sufficient for the requirements of Plato’s mind. He observes in one of his works
                    that there is much to be gained from contemplation rightly directed in foreign
                    travel both by land and sea; that we are not only to look to our own country for
                    examples, but seek in the world at large for specimens of the highest order of
                    men, which, though rare, might, from time to time, be found under every form of
                    government; and that no perfect civilization can be attained without this means

                <p>Having sojourned for a time at Megara, together with the other disciples of
                    Socrates, and probably there, with the assistance of Euclid, increased his
                    acquaintance with the writings of Parmenides and Zeno, as well as studied more
                    intimately the dialectic of their school, he appears to have proceeded to
                    Cyrene. Cyrene was the home, not only of Aristippus, to whose school it
                    afterwards gave its name; but of the venerable Theodorus, the most eminent
                    geometrician of his day. Theodorus had been occasionally a resident at Athens,
                    and an attendant on the teaching of Socrates, whilst he was himself resorted to
                    by the Athenian youth for instruction in the science of geometry.<note

                    His skill in geometry, in particular, requires no other evidence than the
                    interesting fact of his ready solution, in that infant state of the science, of
                    the oracular problem which required the doubling of the cubic altar at

                <p>The course of his travels conducted him to the Greek settlements on the coast of
                    Italy and Sicily, where the colleges of the Pythagoreans were established. It
                    may readily be imagined with what eager curiosity Plato undertook this voyage,
                    what delight he promised himself in seeing the place itself where Pythagoras had
                    taught, and in personal conference with the living successors of the mystic
                    sage, and in obtaining a greater insight into the doctrines of a school which
                    had such charms for him. He had much to observe also in the peculiar discipline
                    by which the Pythagoreans were formed into a distinct fraternity amongst
                    themselves. Greece Proper had nothing to exhibit like this. For though the
                    different sects of philosophy were distinguished there by the names of founders
                    and places, they were not held together by any rules of discipline. But the
                    Pythagoreans at Tarentum, Crotona, and elsewhere in Magna Graecia, had
                    incorporated themselves into synedria, or colleges; each individual giving his
                    property in common, and regarding the bond of connection with his brethren of
                    the sect as closer than the ties of kindred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    anomalies even to the philosophical Athenian, accustomed as he was to regard the
                    free intercourse of social life as indispensable to his very existence.</p>
                <p>It has been said that Plato was admitted to the secret discipline of the
                    Pythagoreans. Probably he was only received by them with great cordiality, and
                    had access to writings and information respecting their doctrines, which would
                    have been denied to one, who came less recommended to them by the sincere
                    enthusiasm of philosophy, and approximation to their views. There are no traces
                    certainly in his writings, or elsewhere, of his having been a professed
                    Pythagorean; although he undoubtedly was greatly captivated by the Pythagorean
                    doctrines, and has introduced them largely into his own speculations.</p>
                <p>Archytas, the greatest name of the Pythagorean school after that of Pythagoras
                    himself, was then flourishing at Tarentum. It must have been an interesting
                    occasion, when there were assembled together at Tarentum, as Cicero
                    relates,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Senect.</hi> c. 12. Cicero says Plato was at Tarentum in the
                    consulship of L. Camillus and Appius Claudius. There appears some inaccuracy in
                    the tradition, but we may believe its substantial truth.</p></note> Pontius the
                    Samnite, the father of that Pontius who defeated the Roman consul at the Fauces

                    Athenian. The very place where they met,— <hi rend="italic">a</hi> point of
                    contact between the old empires of the world, and the rising power destined to
                    break them in pieces,—in itself adds to the interest. Then the characters of the
                    two philosophers who thus met, further arrest our attention :—Archytas, the
                    representative of the old traditionary theological systems now moulded into a
                    scheme of philosophy and a discipline of life; and Plato, the accomplished
                    artist, who was soon to take up the scheme of philosophy where the Pythagoreans
                    left it, and consecrate it by the inspirations of his own genius to an eternal
                    empire on the throne of literature :—Archytas, nurtured in the reserve and
                    mysticism of the Pythagorean discipline; Plato, formed to busy and importunate
                    discussion by the ever-eol-loquial Socrates,—two philosophers so contrasted with
                    each other in many respects, and yet so concordant in their love of ancient
                    wisdom and indefatigable research after truth.</p>
                <p>From the Pythagoreans Plato proceeded to Egypt to converse with the priests of
                    that ancient land, from which Greece had derived her original civilization and
                    science. Since the settlement of the Greek colony in Egypt by Psammetichus,<note

                    of intercourse between Greece and Egypt, and accurate means of information to
                    the Greeks respecting Egypt. The history of Herodotus must in itself have
                    awakened the curiosity of those who had any taste for such inquiries, to know
                    still more of a people from whom Greece had already learned so much, and from
                    whom evidently so much was to be learned; and must have stimulated them to avail
                    themselves of the existing facilities of gratifying that taste. To Plato,
                    indeed, if we take the testimony of Herodotus, that the Greeks, though they had
                    endeavoured to appropriate the discovery, derived the doctrine of the
                    immortality of the soul from the Egyptians (who were the first, he thinks, to
                    teach the doctrine, accompanied with that of transmigration),<note

                    Herodotus has given us an engaging view of the impression which such a visit
                    produced on his mind. What an animated picture might the still more
                    philosophical mind of Plato have presented, of the result of his conversation
                    with the priests of Egypt. Though we may not credit the account of his having
                    had the mysterious wisdom of the Hermetic Columns unfolded to him by the
                    priests, and of his being instructed in magic,<note anchored="true"

                    collected in Egypt scattered through his writings, and, so far, some evidence
                    that this visit was not without its influence on the character of his
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>Indeed it has been further asserted, that, whilst in Egypt, he had access to an
                    existing Greek version of the Old Testament, and that to this circumstance we
                    must attribute that purer and more elevated theology which his works exhibit, in
                    comparison with those of other heathen philosophers. A strange oversight in
                    chronology has also attributed to him a personal intercourse with the prophet
                    Jeremiah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quapropter in

                    supremacy of Scripture truth. At the same time, it is indisputable that Judaism
                    diffused much religious and moral truth beyond its own pale; and that not only
                    Plato, but the Egyptian priests, his instructors, unconsciously derived much
                    from the inspired sources, in collecting, under the form of fable, or allegory,
                    or maxim, portions of truth which the sacred oracles had scattered around them

                    disturbed state of those parts of Asia prevented his fulfilling his intentions.

                    his steps homeward. We have no means of ascertaining the exact time which these
                    travels occupied, or at what period of his life precisely he undertook the
                    office of teacher of philosophy at Athens. From the epistle addressed to the
                    friends of Dion, it appears that he was scarcely forty years of age when he
                    first went to Syracuse;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Mount Aetna, and therefore properly belongs to that part of his history which we
                    have just been tracing. But it had also very important bearings upon the future
                    fortunes, both of himself and many others; so important, indeed, that Plutarch,
                    following out a remark which occurs in the supposed epistles of Plato,
                    attributes it to a providential arrangement, in order to the restoration of
                    liberty to the Syracusans.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    For it was at this time that he became acquainted with the elder Dionysius,
                    tyrant of Syracuse, and Dion, whose sister Dionysius had married. He reclaimed
                    Dion, who was then quite a youth, from a life of vicious indulgence, to habits
                    of sobriety, and inspired him with an ardent love of philosophy. Thus began an
                    intimate friendship between the philosopher and Dion, which subsisted unimpaired
                    until the tragical death of the latter.</p>
                <p>Through the influence of Dion, the tyrant Dionysius, who was himself a literary
                    man and a patron of literature, was induced to receive Plato into the circle of
                    his court. The result, however, whether it was owing to the jealousy of other
                    philosophers who were then at the court of Syracuse, or to an excess of freedom
                    of speech in Plato, and an ebullition of temper and disappointed literary vanity
                    upon the part of Dionysius, was unfortunate. Dionysius was affronted at some
                    words that passed at an interview with him, and was only prevented by the
                    interposition of Dion from slaying the philosopher at the moment of
                    exasperation. But still he did not remit his displeasure; for on suffering him
                    to depart, he instructed the Lacedaemonian ambassador, Pollis, in whose vessel
                    he was to be conveyed from Sicily, either to slay him on the voyage or to sell
                    him as a slave; observing sarcastically, “that being a just man, he would be
                    equally happy though reduced to slavery.” Pollis is said to have so far lent
                    himself to this cruel treachery, that he actually caused the philosopher to be
                    sold as a slave, by landing him at Aegina at a time when a decree was in force
                    there, sentencing to death every Athenian who should set foot in the island.
                    From this shameful indignity, however, Plato was immediately relieved by the
                    generous kindness of Anniceris, a philosopher of Cyrene, who happened to be at
                    Aegina at the time, and paid the twenty minae, the price of his redemption. And
                    such, it is added, was the noble concern which Anniceris felt for him, that he
                    could not be prevailed on to receive back the money from the friends of Plato at
                    Athens, but refused it, saying “that they were not the only persons interested
                    in the welfare of Plato.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The story is related with circumstantial particularity, and so far bears the
                    aspect of truth. Still it has been questioned, as inconsistent with the
                    character of Dionysius, who, though despotic in the power which he possessed,
                    and often cruel in his use of it, was a man of education and courtesy, and the
                    patron of literary men. And the treachery of Pollis, as thus exhibited, has been
                    regarded as altogether unlikely in the high-minded Spartan. Nor again do we find
                    any allusion in the writings of the philosopher himself to so affecting an
                    incident in his life. The story may be thought still more improbable, if the
                    account be true that Dionysius presented him with a considerable sum of money,
                    with which he was enabled, during his residence in Sicily, to purchase a
                    treasure inestimable to him, the books of Philolaus the Pythagorean. These
                    arguments, however, may be pressed too far. Individuals possessed of absolute
                    power have often been found capable of deeds from which their own feelings,
                    apart from that great temptation, would have shrunk: and sudden and most
                    unreasonable and absurd outbreaks of violence, inconsistent with their general
                    behaviour, are characteristics of such power. And as for the Lacedaemonians, we
                    know that at the height of their civilization they were guilty of the acts of
                    barbarians. Their extreme cruelty to the poor debased Helots is well known;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. iv. 80.</p></note>
                    and in the Peloponnesian war they slaughtered indiscriminately all whom they met
                    with at sea, even neutrals, and persons inoffensively engaged in the business of

                    There can be little doubt that the visit of Plato at Syracuse ended
                    unsatisfactorily; that offence arose between the tyrant and himself; that he was
                    treated with great indignity, and that he returned to Athens in disgust.<note

                    course of philosophical labour for which his whole previous life had prepared
                    him. The term “Academy” is now familiar to every one as synonymous with a place
                    of learning. How strongly does this mark the celebrity of a school, which has
                    thus immortalized in vernacular language the grove of the hero Academus or
                    Hecademus, the ground on which Plato walked, and, as he walked, imparted to the
                    throng around him the riches of his genius, and taste, and learning! Here, in
                    the most beautiful suburb of Athens, the Ceramicus, Plato possessed a small
                    patrimony, a garden, where he fixed his abode, in the immediate vicinity of the
                    grove, his daily resort. Here, amongst the tall plane-trees which shaded the
                    walks, were assembled, year after year, the master-spirits of the age, whether
                    in pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, or for counsel in the direction of
                    public or private life,—the philosopher, the statesman, and the man of the
                    world,—to converse with the Athenian sage, and imbibe the wisdom which fell from
                    his lips. What an interesting assemblage must that have been which comprized in
                    it, amongst other influential persons, and young men who afterwards rose to
                    importance in their respective states, Demosthenes, Hyperides, Aristotle,
                    Speusippus, Xenocrates, Polemo, Dion! At once you might see in the throng the
                    young and the gay by the side of the old and the sedate; the stranger from some
                    distant town of Asia Minor, or Thrace, or Magna Graecia, and the citizen of
                    Athens; the tyrant of some little state learning theories of government and laws
                    from the philosopher of the republic; and the haughty Lacedaemonian paying
                    deference to the superior wisdom of an individual of a country which his own had
                    humbled in arms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    Dialogue “on Laws,” it is the Athenian stranger who instructs the Lacedaemonian

                    of what actually was seen in the Academia itself. Socrates is away; Plato
                    speaks; Cretans and Lacedaemonians, among others, are the auditors.</p></note>

                    the accomplished courtezan, whom the unnatural exclusion of the chaste matron
                    from social intercourse had raised to importance in Grecian society, was there,
                    seeking the improvement of her mind by joining in the discussions and listening
                    to the instructions of the philosopher, and thus qualifying herself for that
                    part which she had to sustain as an intimate with the men of the highest rank
                    and most intellectual cultivation in Greece. The celebrated Aspasia had been at
                    once the intimate of Pericles, and a hearer of Socrates; and Plato himself pays
                    her the compliment of saying, that both Pericles and Socrates had taken lessons
                    in rhetoric from her, as a most accomplished mistress of the art; to whom,
                    indeed, Pericles had been chiefly indebted for his eloquence.<note

                <p>Isocrates had, at the same time, his school of rhetoric overflowing with pupils.
                    Aristippus, also trained in the school of Socrates, was inculcating his scheme
                    of ethics, which maintained the theory of pleasure as the chief good. But
                    esteemed as Isocrates was for the gentleness of his life, and his skill as a
                    master of rhetoric; and acceptable as the doctrines of Aristippus must naturally
                    have been to a corrupt society; neither of these great names sufficed to obscure
                    the greater name of Plato, or could rival the pretensions of the Academia to be
                    the great school of philosophy, and literature, and civilization.</p>
                <p>A mind so intensely occupied as that of Plato, would scarcely find leisure for
                    taking part in the political affairs of his country. The profession of
                    philosophy was not as yet indeed become entirely distinct; but the teaching of
                    Socrates had greatly tended to render it so. The rigorous method of
                    interrogation which called forth the latent difficulties on other subjects,
                    could not but produce great distrust in those who laid themselves fully open to
                    it, as to their own ability to manage the complex matters of public concern, as
                    well as impress them with despair of success in that walk of exertion. Socrates
                    himself avoided as far as possible all interference in the politics of Athens.
                    Plato strictly followed his example. Accordingly, we find, in several places of
                    his writings, a contrast drawn between the philosopher and the man of public
                    life; and an indirect apology for himself, as one who kept aloof from the public
                    assemblies and the courts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    un mixed with contemptuous feeling, at the state of misrule into which the
                    democracy of Athens had degenerated in his day, and he was evidently glad to
                    avail himself of the plea of philosophy to absent himself from scenes so
                    uncongenial to his taste. Doubtless, independently of any political bias, he was
                    glad to escape from the sycophancy and tumult of the popular assemblies at
                    Athens, and to enjoy the calm shades of his beloved retreat. This was the sphere
                    of action for which nature and his whole previous life had peculiarly fittéd
                    him. Here he could effectually diffuse the salutary influence of his philosophy,
                    in counteracting, in some measure at least, the selfishness of the world. Here
                    he could maintain an undisputed supremacy over minds, which (such was the
                    impatience of all authority in those times) no mere external power could have so
                    entirely subjected to the direction of an individual.</p>
                <p>Through the influence, however, of his Pythagorean friends, with whom he appears
                    to have held constant intercourse, Plato was prevailed upon, at the age of
                    sixty-five years, to quit the retirement of his garden for a time, and pay a
                    second visit to Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    failed in his promise of land and men for the purpose. But others, he adds,
                    stated that the object of his visit was the liberation of the island from

                    It was the policy indeed of the Pythagoreans, like that of the Jesuits in modern
                    times, to keep up an active intercourse with society, whilst in their internal
                    system they cultivated philosophy with the ardour of exclusive devotees.
                    Socrates wished to govern the conduct of men by an appeal to their reason;
                    convincing them of their errors and follies, and leading them to seek the means
                    of informing themselves aright. The Pythagoreans, like the Jesuits, aspired to
                    carry out their views by a moral hold over men in society; by taking part
                    accordingly in the management of states, and by a secret influence over those in
                    power. The accession of the younger Dionysius to the throne of Syracuse, and the
                    opening presented for producing an effect on him through Plato’s influence with
                    Dion, the next in power to the tyrant, were opportunities which would not be
                    lost by their watchful zeal. Such seems, if we may proceed on the authority of
                    the Epistles, to have been the occasion of this invitation of Plato to Syracuse.
                    We see, at the same time, that there was a struggle of factions at Syracuse at
                    this period. The party opposed to Dion, in order to counteract his influence,
                    obtained the recall of Philistus, a man distinguished alike as a statesman, a
                    commander, and an historian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cicero speaks of Philistus as a writer in the following

                    then in banishment through the ingratitude and caprice of the elder Dionysius.
                    The result was, that though the reception of Plato at Syracuse was most
                    flattering, for he was welcomed with the royal pomp of a decorated chariot, and
                    the celebration of a public sacrifice, his mission was ultimately fruitless.</p>
                <p>At first everything seemed prosperous. The change wrought in the manners of the
                    court is described as marvellous. Philosophy became the fashion; and the very
                    palace was filled with the dust stirred up by the number of geometricians. Even
                    the expulsion of Dion, which soon followed, through the successful intrigues of
                    his enemies, did not at once estrange Dionysius from the philoso <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532544" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2544-0017"/>pher. He would not indeed
                    allow Plato to leave Sicily with Dion; but, using a gentle constraint over him,
                    detained him within the precincts of the citadel; shewing him at the same time
                    all respect, and hoping at last, as it seems, to bring him over to his interest.
                    At length the attention of Dionysius was called to preparations for war; and
                    Plato, released from his embarrassing situation, was enabled to return to
                    Athens.</p>
                <p>He was not, however, deterred from once more making the trial, how far an
                    impression could be made on the mind of Dionysius, and the restoration of Dion
                    to his country effected; and, as on the former occasion, so now, he was chiefly
                    induced to undertake the enterprise, by the earnest intercession of his
                    Pythagorean friends. Dion himself was living at Athens, waiting the opportunity
                    of returning to his country; and his relatives at Syracuse sent letters to
                    Plato, urging him to use his exertions in behalf of Dion. Even Dionysius himself
                    wrote a letter to him, entreating him to come, and promising satisfaction at the
                    same time in regard to Dion. He also sent a trireme for him, with Archidemus, a
                    disciple of Archytas, and others with whom the philosopher was acquainted, to
                    render the voyage more agreeable to him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Plat. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> vii. p. 124.</p></note>
                    For a while Plato persisted in declining the invitation, pleading his advanced
                    age, for he was now sixty-eight years old;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>. c. 361.</p></note> but at length he gave way to these
                    united solicitations. Dionysius, indeed, like his father, was fond of drawing
                    around him men of eminence for literature and philosophy. At this time, amongst
                    others of the same class at his court, were the philosophers Diogenes,
                    Aeschines, Aristippus, and some Pythagoreans. Plato might have not unreasonably
                    hoped, therefore, that a mind delighting in such society, or at least ambitious
                    of the reputation of being a patron of literature, might yet be influenced to
                    sound philosophy. He was, besides, desirous of making an attempt to produce a
                    reconciliation between Dionysius and Dion. Thus did he pass the Straits of
                    Sicily a third time, to be a third time disappointed in the object of his
                    voyage. Though he was welcomed, as before, with great splendour and
                    demonstrations of respect, not only were his endeavours for the restoration of
                    Dion unsuccessful, but he incensed the tyrant by venturing to intercede in
                    behalf of Heraclides, a member of the liberal party at Syracuse, who was under
                    suspicion of having tampered with the mercenaries. Still Dionysius was desirous
                    of retaining the friendship of the philosopher. Plato was removed, indeed, from
                    the garden in which he lived, under the pretence of a sacrifice about to be
                    performed there by women, and placed in the quarter of the mercenaries. Such a
                    situation was most unpleasant to him; as he could not but feel himself in danger
                    amongst that lawless class, who naturally disliked him, as an enemy of the power
                    which gave them employment and pay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Plutarch, in <hi rend="italic">Dion.</hi></p></note> But
                    this indignity was probably more the effect of the hostility of the opposite
                    party against Dion, than an act of the weak tyrant himself. Plato, in his
                    perplexity, applied to Archytas and the Pythagoreans at Tarentum, to extricate
                    him from these difficult circumstances. At their instance, accordingly,
                    Dionysius consented to the departure of Plato, and dismissed him with kindness,
                    furnishing him with supplies for his voyage.</p>
                <p>Thus did Plato once more return to Athens, heartily disgusted with the untoward
                    result of his visits to Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Though the friend of Dion, the head of one great party at Syracuse, he had acted
                    in Sicily consistently with his conduct at Athens, in not taking any active part
                    in political affairs. Even Dionysius himself seems, throughout his conduct
                    towards him, to have been jealous rather of his personal regard for Dion, than
                    suspicious of any exertion on his part in the cause of Dion against him, and to
                    have sought to detain him at Syracuse, not out of fear or ill will, but for the
                    honour of the presence of the philosopher at his court. This is further evinced
                    by the subsequent conduct of Plato. For, in the expedition which Dion planned
                    and executed against Dionysius, he took no part; making answer to the invitation
                    to join in it, “that if invited to assist in doing any good, he would readily
                    concur; but as for doing evil to any one, they must invite others, not
                    him.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The remaining years of his life were gently worn away amidst the labours of the
                    Academia. These labours were unintermitted to the very close of a long life; for
                    he died, according to Cicero’s account, in the act of writing; his death
                    happening on the day in which he completed his eighty-first year. “Such,” adds
                    Cicero, “was the placid and gentle old age of a life spent in quietness, and
                    purity, and elegance.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Another account, however, of his death states that he died during his presence

                    health had been impaired by a lingering fever, in consequence of the marshiness
                    of the ground. He was urged to remove his residence to the Lyceum, the grove
                    afterwards frequented by the school of Aristotle; but such was his attachment to
                    the place, that he preferred it, he said, even to the proverbial salubrity of
                    Mount Athos; and he continued struggling against the disorder for eighteen
                    months, until at length his constitution successfully resisted it.<note

                    habits of strict temperance, he thus preserved his health during the remainder
                    of his life, amidst the harassings of foreign travel, and the undermining
                    assiduities of days and nights of study.</p>
                <p>Plato was never married. He had two brothers, Glauco and Adimantus, and a sister,
                    Potona, whose son, Speusippus, he appears to have regarded with peculiar
                    affection and interest, as the destined successor to his school of philosophy.
                    He inherited a very small patrimony, and he died poor, leaving but three minae
                    of silver, two pieces of land, and four slaves, and a few articles of gold and
                    silver to the young Adimantus, the son, as it would seem, of his brother of that
                    name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diog. Laert. in

                <p>In person he is described as graceful in his youth, and, if the etymology of his
                    name be correct, as remarkable for the manly frame of his body.<note

                    mentioned, which detracts in some measure from his bodily accomplishments; the

                <p>In regard to moral qualities, he was distinguished by the gravity, and modesty,
                    and gentleness of his demeanour. He had never been observed from his youth to

                    provocation; as, for example, his declining to inflict the due punishment on a

                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2557-0018"/>when his fame was at its height. Some strangers,
                    into whose company he had been thrown at Olympia, coming afterwards to Athens,
                    were received by him there with the greatest courtesy. All the while, however,
                    they were ignorant who their host was. They merely knew that his name was Plato.
                    On their requesting him to conduct them to the Academia, and show them his
                    namesake, the associate of Socrates, they were astonished to find, by his smile
                    and avowal of himseIf, that they had experienced so much unpretending kindness
                    from the great philosopher himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Again, being asked by some one if there would.be any saying recorded of him, he
                    answered with the like modesty, “One must first obtain a name, and then there
                    will be several.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diog.

                <p>The gravity of his manner was by some interpreted as severity and gloom. The
                    comic poet Amphis complained of him, that “he knew nothing but to look sad, and
                    solemnly raise the brow.” Aristippus charged him with arrogance. It is no
                    wonder, indeed, that, in contrast with the coarse freedom of Diogenes, and the
                    excessive affability of Aristippus, he should appear haughty and reserved. But
                    that this character did not really belong to him, we may judge from the social
                    humour which mingles even with the sarcastic touches of his Dialogues, and from
                    the anxiety which he shewed to correct such a disposition as a fault in Dion.
                    His favourite pupil Speusippus was distinguished by the opposite quality of a
                    lively temper; and to his especial direction we find Plato sending Dion, that he
                    might learn, by the conversation and example of Speusippus, a more conciliatory
                    and agreeable mode of address.</p>
                <p>The instance given of his vanity in putting himself forward at the death of
                    Socrates, as competent to retrieve the great loss in his own person alone, bears
                    evident marks of a calumny. It may be so far true, as it represents a desire
                    upon his part to console his brother disciples under their common affliction.
                    But as an evidence of an assumption of superiority over them at such a moment,
                    it accords little with that feeling of dismay for themselves, under which he, in
                    common with the rest, fled to Megara as an asylum; or with his indisputable
                    affection for the person of Socrates, and veneration for his wisdom and
                    talents.</p>
                <p>Again, the strictness of Plato’s philosophical profession, amidst the general
                    dissoluteness of manners at Athens, was construed by some who had an envious eye
                    on his reputation, as only an affected austerity. It was complained of him, that
                    his life did not answer to the high requisitions of his moral teaching.<note

                    his brother disciples in the school of Socrates, Antisthenes and Aristippus,
                    imputed to him the grossest licentiousness. The former taking offence at Pl⅛to
                    for objecting to a treatise, which he proposed to read, on the Impossibility of
                    Contradiction, vented his spleen in a most abusive dialogue, which he entitled
                    Satho, intending at once by that term a satirical play on the name, and a stigma
                    on the character, of the philosopher. These calumnies are in some measure
                    supported by the tenor of certain epigrams attributed to Plato, and by passages
                    of his Dialogues, which display a license of impure allusion, shocking to the
                    feelings of the reader, in these days at least. His calumniators then found
                    occasion for their scandal, in observing amongst those by whom he was
                    surrounded, the young and. the handsome. But though we may see much to reprobate
                    in such passages, and painful as the impression is which they leave on the mind,
                    as evidences of the deep corruption of human nature, we are not warranted in
                    regarding them as conclusive of corresponding immorality of conduct in a writer
                    of his age and country. They shew, indeed, that the writer has not escaped the
                    contagion of the vicious atmosphere which he breathed, and they are of course a
                    great drawback in our estimate of the purity of his sentiments and character.
                    But we ought to set off against them the high tone of religious and moral
                    feeling which is the general characteristic of his philosophy; the beacon which
                    it holds up to warn men of the debasing allurements of pleasure, and of the
                    misery consequent on the indulgence of passion; and its glowing exhortation to
                    seek for true happiness, not in externals, or by aiming at a mere human standard
                    of virtue, but by internal purification, and by imitation of the perfections of
                    the Deity.</p>
                <p>Much has been said on the absence of any reference to Xenophon in the Dialogues
                    of Plato. Xenophon, in his <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi> has spoken of
                    Plato, and alluded to the affection with which Plato was regarded by
                    Socrates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. <hi
                    rend="italic">Mem,</hi> iii. 6.</p></note> But Plato has not availed himself of
                    any opportunity of paying the like compliment to Xenophon. This silence cannot,
                    perhaps, be entirely accounted for, without supposing that there was a feeling
                    of literary jealousy on the part of Plato. But there are some considerations
                    which may partly account for Xenophon’s not appearing as an interlocutor in the
                    Dialogues. Xenophon, though a man of philosophical mind, evidently attended the
                    teaching of Socrates, not to lcarn the art of disputation, or for the indulgence
                    of a speculative curiosity. When he philosophized, it was as a man of the world,
                    acquainting himself with human nature, with the manners and opinions of men, in
                    order to his own conduct in life. He was not one of those eager and flippant
                    sciolists, whom Plato takes delight in submitting as apt experiments to the
                    interrogatories of Socrates. Nor was he, again, a devotee of science, like the
                    wise Theaetetus, the interesting person who gives occasion to the dialogue of
                    that name, and whom in some points he resembled. He would not therefore
                    naturally be selected by Plato, in order to the carrying on of discussions
                    intended for the development of his philosophy. It is remarkable, that Plato has
                    only in two places even alluded to himself; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaedo,</hi> to explain his absence from the death-scene in the prison;<note

                    was perhaps thrown in for graphic effect. His own sorrow is too intense to be
                    depicted; therefore he is concealed from the view: his name is introduced, but

                <p>Such Was the character of this eminent man. His distinguished career exposed him
                    to the shafts of envy and detraction; and the high aspirings of his mind were
                    clogged and weighed down by that corrupt heathenism with which he was
                    surrounded. Still his reputation for wisdom and virtue stands above all these
                    attacks and circumstances of disparagement. The more we converse with him in his
                    writings, -the more we are charmed by the deep feeling of natural piety which
                    pervades his philosophy as its masterthought, and by the sound practical wisdom
                    which shines forth from them as the real character of the man, reclaiming and
                    subduing the wild aberrations of his speculative fancy.</p>
                <p>His remains were buried in the place which he had ennobled whilst living. Nor
                    were they unattended by the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532570"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2570-0019"/>customary tributes of honour and affection.
                    Aristotle, who had been his constant disciple during the last twenty years
                    preceding his death, displayed his veneration for his preceptor by consecrating
                    an altar to him. A festival, called after him Platonea, was instituted in honour
                    of him, and celebrated annually by his disciples. A statue, dedicated to the
                    Muses, was afterwards erected in the Academia by Mithridates the Persian. He had
                    not, indeed, been dead but a very few years, when the great celebrity of his
                    name called forth from his nephew and successor, Speusippus, an express work in
                    his praise. Seneca further tells us of a singular mark of honour which was paid
                    to him on the very day of his decease. There were some Magi, he relates, at
                    Athens at the time, who, struck by the singular circumstance of his having
                    exactly completed the perfect number of nine times nine years, performed a
                    sacrifice to him, esteeming him on that account to have been more than man.<note

                    the fiction of the discovery of his body in the time of Constantine the Great,
                    with a golden tablet on the breast, recording his prediction of the birth of

                <p>The writings of Plato obtained an early popularity. Already, during his lifetime,

                    Dialogues, and even by Socrates himself, of the manner in which they had been
                    represented in them by Plato.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Athenaeus, xi. 113. Axiothea is said to have been induced to
                    attend on the teaching of Plato, from having read the Republic.</p></note> It is
                    very probable, also, that during the long time in which he was publicly teaching
                    at Athens, and, doubtless, recurring frequently to the same topics of
                    discussion, considerable portions of what he delivered orally, were treasured up
                    in the memory of some who heard them, and afterwards written down, and thus
                    published to the world without having received the finishing touches of the
                    author’s hand. The practice, indeed, of thus carrying off the oral lessons of
                    the philosopher is alluded to by Plato himself in passages of his writings, as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Parmenides;</hi> where the dialogue is related by some one
                    remembering what has passed in conversation on a former occasion. This
                    circumstance may, at once, account for the comparative inferiority of some of
                    the Dialogues in point of execution, and for the fact that some have been passed
                    under his name which are not really his; whilst we have, at the same time, a
                    very considerable collection of writings authenticated by testimonies descending
                    from his own times.</p>
                <p>It is by no means necessary for our purpose here (which is to obtain a just
                    general view of the character of the philosopher and his writings), to enter
                    into the criticisms by which doubts have been thrown on particular Dialogues,
                    and on different Dialogues by different critics, out of the number commonly
                    included amongst the genuine works of Plato. We may only remark, that these
                    doubts do not rest on external testimony, but are drawn from considerations of
                    the internal character of particular writings, which have been judged inferior
                    to the rest in matter and execution. Nor is it necessary that we should discuss
                    the various theories proposed for connecting the several Dialogues, and tracing
                    in them the gradual formation and development of the philosophical system of the
                    author. This inquiry certainly has its interest; and could we arrive at any
                    clear results in the prosecution of it, it would be valuable, for the light
                    which it would throw on the interpretation of the philosophy of Plato. But
                    though we can discover a connection between several of the Dialogués, like that
                    of a series of discussions on the same subject, it is not possible to decide on
                    the order in which the points discussed presented themselves to the
                    philosopher’s mind, or which we are to regard as the more mature expression of
                    his doctrines. This inquiry further demands a decision of the agitated question
                    concerning the double teaching practised in the ancient schools, known by the
                    technical division into esoteric and exoteric, or mystic and popular; the former
                    addressed to the mature disciple, the latter to the novice or general hearer.
                    There are undoubtedly marks of a recognition of this distinction throughout the
                    writings of Plato;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    particularly <hi rend="italic">Conυiυ.</hi> p. 245. ∙</p></note> and it is also
                    probably referred to by Aristotle, when he speaks of the “unwritten doctrines”
                    of Plato.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristot. <hi
                    rend="italic">Phys.</hi> iv. 2.</p></note> But we cannot practically employ it
                    in determining the relative value of particular discussions or statements in his
                    writings, without in volving ourselves in a maze of theoretic disquisition, and
                    ending at last, perhaps, in absolute scepticism respecting his doctrines.</p>
                <p>But there is a particular class of writings attributed to him, which would
                    possess a peculiar interest for us, if we could establish their genuineness;
                    respecting which, however, the severe verdict of modern criticism compels ns to
                    hesitate in pronouncing on their genuineness. We mean what are commonly
                    published in the editions of his works as the Epistles of Plato. By some the
                    question has been regarded as settled beyond controversy, against their
                    reception.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mitford, <hi

                    be quite below the character of Plato’s mind. The apologetic tone of the chief
                    part of them has also been considered as evidence of their having proceeded from
                    friends or disciples of Plato, vindicating his character from misrepresentations
                    in regard to his intercourse with the conrt of Syracuse. But though we may allow
                    weight to these considerations, they are not sufficient peremptorily to decide
                    the question against the Epistles; particularly as we have in their favour the
                    authority, not only of Plutarch, who founds much of the narrative in his Life of
                    Dion upon them, but of Cicero, referring to them and quoting them expressly as
                    writings of Plato.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Est

                <p>Perhaps no philosophical writer has ever received so early and ample a recompense
                    of his labours, not only in the reception and circulation of his writings, but
                    in the still more glorious tribute of the spread of his philosophy, as Plato has
                    received. We have mentioned the ordinary marks of admiration which accompanied
                    him during his life and after his death. A more enduring monument was reserved
                    for him in the foundation of the school of Alexandria, not many years after his
                    voice had ceased to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532583"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2583-0020"/>heard in the groves of the Academia. There, as in
                    a fitting temple, on the confines of the Eastern and Western Worlds, was
                    enshrined the philosophy which had moulded into one the philosophical systems of
                    the East and the West. And though, in the course of things, the infusion of
                    Eastern Philosophy predominated at Alexandria, it was still under the venerated
                    name of Plato that the new system was taught. The disciples of the Alexandrine
                    school were proud to call themselves Platonists, and to regard themselves as
                    interpreters of the doctrines of Plato, whilst they altered and disfigured those
                    doctrines. Here, then, was erected the proper monument to his fame. Meanwhile,
                    in the Academia, teachers in regular succession transmitted their inheritance of
                    his name, and by the charm of that, prolonged a feeble existence. For the spirit
                    which had formed and animated the school had fled with him; and the Middle and
                    New Academics only attested, by their lingering decay, the strength of the
                    foundation on which they had been built. How great the influence of Plato was on
                    the philosophy of the Romans, needs not to be told to those who are even
                    slightly acquainted with the philosophical writings of Cicero. And even when
                    Christianity threw into the shade all systems of man’s wisdom, the only
                    philosophy which maintained its credit at the first, was that of Plato.
                    Christian teachers were found, not unwilling to own that there was great
                    accordance between his doctrines and the revealed truth. Whilst, on the one
                    hand, there were disciples of the philosopher who claimed for him all that was
                    excellent in the Christian scheme, there were Christians who asserted, that he
                    had learned his superior wisdom from the elder Scriptures. All this shews the
                    hold which his name still retained over the minds of men at this period. The
                    great father of the Western Church, St Augustin, avows himself a warm admirer of
                    Plato. He concedes the approximation of the Platonists to the Christian
                    doctrines; affirming that all other philosophers must yield to those who had
                    speculated so justly as they had respecting the Chief Good.<note anchored="true"

                    indeed, we find Aristotle supplanting Plato in favour with the Christian
                    controversialist. The struggle had been for some time between their respective
                    advocates, which of them should obtain the lead in-the Christian schools. But
                    Plato,.on the whole, had the mastery, though the result of the struggle was an
                    eclectic system, in which the principal differences of the two philosophers were
                    studiously reconciled. In fact, we may consider Platonism as in the ascendency
                    in the Christian schools, until the period of Scholasticism, that is, until the
                    twelfth and the following centuries, when the discipline of argumentation was at
                    its height in the Church, and with it the study of Aristotle’s philosophy. Even
                    then the theories of Plato maintained their ground. The speculations pursued by
                    members of the Church continued to be for the most part Platonic in their
                    principles, though they were conducted and modified by the dialectical method of
                    Aristotle.</p>
                <p>What, then, was the character of this philosophy, it will naturally be asked,
                    which both rendered it so attractive to those amongst whom it arose, and also
                    secured for it such an immortality?</p>
                <p>It is a very remarkable circumstance that, as far as we know, Plato should have
                    escaped all censure at Athens on account of his philosophy, when other
                    philosophers, who, like him, became centres of popular attraction, were the
                    objects of extreme persecution. It is the more remarkable, as not only his
                    master experienced such persecution, but his immediate disciple, Aristotle, was
                    forced to fly from Athens to escape the storm with which he was threatened.
                    Coming between these two, and enjoying, at the height of his po pularity, an
                    influence perhaps surpassing that of either, he yet was suffered to wear out his
                    life unmolested, amidst the tranquil labours of his school.</p>
                <p>The only evidence to the contrary of this is an unauthenticated anecdote, told by
                    Laertius, of Plato’s having accompanied Chabrias to the citadel of Athens, and
                    shewn his zeal in support of that general, under the capital charge brought
                    against him. Upon this occasion, it is said, Cro-bylus, the sycophant, meeting
                    him, observed, “Are you coming to plead for another, as ignorant that the
                    hemlock of Socrates awaits you too ?” to which he replied, “When I served my
                    country in the field I underwent dangers, and now in the cause of duty I undergo
                    them for a friend.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Diog. Laert. <hi rend="italic">in Vita Plat.</hi> 18.</p></note></p>
                <p>But though we may refuse to believe this story, it is quite evident, that the
                    condition of philosophy at Athens was not without its obloquy and danger even in
                    its most flourishing times under Plato. We may gather from many passages of the
                    writings of Plato, that the cause of philosophy still needed defence, and that
                    great caution was required on the part of those who publicly professed the study
                    of it. A re-action indeed had taken place in favour of philosophers, in
                    consequence of the severity with which Socrates had been treated; and the
                    assailants of Socrates suffered retribution from the popular feeling. Still
                    there was in the mass of the Athenian people a strong antipathy to philosophy,
                    from their ignorance of its real nature. They had been taught to regard
                    philosophers as idle and mischievous drivellers, ever prosing about nature and
                    the phenomena of the heavens, and as contemners of the gods.<note

                    also how some of those to whom Athens owed her greatest calamities, had been
                    amongst the students of philosophy. Alcibiades, for example, had been a hearer
                    of Socrates; one of singular natural endowments, in the formation of whose mind
                    Socrates had taken especial pains, and who might therefore be regarded as the
                    test of what philosophy could effect. The people had loved him as their spoiled
                    child, in spite of all his follies; but they had felt also the mischief and
                    misery of his wild career of ambition; and they threw ths blame on his
                    instructors, and the system in which he. had been trained. Again, a great
                    prejudice had been excited in the public mind against philosophy in general,
                    from the many low and mercenary professors of it with which Greece abounded;
                    minute philosophers, patronized by the public for their temporary services in
                    teaching the arts of public life, but who produced ignominy and disgust to the
                    true profession by their unworthy monopoly of its name. Add to this, that
                    popular opinion had been corrupted by the false teaching, which had been so long
                    and extensively at work throughout Greece. Erroneous principles of judgment and
                    conduct had taken root in the public mind; or, to describe the case more
                    correctly, all principles were unsettled, and the state of the public mind was a
                    state of inward anarchy and insubordination. A philosopher, therefore, seriously
                    devoted to his profession, and pursuing it with a single eye to the advancement
                    of truth, was necessarily regarded with suspicion and dislike. For it is a
                    natural propensity of the mind to adhere to what is established, whether it be
                    good or evil, simply because the transition is easy, and no effort of thought is
                    required, no trouble of self-examination imposed, no censure of self exacted;
                    and what is inveterate in their own minds passes with men for the oldness of
                    truth and nature. A reformer, therefore, is always an object of aversion; and no
                    reform is successfully accomplished, until it has worked its way by subduing the
                    prejudices which it has to encounter at the outset. Not <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532596" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2596-0021"/>only was the oppósition to
                    sound philosophy produced in the minds of the vulgar by this distemper of public
                    opinion; but even the better part of society, the more educated and reflecting
                    members of the community, were infected by it. The majority of these would be
                    deterred from taking up a profession exposing them to so much dislike and risk.
                    Some of them, too, with a view of standing well with the mass of those amongst
                    whom they lived, and promoting their own interest, would avail themselves of the
                    popular clamour against philosophy, cry down the pursuit of it as innovation and
                    danger, and make it their business to exaggerate, instead of counteracting,
                    vulgar prejudices on the subject.</p>
                <p>These obstructions to the teaching of philosophy are pointedly referred to by
                    Plato, as existing in his time, and demanding his attention, in order to the
                    success of that mission of reform which he had undertaken. He treats the vulgar
                    prejudice against philosophy as not altogether unreasonable,<note

                    consequence of the perverse opinions which had been popularly inculcated; and
                    endeavours to disarm the public hostility, by alleging the causes of the
                    disrepute into which philosophy had unjustly fallen. Alluding, as it seems,
                    particularly to the instance of Alcibiades, he points out, that it is not
                    philosophy which corrupts the young, but the passions of the young and noble
                    spirit which pervert the means of good to the greatest mischief. None but those
                    of the highest order of talent and natural gifts are fully susceptible of its
                    influence; but then these are the very cases, he observes, which are also
                    capable of the most mischief, through their greater susceptibility of the
                    seductions of the world. There cannot but be objections against philosophy, he
                    further observes, as long as the mass of mankind is, as it is found, incapable
                    of appreciating reaI essential good for its own sake; and as long as those of
                    superior nature, who should be its devoted friends, and examples of its
                    influence, are drawn away from it in pursuit of popular opinion. He endeavours,
                    accordingly, to evince that there is no just ground for alarm, at least in those
                    days, at the power of philosophy. It was now deserted and helpless, fallen
                    amongst those who were not its own people. If disgrace now attached to
                    philosophy, it must be imputed to the unworthy alliance into which it had been
                    forced. The mean artisan, who has made his fortune, now quits his prison, and
                    decks himself out, and aspires to the hand of the daughter of his master in her
                    poverty and destitution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>If Plato thought it necessary thus to apologize for the pursuit of philosophy, it
                    is clear that there was yet reason to apprehend an outbreak of violence against
                    its professors. In fact, however, he appears not only to have escaped all such
                    outrage, but, whilst he propagated, by his oral teaching and his writings, a
                    system of doctrines directly contrary to the impure morality and superstition
                    established around him, to have enjoyed an esteem beyond that which any other
                    teacher on the same ground ever obtained.</p>
                <p>The explanation of this is in a great measure to be sought in the circumstances
                    under which his philosophy was formed and matured, and to which it was
                    peculiarly adapted.</p>
                <p>What Themistocles admitted truly of himself when he answered, that he should not
                    have achieved his glorious deeds if Athens had not been his country, was as
                    truly applied by Plato to himself, when he enumerated amongst his causes of
                    gratitude to the Gods, that he was born an Athenian.<note anchored="true"

                    iii.</p></note> For his philosophy was eminently Athenian. Viewed at least as we
                    have it in his writings, it was the expression, by a master-mind, itself imbued
                    with the spirit of the age, but rising above that spirit by its intrinsic
                    superiority, of those tendencies of thought and action, which had been working
                    in Greece, and especially at Athens, the centre of Grecian civilization.</p>
                <p>The Peloponnesian war terminated with leaving Athens humbled before the
                    confederacy, which the hatred and jealousy of her power had leagued against her.
                    But the loss of her ascendency in Greece was not the worst evil brought on
                    Athens by the result of that war. The machinery of faction, by which the war had
                    been principally carried on, produced the most mischievous effects on the
                    character and happiness of the Greeks at large; aggravating the symptoms of evil
                    already existing in the constitutions of the several states, and, not least, in
                    that of Athens. Not only did the insolence of the Athenian democracy gain
                    strength in the result, and rise beyond all bounds, but the excesses in which
                    party spirit had indulged, drew into prominence the selfishness and
                    ferociousness of a demoralized people. Then might be clearly seen the levity and
                    licentiousness of men, who, living amidst constant hazards, had learnt to regard
                    nothing beyond the enjoyment of the passing hour; the cunning and cruelty
                    engendered by mutual distrust; and the wanton contempt of all law and religion,
                    prompted by the sight of the calamities which the tempests of social life
                    scatter indiscriminately on the good and the evil. On this stock of corruption,
                    speculative irreligion, and speculative immorality, had also grown up as its
                    natural offshoots. Men were found hardening themselves against the reproaches of
                    conscience and the fear of retribution, by arguing against the fundamental
                    truths of religion and morals. In religion, it was contended that there were no
                    Gods; or that if the existence of a divine power were conceded, there was no
                    Providence over human affairs; or, lastly, that if there were a Providence, the
                    wrath of the offended Deity was placable by the prayers and sacrifices of the
                    offender. In morals, the question was debated, whether all was not mere matter
                    of institution, and the device of the weak against the stronger power; and
                    whether right might not change with the opinions of men.</p>
                <p>This state of things had produced and fostered a spurious race of philosophers,
                    familiarly known by the name of the Sophists; a name, not at first implying that
                    disrespect, by which it afterwards characterized the-pretensions of those to
                    whom it was given. For the Sophists evidently were not the primary corrupters of
                    the public mind in Greece, but themselves the offspring of· that moral chaos,
                    which resulted from the internal disorders of the country, and which they
                    sustained, as its own children paying the recompense of their nurture to their
                    genuine parent. They were an evidence of the corruption having reached the
                    higher classes of society; for their instructions were sought by those who could
                    pay for them, and who desired to qualify themselves for office and power in the
                    state. ∙ Going about from place to place, and domesticating themselves wherever
                    they could obtain a reception, they undertook to render all that flocked to them
                    adepts in the arts ' of government, and even in virtue. The pretension would
                    have been absurd and extravagant, but for the prevailing looseness of opinion on
                    moral subjects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    than what happened to be instituted and in fashion, there was an opening to

                <p>At no place were these universal teachers more cordially received than at Athens.
                    The anxiety with which an expected visit from any one of greater note among them
                    was expected at Athens, and the zeal with which the young hastened to see and
                    hear the wise man on his arrival, are depicted in lively colours by Plato. At
                    Athens, evidently, if anywhere, the Sophist felt himself at his proper home.
                    There was his readiest market. Herodotus may justly have been surprised at the
                    success of so vulgar a deception at Athens, the seat of literature, as that
                    practised by Pisistratus, when he exhibited to the people a woman of great
                    stature, arrayed in full armour, and pompously borne in a chariot into the city,
                    as the goddess Minerva, reinstating him in her own citadel.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herodot. <hi rend="italic">Clio,</hi>
                    60.</p></note> It would have been still stranger if these impersonations of
                    Athenian wisdom had not succeeded in imposing on the understanding of Athenians.
                    For their minds were in that fluctuating state, which disposed them to receive
                    every various form. They were subject to chance-impressions from the last
                    teacher. Their general cultivation of mind, and taste for literature, prepared
                    them for listening with pleasure to exhibitions of rhetorical and dialectical
                    skill, such as the Sophists gave. And from admiration of the skill thus
                    displayed, the transition was natural to consider that, as the only wisdom,
                    which was capable of maintaining both sides of a question with equal
                    plausibility, and that, the only virtue, which could shift and accommodate
                    itself to every expedient with equal satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Yet the Athenian was not entirely the creature of those circumstances, which had
                    so considerably modified his character. He yet retained some traces of that high
                    feeling so beautifully touched by his own tragic poet, when that poet speaks of
                    “the pious Athens,” and appeals to the ancient associations of religion which
                    consecrated the land. Religion indeed had acquired the name of superstition, or
                    the fear of supernatural powers, <hi rend="italic">δεισιδαιμονία</hi>; but even
                    this marks that there were some who cherished, though in that degenerate form, a
                    veneration for the truths of the Divine Being, and the Divine agency in the
                    world. Nor was the Athenian ever insensible to his pride of birth, and rank
                    among those of the Grecian name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    estimation of themselves.</p></note> He dwelt on the recollections of a remote
                    antiquity of origin, as distinguishing him among the members of the Greek
                    family. He claimed to be the offspring of the Attic soil, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ai</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">τοχ⅛ων,</hi> whilst others
                    were descended from successive immigrations of strangers. Amidst his fickleness,
                    and susceptibility of every passing impulse, he yet felt himself strongly
                    influenced by his veneration for the past, and loved to connect himself with the
                    ancient glo- ,ries of his country. In the Athenian character, accordingly, ,may
                    be observed the union of extremes; devoutness of deep inward feeling,
                    accompanied with superficial irreligion and profane, dissoluteness of morals; a
                    mercurial temperament, ever eager for change, floating like a light cloud over a
                    deep-rooted reverence of antiquity, and the tradition of ancestral wisdom and
                    virtue.</p>
                <p>Now, .on accurately studying the writings of Plato, we find them, both, a
                    reflexion of this state of the public mind at Athens, and a corrective of it.
                    Full of imagination and of severe subtile thought, they are formed to attract
                    and fix the attention of the literary Athenian. Bringing the Sophist on the
                    scene, and giving sketches of the social life of Athens, and making conversation
                    the vehicle of his instruc tions, Plato in a manner transferred to his own
                    teaching, what was every day witnessed at Athens in the professorial exhibitions
                    of the Sophists themselves. His philosophy, a counterpart, in its way, to the
                    drama of the comic poet, instructed the people, at once, through their wisdom
                    and their folly. As Aristophanes spoke to them under the mask of folly, and gave
                    utterance to lessons of severe wisdom under that mask; so Plato, on the other
                    hand, put on the mask of the sage, and in grave irony ridiculed and exposed the
                    light-hearted folly of his countrymen. Both were wiser than they seemed to the
                    outward observation; as was indeed the volatile Athenian, to whom they addressed
                    their counsel. Both presupposed that delicacy of perception and quick tact in
                    their fellow-citizens, which would be flattered by such indirect modes of
                    address, and would, at the same time, appreciate the jest of the one, and the
                    irony of the other. Both speak with the freedom of the democratic spirit. But
                    the counsel of Aristophanes is that of the privileged jester of the
                    sovereign-people amidst festal scenes and the enthusiasm of mirth; whilst Plato
                    appeals to the Athenian at the moment of quiet, serious reflection on the
                    surrounding folly, and treats him as a contemplative spectator, rather than
                    himself an actor in it.</p>
                <p>Before the time of Plato, there were no philosophical writings which answered the
                    requisitions of the Athenian mind. There were poems of the early philosophers.
                    There were didactic writings of the later Pythagoreans, and even dialogues
                    discussing speculative questions. Anaxagoras, too, whose name was well known at
                    Athens, had published a treatise of philosophy.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Laertius says that Anaxagoras was the first
                    to publish such a treatise. In <hi rend="italic">Vit</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the Athenian, were calculated to attract his attention. The philosophical poems
                    differed nothing from prose but in the metre, and were exceedingly dry and
                    uninviting to the general reader. The books of Pythagoreans were very few, at
                    least at this time, and hardly known to any but the devoted student of
                    philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must be
                    of the more modern Pythagoreans that Dionysius of Halicarnassus speaks, when he
                    recommends the reading of them, not only for their matter, but for their style.
                    <hi rend="italic">De Vett. Scr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Cens.</hi> iv.</p></note>
                    Nor would the dialogues of Zeno or Euclid, concerned about mere logical
                    subtilties, or the physical discussions of Anaxagoras, possess any charm for the
                    lively Athenian. Even afterwards, the instructive writings of Aristotle did not
                    obtain that reception which could save them from a temporary oblivion. But the
                    dialogues of Plato supplied exactly what was yet wanting in this department of
                    Athenian literature. They were the proper development of the philosophical
                    element in the genius of the people. The shrewd practical talent of the
                    Athenians had been strikingly exhibited in the successful achievements of their
                    great generals and statesmen, and in the lead of Athens itself amongst the
                    states of Greece at the close of the Persian war. Their taste in arts, and
                    poetry, and general literature, had put forth splendid fruits in the works of
                    Athenian artists, Athenian masters of the drama, and of history. But their
                    genius for abstract speculation as yet had nothing which it could claim as
                    strictly its own. Socrates indeed laid the basis for such a work. During the
                    half century preceding the appearance of Plato as the leader of a school of
                    philosophy, Socrates had been engaged as a missionary of philosophy, awakening
                    the curiosity of men; turning their thoughts to reflection on themselves, as
                    creatures endued with moral and intellectual faculties; and inspiring them with
                    longings after some information on questions relating to their own nature, and a
                    taste for discussions addressed to the resolution of such questions. Plato
                    succeeded him, and carried the philosophical spirit, now fully called into
                    action, to its result. His works accordingly display this spirit at its
                    maturity; exemplifying at the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532622"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2622-0023"/>same time that peculiar combination of qualities
                    which formed the Athenian character. Thus are they at once serious and lively,
                    abstract and imaginative; full of deep thought and feeling intermingled with
                    gaiety and humour; instinctive with the awe of religion and ancient wisdom,
                    whilst they present also an image of Athenian versatility, and frivolity, and
                    love of change. They convey indeed a strong rebuke of the vices of the times.
                    They draw, in no softened colouring, outlines of the evil and misery resulting
                    from the profligacy of existing governments, and the excesses of individual
                    cupidity; the two great causes assigned by Plato for the prevailing evil of his
                    times. But these lessons were calculated rather to interest the hearer or reader
                    by their faithful representation of manners, than to alienate him, as we might
                    at first think, by the justness of the censure. Athenians would give their
                    attention to such descriptions, as they did to the invectives of their
                    orators,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. iii 38;
                    Demosth. <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi></p></note> acknowledging the general
                    truth of the representation; and each, at the same time, taking no offence at
                    what he applied to others, and to every one rather than to himself. Philosophy
                    too, taught, as by Plato, colloquially, was such as peculiarly to suit the taste
                    of the Athenian, whose life was in the agora, or the ecclesia, or the courts of
                    law; and who regarded the interchange of words as no unimportant ingredient in
                    everything that he had to do.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    conversation, too, as that of Plato’s Dialogues, elegant conversation, steeped
                    in the well-spring of Grecian literature, and expressed in language such as
                    Jove, it was said, might use, and adorned with the charms of an exquisite
                    musical rhythm, could not but be attractive to Athenian ears. We may see,
                    accordingly, in these circumstances, at once, an occasion for the existence of
                    such writings as those of Plato, and a reason of the peculiar mould in which
                    they were cast, as well as of the success which attended them.</p>
                <p>Not only, however, was the general character of his philosophy, as viewed in
                    connection with the writings which convey it, derived from such influences; but
                    the internal structure of it was the natural result of the peculiar education of
                    such a mind as his, under the circumstances to which we have referred. His
                    philosophy was essentially dialectical or colloquial; an examination and
                    discussion of systems, and doctrines, and opinions. According to his notion, the
                    true philosopher is the dialectician; the investigator, who has fought his way,
                    step by step, through every argument capable of being adduced in support of a
                    particular opinion, refuting those that are unsound, until at length he has
                    found rest in some position that cannot be shaken.<note anchored="true"

                    of no particular system of philosophy, whilst he brings all systems under his
                    survey, and compels all to pay a tribute to his stock of truth, by discussing
                    them, and rejecting in them what will not abide the test of examination. We have
                    seen that he was engaged in studying the doctrines of Heraclitus, and of the
                    Pythagoreans, and of the other schools, whilst he was also a hearer of Socrates.
                    He had thus begun in early life to analyse different systems by the searching
                    method of Socrates; and his mature philosophy was only the same proceeding more
                    deeply imbibed in his own mind, more extensively carried on, and more vigorously
                    applied. So far, indeed, does the colloquial spirit predominate over his
                    philosophy, so entirely dialectical is it in its whole internal character, that
                    it leaves on the mind of the reader more an impression of a series of
                    discussions, in order to the determination of the questions considered, than the
                    conviction of any thing positively determined. Hence it is that Ci cero,
                    speaking of Plato’s writings, says, that “in them nothing is affirmed; and much
                    is discoursed on both sides; everything is inquired into; nothing certain is
                    said.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>CÎC. Acad. Quast,
                    i. 12.</p></note> So also Sextus Empiricus raises the question, in what respect
                    the philosophy of Plato differs from that of the Sceptics.<note anchored="true"

                    clouds, which we seem at the point of grasping, when they vanish from our hands.
                    This effect is doubtless partly to be ascribed to the disguise of his irony; to
                    the artist-design which presides over his whole instruction. But it is also the
                    proper effect of that dialectical philosophy which is worked out in the
                    Dialogues. Whilst he is a consummate artist throughout, he is also illustrating
                    the lessons which he had learnt from Socrates, by bringing false opinions to the
                    test of discussion, and leaving truth, for the most part, to be collected from
                    refutation of error, rather than positively enunciating it, or exactly defining
                    it.</p>
                <p>For when we come to examine his philosophy more closely, we find, that it begins
                    and ends, like the lessons of Socrates, with a confession of the ignorance of
                    man. Socrates had led him to perceive how much was taken for granted in the
                    popular opinions and systems of philosophy; how even those who had a reputation
                    for wisdom and talents took up principles which they had never examined, and
                    which they could not satisfactorily account for, or defend, when pressed in
                    argument. Imbibing, accordingly, the spirit of the Socratic method, he did not
                    endeavour to <hi rend="italic">teach,</hi> in the proper sense of the term, so
                    much as to explore and test the minds of men; to ascertain, how far they really
                    understood the doctrines and opinions which they professed. The fundamental
                    error of the Sophists was, that they assumed all current opinions to be true.
                    They did not think it necessary to examine this preliminary; whether the
                    opinions on which they built their fabric of knowledge were true or false. It
                    was enough for them, that certain opinions were <hi rend="italic">actually</hi>
                    held; and to these, as given principles, they directed their whole system of
                    teaching. Their teaching, accordingly, was entirely ngo⅛ <hi rend="italic"
                    >δοζα,v,</hi> relative to opinion; and it must, consequently, stand, or fall, as
                    existing opinions could be maintained or impugned. Now, with Plato, as with
                    Socrates, the investigation of this preliminary point (that is, whether existing
                    opinions are true or no), is everything. The presumption that they are true, is
                    what he will by no means admit. He demands a positive evidence of them. And as
                    the presumption of their truth is a bar to all inquiry concerning them, he
                    commences with the opposite presumption of their falsehood, or at least a
                    confession on the part of the inquirer, that as yet <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>
                    —until he has investigated,—he does not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">truth</hi> of his opinions.</p>
                <p>For the same reason, he avoids all dogmatism in his conclusions. Those might
                    aspire to communicate the knowledge of new truth to the mind, who, as the
                    Sophists did, assumed that knowledge was entirely subjective; or who held that
                    any opinion which could be produced in the mind, was simply true, was really
                    known, because it was there. But as Plato denied the truth of Opinion, if it had
                    no other evidence, but that of its mere presence in the mind; so, neither would
                    he concede that any process of the mind in itself, or any argumentative and
                    persuasive instructions, could produce, <hi rend="italic">by their own
                    force,</hi> a conviction of truth in the mind. In other words, he required the
                    student of philosophy, not only to begin, but to end, with a confession of the
                    ignorance of man.</p>
                <p>We have an apt illustration of this in the dialogue entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">First</hi><hi rend="italic">Alcibiades.</hi> There Socrates is
                    introduced, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532635" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2635-0024"
                    />questioning Alcibiades concerning his plans of life, and shewing how entirely
                    he had presumed on his knowledge of matters with which he was unacquainted; and
                    that until he . could be brought to feel and confess his ignorance, there was no
                    possibility of his being able to direct himself or others aright.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Meno,</hi> the same is illustrated by the comparison of
                    the effect of the searching questions of Socrates, on the mind of the person
                    submitted to them, to that of the torpedo. Meno says, he had thousands of times,
                    and to many a person, and with much credit to himself, as he thought, spoken on
                    the subject of virtue; but on conversing with Socrates, he was quite at a loss
                    now to say even what virtue was.</p>
                <p>To the same purport is the general application by Socrates in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apologia,</hi> of the oracle which pronounced him the wisest of
                    men. The oracle, he observes, had only used his name by way of example, as if it
                    had said, “He, O men! is the wisest of you, whoever, like Socrates, is
                    convinced, that he is in truth worthless in respect of wisdom.”<note

                <p>The method of Plato, accordingly, is the reverse of didactic. The Sophists could
                    employ a didactic method; because they assumed principles as true, from which
                    they might proceed to argue and persuade. But this was precluded to Plato,
                    assuming, as he did, that all opinions demanded a previous examination. It was
                    necessary for him to extort a confession of ignorance, to make men sensible of
                    the difficulties belonging to a subject. It only remained, therefore, for him to
                    proceed by Interrogation. In a colloquial philosophy, Interrogation is what
                    experiment is in physical inquiry. It is the mode of discovering what the real
                    state of a person’s mind is, in regard to the opinions which he professes. The
                    whole art of Socrates consisted in putting questions to the person with whom he
                    conversed, so that an answer bearing on the point in debate might be elicited;
                    that the grounds on which a given opinion was held might fully appear; and the
                    person’s own answers might open his mind to see it in its proper light. This
                    method Plato has followed out in the interrogatory of his Dialogues. Under such
                    a method of philosophy, the answerer is brought to teach himself. The lesson
                    thus given by the philosopher, consists wholly in the questions which he puts.
                    He preserves, from first to last; the simple character of the inquirer; and he
                    <hi rend="italic">pronounces</hi> only so far as he approves or rejects the
                    answer given.</p>
                <p>The popular opponents of this method called it a method of producing doubt; and
                    regarded it as dangerous to the principles of the young. Plato carefully
                    obviates such a misrepresentation of his proceeding, and guards his method from
                    being confounded with that of the Sophists. The Sophists taught the art of
                    exciting doubts on every subject; a mere effort of gladiatorial skill. They
                    professed to make men apt to cavil and dispute on any given subject.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">" Rep.</hi>
                    vii. p. 177.</p></note> All principles, according to them, were equally stable;
                    all were equally open to be impugned. They, therefore, did not care how they
                    unsettled the minds of men, if their skill could only find materials on which to
                    exercise itself. In Plato’s hands, however, the awakening of doubt has for its
                    object, to remove the unstable ground on which opinions may happen to be rested,
                    and to lead to more settled convictions. With him it is exalted into a regular
                    discipline of the mind. With the Sophists, it was perverted to strengthen that
                    universal scepticism in which their whole teaching was based. So strictly does
                    Plato confine the application of his method to the single purpose of investigat
                    ing the truth, that he strongly objects to the use of it as a mere exercise of
                    ingenuity; lest the young, led on by the pleasure of refuting and perplexing
                    others, should think, at last, that there were no real distinctions of right and
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>Plato seems the more anxious to distinguish his method of inquiry from that of
                    the Sophists, as his method did in some measure resemble theirs. It was
                    inquisitive on every subject, as theirs was. It did superficially appear to be
                    nothing but questioning, and doubting, and cavilling. It did appeal to the
                    reason of every man, and oblige him to see how he could defend his opinions. And
                    on this very ground Socrates had been attacked: for he was accused of corrupting
                    the young, by making them “doubt,” anege/v πo∕ovvra.<note anchored="true"

                    admits that this practice, as pursued by the Sophists, was dangerous to the
                    principles of the young. In fact, he observes it would be even better to suffer
                    them to remain under the guidance of some principles which, though not true,
                    served as restraints on their passions, than to remove everything from their
                    minds, and leave no check whatever to licentious indulgence. By a beautiful
                    illustration, he compares the effect produced by the sophistical method, to the
                    case of a child brought up amidst wealth, and luxury, and high connections, and
                    the society of flatterers, but in ignorance as to his real parentage. Suppose,
                    he observes, such a person to come to know that those, whom hd has hitherto
                    believed to be his parents, are not so, and at the same time not to know who his
                    real parents are. It is clear, that whilst in his state of ignorance concerning
                    his supposed parents, he would respect and attend to them more than to his
                    flatterers; but on finding out his mistake, unless he were of a superior
                    character, such as is rarely met with, he would attend to his flatterers more
                    than to those whom he once supposed to be his parents. So would it be, then, he
                    shews, with one who should find out that the popular principles of morals in
                    which he had been trained, were not the truth, without arriving, at the same
                    time, at the real truth. He would no longer be controlled by those moral
                    principles of which he had discovered the falsehood; but having nothing to
                    substitute in their place, he would give way afterwards, without reserve, to the
                    seductions of pleasures, the flatterers, whose blandishments he had before in
                    some measure resisted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    such a system of cavilling, Plato holds an even course between the scepticism

                    everything without examination.</p>

                    regular system and discipline of the mind, is, what he calls by a term conveying

                    method of contradicting on every subject, and involving the mind in endless
                    perplexity, it was the true art of Discussion. As contrasted with the mere
                    wisdom of opinion, δoξotfop∕α, which the Sophists inculcated, it was philosophy,
                    real science, or knowledge of the truth. The method of his philosophy, and his
                    philosophy itself, thus run up into one, and coincide under the common name of
                    Dialectic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>∆λλa <hi

                <p>To trace the manner in which this coincidence was effected, will lead us to a
                    perception of the true character of Plato’s philosophy, as a system mediating
                    between the dogmatism of the sciolist on the one hand, and the scepticism of the
                    disputant on the other.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis, we observe, on which he founded the whole of his proceeding, was
                    the fallaciousness of Opinion; the Sophists, on the contrary, assuming the truth
                    of Opinion <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532648" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2648-0025"
                    />universally. Whilst to the Sophists every opinion served as a ground of
                    argument, and for them there was no need to look beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it was necessary for Plato, to seek for
                    some Criterion of Truth out of the region of mere Opinion. Commencing with
                    denying the sufficieney of what metaphysicians call subjective truth, or the
                    assumption that whatever is perceived by the mind is true, because it is so
                    perceived; he had to search after objective truth, truth independent of the mind
                    of man, and exempt from the contingencies and variations of human judgment, as a
                    foundation of his system of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis, accordingly, of the fallaciousness of Opinion from which his
                    Method set out, involved a corresponding hypothesis in philosophy of the
                    fallaciousness of the senses. It is the joint application of these two
                    fundamental principles that combines his Method and his Philosophy in one
                    master-science of <hi rend="smallcaps">dialectic.</hi> Opinion, aecording to
                    him, is the kind of knowledge derived from the information of the senses, and is
                    therefore no proper knowledge at all, but mere belief or persuasion, <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;sιστις</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereas true knowledge is
                    founded on that which is purely apprehended by the intellect, without any
                    intervention whatever of the senses. Dialectic, as it is philosophy, is
                    conversant about that which is, or which has <hi rend="smallcaps">being,</hi> as
                    contrasted with presentations to the senses, which have only the semblance of
                    Being; as it is a method, it investigates the reason, or account of the Being of
                    everything ;—the account of everything as it is, and not as it <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">appears</hi>; not being satisfied, like its sophistical
                    counterpart, with opinions of which no account can be given, but bringing all to
                    the test of exact argument and definition.</p>
                <p>In order, therefore, to give his Method a firm basis, and his philosophy a
                    distinct object, it was required, that he should establish a sound theory of
                    Being, or, in other words, a sure Criterion of Truth. Such, then, was his
                    celebrated Theory of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ideas.</hi></p>
                <p>There are four distinct views embraced in this theory as it is developed by
                    Plato; four phases, as it were, under which it is presented.</p>
                <p>I. The first, and most strictly Platonic view of it, according to what we have
                    already stated, is in its connection with logical science. None of the great
                    philosophers before Plato; none, that is, of those who had speculated on the
                    universe at large, as Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras,
                    were conversant with logical science. Zeno the Eleatic, and Euclid of Megara,
                    were known indeed as dialecticians. But the kind of logical science which they
                    professed, was a rude and imperfect art, consisting chiefly in the knowledge and
                    use of particular fallacies, and not founded in any deep study of the nature of
                    thought and reasoning. They were, besides, mere dialecticians, rather than
                    philosophers in the most extended sense of the term. Plato’s mind, however,
                    while it was engaged in logical studies, was also no less intent on the
                    investigation of the first principles of all things. And, as has been often
                    observed in other casés, the favourite study of his mind gave its complexion to
                    his theory of first principles, or doctrine of Ideas.</p>
                <p>The term “Idea” does not indeed convey to the understanding of a modern any
                    notion of a connection of the theory with logical science. In our acceptation,
                    it belongs exclusively to metaphysics. But in Plato’s view there was no
                    separation of the two branches of logic and metaphysics. Both were closely
                    united in the one science to which he gave the name of Dialectic, and which was
                    accordingly at once a science of the internal reason,—that is, of the processes
                    of the mind in its silent speculation on things; and of the external
                    reason,—that is, of the processes of the mind in communicating its speculations
                    to others in words. The terms, therefore, belonging to the one process, are
                    indiscriminately applied to the other. Thus, to “give a reason” of the being of
                    a thing, <hi rend="italic">διδοναι λογον της ουσιας,</hi> was equivalent to a
                    scientific view of it; and the word <hi rend="italic">λογoς</hi> denoted at once
                    the terms of language by which that reason was expressed, and the reason itself
                    as it existed in the mind. Thus, too, the word <hi rend="italic">ιδεαι,</hi> or
                    ideas, was only a little varied from the logical term <hi rend="italic"
                    >ε'.δη,</hi> or species, which indeed is sometimes substituted for it in the
                    phraseology of Plato. The simplicity, accordingly, and invariableness, and
                    universality, which belong to terms denoting the agreement of a variety of
                    objects in certain characteristics, were transferred to supposed counterparts in
                    the mind itself, or to the notions represented by the terms which are the name
                    of the species. Hence the idea, or <hi rend="italic">eidos,</hi> was conceived
                    to be, rot simply a result of a process of the mind, but something <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> the mind, and as having a being independent of the mind
                    itself. As the species expressed in words was universal, so its counterpart in
                    the mind was the universal nature in which the individuals to which it referred,
                    participated. In that, the mind, perplexed by the variety and anomaly of
                    individual objects, found an invariable sameness. In the contemplation of it,
                    the mind no longer wavered and doubted, but obtained a fixedness of view. The
                    idea, or species, therefore, was to be explored and reached in order to a just
                    theory of everything, and was in itself that theory.</p>
                <p>Further, as there is a relative classification of objects by means of words; some
                    standing for characteristics common to a greater number of objects, whilst
                    others stand for characteristics of only some out of that number; this property
                    of words was in like manner conceived to have its counterpart in the mind. A
                    graduated series of species was supposed to exist, first in the mind, and then
                    independent of the mind, by means of which, as by steps, the mind might rise to
                    the highest species, the ultimate idea itself, in which all others were
                    comprehended. And hence there was no real perfect science but that which
                    penetrated to this ultimate nature or being; and all other ideas, or theories,
                    were truly scientific only as they participated in this.</p>
                <p>This notion of “participation” of the ideas, was a still further application of
                    logical language to the business of philosophy in general. For, as the several
                    particulars belonging to a species all possess those characteristics which
                    constitute their species, as well as those which connect them with a higher
                    species or genus of which they are the species, their logical description is
                    made up of an enumeration of those characteristics, together with the name of
                    the higher class or genus under which the whole species is included. The higher
                    class is an ingredient in the specification of a lower; or, conversely, a lower
                    class participates in a higher. So Plato considered everything in the universe,
                    as being what it is, by a “participation” of the Ideas; and consequently, that
                    to explore its nature we must ascertain the idea which thus constitutes it. The
                    Pythagoreans before him spoke of things as existing by “assimilation” to the
                    essential being. Plato’s logical views occasioned this change of phraseology;
                    for he varied only the term, as Aristotle observes, whilst he followed the
                    Pythagoreans as masters in the fundamental conception of his theory.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aíistot. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mela-ρh,</hi> i. 6.</p></note> Aristotle, indeed, whilst he assigns the logical
                    studies of Plato as the occasion of the form of the ideal theory, more
                    particularly accounts for the theory, from Plato’s observation of the importance
                    of definitions in the ethical discussions of Socrates. Plato found how effectual
                    an instrument Definition had been in the hands of Socrates in silencing the
                    impertinencies of false opinion on moral subjects. As it had brought moral
                    questions to an issue, so it might be applied, he thought, generally, as a stay
                    to the extravagancies of opinion on all subjects whatever. Accordingly he had
                    only to generalize the principle of definitions, and the result was the theory
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532661" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2661-0026"/>Ideas, or
                    the universal science of reasons, and ultimate criterion of all truth.</p>
                <p>To understand, however, rightly how Plato was led by logical considerations to
                    his theory of Ideas, we should observe more particularly what his view was of
                    the nature of logic. We should greatly misapprehend him if we supposed that he
                    had that notion of the science which has prevailed since the systematic
                    exposition of it by Aristotle. As it was conceived by Plato, it answered
                    strictly to its original name of dialectic, rather than to that of logic; being
                    the art of discussion, or the art of drawing forth the truth from the mind by
                    questioning, rather than the art of deducing consequences from given principles.
                    It was a higher, more comprehensive science, than the art of Deduction. For it
                    was conversant about the discovery and establishment of principles; whereas the
                    logical science which is employed about Deduction, assumes the principles in
                    order to speculate about their consequences. It left the latter inquiry to be
                    pursued by subsequent research, whilst the more ambitious flight of those who
                    first speculated on the nature of Discourse was directed to the discovery of
                    truth. In Plato’s hands it was an energetic reform of the quibbling shallow
                    logic, which was as yet known and practised in the schools. This logic had no
                    concern for truth, but only for victory and display. It consisted in a skill of
                    wielding certain sophisms, known by familiar names in the schools, and founded
                    on the equivocations of words. An appearance of truth being all that it aimed
                    at, it did not exact of the student any consideration of the nature of things.
                    It was enough that he could give the word reason, the mere logos, the symbol or
                    counter. He was not taught to go beyond this legerdemain of language, or to
                    search out the reason of the being of things, and correct the paralogisms
                    involved in the use of words, by reference to the realities represented by them.
                    This sophistical method affected indeed to be a didactic art; to instruct and
                    furnish the mind with principles applicable to every subject of discussion. It
                    considered, forsooth, language as an universal science of nature already
                    constructed; and, proceeding on this supposition, professed to enable the
                    student to apply the wisdom already embodied in language, to the purpose of
                    appearing wise himself, and imparting to others the same apparent wisdom. But
                    going no further than this, it ended in mere <hi rend="italic">δοζα,</hi> mere
                    opinion. It produced, that is, in the result, only a wavering state of mind,
                    subject to be changed by every new impression of opposite arguments, and
                    imparted no steady knowledge.</p>
                <p>It was a great reform, then, which Plato undertook, in following up the example
                    proposed in the conversations of Socrates, and instituting a proper science of
                    Dialectic, a science of the reason of the being of things. It was a change from
                    an empirical system, a vain art of words, to a scientific method or
                    investigation of the reasons themselves, on which an instructive use of words
                    must be founded.</p>
                <p>For, we must observe, it was still a science of words which he teaches as the
                    true logic or dialectic. It had throughout a reference to discussion. Still it
                    was a real science as compared with the verbal and technical logic of his
                    predecessors. Though it was a science of words, it had for its object the
                    determination of such words as should fully correspond to their intention as
                    symbols, in characterizing the proper being of the thing denoted. These reasons
                    of the being of things, the <hi rend="italic">"kογοι της ουσιας,</hi> were the
                    Ideas.</p>
                <p>His logical method, accordingly, was an analytical, inductive method. Setting out
                    on the assumption of the erroneousness of opinion as such, it examines
                    hypothesis after hypothesis on each subject proposed for discussion, rejecting
                    and excluding, as it proceeds, everything irrelevant.</p>
                <p>The scrutiny instituted consists in searching for the grounds of contradiction
                    with regard to each opinion, and shewing that opposite views on point after
                    point in the matter discussed, are at least as tenable as the assumptions
                    contained in the given opinion or hypothesis. Hence it consists almost entirely
                    of refutation, or what both he and Aristotle denominate <hi rend="italic"
                    >elenchus,</hi> a process of reasoning by which the contradictory of a given
                    conclusion is inferred.</p>
                <p>A method of this kind was calculated fully to put to the test every unsound
                    opinion. It collected everything that could be said either for or against a
                    given opinion. It made the maintainer of it state on what grounds he maintained
                    it, what consequences followed from it; and either forced him to
                    self-contradiction in his defence of it, or obliged him to modify it according
                    to the requisitions of the argument. And the result was, that whatever stood its
                    ground after this complete sifting of the question, might be regarded as stable
                    truth. When refutation had done its utmost, and all the points of difficulty and
                    objection had been fully brought out, the dialectical process had accomplished
                    its purpose; and the affirmative which remained after this discussion might be
                    regarded as setting forth the truth of the question under consideration. For
                    everything connected with it, and yet not founded in the truth of things, was
                    then removed. And the result therefore might be accepted as a simple truth of
                    being, an object which the eye of the intellect might steadily contemplate.</p>
                <p>The process throughout corresponds with the process of investigation in modern
                    philosophy. Only we must conceive the dialectical investigation of Plato as
                    nothing more than an admirable scheme for clearing a question of everything
                    foreign to it; whilst the latter draws out the true law of nature from the
                    promiscuous assemblage of phenomena under which it is presented to observation,
                    and concealed until analysis has done its work on the mass. The nomenclature of
                    the two methods varies accordingly. Argument is the instrument of the former;
                    experiment that of the latter. Refutation is the primary business of the former;
                    rejection and exclusion of irrelevant phenomena that of the latter. Definitions
                    of words, as they are signs of the being of things, are the result of the
                    former; whilst the latter developes laws of nature.</p>
                <p>Both processes are carried on by Interrogation. But whereas the analysis which
                    investigates a law of nature proceeds by interrogation of nature, the analysis
                    of Plato’s dialectic proceeds by interrogation of the mind, in order to discover
                    the true being or idea of the thing discussed. Therefore it was that Socrates
                    called his art, in his own playful manner, <hi rend="italic">μαιευμα,</hi> a
                    kind of midwifery;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    delivering of the mind of the notions with which it was pregnant. Thus the
                    dialectic of Plato, being entirely directed to observation on the mind, and not
                    to external nature, takes the state of knowledge as it exists in the mind for
                    the ground of its proceeding. It deals with things; that is, as they exist in
                    the forms of thought; going, as Plato says, “from species to species, until it
                    arrives at the principle of all things,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Jieμ.</hi> vi. p. 124.</p></note> and
                    following throughout the steps by which the mind advances in obtaining an exact
                    view of any object of its contemplation. It is, in fact, the true thought spoken
                    out. The process of thinking by which it is attained, is the dialectical process
                    of interrogation. The decision of the mind when its conviction is settled, is
                    the dialectical conclusion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The chief logical instrument employed in this method is division. The being able
                    to divide according to genera, and not to consider the same species as
                    different, nor a different one as the same, is stated to belong especially to

                    strike the attention. General ideas being founded on general resemblances of
                    objects, the first step towards a more distinct idea of an object is to see that
                    the generalization is complete; that it neither excludes nor includes any
                    objects which it ought not to exclude or include. The true idea of any object
                    would be that which characterized every object belonging to the idea, and none
                    other. The analysis accordingly pursued by Plato is conversant about Division,
                    using the induction of particulars in subordination to this.<note

                    find, indeed, a constant use of Induction by Plato, after the manner of
                    Socrates. But it is always in reference to the main purpose of determining, not
                    a general fact, but the dominant Idea in every object of thought.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we may observe, the Dialectic of Plato is truly a method of
                    investigation, though it does not penetrate to the depth of the modern analysis.
                    It employed deductive reasonings; but these were not essential parts of its
                    method; since the whole was a process of ascent to the theory of the Ideas.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, indeed, Dialectic approximated to what is now commonly understood by
                    Logic. The transition was first to the consideration of it as a method of
                    drawing out the probable conclusions deducible from given premises. This was
                    natural. For in Plato’s method every opinion was admitted as an hypothesis to be
                    examined, in order to rejecting the falsehood and eliciting the truth that might
                    be contained in it; and so far his Dialectic might be regarded as a speculation
                    on probabilities. This transition prepared the way for a further one, when
                    Dialectic became strictly the science of Deduction. Attention would be drawn
                    more and more to the use of words as instruments of reasoning, when Dialectic
                    was once exalted into the rank of a science.</p>
                <p>The progress seems to be this. The science being cultivated primarily with a view
                    to discussion, the importance of language in order to reasoning could not fail,
                    from the first direction of the mind in this channel, to strike the
                    philosophical observer. The phenomena of sophistical argument would suggest the
                    necessity of inquiry into words as they are employed in reasoning. Philosophers,
                    accordingly, would be led to examine into the nature of words considered as
                    signs and representatives of thought. Thus they would proceed to arrange words
                    into classes, according to their import in this respect. Thus would be obtained
                    that great division of words into those that denote an individual alone, and
                    those that stand both for many and for one, or into singular and common ;—the
                    fundamental principle of logic properly so called, or of logic as the science is
                    now considered. The use of Division and Definition would soon appear. These
                    processes, indeed, would be naturally discovered in the very prosecution of
                    discussions addressed to the refutation of false opinions and popular fallacies.
                    The early dialectics, accordingly, abounded in the use of them.<note

                    363.) Plato appears to have been the author of a work “On Divisions,” not now
                    extant.</p></note> Afterwards, as the analytical power of language came to be
                    more particularly observed, the connections of words in propositions and
                    arguments would attract speculation. The possibility of exhibiting any given
                    proposition or argument under abstract formulae, in which unmeaning symbols were
                    substituted for the terms themselves of the proposition or argument, would at
                    length be discovered. Thus in the result would be erected a formal science of
                    logic, in which language would be considered as an artificial system of signs,
                    and the validity of arguments would be explored, independently of the
                    subject-matter about which they happen to be conversant.</p>
                <p>When Plato, however, drew his Theory of Ideas from the logical speculations in
                    which his mind was engaged, there was no such system as that now found in
                    treatises of logic. There are the materials in the writings of Plato for
                    constructing a method of dialectic, such as the science presented itself to his
                    view; but that method remains, even to this day, to be fully explored and
                    stated. It is clear that he had such a system, and that his writings proceed on
                    regular method; though he has nowhere accurately sketched it, and perhaps never
                    even proposed it to himself in the form of a system. His thoughts were engaged
                    in this, as in other subjects, in giving the great outlines of his philosophy.
                    It was enough for him to have seized the bearings of logical truth on all truth;
                    and to this general view of the science he has made everything secondary and
                    subservient.</p>
                <p>II. The next aspect under which the Theory of Ideas should be considered, is that
                    in which it sums up and measures the infinites of the sensible world. In this
                    point of view it more immediately represented its Pythagorean prototype, than
                    under its logical aspect. It is in reference to this intention of the theory
                    that Aristotle objects, that whilst it professes to give the account of things,
                    it introduces an additional number of objects in the Ideas themselves; an
                    absurdity, he observes, like that of attempting to facilitate a calculation by
                    adding to the numbers to be calculated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the individuals of the universe, and exhibit their sum in one statement. As
                    Plato’s logical speculations gave their colour to his whole philosophy, so the
                    devotion of the Pythagoreans to mathematics led them to form a mathematical
                    theory of the universe. The universal nature of number gave them the ground for
                    this application of their peculiar studies. For all things are in number; and
                    there is nothing from which the notion of number may not be abstracted. That
                    number, then, which alone measures all other numbers,—Unity, —would be regarded
                    as the common measure of all things. And thus the philosophy of the universe
                    would be reduced to a system of calculation; and the infinity of existing things
                    summed up in definite proportions of numbers. The Greek word <hi rend="italic"
                    >logos,</hi> whilst it combined in it the notions of “word” and “reason,” also
                    further combined that of “ratio,” and reasoning and calculating were expressed
                    by the one term <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">aγιζε(fyaι.</hi> This
                    marks the connected trains of thought by which the arithmetical theory of the
                    Pythagoreans was formed. The effects of this combination of thought are seen,
                    not only in the fundamental conception of the theory, but in our ordinary
                    phraseology on the subject of reasoning even at this day; as, for example, in
                    our use of the word “Term,”—that is, “limit,” or “boundary,”—for words, not only
                    in their logical signification, but even in their familiar use.<note

                    phraseology throughout. Reasoning, with him, is “reckoning,” and words are

                <p>It appears to have struck the mind of Plato that the theory of the Pythagoreans
                    was not sufficiently comprehensive, or even ultimate, as an account of the Being
                    of things. The simplicity of Number did not adequately explain the great variety
                    of natures found in the universe; and though the science of Arithmetic held
                    almost the highest place in his scale of knowledge, on account of its
                    abstract<pb break="no" facs="nls:193532687" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2687-0028"/>
                    nature, and its leading to the consideration of Being, apart from the changeable
                    objects of sense; he still viewed it as practically implicated with the physical
                    sciences, and, as such, therefore, not strictly and exclusively conversant about
                    Being. In like manner, the science of Geometry, though purer than the physical
                    sciences, as being conversant only about abstract magnitudes, is excluded from
                    the highest place. Geometry, no less than Arithmetic, might seem to be simply an
                    intellectual contemplation; since, though it employs visible figures in its
                    demonstrations, the demonstrations do not refer to these, but to the abstract
                    notions which the diagrams represent. Yet Geometry, as it assumes its
                    principles, and its truths consequently depend on assumptions which in
                    themselves demand evidence, cannot, he observes, rank as perfect
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>Perfect intelligence, <hi rend="italic">vοησις,</hi> implies an absolute stay to
                    dte thought; something beyond which no further inquiry .can be made, which may
                    be seen as it were by the mind’s eye immediately in itself. And such an object
                    only is furnished by the Idea. Though, accordingly, Plato thus carried his
                    theory beyond that of the Pythagoreans, we find him still cherishing the
                    Pythagorean doctrine of Number, by assigning to it the second place in his scale
                    of knowledge, and only barely distinguishing it, in regard to scientific value,
                    from his own Theory of Ideas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    for example, astronomy and music, are not truly scientific, because, addressing
                    themselves to what is passing before the senses in the world, they do not
                    consider the immoveable beings themselves, which are only imperfectly
                    represented in the observed physical movements. The astronomer computes the
                    actual velocities of the heavenly bodies; the musician counts the intervals
                    of∙sounds. But neither of these is intent on the real beings, the Ideas
                    themselves of velocity and of harmony. We can discern in such language as this,
                    a mathematical basis of thought. Perpetual variations, as contemplated in their
                    inconstancy, admit of no calculation. To estimate them, we must find the limit
                    to which they continually approximate, and we thus, as it were, reduce to fixed
                    order the apparent disorder and irregularity, and see the variable in its
                    ultimate form of invariableness. This notion is not fully developed by Plato.
                    But it is conveyed in his doctrine of a twofold class of sciences, under the
                    same names; a popular astronomy, for example, and an higher astronomy; a popular

                <p>III. The third phasis of the Theory is that in which it is a philosophy of Being,
                    in opposition to the mere knowledge of sensible phenomena. According to the
                    school of Heraclitus, the sensible world was ever flowing, ever in a state of
                    becoming or incipiency; being a mere development of successive phenomena,
                    displacing each other without cessation. As duration is no positive existence as
                    a whole, but is made up of an infinite number of moments, each of which is gone
                    as the succeeding moment appears; so was it asserted generally in the doctrine
                    of that school, that every object in the universe was a mere collection of
                    successive phenomena. Of nothing could it be affirmed that it is. The very
                    sensations, no less than the objects of them, were in constant production; being
                    the momentary, ever-varying results of the concourse of agent and patient.
                    Colour, for example, as the object, and sight of the colour in the eye as the
                    sensation, are momentary relations simultaneously produced by something that
                    acts in the coloured object at the moment, on something that receives the
                    impression in the eye.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">* .Tħe&lt;rtet.</hi><hi rend="italic"/></p></note> This
                    doctrine resolved all knowledge into sensation, and (which was equivalent to
                    this) made “man the measure of all things,” according to the celebrated
                    enunciation of Protagoras.</p>
                <p>Plato saw, that if these view’s were admitted as an account of the universe, his
                    whole dialectic must fall to the ground. It would be nothing but miserable
                    trifling to try to call forth those reasons of things which he conceived to be
                    in the mind, if knowledge were of this fluctuating character.<note

                    p. 90.</p></note> There could not, in fact, be then any such reasons. There was
                    nothing stable, nothing that remained in the mind, to serve as the standing
                    criterion of true and false opinions. There would be no distinguishing whether
                    all that passed in life were not a dream, or whether the occurrences in dreams
                    were not rather the realities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> þ. 82.</p></note> Some sure
                    criterion was therefore wanted, to which the phenomena of sensation might be
                    referred. The theory of Ideas, as a theory of Being, furnished this.</p>
                <p>Plato admitted, accordingly, the perpetual flux of sensations and their objects,
                    as taught by Heraclitus, whilst he refuted the sophistical extravagancies into
                    which the doctrine had been carried. Granting, therefore, that there was no test
                    of truth or falsehood in the sensations themselves, he points out, that the
                    ground of fallaciousness is in the judgments formed by the mind concerning the
                    impressions of the senses. The soul is endued with a common power of perception,
                    to which the reports of the different senses are referred, and by means of which
                    the mind is enabled to compare past and present· sensations of the same kind, as
                    also different sensations with one another. It is in the conclusions then formed
                    on these comparisons that we are to seek for knowledge; or in the purely mental
                    processes, abandoning altogether the mere informations of sense.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    pp. 139-144.</p></note></p>
                <p>He was led, accordingly, to examine these processes of the mind, in order to
                    discover the grounds of truth and knowledge. He observed, that when the mind
                    compares two sensations, and decides on their similarity or difference, there is
                    always some ground on which that judgment is made. When, for instance, it
                    decides on the equality of two things, there is a standard to which they are
                    referred, the general notion of equality itself, which serves as a middle term
                    for testing the equality of the two things compared. In like manner, there is
                    always, whenever a comparison is made by the mind, some general principle, which
                    is the medium of the comparison. And this is a principle not in any w∙ay
                    produced by the sensations; for it is evidently prior to them, and independent
                    of them; being appealed to by the mind as a criterion of them. This general
                    principle, then, is in every instance the Idea; and not being formed by the
                    sensations, it is not subject to their variableness. It remains unmoved, and the
                    same, amidst the flow of the sensations, or of the objects of the
                    sensations;—the standing criterion of all the judgments of the mind to which it
                    applies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Hence we may see the peculiar meaning of the term, “Idea” in Plato’s philosophy.
                    It consists in its contrast with the objects of sensation. The latter never
                    attain to any definite perfect form—to any clear outline, as it were, to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193532700" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2700-0029"/> the eye. They
                    flow and have vanished before they could attain to such form; since, in the very
                    succeeding one another, they not only pass away, but undergo alteration. But the
                    standard to which they are referred in the mind, is a positive defined shade, or
                    form, or species, simple and uniform, analogous to an object of sight of which
                    we can clearly trace the whole outline by the eye.<note anchored="true"

                    light of a pattern, to which they would be conformed, but for that incessant
                    mutability which necessarily belongs to them. This, however, was rather the
                    Pythagorean view of general principles than the Platonic, though Plato himself
                    not unfrequently recurs to it.</p>
                <p>Plato, at the same time, in thus constituting Ideas the sole absolute criteria of
                    real existence, did not intend to deny all reality whatever to conclusions drawn
                    from our sensible experience, such as those of the physical sciences. But he
                    means, in the first place, to shew the delusive character of all informations of
                    sense which are not corrected by the internal reason of the mind. In the next
                    place, his design is to point out the inferior knowledge which every other kind
                    of evidence conveys, but that which is drawn from the intuitive perceptions of
                    the mind. The mere informations of sense, he teaches, are only a knowledge of
                    semblances or idols, <hi rend="italic">εικασια,</hi> conjecture founded on mere
                    images of the truth. He describes this kind of knowledge by an admirable
                    illustration from a supposed case of men placed in a long cavern, with their
                    bodies so chained from infancy, that they can only look before them, whilst the
                    light of a fire from behind casts on the side opposite to them, the shadows of
                    vessels, and statues of stone and wood, carried along a track leading upwards
                    from the cavern by persons who are themselves concealed by a wall, like the
                    exhibitors of puppets. As men so circumstanced would see nothing of themselves,
                    and of each other, or of the things thus carried along, but the shadows, they
                    would mistake the shadows for the realities; they would speak of the shadows as
                    if these were the things; and if any voice was heard from the persons carrying
                    along the figures, they would think the sounds proceeded from the passing
                    shadow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    like this, he declares, is the influence of education in the lower world of
                    sense on the minds of men. They must be carried up from this cavern, in which
                    they see everything only by an artificial light, to the light of the sun itself,
                    to the region of Ideas, where alone objects are seen as they are in
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>As to the knowledge conveyed by the physical sciences, neither is this properly
                    science. It amounts only, as he states it, to belief or opinion. These are less
                    intellectual than the mathematical sciences, because they are conversant about
                    human opinions and desires, or about the production and composition of things,
                    or about the means of sustaining things produced and compounded.<note

                    the things about which they are. But they are still not devoid of evidence, so
                    far as they collect t⅛h real informations of the senses, and do not learn
                    from*mere shadows. This is implied in his calling such knowledge belief, and
                    distinguishing it from conjecture; though he is rigid in preserving the
                    exclusive prerogative of Truth to the knowledge of the Ideas.</p>
                <p>The evidence of Experience was necessarily slighted in such a philosophy, and
                    condemned as insufficient for the discovery of truth. For what is Experience but
                    the memory of several similar previous informations of sense, combined into one
                    general conclusion? And though Aristotle allows that such a general conclusion,
                    in which the mind acquiesces, might be regarded as scientific,<note

                    not be admitted by a philosopher who placed the objects of sensation out of the
                    pale of Being. It was not enough for Plato’s system to answer in favour of the
                    scientific value of Experience, that though this and that particular instance of
                    an information of sense had no immoveable truth in it, yet, from the observation
                    of a number of similar instances, a general uniformity might be inferred, and an
                    immoveable general principle established. He would grant that generalization was
                    a corrective of experience. For this he did when he granted some importance to
                    the arts in education, and for the purposes of life. But truth with him must be
                    <hi rend="italic">universal,</hi> not simply general: it must be that which is
                    always the same, not simply that which is for the most part. And the highest
                    degree of the evidence of experience, even that which amounts to what is called
                    moral certainty, falls short of this absolute universality. It might be urged,
                    for example, that though what was sweet to one person and at one time, might be
                    bitter to another person and at another time; and though what seemed the same
                    sensation of sweet, was not in fact the same at two successive moments, but a
                    reproduction; still it was possible, by combining recollections of many similar
                    instances, to form a general notion which should adequately characterize that
                    sensation. Still Plato would say, this was only belief or opinion, and not
                    science. The object of science must be such as cannot be otherwise: it must be
                    absolutely one and the same permanent being: you must altogether quit the stream
                    of the world of sense, and land on the rock of unchangeable eternal Being.</p>
                <p>Thus Rhetoric is strongly reprobated by Plato, on the very ground on which it is
                    systematically taught by Aristotle, of its being nothing more than an instrument
                    of persuasion, or an art speculating on the means of persuasion. Much of his
                    invective indeed derives its point from its application to the servile
                    rhetoricians of his day. Still we find him condemning Rhetoric on the abstract
                    ground of its having no higher view than persuasion. In the modern view of the
                    subject, as in Aristotle’s, Rhetoric is a real science, so far as it is framed
                    on just conclusions respecting those modes of speaking, or writing, which excite
                    interest and produce conviction. With Plato it is mere quackery; and for this
                    reason, that it is founded on experience of what persuades, being only an <hi

                    with the world; an accomplishment, learned by practice, without any real
                    knowledge, in flattering the passions of men. He in fact regarded Experience as
                    corresponding with what we call empiricism; contrasting it with the conclusions
                    of abstract reason, as we contrast an illiterate and unscientific use of
                    experience with that of the philosopher.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Looking to that sort of experience on which the popular teaching of the Sophists
                    was founded, Plato, we should say, was fully justified in his condemnation of
                    the experimental method of his day. It was in truth mere quackery. It was
                    contentwith shadow’s and images of the truth, and entirely directed <hi

                    shallow philosophy of sensation, not founded in the nature of things. He had
                    thus to contend against a system, which distorted that criterion of truth, which
                    man has in himself, by the right use of his reason conjointly with his
                    experience, to the undermining of all truth and reality. This empirical system
                    was the crying evil of those times.</p>

                <p>It had infected politics, and education, and private intercourse, as well as
                    philosophy. In opposition to it, he had to take up an antithetical position; to
                    call in question the existing acceptation and use of the human criterion of
                    truth; to limit it within its proper bounds, and guard against its perversion.
                    Accordingly the whole stress of his philosophy is on this point. It is a
                    perpetual polemic against the sophistical principle, that “man is the measure of
                    all things.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    scientific value of Experience, and insisting on the necessity of the existence
                    of higher principles than those of Experience, in order that the mind may duly
                    receive and appreciate the information of sense. He taught men, at any rate, to
                    perceive that the popular notion of that evidence of truth which man has in his
                    own nature was false and deceptive, and that in all judgments and reasonings
                    there is also something more than is merely of man.</p>
                <p>IV. The fourth leading point of view under which the Theory of Ideas remains to
                    be considered, is its aspect as it is a theory of the Cause of the universe.
                    Under this aspect it is identified with the speculation into the Chief Good.
                    Here it is an account at once of the first principle of motion, and of the end
                    to which all things tend as their perfection and ultimate good. According to
                    Plato, there was no other cause worthy of the name, or which really accounted
                    for the phenomena of the universe, but “The Good,” or, as it is technically
                    called, the Final Cause. The early speculations of philosophers had been chiefly
                    directed to the material phenomena of the universe, and had attempted to account
                    for them in a rude manner, by referring them to some one or more of the material
                    elements. Some indeed had introduced also moral influences into their theory.
                    The Pythagoreans combined with their speculation of the mysterious Unity, the
                    notion of Love as the one-making principle. The Ionic school, however, appears
                    to have led the opinion of philosophers in regard to the cause of the universe
                    at the time of Plato. And though Anaxagoras asserted the ascendancy of mind, he
                    had lost sight of his great theory in the explanations from material causes, to
                    which he descended in the completion of his system. Socrates began a strenuous
                    opposition to the physical philosophers. Plato carried on that opposition, and,
                    blending the familiar ethics of Socrates with the moral and theological
                    mysticism of the Pythagoreans, established the Final Cause or theory of “the
                    Good,” as supreme over the domain of science.</p>
                <p>Anaxagoras had certainly prepared the way for the theory. Plato took up his
                    doctrine of a Divine Intelligence, and gave it that development which, as it had
                    been taught by Anaxagoras himself, it yet waited to receive. It was but a vain
                    theory of a Supreme Mind (sublime and important as the simple enunciation of the
                    great truth was), <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> which did not also exhibit the
                    Supreme Mind as operating in the universe by design, and as diffusing the energy
                    of its intelligence and goodness, as well as of its power, throughout its
                    operations.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Mind, therefore, according to Plato, must be conceived, as
                    exemplifying the attributes of its own nature in the works which have proceeded
                    from it. If it be granted that there is a Supreme Mind, that must be the true
                    measure of all things in the universe. All things must have been framed
                    according to the scheme which such a mind would contemplate in their production.
                    As intelligence, it cannot be regarded but as working for some object, <hi
                    rend="italic">ενεκα τοt</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for
                    by this is intelligence distinguished from unintelligent force; and the only
                    object to the supreme intelligence is the most perfect nature, which is itself.
                    The pattern of its own per feetions, therefore, must have been present to it,
                    and in its design, in the construction of the universe. In other words, the
                    Deity himself is not only the author of all things, but he has designed to
                    exemplify in them his own attributes. The principle, accordingly, by which all
                    true philosophy must hold, and which it must carry out into its speculations,
                    is, that “God is the measure of all things.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De Leg. ∏∙.</hi></p></note> And hence,
                    whenever the proper being of any thing is to be explored, it must be studied in
                    that light in which it is seen as a work of the Supreme Mind, designed after the
                    pattern of the divine perfections. In such a contemplation, the theory of the
                    Best is the view by which philosophy must be guided; for, in ancient philosophy,
                    an object of intelligent aim, and good, are equivalent terms. The object at
                    which the most perfect intelligence aims, must be, therefore, that which is
                    best; and in tracing out, accordingly, the workings of the Divine Mind in the
                    world, we must look for “the best” in everything. That notion of everything by
                    which it is “best,” is both its real nature, and the cause of its being
                    produced.</p>
                <p>But why is not everything, as it is actually seen, a work of “the best ?” why is
                    not good visibly impressed on everything as it stands forth to the view? why
                    must we, in short, resort to the Idea of good, in order to ascertain its nature,
                    instead of taking it simply as it appears?</p>
                <p>The antagonist force of unreason in the nature of that which has body, and is
                    apprehended by the senses, occasions all the imperfection and evil in the world,
                    as the world actually exists. It subsisted already in the mass of disorder and
                    confusion which the Divine intelligence, by its operation, had brought into
                    order and regularity of motion; and it still subsists, though reduced into
                    subordination to intelligence. It is overruled so as to minister to the designs
                    of mind, but still impedes by its contrariety of nature the development of good
                    in the world. And thus Plato says that it is impossible for evils to perish out
                    of the world, for that there must ever exist a contrariety to good.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aroasvθα&lt; τα <hi

                    presence of good; as contraries are displaced by contraries; and as all
                    generation, or production, is carried on by a process from contrary to contrary.
                    Thus, though evil retires before good in the world of generated things, evil
                    still manifests itself in the very act of its retiring before good; and a
                    perpetual opposition of good and evil remains. What we see, accordingly, in the
                    world, is not the perfect accomplishment of good, but effort and tendency after
                    good in all things. The effects of a struggle between reason and unreason are
                    manifested, on the one hand, in the evanescent imperfect nature of all sensible
                    things; and, on the other hand, in their constant renewing, or in that undying
                    vigour with which they flow on, and are reproduced, and aim at a perfection
                    beyond themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Though, therefore, the Divine Artificer has designed everything in the world for
                    the best, they are not actually the best as they are presented to our senses.
                    They are the best that such things can be, but they do not attain to the Idea of
                    good, according to which they have been made. Time, for example, only
                    imperfectly represents the divine eternity, which is its true Idea. In eternity
                    there is no distinction of past, present, and future. But the bodily nature will
                    not admit of this co-instantaneous development of the divine Idea. Existence is
                    here broken up into successive moments; and these successive moments, marked by
                    the periodic motions of the heavenly bodies, introduce the distinctions of
                    number into the simple idea of duration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ttruceitιι.</hi></p></note> Again, the
                    velocities of the heavenly bodies, which are observed by the astronomer, must be
                    conceived as very inadequate<pb break="no" facs="nls:193532726"

                    they have been established. Or, again, it is clear that the ideas of the good,
                    and the just, and the honourable, and the beautiful, as they are seen in the
                    world around us, are only imperfectly developed. Our thoughts arc distracted by
                    the contemplation of them in the world, by the multiplicity of forms under which
                    they are apprehended by men, and it seems to the superficial glance as if there
                    were no one perfect standard of each. At the same time, we are able to trace
                    evident signs of such a standard, when we look thoughtfully at the course of
                    things. We cannot doubt, on such examination, that these principles exist, and
                    are working their way, and that the universe has been constructed after the
                    pattern of them. But all that the most attentive study will disclose to us as
                    actually observed, is <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> towards these principles—a
                    “becoming” or incipiency of being.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    their effect, if the world were such as to give them free scope and exercise,
                    and if the impressions of sense did not diversify and obscure the presentations
                    of them to our minds. Must we not say, then, that if we formed our notions of
                    these principles from the visible world, and the impressions of sense, that we
                    must estimate them improperly? And must we not rather elevate our minds to the
                    Ideas themselves, after which the universe has been constituted in its present
                    order, and take our measures of them from the Divine Being, whose goodness, and
                    truth, and beauty, they represent?</p>
                <p>Thus did the Theory of Ideas serve as a moral explanation of the course of
                    nature, and meet the demand of philosophy, by removing the perplexity of the
                    mind on the contemplation of the apparent disorder of the world, and giving a
                    firm stay to the thought in this direction. This apparent disorder has been the
                    constant appeal of the atheist and the sceptic in all ages. And in Plato’s time
                    there was need, we find from several passages of his writings, of an answer on
                    the part of philosophy to speculative objections on this ground. The Theory of
                    Ideas supplied this answer. By the theory of a perfect model of good,
                    imperfectly wrought out in the visible universe, the existence of evil was
                    accounted for in some degree, and the eye of thought was enabled to see a chain
                    of goodness, and beauty, and order, binding together the most untoward
                    appearances of the moral world. As the Pythagoreans enchained these disjointed
                    portions of the moral fabric, by supposing a fundamental Unity pervading the
                    whole, and reducing the multiple and the unlimited to definite proportion—a sort
                    of keynote, modulating the apparent discords of nature<note anchored="true"

                    the all-pervading moderator of the system of the universe. The abstract notions,
                    the genera, and the species, and the definitions, which dialectical science
                    brought out by the aid of language, presented the materials for extending the
                    moral view to other notions besides those strictly moral; and thus a theological
                    and moral complexion was spread over the whole region of philosophy.</p>
                <p>Ideas of evil were evidently excluded. “The good” could not be the cause of all
                    things, but only of those that were well constituted; of evils it was

                    nature of the Author of the universe. It was a condition of that bodily nature
                    on which the good was actively displayed. Evil arose from the nature of the
                    “diverse”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">. {Tim.</hi> ρ. 315.)</p></note> inherent in body; that nature in
                    body by which it was contradistinguished from the “sameness” belonging to the
                    Ideas.</p>
                <p>In considering the Theory of Ideas under the different aspects which it presents,
                    we have in fact taken a summary view of the whole of Plato’s philosophy. This
                    theory is the cardinal principle of the whole. The speculations on particular
                    branches of philosophy are all included in this one theory, which bindsi them
                    together and explains them. For when the mind had once risen to the
                    contemplation of the Ideas, it needed no further helps from observation or study
                    of nature to understand all knowledge. The mind was then in possession of the
                    only true principles of knowledge; and to enter into the consideration of
                    material and sensible phenomena, was only to return to the darkness and the
                    dreams from which the eye of the intellect had been purified,—to quit the light
                    of the sun for the cavern of shadows.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, all his writings are devoted to the establishment of this theory.
                    Proceeding on that notion of the importance of the theory which he inculcates,
                    he bends every thought to this one point. No one science is set forth by him in
                    detail; no one subject obtains with him a full and explicit consideration. All
                    is resolved into its most abstract and general view, that the mind may be led to
                    see the common principles of all truth; so intent is he throughout on his theory
                    of Ideas, whatever may be his immediate subject of discussion. He assumes
                    hypotheses, and examines them, and refutes them, in the way of argument, without
                    pronouncing on either side of a particular question, as if indifferent about the
                    establishment of any mere opinion, and desirous only of clearing his way for the
                    perception of his theory.</p>
                <p>But to place that theory in its full light, we should advert to the theories of
                    Knowledge and of the Soul, which are intimately connected with it. These
                    theories contain his account of the origin of the Ideas.</p>
                <p>Knowledge, according to Plato, is Reminiscence, <hi rend="italic"
                    >'Kναμ-νησις,</hi> a recovery of forgotten truth, which had been possessed by
                    the soul in a former state of existence. His dialectic professed to do nothing
                    more than to lead the mind, by apt interrogation, to perceive the Truth for
                    itself. It abandoned the attempt to communicate the Truth by didactic
                    propositions. It only removed falsehood, and left the truth to its own course,
                    to suggest itself to the mind, now disabused of its error and prejudice. It
                    appealed to principles as certain criteria of truth, and yet confessed its
                    inability to state those principles, and place them distinctly before the mind
                    of the learner. They were simply referred to, as existing in every mind,
                    whatever might be the peculiar opinions of the individual to whom the questions
                    of the dialectician were addressed. How, then, conld those principles have been
                    acquired? No time in the present life could be pointed out when they first
                    appeared in the mind. They are prior to the sensations, for the sensations arc
                    referred to them; and the sensations we have had from our birth. These standard
                    principles, then, must have been acquired in a previous state of existence, and
                    what is commonly called learning, is, in fact, Reminiscence; and to know, is,
                    properly speaking, to remember.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In proof of this account of the origin of the Ideas, Plato <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532739" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2739-0032"/>introduces Socrates making an
                    expepmeñt on the mind of an uneducated person. Socrates is'represented putting a
                    series of questions to a slave of Meno, and at length eliciting from the youth,
                    after repeated correction of his errors, a right enunciation of a geometrical
                    truth.' Socrates then points triumphantly to the instance, and bids Meno observe
                    how he had <hi rend="italic">taught</hi> the youth nothing, but simply <hi
                    rend="italic">interrogated</hi> him as to his opinions, and the youth had
                    himself recalled for himself the knowledge thus evidently existing in his
                    mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Again, in illustration of the same, Plato refers to instances of association.
                    Often, on the sensation of a particular object, we are reminded of something
                    else not present to us. On seeing a lyre, or a dress, which one whom we love has
                    used, a thought occurs of the person to whom it belonged. So also, on seeing
                    pictures of objects, persons and objects will be suggested to the mind, unlike
                    as well as like to the objects in the picture. Or one of two friends, being
                    presented to our view, we are reminded of the other who is absent.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >P1κεdo.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Now the instances here referred to, both those of association, and those of the
                    self-teaching of the mind by the excitement of its reflection, are highly
                    interesting and important in the history of the origin of ideas. But they do not
                    prove the point for which Plato adduces them. The case of the slave interrogated
                    by Socrates certainly shews, that there are principles in the understanding,
                    which are not derived from external information, but which only wait to be
                    developed by occasions apt to call them forth. And as to the instances of
                    association, we can only say, it is an ultimate fact of our mental constitution,
                    that particular objects serve to bring others before our thoughts. All such
                    instances are illustrations of the fact, that the mind is not passive in its
                    admission of truth, receiving knowledge simply as something infused in it from
                    without; but that its knowledge is in great measure owing to its exertion of its
                    faculties, and its bringing to bear on the instruction given its own intuitive
                    convictions;—that consequently the excellence of all teaching consists, not so
                    much in the positive mass of instruction conveyed, as in stirring up the mind to
                    learn from itself.</p>
                <p>The stress of Plato’s argument in favour of the theory of Reminiscence, and of
                    the previous existence of the Soul as a consequence of it, is laid, we find, on
                    the ground of the priority of the ideas compared with the several particular
                    sensations which are referred to them as criteria. But the priority which he
                    here claims for the Ideas, is not, in fact, a precedence in the order of time,
                    but of logic. In the process of reasoning, general principles are prior to, and
                    more known than, the particulars which fall under them; because in possessing
                    them we possess the particulars, and the particulars, as yet unknown, are known
                    by deduction from them as already known. Thus we familiarly speak of a
                    conclusion as <hi rend="italic">following</hi> from the premises. Now, Plato
                    appears to have transferred a priority of this kind to the Ideas, and then to
                    have concluded their priority <hi rend="smallcaps">absolutely,</hi> as
                    principles existing in the mind independently of the occasions on which they are
                    called forth. But to establish a theory of Reminiscence, it was further required
                    to be shewn, that the ideas are prior in the order of <hi rend="italic"
                    >time,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that we possess them antecedently to, and
                    independently of, all experience. The instance which he has given of the way in
                    which a mathematical conclusion is reached by the simple leading of the mind in
                    the right track, is an instance of what has in modern philosophy been more
                    properly called “Suggestion,”— not of Reminiscence. So far from being an
                    instance of Reminiscence, it shews, on the contrary, that the general principles
                    of the mind are developed <hi rend="italic">subsequently</hi> to the particular
                    occasions which suggest them. It shews, further, that these principles are in
                    some way dependent on sudi occasions for their development, though not dependent
                    on them for their truth and reality; for the mind accepts them as true, and as
                    the criteria of all other truth, at the moment when they are presented to it.
                    This, then, is what is really illustrated in Plato’s instance in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meno.</hi> Geometrical science is the best illustration of it,
                    though it is seen also in all our judgments and reasonings; because the remote
                    conclusions to which we are brought by the chain of demonstration in that
                    science, from a few very simple definitions, present the fact most strikingly.
                    Those conclusions are clearly far beyond the compass of the definitions
                    themselves. They are strictly deduced from them, however, and with an
                    irresistible cogency of argument. The wonder is accounted for, by the fact to
                    which Plato has called our attention. The demonstration of the problem appeals
                    in every step to the intuitive convictions of the mind. Ideas are suggested by
                    which the statements at each point of the proof are tested; and we sanction the
                    conclusion, because the process by which we arrive at it, has been approved
                    throughout by clear principles of our own minds.</p>
                <p>But though the theory of Reminiscence has not been satisfactorily made out by
                    Plato, he has the merit of having distinctly noticed and marked, in speculating
                    on the origin of the Ideas, a class of notions of which no previous account, as
                    it seems, had been given. The philosophy of sensation had before his time
                    chiefly engaged the attention of thinking men, whether of those of the Eleatic
                    school, who made everything stationary, or of the Ionic, who made everything
                    flow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato
                    characterizes them; the one, as the <hi rend="italic">τoυ</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">lo&gt;wii. Thcoet.</hi></p></note> It had been carried into the
                    extreme of refinement by the Sophists, its devotees, when Plato commenced his
                    antagonist system. He found that this philosophy was too narrow a basis for the
                    structure of science, and that it could not stand alone. He saw that it left
                    altogether unexplored the perceptions of the mind itself, such, for example, as
                    the notions of equality, identity, time, causation, right, &amp;c.; and that
                    these notions were, in truth, more important for the establishment of science,
                    than those which had previously chiefly attracted the attention of philosophers.
                    He applied himself accordingly to examine and characterize these principles. The
                    main thing to be accomplished in such an inquiry, was to distinguish them
                    accurately from the informations of sense; to shew that they were not included
                    in, or in any way derived out of, the informations of sense, but developed by
                    the workings of mind, This fact he has recorded in his theory of Reminiscence,—a
                    term expressing the point of contrast in his method, to that of the empirical
                    philosophers before him exclusively founded on sensation.</p>
                <p>The truth and importance, accordingly, of Plato’s Theory of Ideas, appear in
                    this; that by that theory he laid a stable foundation of science, in the
                    principles themselves of the human mind. His error is, that he carried that
                    theory too far; that he included in it notions which are not part of the
                    fundamental principles of the mind, and thus involved his theory in vagueness
                    and paradox. The war of nominalism and realism is well known to every one, who
                    has looked into the history of philosophy, or of theological opinion. This found
                    its occasion in the wide generalization of the Ideal Theory. Had Plato
                    restricted his theory to such notions as really exist in the mind; and had he
                    not extended it, without discrimination, to those which belong to general terms,
                    and which are purely notional; there would not have been that ground for
                    controversy on the subject. As the case has been,—one class of disputants,
                    looking to the generalizations of language, the genera and species of logic,
                    took the nominalist view of the subject,—- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532752"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2752-0033"/><pb break="no" facs="nls:193532765"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2765-0034"/> truth, rather a condition in order to the
                    development of the ideal theory in connection with the phenomena of sensation,
                    than any positive nature, according to his conception of it. He has left it in
                    the most mysterious form: nor does he seem indeed to distinguish it from Space,
                    when he shadows it out by negatives of the attributes of all actual existence.
                    In giving an analysis of production, <hi rend="italic">γενεσις,</hi> he
                    enumerates three principles as concerned in the process: 1. The thing produced;
                    2. That in which it is produced; 3∙ That from which the thing produced takes the
                    pattern of its production; depicting them under the analogy of the father, the
                    mother, and the offspring.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Tirnoeus,</hi> pp. 342-344.</p></note> The notion of body
                    is here represented by the intermediate term of the three, namely, that in which
                    the production takes place. “The nurse,” “the general receptacle,” and “the
                    laboratory,” <hi rend="italic">εκμα-γtιον,</hi> are also expressions by which he
                    endeavours to characterize it, as being in its own nature incapable of being
                    pre-» sented to the senses or the intellect. “As a person,” he says, “observing
                    a perpetual succession of figures moulded of gold, if asked during the process
                    what was moulded, could only safely answer, that it was gold ;”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">≡
                    Ibid.</hi> p. 344.</p></note> so we must be content to speak of this nature,
                    calling it only a receptacle of forms or species, and not attributing to it any
                    particular species whatever. The tendency of this theory of Body is obviously
                    to. remove all material phenomena from the class of real existences. And it
                    seems to point to the origin of Plato’s ideal theory in some older philosophy
                    avowedly idealistic. At any rate, the speculation concerning body, as it stands
                    in his system, leaves a hiatus in the transition from the world of Ideas to that
                    of material existence.</p>
                <p>• The doctrine of Soul, as delivered by Plato, is properly the connecting link
                    between the worlds of being and sensation. Hence is derived the importance of
                    the theory of the immortality of the soul in his philosophy. For it is in the
                    soul that the eternal and immutable is found in the presence of the incipient
                    and evanescent; the intellectual idea in contact, so to say, with the phenomena
                    of sense. The soul partakes of change, as it is connected with the bodily
                    nature: it is eternal and unchangeable, as it is the seat of intelligence.</p>
                <p>Soul, then, according to Plato, is the necessary condition for the development of
                    intelligence in the universe, as Body is for the existence of sensation. Soul,
                    therefore, was necessarily prior to Body, as the first condition in order to the
                    constitution of the universe. It was the animating principle by means of which
                    the Deity, when he brought the world out of the disorder and confusion of
                    unreason, communicated intelligence to it, fashioning it after the pattern of
                    the eternal ideas. And not only is the whole universe thus ensouled by the
                    immediate agency of the Deity; but every particular system in it, in which any
                    degree of intelligence is found united with body, has in the very gift of that
                    intelligence a soul originally imparted to it by the Father of the universe
                    himself</p>
                <p>This is the ultimate account of that immortality which Plato attributes to the
                    soul of man. It is not as a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> soul that it is
                    immortal; but it derives an eternal existence' from its being among the original
                    intelligent units of the animated universe. We see indeed a constant production
                    of living things in the world; but it is not, as they have being, that they are
                    thus <hi rend="italic">produced</hi> or <hi rend="italic">generated.</hi> This
                    is the result of that “diverse” nature which was blended in their original
                    composition with their higher principles, viz. the natures of “sameness” and
                    “being.”</p>
                <p>For these are the three principles into which Plato analyses Soul,—the principles
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">same</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">diverse,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">being</hi>;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> and by these he
                    explains the phenomena of its actual existence. No time can be assigned, then,
                    to the origin of that which by its nature is, and is the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >same</hi> essentially. No one soul, therefore, can now <hi rend="italic"
                    >begin</hi> to exist. And again, whatever once exists can never cease to exist,
                    unless there is anything capable of destroying its principles of Sameness and
                    Being. But Death, as he shews, has no such power. It may disengage the soul from
                    its present body by dissolving the body; but it cannot affect the essential
                    vitality which is in the soul. This essential vitality is the direct contrary to
                    death. It therefore recedes when death comes, according to that law of
                    Contraries, which holds throughout the world of generation and corruption, and
                    which is the agent in all changes. But it still lives as vigorously as ever, and
                    returns to animate another body in the course of Generation.<note

                    can it maintain an unvaried perpetuity of existence. It remains ever
                    undestroyed; but from that “diverse” principle which enters into its
                    composition, it both alters in its internal character, and only imperfectly
                    imitates the eternal nature by a successive re-appearance in the forms of new

                    migrates from the male to the female sex, or to forms of the lower animals,
                    according to that condition of purity in which it departed from its last body,
                    or its previous degree of intellectual cultivation. For, as we may observe,
                    there is no original distinction, according to the theory, between the soul of
                    one man and another, and the soul of man and brute. All are equal in
                    intelligence and goodness, as the immediate work of the Divine Author. The
                    varieties in the characters of souls arise from the operation of the inferior
                    deities who framed the bodies of men and brutes, and the use which individuals
                    may make of their circumstances in the world. Whilst the number of souls, then,
                    remains the same, they are continually changing their habitations, and passing
                    by death from one body to another in the different forms of animal life;
                    undergoing degradation with the forms of inferior animals, or elevation with
                    those of superior nature, according to their state in a former existence.<note

                    are 'found existing in the mind, but their acquisition cannot be traced to any
                    particular period of a man’s present life. They have been there from time
                    immemorial, for no one can say when they first appeared in his own mind. They
                    were therefore born with us; and if so, they must have had existence before our
                    birth: and who can limit that existence? They have existed, for ought we know to
                    the contrary, from all eternity: and who, then, shall limit their existence by
                    any future period? why may they not be born with us in a life subsequent to the
                    present, as they were born with us in the present life, and so on to all
                    eternity in endless generations? This is in substance the train of reasoning by
                    which Plato seeks to establish the immortality of the soul. A similar argument
                    has been reproduced in modern metaphysical treatises, variously modified and
                    stated, but the same in substance. How little calculated it is to produce
                    practical conviction, whilst we admire its ingenuity, is evidenced by Cicero’s
                    confession, that whilst he wept over the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> his mind
                    retained no deep impressions from the argument.<note anchored="true"

                <p>These principles are only the counterpart ethical expressions of his theories of
                    immutable Being, on the one hand, and of the world of phenomena, or mere
                    Becoming, on the other.</p>
                <p>For the soul of man, so far as it has any good or truth in it, is framed after
                    the pattern of the eternal Ideas of the good and true. These Ideas, under the
                    various moral aspects which they present, constitute its moral nature. All its
                    desires, therefore, naturally tend to the Good and True. These qualities are
                    what the soul would be. They are the mysterious realities to which it is
                    striving to attain, in all those various efforts after Pleasure which it makes
                    in the present life ;—unconscious it may be, as it is in fact in the depraved,
                    of the true nature of the objects to which its affections ultimately point.
                    Still, if it be conceded that Ideas are the only proper Beings, and that
                    everything else is phenomenal, or the mere product and offspring of the
                    generating power of the eternal Ideas, it must also be admitted, that nothing
                    else can be the real source of moral phenomena but the Good and True. In the
                    moral, no less than in the physical world, a constant succession of passing
                    events is found to take place. We perceive a variety of affections in the nature
                    of man as he is in the world, directed to a variety of objects, each aiming at
                    some particular gratification; one desire and its gratification passing away,
                    and others succeeding it in endless flow. All this restless course, then, of
                    moral events exhibited in the life of man is phenomenal; not in the sense of its
                    having no reality whatever, but of its having no permanent reality—of its being
                    no more in the result than effort towards being—restless, endless effort towards
                    that which may give rest and full satisfaction, and stable being.</p>
                <p>This ultimate object, then, however indistinctly sought, is the aim of every
                    individual soul of man. Some, indeed, avowedly make mere sensual gratification
                    the end of their desires. They endeavour to satisfy themselves with the limited
                    and the evanescent. But the true cause of all that perverted activity which they
                    display, is the Good itself. They know not what the Good is; but they love it in
                    spite of themselves, and bear evidence, by their life of unceasing pursuit, that
                    they are secretly actuated by the desire of it,—and that they can find no rest
                    in anything short of it. Their soul, originally formed in the likeness of the
                    Deity, can never willingly be separated from its Divine image. In the midst of
                    its wildest aberrations, it feels the attraction of like to like, impelling, and
                    at the same time reclaiming it to right.</p>
                <p>This accordingly is Plato’s meaning in the principle, which he so emphatically
                    lays down, that “no one is willingly evil.” It is very different, we may
                    observe, from saying that no one commits evil willingly. And Plato himself takes
                    care to guard his theory from this misconstruction. He readily grants, that acts
                    of wrong are distinguished by being voluntary and involuntary, without which
                    there could be neither merit nor demerit; but he strenuously maintains that this
                    distinction does not apply to evil itself. It is in all cases involuntary. No
                    one can choose it in itself. It is necessarily the object of aversion, as the
                    good is invariably the object of choice and pursuit.</p>
                <p>How is it, then, it will be inquired, that men do become evil ;—that whilst they
                    are really seeking to be conformed to a divine pattern, they practically do what
                    is evil, and, losing more and more of their likeness to the Eternal Being,
                    conform themselves rather to the fleeting character of the world of
                    sensation?</p>
                <p>The explanation is found in the other great principle of Plato’s philosophy, the
                    theory of Becoming, to which we have referred. Change is the characteristic of
                    all that belongs to this subject; as immutability is the characteristic of
                    Being. The course itself of successive phenomena may be varied by impressions
                    from circumstances. In the soul there is a principle of change in the power of
                    regulating the desires,—in indulging them to excess, or moderating them,
                    according to the will. And the circumstances in which the soul is placed, as
                    connected with the sensible world by means of the body, present the occasion for
                    such change. The humours and distempers of the body produce discomposure in the
                    soul. It becomes diseased analogously to the body. This state of disease is what
                    is commonly called folly, άνο/α; and it takes the form either of madness, <hi
                    rend="italic">μανια</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or of mere
                    ignorance, αμα‰. Where even ignorance only is the result, the internal harmony
                    of the soul is disturbed. Pleasures and pains are unduly magnified; the
                    democracy of the passions prevails; and the ascendancy of reason is cast down.
                    In addition to these disturbances or ailments through the body, come the
                    influences of evil governments, evil public lessons, evil education. Hence the
                    soul is changed from what it was when it first came from the hands of its Divine
                    author. The eternal Ideas after which it was framed are not effaced from it.
                    This cannot be; for then it would cease to have being; but it loses distinct
                    apprehension of them,—mistakes appearances of good for good itself,—and under
                    that delusion willingly does evil, and presumes on obtaining happiness by a
                    course of evil conduct.</p>
                <p>But the same principle of change in the soul gives an opening also for its moral
                    restoration. As the soul is deteriorated by the contagion of the body, so it may
                    also be restored to a sound state by remedial treatment. The yielding to every
                    passing desire, and suffering the desires to grow out of proportion, and destroy
                    the harmony of the soul, is the cause of men’s falling into that blindness which
                    hides the good from their mental eye. By restraining them, and moderating the
                    desires, the internal disorder is gradually corrected; reason resumes its
                    ascendancy; the soul once more “sees and hears aright,” and thus returns to that
                    good to which its desires naturally tend. It is a long process, indeed, by which
                    the restoration is effected; a process of gradual purification, καSαjΛj, of the
                    soul, by chastisement and suffering. Nor is it accordingly completed in a single
                    life; many courses of existence must be passed through. Not only is the present
                    life of the soul a consequence of its conduct in a former one; but it is
                    destined to many successive stages of existence, each adapted to the character
                    acquired at the stage next preceding, until its defilements are purged away.</p>
                <p>These ethical doctrines of the philosopher, when divested of the extravagance of
                    his theory, so far accord with the truth both of inspiration and experience, as
                    they indicate, that the utmost man can do in the present life is insufficient to
                    restore in him the lost image of God. Whilst they lay down this truth under the
                    disguise of the remedial process of the transmigration of the soul, they further
                    agree with the inspired authority, and with experience, in imposing on man the
                    duty of <hi rend="italic">commencing</hi> the process of restoration, and in
                    holding him strictly responsible for the state of his mind and affections,
                    through that power of selfdirection and capacity of improvement by discipline,
                    with which he has been endued. Thus does he also bear evidence both to the fact
                    of the perfection of man at his crea-tibn, and that of his existing corruption.
                    But he differs from the Scripture account of that corruption, in making it
                    originally a physical rather than a moral debasement, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532791" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2791-0036"/>and representing it as taking
                    place by a gradual process, and not by a sudden and entire fall, the effect of a
                    first transgression of a positive divine command.</p>
                <p>The Sophists, indeed, boasted of their power of transforming the characters of
                    men, and accordingly made great profession of “teaching virtue.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gorgias, however, laughed at
                    the other Sophists for pretending to teach virtue. He professed only the art of
                    words.</p></note> But they coupled with this pretension, the admission, that all
                    opinions on moral, no less than on other subjects, are equally true. All
                    opinions in morals, they said, are true; “but all are not good. What we would
                    effect, therefore, is to lead men to such opinions as we know also to be both
                    good and wise.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">≡ Protag.</hi></p></note> But this was a mere evasion; for if all
                    opinions are equally true, then must also each man’s view of good be true, as
                    well as that which his instructor would inculcate on him; and there is no fixed
                    standard to which he may be conformed. Plato’s theory of good, as the sole
                    object of desire,—or the invariable tendency of the will to good, and its
                    invariable aversion from evil,—was a strong ground of opposition to the
                    sophistical doctrine. It pointed out that there was a principle in man superior
                    to instruction, and independent of the accidents of worldly circumstances, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Θεος μετζον,</hi> the “God-measure,” the fixed Divine
                    standard, to which all moral teaching should be directed, and from a reference
                    to which all moral discipline obtained its value.</p>
                <p>From this mode of enunciating the fundamental principles of morals, it followed,
                    that the practical morality which Plato teaches, should be directed to the means
                    of removing the false appearances of good by which the mind is deluded to evil.
                    He shews, accordingly, that there are false pleasures as well as false
                    opinions—that men’s ignorance extends, not only to mistakes in regard to their w
                    calth .or bodily accomplishments, but as to their moral characters; for that
                    most men think themselves better than they .really are.<note anchored="true"

                <p>This, therefore, according to Plato, is the great purpose for which philosophy
                    must be cultivated. Philosophy alone can open the eyes to see the true value of
                    things, and alone elevate the mind from the evanescent region of the phenomenal
                    world to the seat of true and eternal Being.</p>

                <p>Philosophy and morality, in fact, in his system, perfectly coincide. The love of
                    truth is also the love of good, and the love of good is the love of truth.<note

                <p>These views of moral truth are in themselves certainly grand and ennobling. As
                    guides, however, to duty, they are deficient in that particularity and
                    homeliness of application, which are required for the real business of morality.
                    Their tendency, too, to contemplative mysticism is obvious, left as they are by
                    Plato in undefined outline, and clothed in the charms of his imaginative
                    eloquence. Nor shall we wonder that they have easily combined with the feeling
                    of asceticism, so congenial to the human heart. The contempt which they throw
                    over everything belonging to the bodily nature of man,—the delusiveness imputed
                    to the senses, without any limitation of it, or guard against abuse of the
                    theory,—and the abstractedness from the world which they propose,—admit of being
                    construed into a theory of mortification of the body, and of the purifying
                    efficacy of self-inflicted punishments. These tendencies, indeed, of Plato’s
                    ethical doctrines, were, not long after his time, exemplified in the apathy and
                    austerity of the Stoic morality. And it is well known to what extent they have
                    been developed in the teaching and practice of religionists of all creeds. It
                    cannot be denied, also, that where they take hold of a morbid and susceptible
                    temperament of mind, they tend to substitute, in such a case, the morality of
                    imagination and sentiment for that of common sense and household feeling, and to
                    fritter away the convictions of duty into mere proprieties of taste; so that
                    even whilst they elevate the character above sordid and vulgar seductions of
                    pleasure, they emasculate and corrupt it, through the very excess of its
                    refinement.</p>
                <p>As bad education was regarded by Plato as the other great cause of human
                    corruption, in addition to the influence of Body on the soul, he directs a large
                    portion of his philosophical disquisitions to correct the evil arising from the
                    second source. His ethical discussions go to the limiting of the desires, and
                    curing the diseases produced by them in the soul. His political discussions have
                    for their immediate object, the laying down right principles of education, and
                    enforcing them by the constitution, laws, and power of the state.<note

                    most elaborate of his writings, the Dialogues of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Laws,</hi> are rather theories of
                    Education than of Government and Laws. The former indeed inquires more
                    particularly into the principles on which a right government may be formed;
                    whilst the latter gives a systematic view of the principles of legislation.
                    Both, however, have in view the improvement of human nature by social
                    institutions expressly framed for that purpose. It has been supposed that in the

                    the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> a practical exemplification of the theory. But
                    this is clearly a mistake. Both are doubtless intended by Plato as theoretical
                    disquisitions on the political matters of which they treat, whilst the real
                    matter in hand is Education.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    nature, hê would be disposed to object that such proceeding was folly; “for it
                    was not healing the sick man, but rather educating him, as if he wanted to
                    become à physician, and not to be made well.”<note anchored="true"

                    The like objection, he says, might be applied to his method of legislation; for,
                    “whoever pursues the inquiry concerning laws,” he adds, “as we are doing now,
                    educates the citizens, but does not legislate.”<note anchored="true"

                    he goes on to say, in the person of the chief speaker, addressing the other
                    interlocutors of the Dialogue, that in their work of legislation they were at
                    leisure, as speculators on the subject, to consider, not what was most
                    necessary, but what was best.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    it to the knowledge of the Good and True, so he would have philosophy also
                    seated on the throne of government, and exhibit the eternal Ideas of Good and
                    Truth, modifying society after their pattern. Hence it is that he overlooks
                    impossibilities in his arrangements; as is pointed out by Aristotle in his acute
                    comments on the leading points of Plato’s political theories.<note

                    ver. 4.</p></note> All is sacrificed, in fact, to the one great object of
                    Plato’s mind, the sketching of the Idea of the Good as a social principle, apart
                    from the evil influences of society.</p>
                <p>The most extravagant hypotheses, accordingly, arc put forward in this part of his
                    philosophy; not indeed with a view of their being ever exemplified in any
                    institutions of real life, but in extreme contrast with the existing selfishness
                    of human society, and as theoretic developments of the unchangeable idea of
                    good. Such, for example, is his theory of a community of wives and children, and
                    the training of women to the hardiest exercises of the gymnasium and of war. We
                    justly take exception at the immorality and unnaturalness of such hypotheses.
                    But Plato looks down upon man from the height of his sublime theory. He sees
                    everything in the unity and invariableness of that theory, and overlooks
                    distinctions deeply founded in the nature of man. Thus it is that in his view
                    man himself becomes a thing of little consideration or importance,—a sort of
                    plaything of the Deity, <hi rend="smallcaps">Siou</hi><hi rend="italic">τι
                    ταιγνιον,</hi> scarcely worth any serious attention. “You disparage altogether
                    the race of man,” says an interlocutor in the Dialogue of the Laws. “Wonder not
                    at it,” replies the Athenian; “but make allowance for me; for it was from
                    looking off to the Deity, and under this impression, that I said what I have now
                    expressed. However, let it be granted that our race is not insignificant, if you
                    like, but worth some serious consideration.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    vii. p. 353.</p></note> It is in this spirit that he himself sports with human
                    nature, as if human beings were only so many chessmen, to be moved on the board,
                    so as to display the admirable design of the disposing mind, and illustrate the
                    working of the eternal Ideas. His fault is the same as in his physical
                    speculations, that of commencing from the final cause, or the notion of the
                    Best, and forming the world of social life after that, instead of rising from
                    the study of its actual formation to the notion of the Best ;—or at least in
                    supposing, that he could arrive at a just view of the divine pattern of Good, by
                    presenting a theoretic copy of it, after his own conceptions of the Best. But
                    such extravagancies as those we have referred to, could only have proceeded from
                    so bold a mind as that of Plato,—a mind, not checked by the repulsiveness of
                    particular consequences from pushing a theory to the utmost.</p>
                <p>At the same time, tins fundamental notion of the Divine standard and pattern on
                    which he proceeds, imparts a solemn dignity, in the midst of these excesses of
                    the spirit of theory, to the substance of his speculations on government and
                    laws.</p>
                <p>Religion is thus secured as the basis of all right government and legislation.
                    That government only which most resembles a theocracy is, in Plato’s view, a
                    true polity. All others, popularly termed governments, as democracy, oligarchy,
                    aristocracy, monarchy, arc merely settlements of cities, and not <hi

                    called after that power which has the ascendancy, in each over the other parts
                    of the state. So far as a state is truly such, it ought to be named, he says,
                    after the true God, the lord over all intelligent beings. Governments, as they
                    exist, are only the results of the struggles of contending factions: whence we
                    find, as he observes, one party in the ascendancy excluding and depressing
                    another, in order to its own maintenance, and no concern taken for the welfare
                    of the whole community. To remedy this general evil of existing governments, he
                    would have the simple and straightforward course of the divine procedure brought
                    before the minds of men, and a conformity with that procedure inculcated on them

                <p>Here we have emphatically recognized the great truth, that the foundations of all
                    government and law are laid in the unchanging nature of the Divine Being. The
                    law of right, as exemplified in the dominion of party, is the law of the
                    strongest, fluctuating with the accidents of power, and never attaining to any
                    permanent being. Such was the law of right, as taught by the Sophists, from city
                    to city, and which was fully established in public opinion throughout
                    Greece,—not only as manifested in the factious character of the particular
                    governments, but avowedly declared and acted on as a principle of conduct. “It
                    is nothing,” say Athenian ambassadors, “out of the course of the established
                    opinion of men concerning the Divine Being, or <pb break="no"

                    themselves, that we expect or do. For we hold that the Divine Nature, so far as
                    we can judge of it, and human nature, as we see clearly, by an instinctive
                    necessity, ever exercise power where they can obtain the mastery. Nor are we the
                    first, either to propose the law, or to use it when laid down: it was in being
                    when we took it up; and it will subsist for ever, for us to transmit to others
                    after us; and we merely act upon it; convinced, that yourselves, no less than
                    others, were you placed in the same power in which we are, would do so.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. V. 105.</p></note>
                    Here, then, is the law which belongs to the region of instability,—. to that
                    nature which is ever <hi rend="italic">becoming,</hi> and never <hi
                    rend="italic">is.</hi> Contrast with this Plato’s principle, which deduces the
                    origin of law from the eternal <hi rend="smallcaps">idea</hi> of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">good,</hi> and it will then be more distinctly seen what the
                    spirit of Plato’s legislation really is. ∙</p>
                <p>It follows, indeed, from bis principle, that all instituted law is
                    imperfect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    could be established on earth, it would be best that the business of government
                    should be carried on by his will; which would in such a case be only the copy of
                    the Divine exemplar of right. But as this is past hope in the present condition
                    of human things, the substitute for the more perfect system is the institution
                    of laws framed after the eternal Idea of Good; not laws adapted merely to the
                    preservation of a particular form of polity, but embodying in them the immutable
                    principles of right. And even such laws, as being matters of institution, are
                    inferior in dignity to unwrittén laws—the principles of right—which, themselves
                    resting on no external sanction, are yet the conserving principles of all
                    positive laws.</p>
                <p>Having his eye fixed on the eternal pattern of the good and the true, Plato
                    looked with a feeling of disappointment and disgust at the several forms of
                    polity which the states of Greece exhibited. He is generally thought to have
                    inclined to a preference of aristocracy, and to have regarded with aversion all
                    popular government. But though it is probable, that, from what he saw of the
                    tyranny of an unrestrained democracy, he sighed in secret for a better order of
                    things, we cannot conclude from his political speculations that he regarded any
                    single polity as the best. He, in fact, condemns all particular forms;<note

                    nowhere seen in his times, combining in it monarchy, aristocracy, and
                    democracy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Leg.</hi> iii. pp. 137, 138.</p></note> But in his view, as
                    governments then existed, they were all one-sided; the dominion of one part of a
                    community over the rest, and not the dominion of good over the whole. This
                    dominion, as we have observed, was only to be found in the government of God
                    over the world, and to it, therefore, he would have all human government
                    conformed. His sole preference, then, is for a theocracy, if such could be
                    realized on earth. His slighting manner of speaking of the lower orders of
                    society, and of all indeed but those who are gifted with superior talents and
                    other natural endowments, is to be ascribed to his general low estimate of human
                    nature, considered apart from that cultivation, which the highest and most
                    intellectual studies impart to it.</p>
                <p>Respect for antiquity and prescriptive authority is strongly inculcated by Plato.
                    In nothing was the changeable·, ness of all generated things more evident than
                    in the evervarying forms of the states of Greece, and especially of Athens
                    itself. The democracy of Athens had been an universal market, <hi rend="italic"
                    >τrαντο&lt;ιrωλιον,</hi> as Plato terms an extreme democracy of all sorts of
                    po!ities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Rep.</hi> viii.</p></note> And laws had so far lost their force
                    there in the most corrupt times, that everything was transacted by the decrees
                    of the day; the variable determinations of popular assemblies being substituted
                    practically in the place of the records of former experience and wisdom. Early
                    legislators had devised expedients for counteracting this love of change on the
                    part of their countrymen, as Solon, for instance, and Lycurgus, had done. And in
                    some instances, we find a temporary and partial expedient adopted, by the
                    popular assembly itself fixing the penalty of death to the proposal of
                    rescinding a measure before a certain period.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. ii. 24.</p></note> Plato’s expedient
                    was supplied by the principle itself of his philosophy. If the Idea of Good was
                    eternal and unchangeable, the constant pursuit of change must lead men astray
                    from their happiness and the truth. They must be called back, therefore, from
                    that which is present and passing, to the recollection of the past. They must
                    not look on wisdom as a thing which is different to-day from what it was
                    yesterday, or in former times, but hold it as what by its very nature is
                    unalterable. To regard it as susceptible of improvement in the lapse of time,
                    would be to deny its proper Being, to reduce it to the condition of mere
                    Becoming. A distrust in the wisdom of any existing generation of men, and a
                    sacred reverence for that of former generations, and especially for the earliest
                    traditions of knowledge, would naturally be inculcated in such a philosophy.
                    Thus he highly commends the Lacedemonian and Cretan polities for the provision,
                    that no young man should inquire whether the laws were good or bad, but that
                    “all should with one voice and with one mouth agree in declaring that everything
                    in them is well appointed, as being by the appointment of gods ;” and that no
                    other sentiment should be allowed to be expressed. Further, not even does he
                    permit a young person to be present when such matters are considered by the
                    old.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    these lighter matters “imperceptibly change the manners of the young, and bring
                    what is primitive into disrepute, and what is modern into repute ;” and that
                    there cannot be a greater mischief to states than such a habit of “blaming

                <p>All this, which under certain limitations may be true, appears, when thus broadly
                    laid down by Plato, a misapplication of the proper sanction of religious truth
                    to truth in general. In religion, the only question being what is really taught
                    by its Divine author, there can be no addition made in the course of time to the
                    truths revealed, except by another divine revelation, though there may be
                    advancement in the exposition and teaching of it. What is primitive and ancient,
                    accordingly, in this subject, once fully ascertained to be so, is the truth, and
                    the whole truth. Only we must not mistake antiquity of exposition and comment,
                    for primitiveness of the truth itself; for these admit of improved knowledge by
                    human study, when the original truth itself does not. The contest between the
                    advocates of the respective claims of the past and of the present, in the matter
                    of knowledge, is doubtless much older than the time of Plato. But his authority
                    and eloquence have probably been mainly instrumental in starting and sustaining
                    the controversy in modern times, through the early reception of his philosophy
                    into the literature of the Christian church.</p>
                <p>But we may further see a reason for the stress which Plato lays on the wisdom of
                    prescription and authority, in that state of public opinion to which he is
                    addressing himself. It was not, as might be supposed, a state of things <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193532830" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2830-0039"/> corresponding
                    exactly to a demand for religious or civil changes, in our days, under
                    established governments and institutions. The question of change is now gravely
                    discussed, and deliberately carried or rejected, not with the view of unsettling
                    everything, but in order that some particular institution or law may be <hi
                    rend="italic">established</hi> for the future. Except in violent outbreaks of
                    human passions long pent up within artificial restraints, exasperated by
                    resistance, and at length forcing their way out, and levelling all barriers
                    before them, as in the instance of the French revolution, it cannot be said with
                    truth, of the struggles for particular changes in modern institutions, that they
                    have been actuated by the mere desire of change, and the hatred of everything
                    established. The religion and the civilization of modern times have in some
                    measure presented a check to this. But at the centre of movement in Greece,
                    change was the order of the day. Athens would neither rest itself, nor suffer
                    other states to rest When its very demagogues are forced on some occasions to
                    endeavour to repress this incessant changeableness; as Cleon was, when he told
                    the Athenians it was better “to have worse laws unmoved, than good laws
                    perpetually changed ,∙"<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Thucyd. iii. 37.</p></note> —it is evident that the spirit of change was
                    then developed in its most fearful form. For we find the magician himself who
                    had evoked it, starting in terror at the apparition, and finding it too strong
                    for his direction and control, ∆oυλo∕ <hi rend="italic">οντες των αει</hi><hi

                    exorcise it, and which the historian of the times puts into the mouth of one
                    who, as the creature of the system, could most pointedly characterize it. Such
                    was that spirit, then, against which Plato had to contend. It was an enemy not
                    only to the existing government, but to all government, and all law, and all
                    religion and morality. It demanded, therefore, the most forcible counteraction.
                    It was to be met by inculcation of the opposite. According to his own universal
                    principle, contrary was to be expelled by contrary. Everything that was ancient
                    was to be upheld, accordingly, as worthy of veneration and acceptance, simply
                    because it was ancient. The voice itself of antiquity, though speaking without
                    evidence, was to be received with implicit acquiescence and submission. Thus it
                    is that Plato is found strenuously appealing to the instinctive feeling of his
                    countrymen, which they still retained in spite of the prevailing folly,—the
                    feeling with which they so fondly reverted to their early glories, and delighted
                    to view themselves in the past ;—and labouring to correct their vacillations of
                    present opinion by recalling them to the stable lessons of <hi rend="italic"
                    >memory.</hi></p>
                <p>Political philosophy, then, according to Plato, is the history of those changes
                    which the will of man produces in the matter of government and laws, and an
                    endeavour to limit those changes by restoring in the social world the primitive
                    order and rule.</p>
                <p>Education is the means by which those changes are counteracted. It avails itself
                    of that principle of contrariety by which all changes are carried on; and
                    endeavours to expel the evil by inducing the good. The process by which it
                    carries on this effect is, a discipline of the intellect, prescribed by the
                    state, and promoted by all its institutions and customs, framed, as these are
                    supposed to be, after the idea of the Sovereign Good. That discipline lays down
                    a course of exercise for the body as well as for the intellect, that the body
                    may be brought into the best condition, in order to the exercise of the
                    intellect. The intellect itself it conducts through the steps of the several
                    sciences, from the bodily and sensible to the unembodied and intellectual,—from
                    the phenomenal and changeable to that which has real being, and is unchangeable.
                    And thus in Plato’s system it is classed under the two comprehensive heads of
                    Gymnastics and Music; the latter term being understood, according to its
                    derivation, to denote literature in general. Philosophy itself was the ultimate
                    attainment of education,—the result of the whole intellectual training of the
                    accomplished man. Ostensibly, under this system, there was no peculiar
                    discipline of the heart. Indirectly there was; so far .as it inculcated
                    purification and self-denial. But the strengthening and elevating of the
                    intellect was its direct object. Its tendency was thus to exalt the virtues of
                    the intellect above those of the heart; and, in opposition to the evidence of
                    facts, to assert the power of knowledge over the determinations of the will. Not
                    that Plato denies the existence of what we call self-command, or that
                    controlling of the passions which is the result of a previous struggle with
                    them. But he did not admit (as Aristotle does, and urges against him<note

                    could ever be overpowered by the passions, or that if there were a distinct
                    knowledge of the truth in the mind, it could give way to passion.</p>
                <p>In the matter of Religion, Plato’s theory of Ideas led him to see that there were
                    truths above the evidence belonging to Experience, and which must be received
                    solely on the ground of the Divine authority. For whilst he taught that the mind
                    of man must work its way up to the Ideas by a course of argument and examination
                    of evidence, yet, having reached the Ideas themselves, it had attained the
                    ultimatum of truth; no further evidence of these was to be sought; they carried
                    their own light in themselves. So, when any truth was presented to the mind,
                    which related immediately to the Divine Being, it was not to be supposed capable
                    of being examined in itself, and established on any higher ground of internal
                    evidence, but must at once be admitted, if there were sufficient external
                    authority for it. The only question respecting such truths is, are they <hi
                    rend="italic">historically</hi> true? Is it certain, or at least highly
                    probable, that they have descended to us from the Father of Lights himself? Have
                    we reason to think that they were originally real divine communications,—and are
                    they vouched to us as such by a competent evidence?<note anchored="true"

                    principles of the mind, such as we have before spoken of, though they are not
                    evidenced by any higher principles, or by any conclusions from Experience, they
                    carry their own evidence, by their invariable presence in the mind on certain
                    occasions, being naturally suggested by such occasions to every rational
                    understanding. But the truths of religion are of a different nature. They cannot
                    be authenticated by the mind itself to itself, as being out of its range of
                    thought. They must therefore be authenticated from without. And in regard to
                    these, accordingly, we must appeal to the Reason and Word of God, as the simple,
                    and proper, and unanswerable vouchers of them.</p>

                    demonstration or probability, on matters strictly divine, and his frequent
                    appeal to mythic traditions when his discussion touches a mystery of the Divine
                    Being or the Divine conduct. He resolves the whole authority of such matters

                    applicable to the whole subjectof divine things as treated by him. Instead of
                    entering into explicit accounts of them, he observes that the subject is “too
                    great for us, and that we must believe those who have spoken before, being the
                    offspring of gods, in the way in which they said it, and because they must be
                    conceived to have known their own ancestors ;” adding, that we cannot refuse
                    credit to the “sons of gods, although they speak without probabilities and
                    necessary demonstrations, but must follow the rule of believing them on their
                    word, as declaring what belongs to them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> p. 324.</p></note> He
                    commends, too, the primitive generation of men for their docility in following
                    rules of life founded on oral tradition,—their “holding as true what was said
                    <hi rend="italic">τα</hi> as- <hi rend="italic">γομενα,</hi> concerning both
                    gods and men.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of die dead, and their interest in the concerns of men on earth, he appeals to
                    the same kind of evidence. “We must believe,” he says, “the voices of others in
                    such matters, so current as they are, and so extremely ancient; and it is enough
                    for our belief that legislators, unless they be proved absolutely unwise, have
                    asserted them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Leg.</hi> xi. 150.</p></note> So justly does he insist on the
                    reasonableness of being content with the voice of a declaratory authority in
                    matters incapable, by their nature, of a direct evidence from our reason.</p>
                <p>By the heathen philosopher, in the absence of an authentic revelation, the
                    authority for such truths was naturally sought in ancient traditions,—traditions
                    mounting up beyond all memory of their origin, and therefore referable to times
                    when the world was yet fresh from the hand of God. The voice of remote and
                    undefined antiquity, indeed, by a natural delusion, represents itself to the
                    mind as but little different from the sanction of eternal truth. For it is but a
                    slight and imperceptible transition from the indefinite to the infinite. Many
                    such traditions were found in the heathen mythology, connecting themselves with
                    another order of things, when gods conversed with men on earth. Some of them,
                    certainly, were full of absurdity and profaneness; and all were disfigured with
                    the colouring of fable; but still there were some, beautiful in the conception,
                    and sublime and impressive in the doctrine. Of this latter character, for the
                    most part, are those exquisite mythical legends, with which Plato has
                    diversified his discussions, throwing the solemnity of religion over truths
                    which he would especially enforce.</p>
                <p>Thus, though he has elaborately argued the immortality of the soul, he is not
                    content to leave the question on those abstract grounds of conviction. He feels
                    that the conviction which may practically influence the conduct, must be draw n
                    from another source,—that of a simple belief in some authority declaring
                    it,—when he closes the discussion, as in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> and
                    in other places, with a scenic representation, from the legends of ancient
                    tradition, of the doctrines which he has been enforcing. The whole of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> in fact, is a legend rather than a philosophical
                    inquiry. It appeals, for the reception of its truths, to the shadows with which
                    it veils them, and the mystic echoes of sounds heard by the listening ear from
                    afar. In that legend, indeed, we have very considerable evidence of the pure
                    source, from which the heathen world drew much of the sacred truth that was
                    wrapped up and disfigured in their fables. We perceive in such a document of
                    ancient philosophy, at once the sure and wide-spread knowledge resulting from a
                    scriptural Revelation, and the obscurity and fallibility of the information of
                    Tradition. To this effect are the description in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus,</hi> of the universe as the “one” work of the “one Supreme</p>
                <p>Being,”—as the “visible likeness of one himself the object only of intellectual
                    apprehension,”—as the “only-generated,” <hi rend="italic">μοvογενης,</hi> of the
                    Father of all things; and the strong assertion of the goodness, and beauty, and
                    perfection of the universe; and particularly, in reference to this, that
                    striking passage, “When the Father who generated it, perceived, both living and
                    moving, the generated glory of the Everlasting Divinities, he was filled with
                    admiration, and, being delighted, he further contemplated the working it still
                    more to a resemblance of the pattern.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    But at the same time there is much confusion and degradation of the high

                    that the creation arose out of nothing, by the word of God. This is darkly
                    intimated in the shadowy nature which the narrative assigns to Body; but, though
                    it be but a shadow, Body still subsists in his system, as the co-eternal
                    contrary of the Divine Intelligence. Traces of the descent of holy truth, in the
                    like disguise, appear in the references found in Plato to early deluges and

                <p>Such, then, is the character of Plato’s philosophy, both in its general method,
                    and in its results, as a theory of the universe, and an information respecting
                    the leading branches of human knowledge.</p>
                <p>It was concerned, we find, more in investigating and establishing first
                    principles, than in drawing out results; in exciting the love of wisdom, rather
                    than in aiding in the research after it. With him, indeed, philosophy and its
                    method of inquiry, as we have seen, are one; and, in like manner, philosophy and
                    its several branches coalesce in his system into one. We have spoken of his
                    logical, and physical, and ethical doctrines, as if they were distinct subjects;
                    but in his mind the one theory of Ideas held these several doctrines in its
                    embrace, and made them indissolubly one with itself. For his design throughout
                    is, to establish universal principles common to every subject, and on these to
                    build a structure of philosophy,—a counterpart in the human mind to the universe
                    itself, and comprehending therefore all that relates to the Deity, to man, and
                    to the world. He would place the mind of the philosopher far above the scenes in
                    which man lives, and endue him with a keenness and range of vision, extending
                    over the whole region of speculation, and leaving no part, either from its
                    largeness or from its minuteness, unexplored. The problem which he undertakes to
                    solve is, how all things are both one and many; how, amidst the multiplicity of
                    phenomena with which we are surrounded, a real unity still subsists and pervades
                    the whole. He proceeds on the conviction, that to attain to this unity, so far
                    at least as our faculties will enable us to attain to it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532856" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2856-0041"/>(for in itself it is
                    incomprehensible and ineffable), is to find the clue to that maze of sensible
                    things which bewilders human observation. He was not intent, therefore, on
                    distinguishing and arranging the several branches of knowledge, but on bringing
                    all into subjection to his commanding theory of the perfect unity. He has not,
                    in fact, elaborated, or even sketched, any one particular science. He has shewn
                    how the sciences may be distributed, or rather furnished hints for such a
                    distribution. But he has left the task of doing so to others after him, as
                    subordinate agents, filling up the details and supplying the omissions of his
                    system. His was characteristically a one-making mind. It analysed,— not,
                    however, for the purpose of finding and arranging the component elements of a
                    subject, bjjt in search of the one vivifying principle, which gives form, and
                    truth, and goodness, and beauty, to everything. He omits, accordingly, to
                    examine with minuteness into secondary agencies, which are the proper study of
                    the particular sciences, in order that he may direct attention to the
                    master-principle, by which all subordinate principles are held together, and by
                    which they work as concurring causes in the infinite variety of actual phenomena
                    with such energy and constancy of operation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It was left for his pupil Aristotle to take up the business of philosophy where

                    introduce order into the field of science, by assigning to each particular

                    subject where Plato had left it, and to carry it out to the fulness of an
                    instructive method, and a systematic exposition of truth; and such a successor
                    was found in Aristotle. Aristotle, as controverting the Theory of Ideas, may
                    perhaps be regarded by some as an antagonist, rather than a successor, to Plato.
                    But every succeeding system of philosophy is partly a polemic against its
                    predecessor, by whose labours it nevertheless -has profited. So it was with the
                    great movement of mind commenced by Plato. It languished under Speusippus and
                    Xenocrates, and the still more remote successors in the Academia. But in the
                    Lyceum, the rival school in name, but the rival only as the vigorous offspring
                    of the declining parent, a crowd of hearers such as that whom the great magician
                    of the Academia had called around him, was once more assembled, and Athens again
                    assumed the form of an university. In Aristotle’s system, accordingly, we see
                    the productiveness of t]aose germs of philosophy which the genius of Plato had
                    planted and reared. Others cultivated the germs themselves; and some fostered
                    them into a wild luxuriance. It was by being engrafted on the sturdy stock of
                    Aristotle’s mind, that they received fresh vigour, and produced fruits, though
                    not strictly their own, yet partaking of their life and richness.<note

                <p>If we take Plato’s philosophy as a whole in its complex form, not simply as a
                    system of philosophy, but a system in which philosophy, and eloquence, and
                    poetry, and deep religious and moral feeling, are harmoniously combined, it
                    stands alone in the history of literature. There is nothing which approaches to
                    it under this point of view, nothing which may be properly regarded as a
                    continuation of it. It is a splendid work of rare genius, like the Homerie poems
                    or the Minerva of Phidias, which no other artist has ever equalled.
                    Philosophical dialogues have been written in imitation of those of Plato; but
                    how unlike to them, how altogether inferior to them in conception and execution!
                    There is learning, and eloquence, and grace, in whatever the accomplished mind
                    of Cicero has touched. But compare his most finished specimens in this way with
                    the Dialogues of Plato, and what a deficieney appears! Dignity and refinement of
                    mind, and an acquaintance with the stores of philosophy, shine forth in the
                    Dialogues of Cieero. But we miss altogether the depth and the exquisiteness of
                    thought, the range and the minuteness of vision, the exactness of reasoning, the
                    lively sketches of character and manners, which interest and astonish us by
                    their combination in the Dialogues of Plato. Xenophon had great knowledge of
                    human nature, and has thrown an air of great naturalness over his simple
                    descriptions, whether it is conversations and moral lessons that he relates, or
                    stirring scenes of history. But his Soeratic dialogues do not admit of
                    comparison with the elaborate efforts of Plato. They were clearly intended only
                    as accounts of what Socrates had taught, and did not aim at any artist-like
                    effect, as compositions. Or, if we turn to the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi>
                    of Plutarch, there, again, much as the author admired and studied Plato, we
                    observe an entire want of that tact in the management of the dialogue, which so
                    engages our attention amidst the subtilties of Plato’s discussions. If we
                    compare, again, the imitations of Plato in the Dialogues of Berkeley and
                    Shaftesbury, we find the like contrast as in those of Cicero. Superior as these
                    are in composition to other efforts of the kind in our language, they still give
                    no proper representation of the spirit or the form of the Platonic Dialogue.
                    There is no life in the interlocutors of these Dialogues; and the author himself
                    is scarcely concealed behind their masks. Nor are there any touches of natural
                    feeling or incident to connect the argument with the personality of the
                    speakers; such as those in the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> where the
                    discussion opens with the loosing of the chains from the limbs of Socrates, his
                    bending and rubbing his leg, and expressing the pleasure arising from the
                    contrast of his pain before; circumstances, not merely thrown in by way of
                    dramatic interest, but leading, in immediate application, to the argument in
                    hand. As we have said, then, the philosophy of Plato taken in connection with
                    the admirable compositions in which it is contained, stands alone in the history
                    of literature. It is due to the charm of the composition, that the interest of
                    the reader is sustained amidst much of dry abstract speculation, requiring the
                    closest attention, and considerable acquaintance with the subjects of
                    philosophical discussion, in order to follow it. It was this charm in great
                    measure, doubtless, which rendered the writings of Plato, in spite of their
                    abstruseness and subtilty in many parts, so acceptable to Grecian taste. He had
                    his crities also and censors; but all seem to have concurred in placing him at
                    the head of the philosophical writers of Greece. Objection was taken by some to
                    the severity of his sarcasm against the leading Sophists and other great names.
                    Complaint, too, was made of his putting sentiments and words into the mouth of
                    Soerates which Socrates had never used; and of his anachronisms, in bringing
                    together in conversation, persons, who, from the period at which they
                    flourished, could never have met. But these were merely minute criticisms. It
                    was seen by those who entered into the spirit of his writings, that he was still
                    the great master throughout,—that he was not giving,, in his Dialogues, a
                    history of individuals or of the times, but a general character of classes of
                    men, and the prevailing tone, both of philosophical discussion and of popular
                    opinion. The enlightened critic saw that Soerates, for example, is not
                    pourtrayed by him simply as Socrates, but as the characteristic spokesman of the
                    system on which he is engaged ;—and in like manner, that when he brings
                    together· persons of different periods, he overlooks the anachronism, that he
                    may enunciate the doctrines inquired into, in their proper person.</p>
                <p>The perfection to which he wrought the style of his most elaborate Dialogues,
                    will be apparent to those who <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532869"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2869-0042"/>Study them accurately under this point of view. So
                    fastidious, indeed, is the taste with which they have been wrought into their
                    present form, that it cannot be duly appreciated without an accurate and even
                    delicate observa-tibn. Every word seems chosen with care, and every clause of
                    his periods made to flow with its proper rhythm; and this effect at the same
                    time is produced out of the ordinary materials of the language. The words and
                    idioms are those of conversation, and the way in which they are put together
                    seems, at the first view, to be as unstudied as mere conversation. But the
                    result is an exquisite composition, in regard to which we are at a loss to
                    pronounce, whether the depth and the elegance of the thought, or the grace and
                    propriety of expression, most prevail.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    is quite evident that he was not the first to compose Dialogues, were we to look
                    simply to the finished form in which his Dialogues have been executed. They are,
                    doubtless, not the first efforts in that way. But the school of Elea had
                    preceded him in this style. More particularly, however, we are told, that
                    Alcamenus of Teos was the first to write Dialogues; or at least his is the
                    earliest name to which, on the testimony of Aristotle, in a work now lost, the
                    honour of originating the Dialogue has been assigned. But we need look no
                    further than to the Greek drama for the first thought of the Platonic Dialogue.
                    The Mimes of Sophron, and the Comedies of Epicharmus, probably furnished
                    materials from which he was enabled, if not to mould, at least to enrich his
                    Dialogues. The Mimes of Sophron, indeed, it is said, found a place under his
                    pillow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diθg. Lacrt. in

                    intended, not to call forth the applause of spectators, but to elicit thought
                    from a reader.</p>
                <p>Nor, in touching upon the peculiar excellencies of Plato’s</p>
                <p>Dialogues, ought we to omit to notice especially, under this point of view, the
                    delightful mythic narratives, with which he has adorned and relieved his
                    abstract discussions. The art with which he has introduced them is most
                    admirable. They are openings of rich scenery, suddenly presented to the view
                    when least expected ;—tales of an Arabian night succeeding to a morning’s
                    pastime of disputation in some school of Greece ;—solemn shadows from an unseen
                    world, casting their majestic forms over some ordinary incident of daily life.
                    But they are not to be regarded only as embellishments and reliefs to the
                    argument. They bear an important part in the teaching itself of his philosophy.
                    Theysoften down the outline of his reasonings,—taking from them that positive
                    didactic form in which they might appear, amidst the strife of debate, and as
                    wrought out by discussion. The knowledge which his theory aims at imparting, is
                    that of Reminiscence, as we have shewn; and he would not, accordingly, have the
                    results of his inquiry present themselves as anything else but Reminiscence. We
                    are, indeed, to search out the reasons of things. We are not to rest in mere
                    opinion, but to battle our way against error and falsehood, until we rise to the
                    eternal Ideas, the causes of all knowledge, as they are the causes of all Being.
                    Still, we are not to suppose that we can distinctly comprehend the eternal Ideas
                    in themselves. Though they are at last intellectually discerned, it is only “at
                    the last,” and that “scarcely.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
