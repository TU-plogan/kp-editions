                    using it in building.</p>
                <p>As this metal soon melts, and with little heat, it is easy to cast it into
                    figures of any kind, by running it into moulds of brass, clay, plaster, or other
                    material. But the chief article in plumbery consists of sheets and pipes of
                    lead; and as these form the basis of the plumber’s work, we shall here describe
                    the process of making them.</p>
                <p>In casting <hi rend="italic">sheet-lead,</hi> a table or mould is made use of,
                    consisting of large pieces of wood well jointed, add bound with bars of iron at
                    the ends; on the sides of which runs a frame, consisting of a ledge or border of
                    wood, three inches in thickness, and four inches in height from the mould,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">sharps.</hi> The ordinary width of the mould,
                    within these sharps, is from four to five feet; and its length is sixteen,
                    seventeen, or eighteen feet. This should be something longer than the sheets are
                    intended to be, in order that the end where the metal runs off from the mould
                    may be cut off, because it is commonly thin, or uneven, or ragged, at the end.
                    It must stand very even or level in breadth, and something falling from the end
                    in which the metal is poured in, viz. about an inch or an inch and a half in the
                    length of sixteen or seventeen feet or more, according to the thickness of the
                    sheets wanted; for the thinner the sheet, the more declivity the mould should
                    have. At the upper end of the mould stands the pan, which is a concave
                    triangular prism, composed of two planks nailed together at right angles, and
                    two triangular pieces fitted in between them at the ends. The length of this pan
                    is the whole breadth of the mould in which the sheets are cast. It stands with
                    its bottom, which is a sharp edge, on a form at the end of the mould, leaning
                    with one side against it; on the opposite side is a handle to lift it up by, in
                    order to pour out the melted lead; and on that side of the pan which is next the
                    mould are two iron hooks to take hold of the mould, and prevent the pan from
                    slipping whilst the melted lead is pouring out of it into the mould. This pan is
                    lined on the inside with moistened sand, to prevent it from being fired by the
                    hot metal. The mould is also spread over, about two inches thick, with sand
                    sifted and moistened, which is rendered perfectly level by moving over it a
                    piece of wood called a <hi rend="italic">strike,</hi> and smoothing it over with
                    a smoothing plane, which is a plate of polished brass about one fourth of an
                    inch thick, and nine inches square, turned up upon all the four edges, and with
                    a handle fitted on to the upper or concave side. The sand being thus smoothed,
                    it is fit for casting sheets of lead. But if they would cast a cistern, they
                    measure out the bigness of the four sides, and having taken the dimensions of
                    the front or fore part, make mouldings by pressing long slips of wood, which
                    contain the same mouldings, into the level sand; and form the figures of birds,
                    beasts, or anything else, by pressing in the same manner leaden figures upon it,
                    and then taking them off, and at the same time smoothing the surface where any
                    of the sand is raised up by making these impressions upon it. The rest of the
                    operation is the same in casting either cisterns or plain sheets of lead. But
                    before we proceed to mention the manner in which that is performed, it will be
                    necessary to give a more particular description of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >strike.</hi></p>
                <p>The strike, then, is a piece of board about five inches in breadth, and something
                    longer than the breadth of the mould on the inside; and at each end is cut a
                    notch about two inches deep, so that when it is used it rides upon the sharps
                    with those notches. Before they begin to cast, the strike is made ready by
                    tacking on two pieces of an old hat on the notches, or by slipping a case of
                    leather over each end, in order to raise the under side about one eighth of an
                    inch or something more above the sand, according as they would have the sheet to
                    be in thickness; then the under edge of the strike is tallowed and laid across
                    the mould. The lead being melted, it is put into the pan with ladles, in which,
                    when there is a sufficient quantity for the present purpose, the scum of the
                    metal is swept off with a piece of board to the edge of the pan, letting it
                    settle on the sand, which is by this means prevented from falling into the mould
                    at the pouring out of the metal. When the lead is cool enough, which must be
                    regulated according to the thickness of the sheets wanted, and is known by its
                    beginning to stand with a shell or wall upon the sand round the pan, two men
                    take the pan by the handle, or else one of them lifts it by the bar and chain
                    fixed to a beam in tlíe ceiling, and pour it into the mould, whilst another man
                    stands ready with the strike, and as soon as they have done pouring in the
                    metal, puts on the mould, sweeps the lead forward, and draws the overplus into a
                    trough prepared to receive it. The sheets being thus cast, nothing remains but
                    to roll them up or cut them into any measure wanted. But if it be a cistern, it
                    is bent into four sides, so that the two ends may join the back, where they are
                    soldered together; after which the bottom is soldered up.</p>
                <p>We shall next describe the method of casting pipes without soldering. To make
                    these pipes, they have a kind of little mill, with arms or levers to turn it
                    withal. The moulds are of brass, consist of two pieces, which open and shut by
                    means of hooks and hinges, their inward calibre or diameter being, according to
                    the size of the pipe, usually two feet and a half. In the middle is placed a
                    core or round piece of brass or iron, somewhat longer than the mould, and of the
                    thickness of the inward diameter of the pipe. This core is passed through two
                    copper rundies, one at each end of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193533142"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-3142-0063"/>the mould, which they serve to close; and to these
                    is joined a little copper tube about two inches long, and of the thickness the
                    leaden pipe is intended to be of. By means of these tubes the core is retained
                    in the middle of the cavity of the mould. The core being in the mould, with the
                    rundles at its two ends, and the lead melted in the furnace, the latter is taken
                    up in a ladle, and poured into the mould by a little aperture at one end, made
                    in the form of a funnel. When the mould is full, a hook is passed into the end
                    of the core, and, by turning the mill, is drawn out; and after opening the
                    mould, the pipe is also taken out. If they desire to have the pipe lengthened,
                    they put one end of it in the lower end of the mould, and pass the end of the
                    core into it; then shut the mould again, and apply its rundle and tube as
                    before, the pipe just cast serving for a rundle, &amp;c. at the other end.
                    Things being thus replaced, they pour in fresh metal, and repeat the operation
                    till they have got a pipe of the length required.</p>
                <p>For making pipes of sheet-lead, the plumbers have wooden cylinders of the length
                    and thickness required; and on these they form their pipes by wrapping the sheet
                    around them, and soldering up the edges all along them.</p>
                <p>The lead which lines the Chinese tea-boxes is reduced to a thinness which, we are
                    informed, European plumbers cannot imitate. The following account of the process
                    by which the plates are formed was communicated to a writer in the Gentleman’s
                    Magazine, by an intelligent officer of an East Indiaman. The caster sits by a
                    pot containing the melted metal; and has two large stones, the under one fixed,
                    the upper moveable, directly before him. He raises the upper stone by pressing
                    his foot upon the side of it, and with an iron ladle pours in the opening a
                    proper quantity of the fluid metal. He then immediately lets fall the upper
                    stone, and by that means forms the lead into a thin irregular plate, which is
                    afterwards cut into a proper shape. The surfaces of the stones, where they touch
                    each other, are exactly ground together.</p>
