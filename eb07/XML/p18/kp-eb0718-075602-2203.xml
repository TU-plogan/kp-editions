                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    which are not able, by skill in this diabolical art, to resist effectually the

                <p>We do not mean to give an account of the various substances, mixtures, and
                    manipulations necessary in the construction of different fire-works; but, for
                    the reader’s amusement and instruction, we shall mention a few things which are
                    not generally known, and then conclude with the titles of a few works upon
                    pyrotechny.</p>
                <p>The combinations of the different substances employed in the pyrotechny connected
                    with fire-works ought to be guided by a chemical knowledge of these substances.
                    The want of this knowledge causes most of our fire-workers to compound
                    ineffective mixtures, and to follow old and absurd recipes. Great skill in
                    pyrotechny, in its more general sense, was possessed by the Chinese long before
                    the art was known in Europe. The invention of gunpowder seems to be due to them,
                    and perhaps also the invention of fire-works. All those persons we ever
                    conversed with who had been in China, concurred in assuring us that the Chinese
                    fire-works are at this day quite unrivalled in variety, splendour, and beauty.
                    In the account of Lord Macartney’s Embassy to China there is an amusing passage
                    describing the contempt of the Chinese for the best English fire-works that were
                    exhibited to them, and the astonishment of the embassy on witnessing the superb
                    display of fire-works given by the Chinese in return. The most imposing
                    exhibitions of European fire-works used to be those that took place annually at
                    Rome, during certain holidays, on the ramparts of the Castle of St Angelo.</p>
                <p>We shall now give a very few notices of practical pyrotech ny.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lightnings</hi> —The fine seeds of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lycopodium</hi><hi rend="italic">clavatum,</hi> or common club-moss, are
                    extremely inflammable, and arc used in theatres to imitate a vivid flash of
                    lightning, by blowing them from a tube, &amp;c. through the flame of a lamp,
                    &amp;c. These seeds are also used in the composition of some fire-works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Red Fire.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The nitrate of strontia
                    is the chief ingredient in the composition. A beautiful purplish flame is
                    produced by a composition containing chlorate of strontia. To aid in reddening
                    the flame of the former composition, a little lamp-black of the finest quality
                    is generally used; for a red jet of fire from a paper-case formed like that of a
                    serpent, or of a Roman candle, &amp;c., fifteen parts of pulverized gunpowder
                    and four parts of dry nitrate of strontia; a slow and bright-red fire, forty
                    parts of nitrate of strontia, thirteen of pulverized sulphur, five of chlorate
                    of potash, and four of sulphuret of antimony. In this last mixture, to avoid the
                    danger of premature combustion, the chlorate of potash must not be ground in a
                    mortar with the other ingredients, but ground separately, and afterwards mixed
                    with them by shaking and stirring upon a sheet of paper.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Green Fire.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Seventy -seven parts
                    of nitrate of barytes, thirteen of pulverized sulphur, five of chlorate of

                    precautions to be taken as before with regard to the chlorate of potash. The
                    effect of this composition, when burned on the stage of a theatre, is to give a
                    cadaverous and unearthly aspect to the actors. It occurred to us many years ago,
                    that an extension of some of the effects of De Loutherbourg’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fidophusikon</hi> might be easily and effectively adapted to the stage. Where
                    the ioot-lights are, or else above the proscenium or front of the stage, an
                    apparatus might be contrived to throw variously-coloured lights upon the actors
                    and the scenery in the representation of magical incantations, supernatural
                    appearances, &amp;c. The disposition and reflection of these variously-coloured
                    lights might be diversified in such a manner as to produce the most singular
                    contrasts and unexpected effects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brilliant and sparkling jets of</hi> Fire—These are produced
                    from compositions rammed into paper-cases of various sizes. One of these
                    compositions may consist of eighteen parts of pnlverized gunpowder, five of
                    bright steelfilings, and two of saltpetre; another of sixteen parts of
                    pulverized gunpowder, seven of steel-filings, one of saltpetre, and one of

                    crystal, one of gum-arabic, two of pulverized gunpowder, fifteen of saltpetre,
                    six of sulphur, and two of zinc-filings. The composition for these and other
                    stars is made into a stiff paste with alcohol, and then cut into small
                    cylindrical or square pieces, which are rolled in pulverized gunpowder, and
                    dried in the shade.</p>

                    pounded cast iron, eight of pulverized gunpowder, six of saltpetre, six of

                    of saltpetre, and one of sulphur; all rammed into paper-cases or other
                    cases.</p>

                    fire is generally seen in the vertical fire-wheels, &amp;c. When the composition
                    is well made, the sparks drop down somewhat like burning flowers of the jasmine.
                    Its excellence depends chiefly on the use, in the composition, of bright filings
                    or raspings from the steel-springs of clocks or watches, carefully deprived of
                    all the finer dust that may be amongst them. The minute shavings of steel,
                    procured from turners in metal, may also be used. Compositions for this kind of
                    fire, six parts of steel-filings or shavings, sixteen of pulverized gunpowder,
                    one of saltpetre, one of sulphur; or five parts of same filings, &amp;c.,
                    sixteen of pulverized gunpowder, one of saltpetre, one of sulphur; or four parts
                    of filings, twenty of pulverized gunpowder, one of saltpetre, one of sulphur,
                    and four of zinc-tilings or raspings, or pounded zinc rendered pulverizable by
                    being heated to about 205 of the centigrade scale. The compositions for the
                    Chinese fire and the jasmine flowers arc to be mixed up in the same manner. The
                    sulphur, the pounded cast iron, or the steelfilings, are mixed with the addition
                    of a little pure alcohol, and then the other ingredients are added. It must be
                    observed, that the size of the particles of pounded cast iron or of
                    steel-filings should be proportioned to the size of the cases that are to be
                    filled with the composition; the smallest filings, &amp;c. being used for the
                    smallest cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bengal Lights</hi> The common ones are made of one part of

                    in their order. Vases are filled with these compositions, a light gunpowder dust
                    sprinkled over the top, and the whole closed up by a piece of paper pierced with
                    some holes from which pieces of quick-match project. These lights may be made of
                    any size. They sometimes weigh upwards of 200 pounds.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542229" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2229-0758"/>
                <p>It is necessary to warn the reader that fulminating mercury requires great
                    caution in handling it; and, as it is so apt to explode, it had better be left
                    out of the composition for these lights, or any other fire-works. Indeed the
                    pyrotechnist has need to exercise the greatest possible caution in all his
                    operations. For instance, it may, in ignorance, be imagined that no harm can
                    happen from pounding gunpowder in a mortar along with iron or steel-filings,
                    &amp;c. and yet the most serious accidents may result from manipulations of this
                    kind incautiously conducted.</p>
                <p>One of the most formidable pyrotechnical inventions is the Congreve rocket. We
                    have conversed with some officers who served in the war against the Burmese, and
                    they described the effect of these rockets as appaling, not only to the Burmese,
                    but even to the stout-hearted Britons who fired them off.</p>
                <p>Without entering into any very minute description of the process of making such
                    popular fire-works as the common sky-rocket, the Roman candle, &amp;c. we shall
                    content ourselves with a brief account of the general construction of these two.
                    The common sky-rocket consists of a strong paper or thin pasteboard case, the
                    lower end of which, where the cotton quick-match is inserted, is drawn so close
                    by means of a cord as to leave only a circular opening of about one third of the
                    interior diameter of the case. This is technically called <hi rend="italic"
                    >choking</hi> the case. The case, when dried after pasting, is placed in a
                    hollow cylinder of wood, into which it fits. This mould is furnished with a
                    moveable bottom having a central nipple and a tapering spike of iron, which
                    last, entering the aperture at the lower end of the case, rises within it nearly
                    to the top. The space left round this spike is filled gradually, and by repeated
                    blows from a mallet upon a hollow rammer, with a composition of pulverized
                    gunpowder, saltpetre, and charcoal, or of sixteen parts of saltpetre, twelve of
                    elm charcoal, and four of purified flour of sulphur. The rammer, which fits the
                    inner diameter of the case, and to which the mallet is applied, has in its
                    centre a deep hollow adapted to the iron spike before mentioned. The composition
                    which forms the charge of the case must be put in by small quantities at a time,
                    and driven down compactly by regulated blows of the mallet upon the rammer. The
                    filling of the case in this manner requires skill and experience, because if the
                    charge is not uniformly compacted in the case, the rocket will not rise evenly
                    and regularly. When the charge has been driven a little higher than the top of
                    the spike, a round piece of doubled paper* is put in; and upon •this one half of
                    the inner paper of the remainder of the case is folded down and rammed firmly,
                    so as to close the case. This plug is then pierced with a few holes, and above
                    it are placed, along with some of the composition, or with some gunpowder, the
                    stars, sparks, &amp;c. that are intended to appear when the rocket has reached
                    its highest ascent. The top of the case is then covered in, and fitted with a
                    paper cone. In signal-rockets, that are intended to end with a report without
                    stars, &amp;c. the round piece of double paper before mentioned is pierced with
                    a hole in the centre, and a little gunpowder is pressed firmly in above it, but
                    without crushing the grains. The top of the case is then choked <hi
                    rend="italic">close,</hi> and the paper cone fitted on. In some other rockets
                    that contain what are called <hi rend="italic">decorations,</hi> that is, stars,
                    sparks, serpents, crackers, &amp;c., these are placed with meal-powder in a
                    wider cylindrical case, which is fitted to the top of the case containing the
                    charge. These rockets are also terminated by a conical cap. We may remark, that
                    in our common rockets the conical cap is not sufficiently stiff to maintain its
                    form invariably, and so to aid in the regular ascent of the rocket. The
                    balance-stick has next to be fastened to the rocket. The length, thick-íiess,
                    and weight of this stick, require calculation to suit it to the dimensions and
                    weight of the case. On the Continent, rockets have been made to ascend without
                    sticks by means of a triangle of pasteboard passing round the case, or by means
                    of three pasteboard wings glued to the case. Each of these wings forms an
                    isosceles triangle, in height six interior diameters of the rocket-case, and a
                    little more than two of these diameters at the base. Each of these wings must be
                    glued on quite parallel to the axis of the case, otherwise the flight of the
                    rocket will be irregular. A short stick with similar wings has also been
                    employed for rocket-cases. It is stated that all these winged rockets rose
                    beautifully, even in a violent wind and bad weather; but some allowance must
                    surely be made for the lateral action upon them of a strong wind.</p>
                <p>The Roman candle consists of a strong case of paper or of thin pasteboard, which
                    is completely closed at the lower end. It is generally charged with the same
                    composition as sky-rocket cases, alternating with gunpowder and stars, as
                    follows: First a small quantity of composition is placed at the bottom of the
                    case, and rammed down compactly by a rammer and mallet; next a small quantity of
                    gunpowder, and above that a star without any ramming, but a gentle push to
                    secure the contact of the star with the gunpowder; then a quantity of the
                    composition, which is rammed down as before; next a little more gunpowder and a
                    star, and then more composition rammed down; and so on till the case is filled.
                    The case is then closed by a piece of papermatch pasted round the outside, and
                    twisted to a point at the top. The charges of Roman candles might be diversified
