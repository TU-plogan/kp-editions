                <p><label type="entry">PROPERTY</label>, in a general sense, is a particular virtue
                    or quality which nature has bestowed upon some things exclusive of all others.
                    Thus, colour is a property of light; extension, figure, divisibility, and
                    impenetrability, are properties of body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Property,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is described
                    to be the highest right which a person has or can have to any thing.</p>
                <p>There is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination and engages the
                    affections of mankind, as the right of property; or that sole and despotic
                    dominion which one man claims and exercises over certain external things of the
                    world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.
                    And yet there are very few that will give themselves the trouble to consider the
                    origin and foundation of this right. Pleased as we are with the possession, we
                    seem afraid to look back to die means by which it was acquired, as if suspicious
                    of some defect in our title; or at best we rest satisfied with the decision of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193540955" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0955-0660"/>laws in
                    our favour, without examining the reason or authority upon which those laws have
                    been built. We think it enough that our title is derived from the grant of the
                    former proprietor, by descent from our ancestors, or by the last will and
                    testament of the dying owner, not caring to reflect, that, strictly and
                    accurately speaking, there is no foundation in nature or in natural law why a
                    set of words upon parchment should convey the dominion of land; why the son
                    should have a right to exclude his fellow-creatures from a determinate spot of
                    ground, because his father had done so before him; or why the occupier of a
                    particular field or of a jewel, when lying upon his death-bed, and no longer
                    able to maintain possession, should be entitled to tell the rest of the world
                    which of them should enjoy it after him. These inquiries, it must be owned,
                    would be useless, and even troublesome, in common life. It is well if the mass
                    of mankind obey the laws when made, without scrutinizing too nicely into the
                    reasons of making them. But when law is to be considered not only as a matter of
                    practice, but also as a rational science, it cannot be improper or useless to
                    examine more deeply the rudiments and grounds of these positive constitutions of
                    society.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the world, we are informed by Holy Writ, that the
                    all-bountiful Creator gave to man dominion over all the earth; “over the fish of
                    the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth
                    upon the earth.” This is the only true and solid foundation of man’s dominion
                    over external things, whatever airy metaphysical notions may have been started
                    by fanciful writers upon this subject. The earth, therefore, and all things
                    therein, are the general property of all mankind, exclusive of other beings,
                    from the immediate gift of the Creator. And, whilst the earth continued thinly
                    inhabited, it is reasonable to suppose that all was in common amongst them, and
                    that every one took from the public stock to his own use such things as his
                    immediate necessities required.</p>
                <p>These general notions of property were then sufficient to answer all the purposes
                    of human life, and might perhaps still have answered them, had it been possible
                    for mankind to have remained in a state of primeval simplicity; as may be
                    collected from the manners of many American nations, when first discovered by
                    the Europeans, and from the ancient method of living amongst the first Europeans
                    themselves, if we may credit either the memorials of them preserved in the
                    golden age of the poets, or the uniform accounts given by historians of those
                    times wherein <hi rend="italic">erant omnia</hi><hi rend="italic">communia
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">indivisa</hi><hi rend="italic">omnibus, veluti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">unum cunctis patrimonium esset.</hi> Not that this communion of
                    goods seems ever to have been applicable, even in the earliest ages, to aught
                    but the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of the thing; nor could it be extended
                    to the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of it. For, by the law of nature and reason,
                    he who first began to use it acquired therein a kind of transient property, that
                    lasted as Jong as he was using it, and no longer; or, to speak with greater
                    precision, the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> of possession continued for the same
                    time only that the <hi rend="italic">act</hi> of possession lasted. Thus the
                    ground was in common, and no part of it was the permanent property of any man in
                    particular; yet whoever was in the occupation of any determinate spot of it, for
                    rest, for shade, or the like, acquired for the time a sort of ownership, from
                    which it would have been unjust, and contrary to the law of nature, to drive him
                    by force; but the instant that he quitted the use or occupation of it, another
                    might seize it without injustice. Thus also a vine or other tree might be said
                    to be in common, as all were equally entitled to its produce; and yet any
                    private individual might gain the sole property of the fruit which he had
                    gathered for his own repast: a doctrine well illustrated by Cicero, who compares
                    the world to a great theatre, which is common to the public, and yet the place
                    which any man has taken is for the time his own.</p>
                <p>But when mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it became necessary to
                    entertain conceptions of more permanent dominion, and to appropriate to
                    individuals, not the immediate <hi rend="italic">use</hi> only, but the very <hi
                    rend="italic">substance</hi> of the thing to be used; otherwise innumerable
                    tumults must have arisen, and the good order of the world been continually
                    broken and disturbed, whilst a variety of persons were striving who should get
                    the first occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had actually
                    gained it. As human life also grew more and more refined, abundance of
                    conveniencies were devised to render it more easy, commodious, and agreeable;
                    such as habitations for shelter and safety, and raiment for warmth and decency.
                    But no man would be at the trouble to provide either, as long as he had only an
                    usufructuary property in them, which was to cease the instant that he quitted
                    possession; if, as soon as he walked out of his tent, or pulled off his garment,
                    the next stranger who came by would have a right to inhabit the one and to wear
                    the other. In the case of habitations in particular, it was natural to observe,
                    that even the brute creation, to whom everything else was in common, maintained
                    a permanent property in their dwellings, especially for the protection of their
                    young; that the birds of the air had nests, and the beasts of the field had
                    caverns, the invasion of which they esteemed a very flagrant injustice, and
                    would sacrifice their lives to preserve them. Hence a property was soon
                    established in every man’s house and home-stall; which seem to have been
                    originally mere temporary huts or moveable cabins, suited to the design of
                    Providence for more speedily peopling the earth, and suited to the wandering
                    life of their owners, before any extensive property in the soil or ground was
                    established. And there can be no doubt, but that moveables of every kind became
                    sooner appropriated than the permanent substantial soil; partly because they
                    were more susceptible of a long occupancy, which might be continued for months
                    together without any sensible interruption, and at length by usage ripen into an
                    established right; but principally because few of them could be fit for use,
                    till improved and meliorated by the bodily labour of the occupant, which,
                    bestowed upon any subject that before lay in common to all men, is universally
                    allowed to give the fairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property
                    therein.</p>
                <p>The article of food was a more immediate call, and therefore a more early
                    consideration. Such as were not contented with the spontaneous product of the
                    earth sought for a more solid refreshment in the flesh of beasts, which they
                    obtained by hunting. But the frequent disappointments incident to that method of
                    provision induced them to gather together such animals as were of a more tame
                    and sequacious nature, and to establish a permanent property in their flocks and
                    herds, in order to sustain themselves in a less precarious manner, partly by the
                    milk of their dams, and partly by the flesh of the young. The support of these
                    their cattle made the article of water also a very important point. And
                    therefore the book of Genesis, the most venerable monument of antiquity,
                    considered merely with a view to history, will furnish us with frequent
                    instances of violent contentions concerning wells; the exclusive property of
                    which appears to have been established in the first digger or occupant, even in
                    places where the ground and the herbage remained yet in common. Thus we find
                    Abraham, who was but a sojourner, asserting his right to a well in the country
                    of Abimelech, and even exacting an oath for his security, “because he had digged
                    that well.” And Isaac, about ninety years afterwards, reclaimed this his
                    father’s property, and, after much contention with the Philistines, was suffered
                    to enjoy it in peace.</p>
                <p>All this while the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in common as
                    before, and open to every occupant; except perhaps in the neighbourhood of
                    towns, where the necessity of a sole and exclusive property in lands, for the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193540968" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0968-0661"/>sake of
                    agriculture, was earlier felt, and therefore more readily complied with.
                    Otherwise, when the multitude of men and cattle had consumed every convenience
                    upon one spot of ground, it was deemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy
                    such other lands as would more easily supply their necessities. This practice is
                    still retained amongst the wild and uncultivated nations that have never been
                    formed into civil states, like the Tartars and others in the East; where the
                    climate itself, and the boundless extent of their territory, conspire to retain
                    them still in the same savage state of vagrant liberty, which was universal in
                    the earliest ages, and which Tacitus informs us continued amongst the Germans
                    till the decline of the Roman empire. We have also a striking example of the
                    same kind in the history of Abraham and his nephew Lot. When their joint
                    substance became so great, that pasture and other conveniencies grew scarce, the
                    natural consequence was, that a strife arose between their servants; so that it
                    was no longer practicable to dwell together. This contention Abraham endeavoured
                    to compose: “Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me. Is not
                    the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt
                    take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right
                    hand, then I will go to the left.” This plainly implies an acknowledged right,
                    in either, to occupy whatever ground he pleased, that was not pre-occupied by
                    other tribes. “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
                    that it was well watered everywhere, even as the garden of the Lord. Then Lot
                    chose him all the plain of Jordan, and journeyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the
                    land of Canaan.”</p>
                <p>Upon the same principle was founded the right of migration, or sending colonies
                    to find out new habitations, when the mother-country was overcharged with
                    inhabitants; which was practised as well by the Phoenicians and Greeks, as by
                    the Germans, Scythians, and other northern people. And, as long as it was
                    confined to the stocking and cultivation of desert uninhabited countries, it
                    kept strictly within the limits of the law of nature.</p>
                <p>But as the world by degrees grew more populous, it daily became more difficult to
                    find out new spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon former occupants; and by
                    constantly occupying the same individual spot, the fruits of the earth were
                    consumed, and its spontaneous produce destroyed, without any provision for a
                    future supply or succession. It therefore became necessary to pursue some
                    regular method of providing a constant subsistence; and this necessity produced,
                    or at least promoted and encouraged, the art of agriculture. And the art of
                    agriculture, by a regular connection and consequence, introduced and established
                    the idea of a more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been
                    received and adopted. It was evident that the earth would not produce her fruits
                    in sufficient quantities without the assistance of tillage; but who would be at
                    the pains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to seize upon and
                    enjoy the product of his industry, art, and labour? Had not therefore a separate
                    property in lands, as well as moveables, been vested in some individuals, the
                    world must have continued a forest, and men have been mere animals of prey;
                    which, according to some philosophers, is the genuine state of nature. Whereas
                    now, so graciously has Providence interwoven our duty and our happiness
                    together, the result of this very necessity has been the ennobling of the human
                    species, by giving it opportunities of improving its rational faculties, as well
                    as of exerting its natural. Necessity begat property; and in order to insure
                    that property, recourse was had to civil society, which brought along with it a
                    long train of inseparable concomitants; states, governments, laws, punishments,
                    and the public exercise of religious duties. Thus connected together, it was
                    found that a part only of society was sufficient to provide, by their manual
                    labour, for the necessary subsistence of all; and leisure was given to others to
                    cultivate the human mind, to invent useful arts, and to lay the foundation of
                    science.</p>
                <p>The only question remaining is, How this property became actually vested, or what
                    it is that gave a man an exclusive right to retain in a permanent manner that
                    specific land which before belonged generally to every body, and particularly to
                    nobody? And, as we before observed that <hi rend="italic">occupancy</hi> gave
                    the right to the temporary <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the soil, so it is
                    agreed upon all hands, that occupancy gave also the original right to the
                    permanent property in the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of the earth itself,
                    which excludes every one else but the owner from the use of it. There is indeed
                    some difference amongst the writers on natural law, concerning the reason why
                    occupancy should convey this right, and invest one with this absolute property:
                    Grotius and Puftendorf insisting that this right of occupancy is founded upon a
                    tacit and implied assent of all mankind, that the first occupant should become
                    the owner; and Barbeyrac, Titius, Locke, and others, holding that there is no
                    such implied assent, neither is it necessary that there should be, as the very
                    act of occupancy alone, being a degree of bodily labour, is, from a principle of
                    natural justice, without any consent or compact, sufficient of itself to found a
                    title. The dispute, however, savours too much of nice and scholastic refinement.
                    But both sides agree in this, that occupancy is the thing by which the title was
                    in fact originally acquired; every man seizing to his own continued use such
                    spots of ground as he found most agreeable to his own convenience, provided he
                    found them unoccupied by any one else.</p>
                <p>Property, both in lands and moveables, being thus originally acquired by the
                    first taker, which taking amounts to a declaration that he intends to
                    appropriate the thing to his own use, it remains in him, by the principle of
                    universal law, till such time as he does some other act which shows an intention
                    to abandon it; for then it becomes, naturally speaking, <hi rend="italic"
                    >publici</hi><hi rend="italic">juris</hi> once more, and is liable to be again
                    appropriated by the next occupant. So if one is possessed of a jewel, and easts
                    it into the sea or a public highway, this is such an express dereliction, that a
                    property will be vested in the first fortunate finder who shall seize it to his
                    own use. But if he hides it privately in the earth, or other secret place, and
                    it is discovered, the finder acquires no property therein; for the owner had not
                    by this act declared any intention to abandon it, but rather the contrary; and
                    if he loses or drops it by accident, it cannot be collected from thence that he
                    designed to quit the possession; wherefore in such eases the property still
                    remains in the loser, who may claim it again of the finder. And this, we may
                    remember, is the doctrine of the English law with relation to <hi rend="italic"
                    >treasure-trove.</hi></p>
                <p>But this method of one man’s abandoning his property, and another seizing the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> vacant possession, however well founded in theory,
                    could not long subsist in fact. It was calculated merely for the rudiments of
                    civil society, and necessarily ceased amongst the complicated interests and
                    artificial refinements of polite and established governments. In these it was
                    found, that what became inconvenient or useless to one man, was highly
                    convenient and useful to another, who was ready to give in exchange for it some
                    equivalent that was equally desirable to the former proprietor. This mutual
                    convenience introduced commercial traffic, and the reciprocal transfer of
                    property by sale, grant, or conveyance; which may be considered either as a
                    continuance of the original possession which the first occupant had, or as an
                    abandoning of the thing by the present owner, and an immediate successive
                    occupancy of the same by the new proprietor. The voluntary dereliction of the
                    owner, and delivering the possession to another individual, amount to a transfer
                    of the property; the proprietor declaring his intention no longer to occupy the
                    thing himselfi but that his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193540981"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-0981-0662"/>own right of occupancy shall be vested in the new
                    acquirer. Or, taken in the other light, if I agree to part with an acre of my
                    land to Titius, the deed of conveyance is an evidence of my intending to abandon
                    the property; and Titius, being the only or first man acquainted with such my
                    intention, immediately steps in and seizes the vacant possession. Thus the
                    consent expressed by the conveyance gives Titius a good right against me, and
                    possession or occupancy confirms that right against all the world besides.</p>
                <p>The most universal and effectual way of abandoning property is by the death of
                    the occupant, when, both the actual possession and intention of keeping
                    possession ceasing, the property, which is founded upon such possession and
                    intention, ought also to cease of course. For, naturally speaking, the instant a
                    man ceases to be, he ceases to have any dominion; otherwise, if he had a right
                    to dispose of his acquisitions one moment beyond his life, he would also have a
                    right to direct their disposal for a million of ages after him, which would be
                    highly absurd and inconvenient. All property must therefore cease upon death,
                    considering men as absolute individuals, and unconnected with civil society; for
                    then, by the principles before established, the next immediate occupant would
                    acquire a right in all that the deceased possessed. But as, under civilized
                    governments, which are calculated for the peace of mankind, such a constitution
                    would be productive of endless disturbances, the universal law of almost every
                    nation, which is a kind of secondary law of nature, has either given the dying
                    person a power of continuing his property, by disposing of his possessions by
                    will; or, in case he neglects to dispose of it, or is not permitted to make any
                    disposition at all, the municipal law of the country then steps in, and declares
                    who shall be the successor, representative, or heir of the deceased; that is,
                    who alone shall have a right to enter upon this vacant possession, in order to
                    avoid that confusion which its becoming common again would occasion. And
                    farther, in case no testament be permitted by the law, or none be made, and no
                    heir can be found so qualified as the law requires, still, to prevent the robust
                    title of <hi rend="italic">occupancy</hi> from again taking place, the doctrine
                    of escheats is adopted in almost every country, whereby the sovereign of the
                    state, and those who claim under his authority, are the ultimate heirs, and
                    succeed to those inheritances to which no other title can be formed.</p>
                <p>The right of inheritance, or descent to the children and relations of the
                    deceased, seems to have been allowed much earlier than the right of devising by
                    testament. We arc apt to conceive at the first view that it has nature on its
                    side; yet we often mistake for nature what we find established by long and
                    inveterate custom. It is certainly a wise and effectual, but clearly a
                    political, establishment; since the permanent right of property, vested in the
                    ancestor himself, was not a natural, but merely a civil, right. It is true, that
                    the transmission of one’s possessions to posterity has an evident tendency to
                    make a man a good citizen and a useful member of society: it sets the passions
                    on the side of duty, and prompts a man to deserve well of the public, when he is
                    sure that the reward of his services will not die with himself, but be
                    transmitted to those with whom he is connected by the dearest and most tender
                    affections. Yet, reasonable as this foundation of the right of inheritance may
                    seem, it is probable that its immediate origin arose not from speculations
                    altogether so delicate and refined, but, if not from fortuitous circumstances,
                    at least from a plainer and more simple principle. A man’s children or nearest
                    relations are usually about him on his death-bed, and are the earliest witnesses
                    of his decease. They became therefore generally the next immediate occupants,
                    till at length in process of time this frequent usage ripened into general law.
                    And therefore also in the earliest ages, on the failure of children, a man’s
                    servants born under his roof were allowed to be his heirs, being immediately on
                    the spot when he died. For we find the patriarch Abraham expressly declaring,
                    that “since God had given him no seed, his steward Eliczer, one born in his
                    house, was his heir.”</p>
                <p>Whilst property continued only for life, testaments were useless and unknown; and
                    when it became inheritable, the inheritance was long indefeasible, and the
                    children or heirs at law were incapable of exclusion by will; until at length it
                    was found, that so strict a rule of inheritance made heirs disobedient and
                    headstrong, defrauded creditors of their just debts, and prevented many
                    provident fathers from dividing or charging their estates as the exigencies of
                    their families required. This introduced pretty generally the right of disposing
                    of one’s property, or a part of it, by <hi rend="italic">testament;</hi> that
                    is, by written or oral instructions properly witnessed and authenticated,
                    according to the pleasure of the deceased, which we therefore emphatically style
                    his <hi rend="italic">will.</hi> This was established in some countries much
                    later than in others. In England, till modern times, a man could only dispose of
                    one third of his moveables from his wife and children; and in general, no will
                    was permitted of lands till the reign of Henry VIII. and then only of a certain
                    portion; for it was not till after the Restoration that the power of devising
                    real property became so universal as at present.</p>
                <p>Wills, therefore, and testaments, rights of inheritance, and successions, are all
                    of them creatures of the civil or municipal laws, and accordingly are in all
                    respects regulated by them; every distinct country having different ceremonies
                    and requisites to make a testament completely valid. Neither does any thing vary
                    more than the right of inheritance under different national establishments. In
                    England particularly, this diversity is carried to such a length, as if it had
                    been meant to point out the power of the laws in regulating the succession to
                    property, and how futile every claim must be that has not its foundation in the
                    positive rules of the state. In personal estates, the father may succeed to his
                    children; in landed property, he never ’ can be their immediate heir by any the
                    remotest possibility. In general, only the eldest son, in some places only the
                    youngest, in others all the sons together, have a right to succeed to the
                    inheritance. In real estates, males are preferred to females, and the eldest
                    male will usually exclude the rest; in the division of personal estates, the
                    females of equal degree are admitted together with the males, and no right of
                    primogeniture is allowed.</p>
                <p>This one consideration may help to remove the scruples of many well-meaning
                    persons, who set up a mistaken conscience in opposition to the rules of law. If
                    a man disinherits his son, by a will duly executed, and leaves his estate to a
                    stranger, there are many who consider this proceeding as contrary to natural
                    justice; whilst others so scrupulously adhere to the supposed intention of the
                    deed, that if a will of lands be attested by only two witnesses instead of
                    three, which the law requires, they are apt to imagine that the heir is bound in
                    conscience to relinquish his title to the devisee. But both of them certainly
                    proceed upon very erroneous principles: as if, on the one hand, this son had by
                    nature a right to succeed to his father’s lands; or as if, on the other, the
                    owner was by nature entitled to direct the succession of his property after his
                    own decease; whereas the law of nature suggests, that on the death of the
                    possessor, the estate should again become common, and be open to the next
                    occupant, unless otherwise ordered, for the sake of civil peace, by the positive
                    law of society. The positive law of society, which is with us the municipal laws
                    of England and Scotland, directs it to vest in such person as the last
                    proprietor shall by will, attended with certain requisites, appoint; and, in
                    defect of such appointment, to go to some particular person, who, from the
                    result of certain local constitutions, appears to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193540994" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0994-0663"/>the heir at law. Hence it
                    follows that, where the appointment is regularly made, there cannot be a shadow
                    of right in any one but the person appointed; and, where the necessary
                    requisites are omitted, the right of the heir is equally strong, and built upon
                    as solid a foundation as the right of the devisee would have been supposing such
                    requisites were observed.</p>
                <p>But, after all, there are some few things which, notwithstanding the general
                    introduction and continuance of property, must still unavoidably remain in
                    common, being those in which nothing but an usufructuary property is capable of
                    being had; and therefore they still belong to the first occupant, during the
                    time he holds possession of them, and no longer. Such, amongst others, are the
                    elements of light, air, and water, which a man may occupy by means of his
                    windows, his gardens, his mills, and other conveniencies; such also are the
                    generality of those animals which are said to be <hi rend="italic">ferae
                    naturae,</hi> or of a wild and untameable disposition, and which any man may
                    seize upon and keep for his own use or pleasure. All these things, as long as
                    they remain in possession, every man has a right to enjoy without disturbance;
                    but if once they escape from his custody, or he voluntarily abandons the use of
                    them, they return to the common stock, and any other man has an equal right to
                    seize and enjoy them afterwards.</p>
                <p>Again, there are other things in which a permanent property may subsist, not only
                    as to the temporary use, but also the solid substance; and which yet would
                    frequently be found without a proprietor, had not the wisdom of the law provided
                    a remedy to obviate this inconvenience. Such are forests and other waste
                    grounds, which were omitted to be appropriated in the general distribution of
                    lands: such also are wrecks, estrays, and that species of wild animals which the
                    arbitrary constitutions of positive law have distinguished from the rest by the
                    well-known appellation of <hi rend="italic">game.</hi> With regard to these and
                    some others, as disturbances and quarrels would frequently arise amongst
                    individuals contending about the acquisition of this species of property by
                    first occupancy, the law has therefore wisely cut up the root of dissension, by
                    vesting the things themselves in the sovereign of the state, or else in his
                    representatives appointed and authorized by him, being usually the lords of
                    manors. And thus our legislature has universally promoted the grand ends of
                    civil society, the peace and security of individuals, by steadily pursuing that
                    wise ‘and orderly maxim, of assigning to everything capable of ownership a legal
                    and determinate owner.</p>
