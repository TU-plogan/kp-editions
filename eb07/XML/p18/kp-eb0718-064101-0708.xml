                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="italic">Projectiles</hi> is applied
                    to that part of mechanical philosophy which treats of the motion of bodies
                    anyhow projected from the surface of the earth, and influenced by the action of
                    terrestrial gravity.</p>
                <p>It is demonstrated in the physical part of astronomy, that a body so projected
                    must describe a conic section, having the centre of the earth in one focus; and
                    that it will describe round that focus areas proportional to the times. It
                    follows also from the principles of that science, that if the velocity of
                    projection exceed 36,700 feet in a second, the body (if not resisted by the air)
                    would describe a hyperbola; if the velocity be just 36,700 feet in a second, the
                    body would describe a parabola; and a body projected with a smaller velocity
                    than this would describe an ellipse. In the first case, if projected directly
                    upwards, it would never return, but proceed for ever, its velocity continually
                    diminishing, but never becoming less than an assignable portion of the excess of
                    the initial velocity above 36,700 feet in a second. In the second case it would
                    never return; its velocity would diminish without end, but never be
                    extinguished. In the third case it would proceed till its velocity was reduced
                    to an assignable portion of the difference between 36,700 feet and its initial
                    velocity, and would then return, regaining its velocity by the same degrees and
                    in the same places as it lost it. These are necessary consequences of a gravity
                    directed to the centre of the earth, and inversely proportional to the square of
                    the distance. But in the greatest projections that we are able to make, the
                    gravitations are so nearly equal, and in directions so nearly parallel, that it
                    would be ridiculous affectation to pay any regard to the deviations from
                    equality and parallelism. A bullet rising a mile above the surface of the earth
                    loses only <hi rend="subscript"> 2δ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> δσ</hi> of its weight, and a horizontal range of 4 miles makes
                    only 4' of deviation from parallelism.</p>
                <p>Let us therefore assume gravitation as equal and parallel. The errors arising
                    from this assumption are quite insensible in all the uses which can be made of
                    this theory.</p>
                <p>Gravity must be considered by us as a constant or uniform accelerating or
                    retarding force, according as it produces the descent, or retards the ascent, of
                    a body. A constant or invariable accelerating force is one which produces an
                    uniform acceleration; that is, which in equal times produces equal increments of
                    velocity, and therefore produces increments of velocity proportional to the
                    times in which they are produced. Forces are of themselves imperceptible, and
                    are only sensible in their effects; and they have no measure but the effect, or
                    what <hi rend="italic">measures</hi> the effect; and every thing which we can
                    discover with regard to those measures, we may affirm with regard to the things
                    of which we assume them as the measures. Hence this proposition :—</p>
                <p>The motion of a falling body, or of a body projected directly downwards, is
                    uniformly accelerated; and that of a body projected directly upwards is
                    uniformly retarded; that is, the acquired velocities are as the times in which
                    they are acquired by falling, and the extinguished velocities are as the times
                    in which they are extinguished. The following consequences are readily deduced
                    from the proposition now enunciated:</p>
                <p>1. If bodies simply fall, not being projected downwards by an external force, the
                    times of the falls are proportional to the final velocities; and the times of
                    ascents, which terminate by the action of gravity alone, are proportional to the
                    initial velocities.</p>
                <p>2. The spaces described by a heavy body falling from rest are as the squares of
                    the acquired velocities; and the differences of these spaces are as the
                    differences of the squares of the acquired velocities; and, on the other hand,
                    the heights to which bodies projected upwards will rise, before their motions
                    are extinguished, are as the squares of the initial velocities.</p>
                <p>3. The spaces described by falling bodies are proportional to the squares of the
                    times from the beginning of the fall; and the spaces described by bodies
                    projected directly upwards are as the squares of the times of the ascents.</p>
                <p>4. The space described by a body falling from rest is one-half of the space which
                    the body would have uniformly described in the same time, with the velocity
                    acquired by the fall. And the height to which a body will rise, in opposition to
                    the action of gravity, is one-half of the space which it would uniformly
                    describe in the same time with the initial velocity.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the difference of the spaces which a falling or rising body
                    describes in any equal successive parts of its fall or rise, is one-half of the
                    space which it would uniformly describe in the same time with the difference of
                    the initial and final velocities.</p>
                <p>The last proposition will be more conveniently expressed for our purpose as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>A body moving uniformly during the time of any fall with the velocity acquired
                    thereby, will in that time describe a space double of that fall; and a body
                    projected directly upwards will rise to a height which is one-half of the space
                    which it would describe in the time of its ascent with the initial velocity of
                    projection, if the motion continued uniform.</p>
                <p>It is a matter of observation and experience, that a heavy body falls 16 feet and
                    one inch English measure in a second of time; and therefore acquires the
                    velocity of 32 feet 2 inches per second. This cannot be ascertained directly,
                    with the precision that is necessary. A second is too small a portion of time to
                    be exactly measured and compared with the space described; but the observation
                    is made with the greatest accuracy by comparing the motion of a falling body
                    with that of a pendulum. The time of a vibration is to the time of falling
                    through half the length of the pendulum, as the circumference of a circle is to
                    its diameter. The length of a pendulum can be ascertained with great precision;
                    and in this way the space fallen through in a second has been accurately
                    measured.</p>
                <p>As all forces are ascertained by the accelerations which they produce, they are
                    conveniently measured by comparing their accelerations with the acceleration of
                    gravity. This therefore has been assumed by all the later and best writers on
                    mechanical philosophy as the unit by which every other force is measured. It
                    gives us a perfectly distinct notion of the force which retains the moon in its
                    orbit, when we say it is the 3600th part of the weight of the moon at the
                    surface of the earth. We mean by this, that if a bullet were weighed at the
                    surface of the earth by a spring steelyard, and pulled the spring out to the
                    mark 3600; if the body were then taken to the distance of the moon, it would
                    pull the spring out only to the mark 1. And we make this assertion on the
                    authority of our having observed that a body at the distance of the moon falls
                    from that distance <hi rend="subscript"> 5δ</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> δδ</hi> th part of 16 feet in a second. We do not
                    therefore compare the <hi rend="italic">forces,</hi> which are imperceptible
                    things; we compare the accelerations, which are at the same time their effects
                    and their measures.</p>

                <p>Philosophers have therefore been at great pains to determine with precision the
                    fall of heavy bodies, in order to have an exact measure of the accelerating
                    power of terrestrial gravity. Now we must here observe, that this measure may be
                    taken in two ways; we may take the space through which the heavy body falls in a
                    second; or we may take the velocity which it acquires in consequence of gravity
                    having acted on it during a second. The last is the proper measure, for it is
                    the immediate effect on the body. The action of gravity has changed the state of
                    the body by giving it a determination to motion downwards; and this both points
                    out the nature, and the degree or intensity, of the force of gravity. The space
                    described in a second by falling, is not an invariable measure; for, in the
                    successive seconds, the body falls through 16, 48, 80, 112, &amp;c. feet, but
                    the changes of the body’s state in each second is the same. At the beginning it
                    had no determination to move with any appreciable velocity; at the end of the
                    first second it had a determination by which it would have gone on for eVer (had
                    no subsequent force acted on it) at the rate of 32 -feet per second. At the end
                    of the next second, it had a determination by which it would have moved for
                    ever, at the rate of 64 feet per second. At the and of the third second, it had
                    a determination by which it would have moved for ever, at the rate of 96 feet
                    per second, &amp;c. The differences of these determinations are constant, and
                    amount to 32 feet per second. This is therefore the indication and proper
                    measure of the constant or invariable force of gravity. The space fallen through
                    in the first second is of use only as it is one-half of the measure of this
                    determination; and as halves have the proportion of their wholes, different
                    accelerating forces may be safely affirmed to be in the proportion of the spaces
                    through which they uniformly impel bodies in the same time. But we should always
                    recollect, that this is but one-half of the true measure of the accelerating
                    force.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to investigate the formulae of rectilinear motion.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">X</hi> b 3 the space described by a moving body in a

                    the time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> When the motion is uniform, the space
                    described is in the compound ratio of the velocity and the time, therefore <hi

                    velocity varies by infinitely small degrees, and we may therefore assume it to

                    But the space over which the body moves in the time <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi>

                    supposed to act in the straight line in which the body is moving at the instant;
                    and as an accelerating force becomes a retarding force by changing the sign from
                    positive to negative, it is usually called, in both cases, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >accelerating force.</hi> In order to obtain the measure of &lt;ρ, we must
                    consider the effect it produces. Since the motion may be regarded as uniform

                    which produces a velocity = V in the portion of time which is taken as unit;
                    then the velocity produced by the force F in the time <hi rend="italic">dt</hi>
                    is Vc⅛, and we have this proportion, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>: F:: <hi

                    the last equation gives &lt;∕=2Λ=32 feet; and the three equations become, in

                <p>To give some examples of the use of these formulae, let it be required,</p>
                <p>1. To find the time of falling through 256 feet. Here 4=256, <hi rend="italic"

                    of 56 feet per second, or the height through which a body must fall to acquire
                    this velocity. In this case we have</p>
                <p>56, 56÷8=7, = √4, 7 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> =4, =49 feet.</p>
                <p>or 56 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =3136, 3136÷64=49 feet.</p>
                <p>5. Suppose a body projected directly downwards with the velocity of 10 feet per
                    second; what will be its velocity after four seconds? In four seconds it will
                    have acquired, by the action of gravity, the velocity of 4 × 32, or 128 feet,
                    and therefore its whole velocity will be 138 feet per second.</p>
                <p>6. To find how far it will have moved, compound its motion<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193540734" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0734-0643"/> of projection, which will be
                    40 feet in four seconds, with the motion which gravity alone would have given it
                    in that time, which is 256 feet; and the whole motion will be 296 feet.</p>
                <p>7∙ Suppose the body projected, as in the 5th example, and that it is required to
                    determine the time it will take topass through 296 feet, and the velocity it
                    will have acquired.</p>

                    falling from this height. Then find the time <hi rend="italic">t'</hi> of
                    falling through the height 296 <hi rend="italic">A∙h,</hi> and the velocity <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> acquired by this fall. The time of describing the 296 feet

                <p>These examples will suffice for the perpendicular ascents or descents of heavy
                    bodies, abstracting from the resistance of the air. We now proceed to consider
                    the motions of bodies projected obliquely. The subject is one of considerable
                    interest, as it forms the foundation of the theory of gunnery.</p>
                <p>Let a body be projected from the point A (fig. 1.) in any direction AK not
                    perpendicular to the horizon, and with a given velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >—a;</hi> it is required to determine the path of the body, and all the
                    circumstances of its motion.</p>
                <p>Since gravity acts only in the vertical direction, and the body, after being
                    projected, is acted on by no other accelerating force, it is evident, in the
                    first place, that the whole of the trajectory, or path described by the
                    projectile, must be contained in the vertical plane which passes through AK. In
                    the second place, since the action of gravity is constant, the projectile must
                    describe a continuous curve, to which AK is a tangent at A. Through A draw AB
                    horizontal, and AH vertical, and let these lines be taken as the axes of the
                    rectangular co-ordinates to which the different points of the curve are
                    referred. Let P be the place of the projectile at the end of the time 7; draw
                    PQ. perpendicular to AB, and make <hi rend="smallcaps">AQ=z,</hi> PQ=y. The
                    object is now to find the equation of the trajectory by establishing a relation
                    between the co-ordinates <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >y.</hi></p>
                <p>Let the angle KAB, which the initial direction of the projectile makes with the
                    horizon, be denoted by A. As we abstract from the resistance of the air, the
                    motion in the direction AK is uniform, and proportional to the time <hi
                    rend="italic">t;</hi> and the velocity of projection being <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> the velocity in the direction AB (which is not affected by gravity) is
                    also uniform, and equal to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cos A, therefore the space
                    passed over being equal to the product of the time by the velocity, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">χ-=∙a</hi> cos A. To find <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> we must
                    consider that the motion in the vertical direction is made up of two parts;
                    first, that which is due to the velocity of projection; and, second, that which
                    arises from the action of gravity. The velocity in the direction AH, independent
                    of gravity, is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sin A; and therefore the space described
                    in that direction in the time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ta</hi> sin A. But by the formula III. the space through which the body is
                    carried in the time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> by the accelerating force of
                    gravity is <hi rend="italic">⅛gt</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi>; and
                    as this is in the direction opposite to the former, it must be taken with the
                    negative sign. We have therefore <hi rend="italic">y==tα</hi> sin A— <hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">gt</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                <p>we shall have the equation of the trajectory. The first gives <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Having found the equation of the curve, it is easy to assign its position in the
                    plane of the co-ordinates. Let B be the point in which the parabola meets the
                    horizontal line drawn through A, C the vertex of the parabola, and let CD be
                    perpendicular to AB. The point C is thus found. Let <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> be
                    the angle which the tangent to the curve at any point P makes with the axis AB;
                    we have then for any curve whatever, tan <hi rend="italic">ð dx=dy.</hi> At the
                    vertex, the tangent becomes parallel to AB, consequently <hi rend="italic"
                    >ô</hi> vanishes, and we have —0</p>
                <p>Now on differentiating the equation (2), we find tf?/ . <hi rend="italic">x</hi>

                <p>To find the point B in which the projectile meets the horizontal line AB, it is
                    only necessary to make <hi rend="italic">y-^</hi> in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> ’
                    equation (3). This gives 0=afran A— <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>-.; whence <hi

                <p>From this equation it appears that when the velocity of projection α, or the
                    height <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> corresponding to that velocity, is given, the

                    (that is, KAB) is equal to 45°, for then sin 2A=l. In this case we have AB=2∕z,
                    that is to say, when a ball is projected with an angle of elevation equal to 45
                    degrees, the amplitude or range on the horizontal plane is equal to twice the
                    height from which a body must fall in order to acquire a velocity equal to the
                    velocity of projection.</p>
                <p>To find the velocity at any point P of the trajectory, in the direction of the

                    projecting the body under two different angles of elevation, and the points
                    which the projectile cannot reach at all.</p>
                <p>The different expressions which have been found in the preceding solution, may be
                    represented by a very simple geometrical construction. On the vertical line
                    passing through A, (fig. 2.) take AH=7z= height due to the velocity of
                    projection <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and let AK be the initial direction. On AH
                    describe a semicircle, meeting AK in L, make LM perpendicular to AH, and join
                    IIL. Since ALH is a right angle, and therefore AHL=LAB=</p>
                <p>A, we have AL=A sin A, AM=AL sin A=A sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> A; and
                    LM=AL cos A=7i cos A sin A. Comparing these expressions with the equations (4),
                    we have ∙r <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 2LM, and yι=AM,a∙ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> being
                    the co-ordinates of the vertex. Hence the vertex of the parabola lies in the
                    straight line MI., and is obtained by making LC=MI.. It follows also from the
                    equation (5), that AB, the horizontal range, is equal to 4ML.</p>
                <p>Through L conceive a straight line to be drawn perpendicular to AB, or parallel
                    to AH. This line will either be a tangent to the semicircle, or will meet it in
                    another point L'. In the former case the angle of elevation is 45°, and there is
                    only one parabola corresponding to the given velocity <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    through which a projectile can pass to B. But when the horizontal range AB is
                    less than twice the height AH due to the velocity, the vertical drawn through L
                    again meets the circle in L ’, and AL ’ is the tangent to another parabola which
                    passes through B, and of which the vertex is situated at the intersection of DC
                    with M‘L ’ parallel to AB.</p>
                <p>From the equation (3) the parameter of the parabola is <hi rend="italic">4h</hi>
                    cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> A. But DC=A sin <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> A; whence DC + ½ parameter =7z, and consequently MH=½ parameter. But (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Conic Sections,</hi> Part I. prop, xiv.) the distance of
                    the directrix of a parabola from its vertex is equal to one-fourth of the
                    parameter; and hence a straight line drawn through H parallel to AB is the
                    common directrix of all the parabolas which can be described by a body projected
                    from A with the velocity due to the height AH.</p>
                <p>The focus of the parabola A C B is at the point F where H L meets the axis C D,
                    and the focus of A C ’ B at the point F' where H L' meets the axis; and if a
                    circle be described about A as a centre, with a radius = A H, the foci of all
                    the parabolas which can be described with the given velocity of projection, will
                    be in the circumference of that circle.</p>
                <p>These few simple propositions contain the whole theory of the motion of
                    projectiles in vacuo, or independent on the resistance of the air; and being
                    easily investigated, and connected with very interesting practice, they have
                    been much commented on, and have furnished matter for many splendid volumes. But
                    the air’s resistance occasions such a prodigious diminution of motion in the
                    great velocities of military projectiles, that this parabolic theory, as it is
                    called, is hardly of any use. Mr. Robins found that a musket-ball, discharged
                    with the usual allotment of powder, had the velocity of 1700 feet in a second.
                    This requires a fall of45,15β feet, and the range therefore should be 90,312,or
                    17½miles; whereas it does not much exceed half a mile. A twenty-four pound ball,
                    discharged with sixteen pounds of powder, should range about sixteen miles;
                    whereas it is generally short of three miles. It is only in the cases of slow
                    motions, not exceeding 300 or 400 feet in a second, that the theory can be of
                    any use, for then the path of the projectile differs little from a parabola.</p>
                <p>In such experiments as can be performed with great accuracy in a chamber, the
                    coincidence is as great as can be wished. A jet of water or mercury, gives us
                    the finest example, because we have the whole parabola exhibited in the
                    simultaneous places of the succeeding particles. Yet even in these experiments a
                    deviation can be observed. When the jet is made on a horizontal plane, and the
                    curve carefully traced on a perpendicular plane held close by it, it is found
                    that the distance between the highest point of the curve and the mark is less
                    than the distance between it and the spout, and that the descending branch of
                    the curve is shorter than the ascending branch. And this difference is more
                    remarkable as the jet is made with greater velocity, and reaches to a greater
                    distance; and it is evidently produced by the resistance of the air, which
                    diminishes the velocity, without affecting the gravity of a projectile. It is
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193540760" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0760-0645"/>still more
                    sensible in the motion of bombs. These can be traced through the air by the
                    light of their fuzes; and we see that their highest point is always much nearer
                    to the mark than to the mortar on a horizontal plane.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the problem of determining the path of a projectile in a
                    resisting medium, and as the solution is attended with considerable difficulty,
                    and cannot be obtained without the aid of the integral calculus, we shall
                    endeavour to render it more perspicuous, by considering separately, 1st, the
                    motion of a body allowed to fall from rest; 2d, of a body projected vertically
                    upwards; and, lastly, the general case of a body projected with a given velocity
                    in any direction oblique to the horizon. In order to simplify the subject, we
                    shall suppose the density of the medium to be uniform, which may be considered
                    to be the case of the atmosphere at all altitudes which can be reached by a
                    projectile from the ground; and that the projected body is a sphere, either
                    homogeneous, or composed of spherical strata, for each of which the density is
                    uniform.</p>
                <p>Suppose then the body to be let fall, or submitted to the action of gravity, and
                    let R denote the force with which it is resisted at any given instant. By the
                    principles of dynamics the corresponding accelerating force is equal to the
                    moving force R divided by the mass of the body, (or the moving force referred to
                    the unit of mass,) therefore the accelerating force due to the resistance is
                    R÷m. As this force acts in the direction opposite to gravity, it must be taken
                    with the negative sign, or deducted from <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and the whole
                    accelerating force, causing the descent of the body being represented by &lt;p,
                    we have τ</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">φ=g</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> R÷?n. (6)</p>
                <p>It is necessary to remark, for the sake of preserving accurate principles, that a
                    body descends in air, not by the whole of its weight, but by the excess of its
                    weight above that of the air which it displaces. It descends by its <hi
                    rend="italic">specific</hi> gravity only as a stone descends in water. Suppose a
                    body 32 times heavier than an equal bulk of air, it will be buoyed up by a force
                    equal to 1-32d part of its weight; and, instead of acquiring the velocity of 32
                    feet in a second, it will only acquire a velocity of 31, even though it
                    sustained no resistance from the inertia of the air. Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi> be the weight of the body, and <hi rend="italic">id</hi> the weight of
                    an equal bulk of air, then the <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> acceleration of
                    gravity will be correctly expressed by <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ^1—— Butin all
                    practical cases, and particularly in the case of military projectiles, which
                    have a great density, the fraction which enters into this expression is so small
                    that it is not Worth attending to.</p>
                <p>In order to reduce the force R÷roto its simplest expression, let <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> denote the radius of the sphere, and δ its mean density.
                    Its volume is then jwr <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, (w being as usual the
                    ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,) and we have for the
                    mass τn=^wor <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. With respect to the force R, the
                    usual hypothesis is to suppose it to be proportional to the square of the
                    velocity of the moving body, to the surface of the projectile, and also to the
                    density of the air. If then we take <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> to represent the
                    density of the air, and assume <hi rend="italic">n=</hi> a numerical factor to
                    be found by experiment, we shall have <hi rend="italic">^R=ηp v</hi><hi

                <p>Since R÷ffl is an accelerating force of the same nature as gravity, and may

                    gravity, or when R÷m=y, and it is consequently no longer urged by an
                    accelerating or retarding force. For the resistance being assumed proportional
                    to the square of the velocity, and R÷m being the retarding force due to the

                <p>Thus the retarding force due to any velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is
                    expressed in terms of the terminal velocity, but the great difficulty is to
                    procure an absolute measure of this quantity. Sir Isaac Newton has attempted to
                    determine the resistance by theory, and employs a great part of the second book
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> in demonstrating, that the resistance to
                    a sphere moving with any velocity, is to the force which would generate or
                    destroy its whole motion in the time that it would uniformly move over § of its
                    diameter with this velocity, as the density of the air is to the density of the
                    sphere. This is equivalent to demonstrating that the resistance of the air to a
                    sphere moving through it with any velocity, is equal to half the weight of a
                    column of air having a great circle of the sphere for its base, and for its
                    altitude the height from which a body must fall in <hi rend="italic">vacuo</hi>
                    to acquire this ∣velocity. This appears from Newton’s demonstration; for, let
                    the specific gravity of the air be to that of the ball as , 1 to <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi>; then, because the times in which the same velocity . will
                    be extinguished by the uniform action of different forces are inversely as the
                    forces, the resistance to this velocity would extinguish it in the time of
                    describing <hi rend="italic">§ βd,d</hi> being the diameter of the ball. Now 1
                    is to <hi rend="italic">β</hi> as the weight of the displaced air to the weight
                    of the ball, or as ∣ of the ball to the length of a column of air of equal
                    weight. Call this length <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> is therefore equal to f <hi rend="italic">β d.</hi> Suppose
                    the ball to fall from the height <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in the time <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> and acquire the velocity «. If it moved uniformly with
                    this velocity <hi rend="italic">u</hi> during the time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    it would describe a space =24, or 1 <hi rend="italic">β d.</hi> Now its weight
                    would extinguish this velocity, or destroy this motion, in the same time, that
                    is, in twice the time of falling. The resistance therefore is equal to half the
                    weight of the ball, or to half the weight of the column of air whose height is
                    the height producing the velocity. But the resistances to different velocities
                    are as the squares of the velocities, and therefore, as their producing heights;
                    and, in general, the resistance of the air to a sphere moving with any velocity,
                    is equal to the half weight of a column of air of equal section, and whose
                    altitude is the height producing the velocity. The result of this investigation
                    has been acquiesced in by all Sir Isaac Newton’s commentators. Many faults have
                    indeed been found with his reasoning, and even with his principles; and it must
                    be acknowledged that his reasoning is liable to serious objections, which his
                    most ingenious commentators have not completely removed. We must add, however,
                    that all the causes of deviation from the duplicate ratio of the velocities, and
                    the causes of increased resistance, which the latter authors have valued
                    themselves for discovering and introducing into their investigations, were
                    pointed out by Sir Isaac Newton, but purposely omitted by him, in order to

                <p>We may take an example. A ball of cast iron weighing 12 pounds, is 4½ inches in
                    diameter. Suppose this ball to move at the rate of 25} feet in a second (the
                    reason of this choice will appear afterwards). The height which will produce
                    this velocity in a falling body is 9} feet. The area of its great circle is
                    0∙11044 feet, or <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 0

                    weight of the air incumbent on this great circle, and 9⅛ feet high, is 0O81151
                    pounds; half of this is 0O405755, or nearly of a pound. This should be the
                    resistance of the air to this motion of the ball.</p>
                <p>Newton himself attempted to compare his propositions with experiment. Some were
                    made by dropping balls from the dome of St. Paul’s cathedral; and all these
                    shewed as great a coincidence with his theory as they did with each other; but
                    the irregularities were too great to allow him to say with precision what was
                    the resistance. It appeared to follow the proportion of the squares of the
                    velocities with sufficient exactness; and though he could not say that the
                    resistance was' equal to the weight of the column of air having the height
                    necessary for communicating the velocity, it was always equal to a determinate
                    part of it; and might be stated <hi rend="italic">≈n h, η</hi> being a number to
                    be fixed by numerous experiments.</p>
                <p>Newton made another set of experiments with pendulums; and has pointed out some
                    very curious and unexpected circumstances of their motions in a resisting
                    medium. Their results were much more uniform, and confirmed his general theory;
                    which, as we have said above, has been acquiesced in by the first
                    mathematicians.</p>
                <p>But the deductions from this theory were so inconsistent with the observed
                    motions of military projectiles, when the velocities are prodigious, that no
                    application could be made which could be of any service for determining the path
                    and motion of cannon shot and bombs; and although John Bernoulli gave, in 1718,
                    a most elegant determination of the trajectory and motion of a body projected in
                    a fluid which resists in the duplicate ratio of the velocities, it has remained
                    a dead letter. Mr. Benjamin Robins was the first who suspected the true cause of
                    the imperfection of the usually received theories; and in 1737 he published a
                    small tract, in which he showed clearly, that even the Newtonian theory of
                    resistance must cause a cannon ball, discharged with a full allotment of powder,
                    to deviate farther from the parabola, in which it would move <hi rend="italic"
                    >in vacuo,</hi> than the parabola deviates from a straight line. But he farther
                    asserted, on the authority of good reasoning, that in such great velocities the
                    resistance must be much greater than this theory assigns; because, besides the
                    resistance arising from the <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi> of the air which is
                    put in motion by the ball, there must be a resistance arising from a
                    condensation of the air on the anterior surface of the ball, and a rarefaction
                    behind it; and there must be a third resistance, arising from the statical
                    pressure of the air on its anterior part, when the motion is so swift that there
                    is a vacuum behind. Even these causes of disagreement with the theory had been
                    foreseen and mentioned by Newton (see the Scholium to prop. .37, book ii. <hi
                    rend="italic">Princip.)</hi>; but the subject seems to have been little attended
                    to.</p>
                <p>Two or three years after this first publication, Mr. Robins invented that
                    ingenious method of measuring the great velocities of military projectiles,
                    which has handed down his name to posterity, and discovered the prodigious
                    resistance of the air by observing the diminution of velocity which it
                    occasioned. This made him anxious to examine what was the real resistance to any
                    velocity whatever, in order to ascertain what was the law of its variation; and
                    he was equally fortunate in this attempt. His method of measuring the resistance
                    has been fully described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunnery.</hi></p>
                <p>It appears (Robins’s <hi rend="italic">Math. Works,</hi> vol. i. p. 205,) that a
                    sphere of 4½ inches in diameter, moving at the rate of 25} feet in a second,
                    sustained a resistance of 0∙04914 pounds, <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> To
                    Boise <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> pound. This is a greater resistance than
                    that of the Newtonian theory, which gave 0∙0405755, in the proportion of 1000 to
                    1211, or very nearly in the proportion of five to six in small numbers. And we
                    may adopt as a rule in all moderate velocities, that the resistance to a sphere
                    is equal to <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ¾⅛ of the weight of a column of air
                    having the great circle of the sphere for its base, and for its altitude the
                    height through which a heavy body must fall <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> to
                    acquire the actual velocity.</p>
                <p>This experiment is peculiarly valuable, because the ball is precisely the size of
                    a 12-pound shot of cast iron; and its accuracy may be depended on. There is but
                    one source of error. The whirling motion must have occasioned some whirl in the
                    air, which would continue till the ball again passed through the same point of
                    its revolution. The resistance observed is therefore probably somewhat less than
                    the true resistance to the velocity of 25} feet, because it was exerted in a
                    relative velocity which was less than this, and is, in fact, the resistance due
                    to this relative and smaller velocity. The Chevalier de Borda made experiments
                    similar to those of Mr. Robins, and his results exceed those of Robins in the
                    proportion of 5 to 6. It is much to be regretted, that in a subject so
                    interesting both to the philosopher and the engineer, experiments have not been
                    multiplied. Nothing would tend so much to perfect the science of gunnery, and
                    indeed until this be done, no practical advantage can be derived from the
                    theory.</p>
                <p>Adopting this experimental measure of Robins, we have the product <hi
                    rend="italic">ηρ</hi> of equation (7) =∙04914 pounds in respect of a sphere of
                    4½ inches diameter, or 2∙25 inches radius, moving at the rate of 25∙2 feet in a
                    second. In order to determine from this experiment the resistance on a sphere of
                    a different size, and moving with a different velocity, it will be convenient to
                    reduce it to the case corresponding to the units of magnitude and velocity;
                    therefore, since the resistance is assumed proportional to the square of the
                    velocity and the surface of the projectile, or <hi rend="italic">ll=npv</hi><hi

                <p>The logarithm of this number is 5∙18427∙ The resistance here determined is
                    independent of the density of the ball; but the retardation occasioned by it
                    being in proportion to the quantity of motion, will therefore be proportional to
                    the density of the ball, or its specific gravity. Military projectiles are of
                    cast iron or lead, the specific gravities of which may be taken at 7’207, and
                    11∙37 respectively, tlist of water being 1.</p>
                <p>The following examples will illustrate the application of the above formula.</p>
                <p>1. Let it be proposed to find the resistance to a 24-pound iron ball (whose
                    diameter is 5∙β03 inches), moving with the velocity of 1670 feet in a second,
                    which is nearly the velocity communicated by 16 lbs. of gunpowder.</p>
                <p>Here ’ u≈1670, r=2∙8015, and the formula <hi rend="italic">"R=npv</hi><hi

                <p>But it is found, by unequivocal experiments, that the retardation of such a
                    motion, is equivalent to 504 lbs. This is owing to the causes often mentioned,
                    the additional resistance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193540786"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-0786-0647"/> to great velocities, arising from the
                    condensation of the air, and from its pressure into the vacuum left by the
                    ball.</p>
                <p>2. Let the terminal velocity of the same ball be required.</p>
                <p>Here the equation (7) gives <hi rend="italic">-~≈≈g-</hi>; therefore in respect
                    of the ball whose velocity is 1 and radius 1, we have R <hi rend="subscript">

                    rend="italic">, b</hi> being the terminal velocity. Now it is to be observed
                    that the product of the mass of a body into the force of gravity expresses its

                <p>On integrating this equation, and observing that as <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and

                    >b</hi> to be known. It will be observed that the logarithm is hyperbolic, and
                    therefore, if the common tables are used, the tabular logarithm of the number in
                    question must be divided by the modulus of the system M=∙43429 (see <hi

                    ball, and the ratio of its density to that of the air, and must be determined by

                <p>As an example of the formula, assume the terminal velocity =689⅜ feet in a

                <p>The time required for reaching the greatest altitude is found by making r=0 in

                    ^tan= -J. We learn from this expression of the time, that however great the
                    velocity of projection, and the height to which the body will rise, may be, the
                    time of its ascent is limited. It never can exceed the time of falling <hi

                    the resistance to quick motions did not increase faster than the square of the
                    velocity. It probably will attain its greatest height in less than 12 seconds,
                    let its velocity be ever so great.</p>
                <p>Having thus determined the relations subsisting between the velocity, the space
                    described, and the time, in the cases of vertical ascent and descent in a
                    resisting medium, we come now to consider the general problem, and to determine
                    the motion of a body projected in any direction whatever. Our readers will
                    readily conceive that this must be a difficult subject, when they see the
                    simplest cases of rectilineal motion abundantly abstruse. In the infancy of the
                    fluxionary calculus, the difficulty was indeed such that Newton himself did not
                    succeed in obtaining a complete solution of the problem. In the tenth and
                    subsequent propositions of the second book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> he shows what state of density in the air will comport with the
                    motion of a body in any curve whatever; and then, by applying this result to
                    several curves which have some similarity to the path of a projectile, he found
                    one which is not very different from what may be supposed to obtain in the
                    atmosphere. But even the approximation was involved in calculations of such
                    intricacy, that it seemed impossible to make any use of it. In the second
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> published in 1713, he corrects
                    some mistakes into which he had fallen in the first, and carries the
                    approximation much farther, but still does not attempt a direct investigation of
                    the trajectory. In proposition 14, &amp;c. he shows how a body, actuated by a
                    centripetal force, in a medium of a density varying according to certain laws,
                    will describe an eccentric spiral, of which he assigns the properties, and the
                    law of description. Had he supposed the density constant, and the difference
                    between the greatest and least distances from the centre of centripetal force
                    exceedingly small in comparison with the distances themselves, his spiral would
                    have coincided with the path of a projectile in the air of uniform density, and
                    the steps of his investigation would have led him immediately to the complete
                    solution of the problem. For this is the real state of the case. A heavy body is
                    not acted on by equal and parallel gravity, but by a gravity inversely
                    proportional to the square of the distance from the centre of the earth, and in
                    lines tending to that centre nearly; and it has been only with the view of
                    simplifying the investigation, that mathematicians have adopted the other
                    hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Soon after the publication of this second edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> the dispute about the invention of the fluxionary calculus
                    became very violent, and the great promoters of that calculus upon the continent
                    were in the habit of proposing difficult problems as trials of skill to each
                    other. Challenges of this kind frequently passed between the British and
                    foreigners. Dr. Keill of Oxford had keenly espoused the claim of Sir Isaac
                    Newton to this invention, and had engaged in a very acrimonious altercation with
                    the celebrated John Bernoulli of Basle. Bernoulli had published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi> of Leipsic an
                    investigation of the law of the forces, by which a body moving in a resisting
                    medium might describe any proposed curve, reducing the whole to the simplest
                    geometry; and Dr. Keill proposed to him the particular problem of the trajectory
                    and motion of a body moving through the air. Bernoulli very soon solved the
                    problem in a way much more general than it had been proposed, viz. without any
                    limitation either of the law of resistance, the law of the centripetal force, or
                    the law of density, provided only that they were regular, and capable of being
                    expressed algebraically. Dr. Brook Taylor, the celebrated author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Method of Increments,</hi> solved it at the same time, in the
                    limited form in which it was proposed. Other authors since that time have given
                    other solutions. But they are all (as indeed they must be) the same in substance
                    with Bernoulli’s. Indeed they are all (Bernoulli’s not excepted) the same with
                    Newton’s first approximations, modified by the steps introduced into the
                    investigation of the spiral motions mentioned above.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the problem itself, restricted to the case of uniform density
                    and a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity.</p>

                    descending branch, the problem is thus brought within the method of quadratures;
                    that is to say, it depends on finding the areas of two curves, of which the
                    ordinates are respectively ι½(0) and <hi rend="italic">ψ'(6),</hi> corresponding

                    and consequently any number of points may be found in the trajectory.</p>
                <p>Instead of employing the equations (25), the curve may be constructed by means of
                    equation (24), which is the method followed by Euler. That equation gives e <hi

                    the arc AP, and if at the pointy? at a small but finite distance from P, the
                    angle becomes <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> —ω, and the arc z + ∆z, then if the
                    formula be computed for a given value of <hi rend="italic">ô,</hi> (for example

                    rend="italic">ω</hi> (suppose 25°), the difference between the two resulting
                    numbers will give the length of the arc Pjo=∆z. Thus we can find the values of a
                    great number of small portions, and the inclinations of the two tangents at
                    their extremities. We can also assign to each of these portions its proportion
                    of the absciss and ordinate, without having recourse to the values of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi>; for the portion of the

                    rend="italic">—</hi> ½ω being the inclination of its middle point to the

                    >(Ô</hi> —½ω). By adding all these portions together, the co-ordinates will be

                    >6=,</hi> A to 0=0, or through the ascending branch from A to the vertex. Near
                    the point of projection, the variation of the length of the arc is much greater
                    than that of the angle <hi rend="italic">ô,</hi> and therefore at the
                    commencement it may be necessary to compute <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> for each
                    degree, that is, to assume ω=1°; but a sufficiently near approximation will be
                    obtained by taking intervals of 5°, or making ω=5° throughout the rest of the
                    curve. It will be observed that the logarithms of the formulae are hyperbolic;
                    and therefore the logarithms of the common tables must be divided by the modulus

                <p>As the vertex, 0=0, and cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0=1; therefore,

                <p>If there were no resistance, the smallest velocity would be at the vertex, and

                    conspiring (in a small degree, however) with the motion of the body. But in a
                    resisting medium the velocity at the vertex is diminished by a quantity to which
                    the acceleration of gravity in that point bears no assignable proportion. It is
                    therefore diminished upon the whole, and the point of smallest velocity is a
                    little way beyond the vertex. It is not material for our present purpose to

                    moving. We now proceed* to, consider the motion in the descending branch.</p>

                    independently, as if they belonged to different curves.</p>
                <p>In the descending branch the angle 0=ENS continually increases with the distance
                    of the point S from C, until it becomes a right angle, which is its limiting

                    only increase to a certain magnitude, which it would attain when S is at an

                    which is perpendicular to the horizon. To prove this, let the factor K+F(0) be
                    developed, and let us consider what it becomes when <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>
                    approaches its limit. We have F(0)=</p>

                <p>ed to any question in practical artillery. By means of the preceding formulae, we
                    are enabled to compute the motion from any point in the ascending branch to the
                    vertex, where the motion becomes horizontal, and the motion from the vertex to a
                    point in the descending branch, where the motion has acquired another
                    determinate direction; the constants which enter into the formulae being <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> and K, of which <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (=y÷6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) depends on the terminal velocity, and therefore on
                    the nature of the projectile and the ratio of its density to that of the air;
                    and K on the initial velocity, the terminal velocity, and the angle of
                    elevation. We have also shewn that K denotes the ratio of the square of the
                    terminal velocity to the square of the velocity in the vertex; therefore the
                    terminal velocity and velocity in the vertex may be regarded as the two
                    constants of the formulae. The mode in which the formulae are applied to the
                    solution of the usual question, namely, to find the motion of a ball projected
                    in a certain direction, with a certain velocity, is as follows: Suppose a
                    trajectory, computed for a particular terminal velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> and for a particular velocity at the vertex, and that the velocity at
                    that point of the ascending branch where the inclination of the tangent is 30°
                    is 900 feet per second. Then, we are certain, that if a ball, whose terminal
                    velocity is <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> be
                    projected with the velocity of 900 feet per second, and an elevation of 30°, it
                    will describe this very trajectory, and the velocity and time corresponding to
                    every point will be such as is here determined.</p>
                <p>Now this trajectory will, in respect to form, answer an infinity of cases: for
                    its characteristic is the proportion of the velocity in the vertex to the
                    terminal velocity. If, therefore, we compute the trajectories for a sufficient
                    variety of these proportions, we shall find a trajectory that will nearly
                    correspond to any case that can be proposed: and an approximation sufficiently
                    exact will be had by taking a proportional medium between the two trajectories
                    which come nearest to the case proposed.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, a set of tables or trajectories have been computed by the English
                    translator of Euler’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Robinds Gunnery.</hi> They
                    are in number 18, distinguished by the position of the assymptote of the
                    ascending branch. This is given for 5°, 10°, 15°, &amp;c. to 85°, and the whole
                    trajectory is computed as far as it can ever be supposed to extend in
                    practice.</p>
                <p>Since the path of a projectile is much less incurvated, and more rapid in the
                    ascending than in the descending branch, and the difference is so much the more
                    remarkable in great velocities, it must follow, that the range on a horizontal
                    or inclined plane depends most on the ascending branch: therefore the greatest
                    range will not be made with that elevation which bisects the angle of position,
                    but with a lower elevation; and the deviation from the bisecting elevation will
                    be greater as the initial velocities are greater. It is difficult to frame a
                    rule for determining with much precision, the elevation which gives the greatest
                    range.</p>
                <p>When the angle of elevation is very small, and consequently the path of the
                    projectile nearly horizontal, the formulae admit of simplifications which it is
                    important to consider. Suppose KAB(fig.5.) the angle of elevation to be small,
                    then 0, the angle which the tangent at any other point of the trajectory makes
                    with AB, will be very small, and sin <hi rend="italic">6</hi> and tan <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> will be very small fractions. Suppose the angle so small
                    that tan <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0 may be neglected as insensible; then
                    cos <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> may be regarded as unit, and the equation <hi

                <p>The solution which we have now given of this celebrated problem is exact in
                    principle, and the application of it by no means difficult or even operose. But
                    let us see what advantage we are likely to derive from it.</p>
                <p>In the first place, it is very limited in its application. There are few
                    circumstances of general coincidence, and almost every case requires an
                    appropriate calculus. Perhaps the only general rules are the two following:</p>
                <p>1. Balls of equal density, projected with the same elevation, and with velocities
                    which are as the square roots of their diameters, will describe similar curves.
                    This is evident, because, in this case, the resistance will be in the ratio of
                    their quantities of motion. Therefore all the homologous lines of the motion
                    will be in the proportion of the diameters.</p>
                <p>2. If the initial velocities of balls projected with the same elevation are in
                    the inverse subduplicate ratio of the whole resistances, the ranges, and all the
                    homologous lines of their track, will be inversely as those resistances.</p>
                <p>These theorems are of considérable use; for by means of a proper series of
                    experiments on one ball projected with different elevations and velocities,
                    tables may be constructed which give the motions of an infinity of others.</p>
                <p>But when we take a retrospective view of what we have done, and consider the
                    conditions which were assumed in the solution of the problem, we shall find that
                    much yet remains before it can be rendered of great practical use. The
                    resistance is all along supposed to be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity;
                    but even theory points out many causes of deviation from this law, such as the
                    pressure and condensation of the air, in the case of very swift motions; and Mr.
                    Robins’s experiments are sufficient to show us that the deviations must be
                    exceedingly great in such cases. Euler and all subsequent writers have allowed
                    that it may be three times greater, even in cases which frequently occur; and
                    Euler gives a rule for ascertaining with tolerable accuracy what this increase
                    and the whole resistance may amount to. Let H be the height of a column of air
                    whose weight is equivalent to the resistance taken, in the duplicate ratio of
                    the velocity. The whole resistance will be expressed by ∏ +</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>———. This number 28845 is the height in feet of a column of air whose weight
                    balances its elasticity. We shall not at present call in question his reason for
                    assigning this precise addition. They are rather reasons of arithmetical
                    con-veniençy than of physical import. It is enough to observe, that if this
                    measure of the resistance is introduced into the process of investigation, it is
                    totally changed; and it is not too much to say, that with this complication it
                    requires the knowledge and address of a Euler to make even a partial and very
                    limited approximation to a solution. Any law of the resistance, therefore, which
                    is more complicated than what Bernoulli has assumed, namely, that of a simple
                    power of the velocity, must be abandoned on account of the intricacy of the
                    calculations; and’ mathematicians have attempted to avoid the errorarising from
                    the assumption of the duplicate ratio of the velocity, either by supposing the
                    resistance throughout the whole trajectory to be greater than what it is in
                    general, or they have divided the trajectory into different portions, and
                    assigned different resistances to each, which vary, through the whole of that
                    portion, in the duplicate ratio of the velocities. In this manner they make up a
                    trajectory and motion which correspond, in some tolerable degree, not with an
                    accurate theory, but with a series of experiments. For, in the first place,
                    every theoretical computation that we make, proceeds on a supposed initial
                    velocity; and this cannot be ascertained with any thing approaching to
                    precision, by any theory of the action of gunpowder that we are yet possessed
                    of. In the next place, our theories of the resisting power of the air are
                    entirely established on the experiments on the flights of shot and shells, and
                    are corrected and amended till they tally with the most approved experiments we
                    can find. We do not learn the ranges of a gun by theory, but the theory by the
                    range of the gun. Now the variety and irregularity of all the experiments which
                    are appealed to are so great, and the acknowledged difference between the
                    resistance to slow and swift motions is also so great, that there is hardly any
                    supposition which can be made concerning the resistance, that will not agree in
                    its results with many of those experiments. It appears from the experiments of
                    Dr. Hutton of Woolwich, in 1784, 1785, and 1786, that the shots frequently
                    deviated to the right or left of their intended track 200, 300, and sometimes
                    400 yards. This deviation was quite accidental and anomalous, and there can be
                    no doubt but that the shot deviated from its intended and <hi rend="italic"
                    >supposed</hi> elevation as much as it deviated from the intended vertical
                    plane, and this without any opportunity of measuring or discovering the
                    deviation. Now, when we have the whole ranges from one to three to choose among
                    for our measure of resistance, it is evident that the confirmations which have
                    been drawn from the ranges of shot are but feeble arguments for the truth of any
                    opinion. Mr. Robins finds his measures fully confirmed by experiments made at
                    Metz and Minorca. Mr. Muller finds the same. Yet Mr. Robins’s measures, both of
                    the initial velocity and of the resistance, are at least treble of Mr. Muller’s;
                    but by compensation they give the same results. The Chevalier Borda has adduced
                    the very same experiments in support of his theory, in which he abides by the
                    Newtonian measure of the resistance, which is about ½ of Mr. Robins’s, and about
                    ∣ of Muller’s. From all this we may conclude, that we have as yet a very
                    uncertain and imperfect knowledge of the law and the measure of the air’s
                    resistance.</p>
                <p>There is another essential defect in the conditions assumed in the solution. The
                    density of the air is supposed uniform; whereas we are certain that it is less
                    by one-fifth or one-&gt;sixth towards the vertex of the curve, in many cases
                    which frequently occur, than it is at the beginning and end of the flight. This
                    is another latitude given to authors in their assumptions of the air’s
                    resistance. Borda has, with considerable ingenuity, accommodated his
                    investigation to this circumstance, by dividing the trajectory into portions,
                    and, without much trouble, has made one equation answer them all. We are
                    disposed to think that his solution of the problem (in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> of the Academy of Paris for 1769) corresponds better with the
                    physical circumstances of the case than any other. But this process is there
                    delivered in too concise a manner to be intelligible to a person not perfectly
                    familiar with all the resources of modern analysis.</p>
                <p>After all, the practical artillerist must rely chiefly on the records of
                    experiments contained in the books of practice at the academies, or those made
                    in a more public manner^</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193540890" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0890-0655"/>
                <p>Even a perfect theory of the air’s resistance can do him little service, unless
                    the force of gunpowder were uniform. This is far from being the case even in the
                    same powder. A few hours of a damp day will make a greater difference than
                    occurs in any theory; and, in service, it is only by trial that everything is
                    performed. If the first shell fall very much short of the mark, a little more
                    powder is added; and in cannonading, the correction is made by varying the
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Mr. Robins and Dr. Hutton show, in the most incontrovertible
                    manner, that the resistance to a motion exceeding 1100 feet in a second, is
                    almost <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> greater than in the duplicate ratio of
                    the resistance to moderate velocities. Euler’s translator, in his comparison of
                    the author’s trajectories with experiment, supposes it to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >no</hi> greater. Yet the coincidence is very great. The same may be said of
                    Borda’s. Nay, the same may be said of Mr. Robins’s own practical rules: for he
                    assumes the quantity which represents the height due to the terminal velocity,
                    almost double of what these authors do, and yet his rules are confirmed by
                    practice.</p>
                <p>But it must not be inferred from all this, that the physical theory is of no use
                    to the practical artillerist. It plainly shows him the impropriety of giving the
                    projectile an enormous velocity. This velocity is of no effect after 200 or 300
                    yards at farthest, because it is so rapidly reduced by the prodigious resistance
                    of the air. Mr. Robins has deduced several practical maxims of the greatest
                    importance from what we already know of this subject, and which could hardly
                    have been even conjectured without this knowledge. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gunnery.</hi></p>
                <p>It must also be acknowledged, that this branch of physical science is highly
                    interesting to the philosopher; nor should he despair of carrying it to a
                    greater perfection. The defects arise almost entirely from our ignorance of the
                    law of variation of the air’s resistance. Experiments may be contrived much more
                    conducive to our information here than those commonly resorted to. The oblique
                    flights of projectiles are, as we have seen, of very complicated investigation,
                    and ill fitted for instructing us; but numerous and well contrived experiments
                    on the perpendicular ascents are of great simplicity, being affected by nothing
                    but the air’s resistance.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this article, by giving two tables, computed from the
                    principles established above, and which serve to bring into one point of view
                    the chief circumstances of the motion in a resisting medium. Although the result
                    of much calculation, as any person who considers the subject will readily see,
                    they must not be considered as offering any very accurate results; or that, in
                    comparison with one or two experiments, the differences shall not be
                    considerable. Let any person peruse the published registers of experiments which
                    have been made with every attention, and he will see such enormous
                    irregularities, that all expectations of perfect agreement with them must cease.
                    In the experiments at Woolwich in 1785, which were continued for several days,
                    not only do the experiments of one day differ among themselves, but the mean of
                    all the experiments of one day differs from the mean of all the experiments of
                    another no less than one-fourth of the whole. The experiments in which the
                    greatest regularity may be expected, are those made with great elevations. When
                    the elevation is small, the range is more affected by a change of velocity, and
                    still more by any deviation from the supposed or intented direction of the
                    shot.</p>
                <p>The first table shows the distance in yards to which a ball projected with the
                    velocity of 1600 feet in a second will go, before its velocity is reduced
                    one-tenth, and the distance at which it drops 16 feet from the line of its
                    direction. This table is calculated by the resistance observed in Mr. Robins’s
                    experiments. The first column is the weight of the ball in pounds. The second
                    column remains the same whatever be the initial velocity; but the third column
                    depends on the velocity. It is here given for the velocity which is very usual
                    in military service, and its use is to assist us in directing the gun to the
                    mark. If the mark at which a ball of 24 pounds is directed is 474 yards distant,
                    the axis of the piece must be pointed 16 feet higher than the mark. These
                    deflections from the line of direction are nearly as the squares of the
                    distances.</p>

                <p>The next table contains the ranges in yards of a 24- pound shot, projected at an
                    elevation of 45°, with the different velocities in feet per second, expressed in
                    the first column. The second column contains the distances to which the ball
                    would go <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> in a horizontal plane; and the third
                    contains the distances to which it will go through the air. The fourth column is
                    added, to shew the height to which it rises in the air; and the fifth shows the
                    ranges corrected for the diminution of the air’s density as the bullet ascends,
                    and may therefore be called the <hi rend="italic">corrected range.</hi></p>
                <p>The initial velocities can never be pushed as far as they have been calculated
                    for in this table; but we mean it for a table of more extensive use than appears
                    at first sight. Recollect, that while the proportion of the velocity at the
                    vertex to the terminal velocity remains the same, the curves will be similar;
                    therefore, if the initial velocities are as the square roots of the diameters of
                    the balls, they will describe similar curves, and the ranges will be as the
                    diameters of the balls.</p>
                <p>Let it be required, for example, to find the range of a 12- pound shot, projected
                    at an elevation of 45°, with the velocity 1500; suppose the diameter of the
                    twelve-pounder to be√, and that of the twenty-four-pounder D; and let the
                    velocities be <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and V: Then say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sjd:</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    with the velocity V, it will describe a curve similar to that described by the
                    twelve-pounder, having the initial velocity 1500. Therefore find (by
                    interpolation) the range of the twenty-four-pounder, having the initial velocity
                    V. Call this R. Then D: d=R: <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi> the range of the

                <p>the balls to be 4∙45 and 5∙61 inches, respectively, will be found 3312.</p>
                <p>This table* shews the immense difference between the motions through the air and
                    in a void. It shews also that the ranges through the air, instead of increasing
                    in the duplicate ratio of the initial velocities, really increase slower than
                    those velocities in all cases of military service; and in the most usual cases,
                    viz. from 800 to 1600, they increase nearly as the square roots of the
                    velocities.</p>
                <p>A set of similar tables, made for different elevations, would almost complete
                    what can be done by theory, and would be much more expeditious in their use than
                    Mr. Euler’s <hi rend="italic">Trajectories,</hi> computed with great labour by
                    his English translator.</p>
                <p>The same table may also serve for computing the ranges of bomb -shells. We have
                    only to find what must be the initial velocity of the twenty-four-pound shot
                    which corresponds to the proposed velocity of the shell. This must be deduced
                    from the diameter and weight of the shell, by making the velocity of the
                    twenty-four pounder such, that the ratio£of its weight to the resistance may be
                    the same as in the shell.</p>
                <p>Dr. Hutton, in his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tracts</hi> (vol. iii. p. 276),
                    has given a similar table, deduced partly from theory and partly from
                    experiment, but the numbers in the three last columns differ greatly from the
                    above, particularly for the higher velocities. Thus, for the velocity of 1600
                    feet, Dr. Hutton’s corrected range is 2264 yards, and the Height to which the
                    ball rises 650 yards, instead of 4050 and 1814, as in our table.</p>
