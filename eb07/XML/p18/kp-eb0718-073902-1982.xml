                <p><label type="entry">PUNO</label>, a department and city of the republic of
                    Southern Peru, in South America, lying to the eastward of Arequipa and to the
                    south of Cuzco. The surface of the country is nearly all high table-land, being
                    in few places less than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. The climate is
                    cold compared with that of the coast, but on that account it is very healthy.
                    The hordes of domestic animals are numerous, consisting of llamas, sheep,
                    horses, mules, asses, pigs, guanacas, alpacas, and cattle in great abundance.
                    The llama is peculiar to the Peruvian Andes, and of great use, particularly upon
                    roads impassable for mules, or in places where forage is scarce. It is employed
                    in carrying ores from the mines, charcoal, corn, and other burdens. From the
                    great height of this district, agriculture is limited to a few objects. The
                    principal are, potatoes, quinoa, rye, barley, and oats; but the three latter do
                    not ripen to seed, and are cut green for horses. Puno contains a number of
                    silver mines, which in productiveness were at one time only second to those of
                    Potosi. The most noted is that of Laycacota, or Salcedo, as it is now called,
                    after its first proprietor. The mines are situated in a high range of hills
                    forming the western boundary of the great lake of Titicaca. These mountain
                    ridges are chiefly composed of a porphyritic rock, which reposes on a sandstone
                    formation, similar to that of the red marl and sandstone of the British islands,
                    and to the great red sandstone formation of the continent of Europe. In its
                    general disposition, as well as in its mineralogical characteristics, the
                    porphyry of Puno corresponds exactly with those metalliferous porphyries which
                    have produced the immense riches of the Real del Monte, of the Bolanos, and
                    partly of the Guanaxuato mines in Mexico and with those of Hungary and
                    Transylvania; and, like them, it abounds in veins containing the precious
                    metals. The hills of Laycacota, Cancharani, and San José, are one continuous
                    range formed of this porphyry nearly to their bases, and in it are situated the
                    rich veins of silver ore which have rendered the place so celebrated. The
                    produce of these mines, particularly that of Laycacota, during ’ the seventeenth
                    century, was enormous. It appears from documents of indisputable authenticity,
                    that the ore extracted in the year 1668 from the mines of Salcedo produced
                    upwards of a million and a half of dollars. They were afterwards neglected, and
                    only towards the end of the last century they again began to be worked with
                    activity. In the year 1805, they yielded 96,528 marcs of silver. The annual
                    average produce between 1796 and 1820 amounted to nearly 30,000 marcs. Since
                    that time they have been again neglected; and in the month of April 1831 only
                    one mine was worked, which belonged to an Englishman. The mining district of
                    Puno being surrounded on all sides by arid mountains, is almost destitute of
                    wood, so that fuel is scarce. This is one of the reasons why the ores are
                    treated by amalgamation, and not by smelting in furnaces, to which they are
                    peculiarly well adapted, from their being very frequently associated with the
                    ores of lead and copper.</p>
                <p>The grandest natural feature of South America, next to the cordilleras of the
                    Andes, is the Laguna de Puno, commonly called Titicaca or Chucuito. It is
                    situated between the two cordilleras, and is enclosed by the surrounding
                    mountains. According to Mr Pentland, it is placed 12,795 feet above the level of
                    the sea, and is consequently the largest lake in the world found at such an
                    elevation. The same traveller informs us that it occupies an area of almost 4000
                    geographical square miles. With regard to its depth, he states that from
                    accidental circumstances he was not able to obtain deeper soundings than a
                    hundred and twenty fathoms (which, however, is a much greater depth than any
                    hitherto assigned to the lake); “but,” he observes, “from the precipitous cliffs
                    which in many parts of it form the shores, and its islands, I am persuaded that
                    its depth in the central portion is much greater. The lake of Titicaca receives
                    numerous streams at its northern extremity, but by no means so great a mass of
                    water as might be expected from the height of the Andes that surround it.” The
                    principal streams which supply the lake are those which on its northern side
                    form the rivers of Asangaro, descending from the cordillera of Crucero and San
                    Juan del Oro, and that of Lagunillas, which rises in a chain of small lakes in
                    the western cordillera. The latter is probably the stream which Dr Meyen calls
                    the Rio Jussecano, which, he says, is one of the largest rivers falling into the
                    lake of Titicaca. One of its sources is in an alpine sheet of water called
                    Laguna Compuerta; and not far from it is another lake called La-gunilla, to
                    which Rivero assigns an elevation of more than 15,000 feet above the level of
                    the Pacific. The only outlet of the lake of Titicaca is the river Desaguadero,
                    which issues from its south-western extremity in lat. 16. 38. 10. and is an
                    inconsiderable stream when compared to the immense extent of the lake from which
                    it proceeds. This anomaly, however, may easily be explained by the great amount
                    of spontaneous evaporation to which its surface is exposed, in an extremely dry
                    and rarefied atmosphere, owing to its excessive elevation. Mr Pentland found the
                    width of the river Desaguadero, in the beginning of the rainy season, and close
                    to its origin in the lake, to be forty-six yards; its course was scarcely two
                    miles an hour, but its depth was considerable. The lake of Titicaca is studded
                    with small steep islands. It derived its name of Titicaca from one of the
                    largest of these, which is situated at the south-eastern extremity. It was held
                    in great veneration by the natives, as they believed it to be the spot where
                    Manco Capac received his divine commission to civilize the inhabitants of the
                    country. Numerous Peruvian ruins are still to be seen upon it. “The low banks of
                    the lake,” says Dr Meyen, “are lined with rushes; and farther inwards its waters
                    are covered with <hi rend="italic">Myriophyllum chuquitense,</hi> a new species.
                    Rushes are here a plant of great utility, being employed by the natives for
                    almost as many uses as the bamboo in the East Indies. They supply the place of
                    wood, which is wanting throughout the whole valley of the Desaguadero. The huts
                    of the poor are made of rushes, as also mats for the floor, and bed-covers. The
                    boats with which the rivers and the lakes are navigated are also made of rushes
                    twisted together; the rudder and the mast alone are of wood, and form one of the
                    most valuable possessions of the poor natives. These boats are frequently made
                    with great taste and ingenuity. The smaller ones carry only three or four
                    persons. The larger venture to some distance from the banks of the lake, which,
                    even in calm weather, is subject to a heavy swell. The lake abounds in fish and
                    waterfowl.” Its waters are said to be “bitter” and impure, yet they are drunk by
                    the cattle, and even by the Indians. It appears that the extent of the lake has
                    diminished even within the historical period of this continent; for a Spanish
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193541995" xml:id="kp-eb0718-1995-0740"/>writer, soon
                    after the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, in describing the gigantic Peruvian
                    monuments of Tiaguanaco, says that the waters of the lake washed their walls.
                    These ruins are now elevated many feet above the level of the lake, and stand at
                    a considerable distance from it. The valley of the Desaguadero and the lake form
                    together one continuous and immense basin, which, by a calculation of •Mr
                    Pentland, occupies an area of above 16,000 geographical square miles. 'The
                    valley of the Desaguadero is necessarily in the direction of the two chains
                    which enclose both it and the lake. In its southern portion it runs nearly
                    parallel with the meridian; but north of latitude 17° it forms an angle of
                    almost 45° with that line, running very nearly north-west by north, and
                    south-east by south. It is entirely bounded by mountains, having no outlet
                    towards the sea; and the rivers which descend into it are either lost in the
                    sandy soil, or empty themselves into the lake of Titicaca at its northern
                    extremity.</p>
                <p>The city of Puno is situated upon the western shores of the lake of Titicaca, in
                    lat. 15. 50. S. and long. 70. 22. W. from Greenwich, at an elevation of 12,832
                    feet above the level of the sea. It was formerly a rich and beautiful place, but
                    has now very much declined in all respects. It possesses some woollen
                    manufactures, with which it supplies Lima and Arequipa; and it contains a
                    population of about 9000. The number of inhabitants in the department has been
                    estimated at 30,917.</p>
