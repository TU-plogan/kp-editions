                    rend="italic">Astronomy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> signifies in
                    general a perspective representation of the surface of the sphere on a plane;
                    and it is of various kinds according to the different positions of the eye and
                    the plane of projection.</p>
                <p>As the principles of the different projections commonly employed in the
                    construction of maps and charts, and the method of applying them, have already
                    been explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography,</hi> (chap, iv.,)
                    we shall merely give a general view of the subject in this place, referring the
                    reader to the article just cited,for thedetailsand demonstrations.</p>
                <p>The simplest of all the projections is the <hi rend="italic">Orthographic.</hi>
                    Considered as a perspective delineation of the surface of the sphere, this
                    supposes the eye to be placed at an infinite distance, so that all the rays
                    coming from the different parts of the surface are parallel; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">plane of projection,</hi> or plane upon which the representation
                    is made, is assumed to be perpendicular to the direction of the visual rays, and
                    to pass through the centre of the sphere. The orthographic projection of any
                    point is therefore the intersection of a perpendicular from that point with the
                    plane of projection. When the object is to represent only a small portion of the
                    surface of the sphere, situated near the <hi rend="italic">pole of
                    projection,</hi> or point in which the straight line from the eye to the centre
                    of the sphere intersects the surface, this projection answers every purpose; but
                    it is not so well adapted to the delineation of a whole hemisphere, or even a
                    considerable portion of it; for the distances from the pole being represented by
                    the sines of the arcs by which they are measured on the sphere, and as the sines
                    of large arcs increase in a much smaller ratio than the arcs themselves, the map
                    is necessarily crowded and distorted towards the extremities, and gives a very
                    imperfect representation of the objects delineated.</p>
                <p>The principal properties of the orthographic projection are, 1st, That all the
                    great circles of the sphere, the planes of which pass through the eye, are
                    represented by straight lines: 2d, That all circles, (they can only be small
                    circles) the planes of which are perpendicular to the line of sight, are
                    represented by circles: 3d. That all other circles, whether large or small,
                    being seen obliquely, are represented by ellipses. This method of projection was
                    known to the ancient astronomers, and employed by them in the construction of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Analemma,</hi> a sort of instrument for the graphical
                    solution of various problems of the sphere, on which Ptolemy wrote a treatise,
                    which has been preserved through the medium of an Arabic version, and of which a
                    Latin translation was published by Commandine at Rome in 1562. The orthographic
                    projection is conveniently used for various astronomical purposes, such as the
                    geometrical delineation of eclipses, transits, and occultations; and it has
                    numerous applications in the arts, the plans and sections by which artificers
                    execute their constructions, being merely orthographical projections of the
                    things to be constructed.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Stereographic</hi> projection the eye is supposed to be
                    situated at the surface of the sphere, and the plane of projection is the plane
                    of the great circle, at the pole of which the eye is placed. The hemisphere
                    which is projected, is that which is opposite to the eye, and consequently the
                    sphere must be supposed transparent, in order that the different points of its
                    surface may be visible. According to the testimony of two ancient authors,
                    Synesius and Proclus, this projection was invented by Hipparchus. It was called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Planisphere,</hi> on which also there is a treatise by
                    Ptolemy, preserved through the Arabic. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stereo-graphia</hi> (derived from στepeos∙, solid, because it results from the
                    intersection of two solids, the sphere and the cone) was, according to Delambre,
                    first applied to it by the Jesuit Aguilon in a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Optics,</hi> published at Antwerp in 1613. The astrolabe, an instrument formerly
                    much in use for the graphical solution of astronomical problems connected with
                    the diurnal motion, was constituted on this projection.</p>
                <p>The two principal properties of the stereographic projection are, 1st, That all
                    circles on the sphere which do not pass through the eye, whether great or small,
                    are projected into circles; and, 2d, That the circles of projection intersect
                    each other under the same angles as their corresponding circles on the sphere.
                    The first of these properties is of great importance, by reason of the facility
                    which it affords for the construction of maps. It is demonstrated in the
                    planisphere of Ptolemy for all the particular cases that occur in the
                    projections there described; and although the general proposition is not
                    formally mentioned, it can scarcely be supposed to have been unknown to him, as
                    his demonstrations are easily rendered applicable to every case. It is, indeed,
                    an almost obvious consequence of a property demonstrated by Apollonius relative
                    to the subcontrary sections of the oblique cone. The demonstration of Ptolemy
                    for the particular cases is, however, entirely independent of the theorem of
                    Apollonius. Delambre <hi rend="italic">(Astronomie Ancienne,</hi> tom. ii. p.
                    456) states, that the oldest work in which he has met with the enunciation of
                    the general property is the <hi rend="italic">Planisphere</hi> of Jordanus,
                    published with some other astronomical tracts, at Toulouse in 1544. It may be
                    remarked, that Jordanus, instead of projecting the hemisphere on the plane of
                    the equator, chooses for the plane of projection,. the plane touching the sphere
                    at the north pole. The property of the equality of angles, which is also very
                    curious and important, appears to be of modern discovert, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193540916" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0916-0657"/>but the author of it is not
                    certainly known. Delambre (Ms- <hi rend="italic">tronomie,</hi> tom. iii p. 674)
                    says, he has searched for it in vain in the large treatise of Clavius, in that
                    of Stoflerinus, and in Bion; and <hi rend="italic">(Histoire de P Astronomie au
                    Dix-Huitième Siècle,</hi> p. 88,) that the oldest demonstration of it known to
                    him is in <hi rend="italic">Leadbetteds Astronomy,</hi> London, 1728. It had,
                    however, been previously demonstrated by Dr. Halley in 1696, in No. 219 of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> in which he attributes the
                    first discovery of the proposition to Demoivre or Hook.</p>
                <p>As the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of one of its great
                    circles, it follows that in the stereographic projection on the plane of a great
                    circle, the surface of the hemisphere is reduced to one-half of its original
                    dimensions. This w ould be no defect, if the reduction were uniform; which,
                    however, is far from being the case; for at the centre, the linear dimensions
                    are reduced to one-half, and consequently the superficial to one-fourth; and the
                    reduction becomes less and less towards the extremities of the map. Any portion
                    of the upper hemisphere projected in this way would be enlarged. Hence there is
                    little resemblance between a given portion of the spherical surface and its
                    representation, which is the great defect of the projection. In maps of the
                    stars, for which it is most frequently employed, there is also an inconveniency
                    in the difficulty of finding the places of particular stars, for three or more
                    objects, which in the apparent heavens are situated in the same straight line,
                    are placed in the map on the circumference of a circle which is not represented.
                    Nevertheless, the projection answers conveniently enough all the purposes, for
                    which a map is required by the astronomer.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Gnomonic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Central</hi>
                    projection, the eye is supposed to be placed at the centre of the sphere, and
                    the plane of projection is a plane touching the sphere at any point assumed at
                    pleasure. The point of contact is called the <hi rend="italic">principal
                    point</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the projection of all other points are at the
                    extremities of the tangents of the arcs intercepted between them and the
                    principal point, and the tangents make with each other angles equal to those in
                    which their arcs intersect at the pole. This projection is also described by
                    Ptolemy in the <hi rend="italic">Analemma,</hi> (Delambre, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ancienne,</hi> tom. ii. p. 486); but as the Greeks
                    had no idea of the trigonometrical tangents, the polar distances arc in that
                    work expressed by the ratios of the sines to the cosines of the arcs. As the
                    tangents of arcs exceeding 45° increase very rapidly, and become infinite for
                    arcs of 90°, the projection cannot be employed for a whole hemisphere. The
                    celestial maps published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,
                    are projected in this manner, and the surface embraced is one-sixth of the whole
                    sphere, or the sphere is projected on the six sides of its circumscribing cube.
                    For a map of the stars this projection possesses some advantage over the
                    stereographic. All stars which appear in the same straight line in the heavens,
                    are projected in the same straight line, so that their places can be readily
                    found on the map; and from the position of the eye at the centre of the sphere,
                    the appearance of the heavens is better preserved. The map is necessarily
                    distorted in some degree near the extremities and corners, but not to so great
                    an extent as to render it a bad representation. Besides, the distortion is equal
                    for lines equally distant from the centre, and there is no angular distortion
                    with respect to lines which pass through the centre of the map. This projection
                    is particularly applicable to the construction of sun-dials and gnomons, whence
                    its name.</p>
                <p>The three kinds of projection now described, are chiefly employed in the
                    construction of celestial maps; but for the purpose of representing portions of
                    the earth’s surface, the <hi rend="italic">Globular projection</hi> is
                    frequently had recourse to. This may be considered as a modification of the
                    stereographic, or in a manner intermediate between the stereographic and
                    orthographic. In the orthographic, the proportion of the parts of the projection
                    to the parts on the sphere which they represent, decreases from the centre to
                    the circumference of the projection; in the stereographic the projection
                    increases; and as in the first case the eye is supposed at an infinite distance,
                    and in the second, on the surface of the sphere, there must be some position at
                    a finite distance from the surface, in which if the eye is placed, the
                    proportion between the parts of the surface of the sphere and their
                    representations, will be the same or nearly so, whether those parts be taken at
                    the centre or circumference of the map. It is easy to shew that the height above
                    the sphere at which this takes place is equal to the sine of 45 degrees, and
                    therefore very nearly 71-hundredths of the radius. This projection was first
                    proposed by La Hire, in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the Academy of
                    Sciences of Paris for 1701. It is employed in many cases, on account of the
                    small change of configuration; but by the removal of the eye from the surface
                    the characteristic advantages of the stereographic projection arc lost.</p>
                <p>Projections of the circles of the sphere on a plane, are easily found by the
                    methods of the descriptive Geometry, by spherical Trigonometry, or common
                    Algebra. Whatever be the situation of the eye, every circle on the sphere,
                    unless its plane pass through the eye, forms the base of a cone, of which the
                    eye is the apex; and the intersection of this cone with the plane of projection,
                    gives the curve into which the circle is projected. Hence the curve is
                    necessarily a conic section and its equation cannot exceed the second degree. On
                    forming the general equation of the curve, and assigning a determinate position
                    to the eye and the plane of projection, all the properties of the different
                    kinds of projection, which are merely particular cases of the same general
                    problem, are readily deduced.</p>
                <p>Although it is convenient to employ the principles of perspective in representing
                    the lines and circles of the sphere on a plane surface, there is nothing in the
                    nature of the thing itself, (unless the map is to be regarded as a picture)
                    which renders such a mode of proceeding necessary. The meridians and parallels
                    may be represented on the map by any lines whatever, and the map will still be
                    accurate, if the different points are laid down so as to have respectively the
                    same relative positions with respect to those lines as the points represented
                    have to the corresponding circles of latitude and longitude; for in thjs case,
                    any point on the map can be referred to its proper place on the sphere, which is
                    the essential condition of a correct map. In order, however, to render the
                    problem determinate, the lines chosen to represent the meridians and parallels
                    of the sphere must be such as satisfy certain conditions capable of being
                    expressed by an algebraic equation. But these conditions may have no reference
                    to perspective. Mercator’s Chart is an example. In this chart the condition
                    which determines the relative situations of the meridians and parallels is, that
                    the rhumbs shall be straight lines, and make with each other the same angles as
                    on the sphere. This condition determines the well known property of the chart,
                    namely, that the degrees of longitude are all equal, while the degrees of
                    latitude vary in the inverse ratio of the sines of their polar distances.</p>
                <p>The theory of the construction of maps on this general principle, was first
                    considered by Lambert, who, in the third volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beitrage zum Gebrauche der Mathematik,</hi> &amp;c., published at Berlin in
                    1772, undertook the solution of the problem to determine the nature and
                    situation of the lines on the map representing the meridians and parallels,
                    where the condition to be fulfilled is, that the angles formed by lines on the
                    map shall be equal to the corresponding angles on the sphere. This condition is
                    important; for it follows from the equality of the angles that any indefinitely
                    small portion of the surface of the sphere, and its projection<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193540929" xml:id="kp-eb0718-0929-0658"/> on the map, are similar
                    figures; and consequently that the representations of such parts differ from the
                    original only in respect of magnitude. The same problem was considered by Euler
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Petersburg Commentaries</hi> for 1777, but neither of
                    these illustrious geometers prosecuted the subject farther than to shew that the
                    known properties of the stereographic projection, and Mercator’s Chart, are
                    comprehended in their general solution.</p>
                <p>In the volume of the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs</hi> for 1779, there are
                    two memoirs by Lagrange on the same subject. In the first he gave a solution of
                    the problem of Lambert, of which he shewed the stereographic projection to be
                    only a particular case; and in the second, he undertook the more difficult task
                    of determining the form which the arbitrary functions that enter into the
                    general solution must have in order that the lines representing the meridians

                <p>The general problem of projection has been more recently considered by the
                    celebrated Professor Gauss of Göttingen, in a memoir written in answer to a
                    prize question proposed by the Academy of Sciences of Copenhagen. In this memoir
                    the author, instead of confining himself to the particular case of the
                    representation of a spherical surface on a plane, undertook the solution of the
                    general problem; namely, to represent the parts of any given surface on any
                    other given surface, subject to the condition that the differential elements of
                    the first surface shall be similar to their representations on the second.
                    Having determined the differential expressions of the co-ordinates of any point
                    on the map, in terms of the co-ordinates of the corresponding point of the
                    primitive surface, he applies the general solution to the particular cases of a
                    plane surface projected on another plane, the surface of a cone on a plane, of a
                    sphere and spheroid on a plane, and lastly, of an ellipsoid of revolution on the
                    surface of a sphere. Gauss’s memoir is published in No. 3 of Schumacher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Abhandlungen,</hi> and a translation of it in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> for August and September 1828.
                    Considered in this general view, the theory of projection becomes an interesting
                    and very difficult mathematical speculation; but it is one of which, it must be
                    confessed, the results are of no great practical use.</p>
