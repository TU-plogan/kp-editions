                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Until</hi> a very few years since, the greater number of
                    natural philosophers, and almost all mathematical opticians, were agreed in
                    considering the rays of light as composed of extremely minute molecules, darted,
                    in every possible direction, by a luminous body, with very great velocities. The
                    form of these molecules remained undetermined; but as it was inferred from some
                    observations, made long ago, that certain rays had not the same properties in
                    every part of their circumference, it was natural to compare them to little
                    magnets, and to suppose them possessed of poles. Hence the appellation of a <hi
                    rend="italic">polarised ray</hi> was applied to every ray of light so modified
                    as to exhibit the polar properties of its molecules. We shall begin this article
                    by describing the different methods that have been discovered for obtaining
                    polarised rays.</p>

                <p>Supposing a pencil of <hi rend="italic">natural light,</hi> that is to say, of
                    light coming directly from a luminous body, without having undergone any change
                    by refraction or by reflection, to fall upon a crystal of carbonate of lime,
                    perpendicularly to one of its surfaces, either natural or artificial: This
                    pencil will in general undergo a bifurcation as it enters the crystal; one half
                    of the incident light continuing its course in a right line, according to the
                    ordinary laws of refraction, and the other exhibiting a very remarkable
                    phenomenon, and assuming an oblique direction, notwithstanding its original
                    perpendicularity. The former half is called the <hi rend="italic">ordinary
                    pencil</hi> or ray, the latter the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary pencil</hi>
                    or ray. The plane passing through these two pencils must obviously be
                    perpendicular to the surface of the crystal: this plane is of great importance
                    in the phenomena of polarisation, and it is denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principal section of</hi> the crystal.</p>
                <p>According to this definition, it appears that every ray of light, at each point
                    of incidence on a given crystal, will have a principal section corresponding to
                    it; and we have only to observe, that all these sections will be parallel to
                    each other. In a rhomboid of Iceland spar, the principal section cuts the
                    natural faces of the crystal in a line parallel to the diagonal joining the
                    obtuse angles of the parallelogram, and dividing it into two equal parts.</p>
                <p>Now, the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi>
                    rays both <hi rend="italic">acquire</hi> within the crystal <hi rend="italic"
                    >new properties,</hi> not inherent in the direct light. In order to show this,
                    it will be sufficient to remark what happens to these rays when they fall on a
                    second crystal which has the properties of double refraction; and, first, with
                    respect to the ordinary ray, which has preserved its rectilinear direction
                    without deviation.</p>
                <p>If the principal section of the second crystal <hi rend="italic">is parallel</hi>
                    to the principal section of the first, the ray will undergo no double refraction
                    in the second, but will continue its course without any subdivision. But if the
                    principal sections of the two crystals are perpendicular to each other, the ray
                    which was <hi rend="italic">ordinarily</hi> refracted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> crystal, will become an <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray in
                    the <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> and will be refracted obliquely when its
                    incidence is perpendicular. But when the principal sections are neither
                    perpendicular nor parallel to each other, this same ordinary ray will be
                    subdivided in the second crystal, but its portions will be of different
                    intensities, excepting when the sections form an angle of 45° with each
                    other.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary pencil exhibits phenomena of a similar nature. It remains an
                    extraordinary pencil in every crystal of which the principal section is parallel
                    to that of the crystal which has transmitted it, and becomes an ordinary pencil
                    when the principal sections are at right angles to each other. It is subdivided
                    into two pencils of equal intensity if the two sections make an angle of 45°
                    with each other, and, in every other position, into two pencils of unequal
                    intensities.</p>
                <p>It is extremely easy to verify these propositions by experiment. We place on a
                    horizontal table a piece of black paper, and draw two very fine lines at right
                    angles to each other, with a white spot of a certain magnitude at their
                    intersection; and we lay on the paper a rhomboid of calcareous spar, and with
                    our eye immediately above the spot we see two images of it, situated in a line
                    parallel to the shorter diagonal of the upper face of the rhomboid. One of these
                    images is seen in the true place of the spot, as is easily ascertained by two
                    lines which cross in it, and of which the portions not covered by the crystal
                    point at it; these rays have therefore undergone no deviation, and have been
                    ordinarily refracted. The other rays have been bent, since they do not pass
                    through the true place of the spot, and therefore afford the extraordinary
                    image.</p>
                <p>We now place a second crystal on the first, in such a manner that the shorter
                    diagonals of the faces in contact may be parallel; and we still find only two
                    images of the white spot, but they are more remote from each other. The one
                    retains its natural situation; whence it follows, that the rays which afford it
                    are no more deflected from their course in the second crystal than they are in
                    the first, and that they have always remained ordinary rays. With regard to the
                    second image, since it is more remote from the true place of the object than
                    when seen through the first crystal only, it is obvious that the rays, which
                    have already been extraordinarily refracted in the lower rhomboid, have
                    undergoné the same kind of refraction in passing through the upper.</p>
                <p>If we only turn the upper rhomboid round the vertical line, so as to remove its
                    principal section from its parallel position, each of the two images will be
                    subdivided into two others. The new images will at first be very weak; but their
                    intensity will augment by degrees at the expense of the original images, in
                    proportion as the angle formed by the two sections becomes greater; and at last,
                    when it is a right angle, the two primitive images will have disappeared, and
                    the new images alone will remain. One of them will be at a distance from the
                    true place of the spot, in the direction of the shorter diagonal of the upper
                    rhomboid, about equal to the result of the double refraction of the second
                    crystal if it were separate from the first. This image is therefore formed by
                    rays which have been refracted ordinarily in the first crystal, and
                    extraordinarily in the second. And it will be equally manifest that the other
                    image is derived, on the contrary, from rays refracted at first extraordinarily,
                    and then ordinarily, in the respective crystals.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> p. 461, 462 <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>As it is difficult to procure very thick rhomboids of carbonate of lime that are
                    quite transparent, the same experiments may be performed by means of two prisms,
                    cut out <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535261" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5261-0226"/>of
                    doubly refracting crystals, and rendered achromatic by combining them with
                    prisms of common glass placed with their bases in opposite directions. Through
                    two such achromatic prisms placed on each other, the image of a candle appears
                    quadruple or double, according to the relative positions of the principal
                    sections. We thus see very distinctly that the images which disappear are not
                    confounded with the other two, but that they become fainter gradually, whilst
                    the others increase in intensity by the same degrees.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, first, that the direct light is <hi rend="italic">always
                    divided</hi> into two pencils in its passage through the natural faces of a
                    crystal of carbonate of lime; and, on the contrary, toat the light of which
                    either of the two pencils is composed. when submitted to the action of such a
                    crystal, in <hi rend="italic">some particular positions</hi> of the principal
                    section, <hi rend="italic">is not divided,</hi> and gives but a single
                    pencil.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the two images furnished by the direct light have always an <hi
                    rend="italic">-equal degree</hi> of brightness; but the light of the ordinary or
                    extraordinary pencils, when it undergoes a further double refraction, gives
                    almost always images of unequal intensities.</p>
                <p>Hence it follows, that in the act of double refraction this last light has
                    received some new properties, by which it may always be distinguished from
                    natural light. But are these properties necessarily of such a nature as to be
                    inexplicable without supposing the elementary molecules of the rays to possess
                    certain poles? This is a question which we are now to examine.</p>
                <p>We will suppose that a rhomboid of carbonate of lime is placed horizontally; that
                    the incident light falls perpendicularly on its upper surface, and that the
                    principal section, which will be vertical, is in the plane of the meridian, or
                    that it runs north and south; observing, however, that these directions are only
                    chosen to facilitate our comprehension of the facts.</p>
                <p>The ordinary pencil afforded by this crystal when it is submitted to the action
                    of a new rhomboid similarly placed, that is to say, having also its principal
                    section in the plane of the meridian, passes through it, as we have seen,
                    without lateral refraction, and continues its course in a right line, remaining
                    as an ordinary ray.</p>
                <p>But when the principal section of the second crystal, being still vertical, is
                    directed from east to west, the ordinary ray, transmitted by the first crystal,
                    will be refracted laterally in it, although it falls perpendicularly on the
                    surface, and will become an extraordinary ray.</p>
                <p>In the first case, the principal section of the second rhomboid intersected the
                    ray, or the luminous molecules supposed to compose it, from north to south; in
                    the second, these molecules were intersected from east to west. It may be
                    remarked, that this is the only circumstance in which the cases differ from each
                    other, the ray falling in both cases on the same point of the crystal, and in
                    the same angular direction. It must therefore be concluded, that in the ray of
                    light, or in the elements of which it is formed, the north and south sides must
                    have different properties from those of the east and west.</p>
                <p>When we analyse the extraordinary pencil with the second crystal, if the
                    principal section intersects this pencil from north to south, it undergoes the
                    extraordinary refraction, but it follows the ordinary course when this same
                    plane intersects it from east to west, which is exactly the contrary of what
                    occurs with the ordinary pencil. The north and south sides of this pencil have
                    therefore the properties of the east and west sides of the extraordinary pencil,
                    and the reverse; nor is there any other difference between the pencils; the
                    sides possessed of similar properties are only differently directed, so that if
                    we could cause an extraordinary ray transmitted by any crystal to make a quarter
                    of a revolution on itself, it would be impossible to distinguish it from the
                    ordinary ray that has been separated from it.</p>
                <p>When natural philosophers say of a loadstone or a magnet that it has poles, they
                    merely understand by this expression that certain points about the circumference
                    of the magnet possess properties which do not belong, either at all, or in the
                    same degree, to the other parts of the circumference. It was then equally
                    correct to say of the ordinary and extraordinary rays derived from the
                    subdivision of natural light in the crystals of carbonate of lime, that they had
                    <hi rend="italic">poles,</hi> or were <hi rend="italic">polarised.</hi> It is
                    only necessary to remark, in order to avoid extending the analogy between the
                    rays of light and the magnet beyond its proper bounds, that for every element of
                    the ray, the sides or poles diametrically opposite to each other, that is, in
                    the position here supposed for illustration, the north and south poles of the
                    ordinary ray, appear both to possess exactly the same properties; and it is at
                    the angular distance of 90° from these points, that is, on a perpendicular to
                    the line that joins them, that we find in the same ray poles possessed of
                    different properties; and if we compare with each other the two pencils
                    transmitted by a given crystal, the poles possessed of the same properties will
                    be situated in directions perpendicular to each other.</p>
                <p>Let us once more consider the two rays transmitted by a crystal of which the
                    principal section is supposed to be in the plane of the meridian. There is no
                    reason whatever for assigning the denomination of poles to the north and south
                    sides of the ordinary ray rather than to the east and west; but as it is
                    necessary to make some distinction, it has been generally agreed to apply the
                    name of poles to the north and south sides. Hence it has been usual to say, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">ordinary ray</hi> is polarised in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plane of the principal section</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which is as much as
                    to say that the different elements of the ray have the faces, which we have
                    called poles, situated in that plane. The <hi rend="italic">extraordinary ray is
                    polarised perpendicularly to the principal sectian;</hi> its poles are situated
                    perpendicularly to that plane, since it becomes perfectly similar to the
                    ordinary ray when it is made to describe a fourth of a revolution round
                    itself.</p>
                <p>When we have arrived thus far, it becomes natural to ask whether we are to
                    suppose that the separation of the light within the crystal has <hi
                    rend="italic">given</hi> poles to the molecules, or that the poles, already <hi
                    rend="italic">pre-existing,</hi> have merely been turned towards the same points
                    of space. This question is a very difficult one; but we shall find hereafter, if
                    not a demonstration of the second hypothesis, at least some plausible reason for
                    adopting it. It will be here sufficient to remark, that the modification
                    undergone by the rays is entirely independent of the nature of the crystal,
                    provided that it only produce a double image; and that the phenomena presented
                    by two rhomboids of calcareous spar, placed on each other, would be reproduced,
                    with their minutest details, if we combined, for example, one of these rhomboids
                    with a crystal of carbonate of lead; or if the first crystal were of sulphur,
                    and the second of quartz or of sulphate of baryta.</p>
                <p>But it is not only in the phenomena of double refraction that the particular
                    properties of polarised rays are exhibited; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflection</hi> of these rays, at the surfaces of <hi rend="italic">transparent
                    bodies,</hi> affords also a method of <hi rend="italic">distinguishing</hi> them
                    from <hi rend="italic">common light.</hi></p>
                <p>When a pencil of natural light falls on a transparent mirror, with any
                    inclination whatever, it is divided into two parts; the one passes through the
                    substance of the mirror, the other is reflected. This latter portion is always
                    found in the plane passing through the primitive pencil, and the line
                    perpendicular to the surface, which is called the <hi rend="italic">plane of
                    reflection,</hi> and which must be carefully distinguished from the <hi
                    rend="italic">reflecting surface.</hi></p>
                <p>If we now place the principal section of a doubly-refracting crystal in a
                    vertical position, and throw a pencil of common light perpendicularly on its
                    surface, receiving the two emerging pencils on the horizontal surface of some
                    water; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535274" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5274-0227"/>and let
                    us suppose the ordinary pencil to make with the surface of the liquid an angle
                    of 37° 15' [the crystal being held in a position inclined to the horizon]; this
                    pencil will undergo a partial reflection like the direct light, while the
                    extraordinary peneil, when its angle of incidence is also 37° 15', will <hi
                    rend="italic">enter the liquid completely, without the reflection of any of its
                    molecules</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a character which constitutes a marked
                    distinction between this peneil and the natural light.</p>
                <p>All other circumstances of the experiment remaining die same, let us now cause
                    the crystal to make one fourth of a revolution round the incident pencil, so as
                    to bring the principal section into a position perpendicular to its first
                    situation; we shall then find that the ordinary pencil alone will be entirely
                    transmitted by the liquid; the other will undergo a partial reflection, exactly
                    equal to that which we had first observed in the ordinary ray; the experiment
                    affording a new proof, that the two rays only differ in the direction which is
                    assumed by their corresponding sides.</p>
                <p>We find also, that in all positions of the principal section, intermediate
                    between these two, the two pencils will both undergo a partial reflection so
                    much the stronger, for the ordinary pencil, as the principal section is the
                    nearer to a coincidence with the plane of reflection, and for the extraordinary
                    pencil, as these planes are more nearly perpendicular to each other.</p>
                <p>We shall finish this section with an account of the mathematical law which
                    appears to determine the comparative intensities of the ordinary and
                    extraordinary pencils into which polarised light is separated when it is
                    analysed with a doubly refracting crystal. Let <hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi

                    again confirmed by observation, since the extraordinary ray, coming from a
                    certain crystal, follows only the ordinary course in passing through another, of
                    which the principal section is perpendicular to that of the first. The same

                    verifying these formulas, as well as the former, by direct experiments at
                    intermediate angles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>SECT. II. OF REFLECTION, CONSIDERED AS A MODE OF POLARISING LIGHT.</p>
                <p>Refleetion, at the surface of a transparent body, affords, as we have seen, a <hi
                    rend="italic">criterion</hi> for the distinction of polarised from ordinary
                    rays: we must also add, that such a reflection is also capable of polarising
                    ordinary light.</p>
                <p>Throwing, for example, a peneil of natural rays on a ’ mirror of common glass in
                    a horizontal position, in such a manner that the inclination of the ray to the
                    surface may be about 35°; we shall find that a part of the pencil will pass
                    through the glass, the other part will be reflected, and the reflected portion
                    will be polarised in the same manner as the ordinary pencil transmitted by a
                    crystal of which the principal section eincides with the plane of
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>In fact, if we analyse the light thus partially reflected, by the assistance of a
                    crystal of which the principal section eincides with the plane of reflection, it
                    is not subdivided, and affords only a single ordinary image. Nor is it again
                    subdivided in passing through the crystal when the principal section is
                    perpendicular to the plane of reflection; but in this ease it only affords an
                    extraordinary image. In every other position we have both an extraordinary and
                    an ordinary image, the intensity of the latter being expressed by the formula,
                    <hi rend="italic">F</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi>; in which <hi rend="italic">F</hi> is the total intensity of the peneil
                    subjected to the experiment, and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> the angle formed by
                    the principal section of the crystal with the plane of reflection. This formula
                    obviously coincides with that which we have given for the ordinary pencil in the
                    case of two crystals combined. The plane of reflection here performs the office
                    of the principal section of the first crystal; it is therefore in this plane
                    that the ray has become polarised by the reflection.</p>
                <p>Before we assert, however, that there is an identity in the species of
                    polarisation effected by partial reflection with given inclinations, at the
                    surface of a transparent body, and that which results from double refraction, we
                    must submit the ray polarised by a first reflection to the test of new
                    reflections.</p>
                <p>These second reflections will obviously throw the light downwards if the mirror
                    is above the ray, or upwards if below; from right to left if the mirror receives
                    thp ray on its [left-hand] surface, and the reverse if on the [right]
                    surface.</p>
                <p>Now, if the second mirror is above or below the ray, so that the new plane of
                    reflection coincides with the old, there is a partial reflection at all
                    incidences. But when, on the contrary, this mirror is presented to the ray on
                    the left or the right side, and in suelι a manner that the new plane of
                    reflection may be perpendicular to the old one, all reflection ceases at the
                    inclination of about 35°, already mentioned. In the intermediate positions of
                    the mirror, and with the constant inclination of 35°, the intensity of the
                    reflection varies in proportion to the square of the cosine of the angle formed
                    by the two planes of reflection with each other.</p>
                <p>The least attention will show how much analogy this experiment has with those
                    which have been made with a rhomboidal crystal. In those experiments, in order
                    to see if the ordinary ray had the same properties with respect to each point of
                    its circumference, we caused the crystal to revolve round the ray as an axis, so
                    as to bring in succession its principal section, and consequently the poles
                    contained in it, into a vertical direction, from right to left, and so forth; in
                    these different positions we threw the ray on a transparent substance. Here we
                    left the first plane of reflection immoveable, and the second turned round the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535287" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5287-0228"/>ray, which was
                    thrown on its different sides. This trial is evidently similar to the former,
                    and the result is identical.</p>
                <p>We may therefore now affirm, that the ray which is reflected at the upper surface
                    of the glass, with an inclination of about 35°, possesses in all respects the
                    same properties as a ray transmitted by a crystal of which the principal section
                    coincides with the plane of reflection.</p>
                <p>We have supposed the substance employed in this experiment to be transparent; but
                    we must add, that some opaque bodies, such as black marble, ebony, and some
                    varnishes, possess in an equal degree the property of polarising rays which are
                    reflected at their surface. These substances, when made to revolve round a
                    polarised ray, exhibit the same effect, with regard to the reflected light, as
                    the transparent substances which have been considered.</p>

                <p>Rays partially polarised are those which possess properties that may be called
                    intermediate between the properties of ordinary light and of light completely
                    polarised. They are distinguished from polarised light by affording always two
                    pencils in their passage through a crystal possessed of the property of double
                    refraction; they differ from natural light in not affording always two pencils
                    of the same intensity, in all positions of the principal section of the same
                    crystal.</p>
                <p>It may be asked, if a ray partially polarised may not be considered as consisting
                    of a portion <hi rend="italic">A</hi> of polarised and a portion <hi
                    rend="italic">B</hi> of natural light. This latter portion would <hi
                    rend="italic">al-ways</hi> be equally divided into an ordinary and an
                    extraordinary pencil, in its passage through a crystal possessing the properties
                    of double refraction; the other would pass <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi>
                    entirely as an ordinary or an extraordinary pencil. In a certain position of the
                    principal section, therefore, the comparative intensities of the two pencils
                    would be ½Z? + <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">½jB</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi> and, after one fourth of a revolution, .they would
                    become ½Z? and <hi rend="italic">⅛B + A</hi> respectively. In all other
                    positions, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> would be divided between the two images; the
                    portion belonging to the ordinary image being expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">i,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> being the angle contained by the plane of polarisation of
                    <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and the principal section of the crystal; and when <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> = 45°, the two images would be of equal intensity.</p>
                <p>All these consequences of the hypothesis that we have assumed are conformable to
                    experiment; and we may therefore suppose that a ray partially polarised is
                    composed of two separate portions, the one, <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> in its
                    natural state, the other, <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> totally polarised. (Sir
                    David Brewster’s experiments on partial polarisation will be mentioned
                    hereafter.)</p>
                <p>In every pencil reflected perpendicularly by a transparent substance, the portion
                    <hi rend="italic">A</hi> vanishes: it acquires greater and greater values in
                    proportion as the angle of incidence increases; but at the angular situation of
                    complete polarisation <hi rend="italic">B</hi> vanishes, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> comprehends the whole pencil. Still farther from the perpendicular, we
                    find again in the pencil natural light <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> and polarised
                    light <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lastly, when the incident and reflected light
                    sweeps, as it were, the surface of the mirror, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is again
                    very inconsiderable with respect to <hi rend="italic">B.</hi></p>
                <p>Metallic mirrors do not completely polarise the rays that they reflect at any
                    angle of incidence. As in the case of transparent substances, <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> is evanescent for perpendicular rays; but it becomes sensible in every
                    other case, and the light becomés partially polarised. The angle of
                    polarisa-</p>

                <p>tion of a metal is that which makes the quotient -∣∙ a maximum.</p>
                <p>There exist also some transparent bodies, such as the diamond and sulphur, which
                    never produce complete polarisation of the light that is reflected at their
                    surfaces; but, the quotient — acquires, at least, much greater values for their
                    substances than for the metals.</p>
                <p>. The mathematical law which connects the value of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> with
                    that of the angle of incidence, and of the refractive form of the mirror, has
                    not yet been discovered. It is only known, that at regular angular distances
                    above and below the angle of complete polarisation, the proportion of <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> to <hi rend="italic">A + B</hi> is nearly the same,
                    although the absolute value of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >B</hi> may have changed very considerably.</p>
                <p>Thus, in the case of the glass of St Gobin, for example, in which the complete
                    polarisation takes place when the inclination of the ray to the surface is about
                    35°, we find that the reflected pencils contain the <hi rend="italic">same
                    proportion</hi> of polarised light at the following angles :—</p>
                <p>65° 42' 63° 54 ’ 60° 18'</p>
                <p>and 7 12 7 55 11 40</p>
                <p>mean 36 27 35 55 35 59</p>
                <p>For water, the relation of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> to <hi rend="italic">A +
                    B</hi> is nearly the same at the angles 3° 29' and 73° 48'; the mean of these,
                    38° 36', exceeds by 1½° only the true inclination of complete polarisation,
                    though it is deduced from angles which differ from it more than 30°.</p>
                <p>In the same manner, therefore, as astronomers determine the instant of the
                    passage of a luminary over the meridian, by corresponding altitudes, observed
                    before and after that passage, we may obtain, with tolerable precision, the
                    angle of complete polarisation, by taking the half sum of the inclinations
                    corresponding to equivalent partial polarisations, especially if we take care
                    not to deviate too far from the angle required; and this method has its
                    advantages, when we make the experiment on bodies which do not polarise the rays
                    of light completely at any incidence.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV.—OF THE LAWS WHICH CONNECT THE REFRACTIVE DENSITIES OF BODIES WITH THE
                    ANGLES OF POLARISATION.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> pp. 4G3, 4G5.</p></note></p>
                <p>It is sufficient to look over the tables which have been published, of the angles
                    of complete polarisation for rays reflected by substances of various kinds, in
                    order to observe that these angles, reckoned from the perpendicular, approach so
                    much the more to right angles, as the refractive densities of the substances are
                    greater; but it was not so easy to detect the remarkable connection which exists
                    between these two elements, and which we shall now proceed to examine.</p>
                <p>When a ray of light, IO, passes from a vacuum into a certain medium, SS ʹ, it is
                    refracted at the point of incidence 0, approaches to the perpendicular PQ,and
                    follows, for example, the direction OR; the angles POI and QOR being for each
                    medium connected by the proportion sin.</p>
                <p> POI: sin. QOR = <hi rend="italic">ιη</hi>: 1, in which the quantity <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> is constant for all values of the angles. This quantity,
                    which is always greater than unity, has been called the <hi rend="italic">index
                    of refraction,</hi> appropriate to the medium. It is necessary to distinguish it
                    carefully from the refractive <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> a numerical
                    expression depending on <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and on the density, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193535300" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5300-0229"/> and chiefly
                    relating to the particular properties attributed to refractive substances in the
                    theory of emission.</p>
                <p>This being understood, if the angle of incidence be supposed such, that the
                    reflected ray OF may be completely polarised, it is found that <hi rend="italic"
                    >the tangent of the angle of incidence will be equal to the index of
                    refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>In the following table, the angles of polarisation, determined by experiment, are
                    compared with those which result from the general law; and the errors are not
                    greater than may be attributed to the unavoidable error of observation.<note

                    incident ray to the surface is equal to the angle of refraction</hi><hi

                    perpendicular to each other.</hi></p>
                <p>It is of consequence to examine some objections which have been made to the
                    accuracy of the law in question. If it were mathematically accurate, the rays of
                    different colours, it has been observed, would not be polarised exactly at the
                    same time, since they enter the refractive medium in different directions. Hence
                    it would follow, that in the usual mode of investigating this angle of complete
                    polarisation by analysing the reflected light with the assistance of a doubly
                    refractive crystal, we ought not, in any case, to lose sight of one of the
                    images; that when we arrived, for instance, at the angle which causes all the
                    red light of the mixed pencil to be polarised, and to pass into the ordinary
                    pencil, the observer ought to see an extraordinary image formed of the <hi
                    rend="italic">white wanting the red,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">green</hi>;
                    and the same for the other colours. Notwithstanding this, it has been added, in
                    the greater number of cases, the crystal being properly arranged, one of the
                    images is weakened by little and little, as we approach to the appropriate
                    inclination, and at last disappears entirely without presenting any visible
                    traces of colour.</p>
                <p>It may be answered, in the first place, that there actually are substances in
                    which this appearance of colour <hi rend="italic">is</hi> manifest; and which,
                    therefore, do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> polarise the rays of different kinds at
                    the same angle, but accord with the law of the tangent Among others may be
                    adduced the instance of specular iron ore, in which the phenomena is very
                    striking; and the oil of cassia, of which the great dispersive power renders it
                    also perfectly distinct. It may be added, too, that there is every reason to
                    hope, that more accurate observations made with homogeneous light from different
                    parts of the spectrum, and more precise measurements of the quantities of light
                    that escape polarisation at inclinations approaching to that of complete
                    polarisation, will hereafter remove the slight appearance of disagreement
                    between experiments and a law too nearly approaching to the whole mass of the
                    phenomena to be considered as otherwise than rigorously accurate.</p>
                <p>The table already inserted contains the names of several mediums, such as the
                    diamond and sulphur, which do not completely polarise light; the law of the
                    tangent <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> therefore applicable to such mediums as
                    these, provided that we understand, by the angle of polarisation, that in which
                    the reflected pencil contains the greatest proportion of polarised light. In
                    this case, the observation of this angle for metals would be the more important,
                    as their refractive density has not been hitherto determined.</p>
                <p>The angles of greatest polarisation, measured from the perpendicular, appear to
                    be, for mercury, 76 ½ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>; for steel, above 71°;
                    hence the index of refraction for mercury and for steel ought to be 4∙16 and
                    2∙85. [The oxide colouring the surface of heated steel has been found to give
                    about 2∙ l for its index, which agrees sufficiently well with this
                    experiment.]</p>
                <p>- We have hitherto only spoken of the polarisation which takes place at the first
                    surface of transparent surfaces entered by the light; the second surfaces
                    possess analogous properties with respect to light passing out of them.</p>
                <p>The angle measured from the perpendicular at which light is polarised when it is
                    on its passage from a vacuum into a refractive medium, is greater than that in
                    which the same phenomenon is observed when the light coming from the medium
                    tends to pass into the vacuum; it is also shown by experiment that the <hi
                    rend="italic">sine of the former angle is to the sine of the latter</hi> as the
                    index of refraction is to unity. We might express the same fact by saying, that
                    at the second surface, as well as at the first, <hi rend="italic">the ray
                    completely polarised</hi> by reflection is perpendicular to the refracted ray.
                    It follows, also, that if a medium is contained between two parallel surfaces,
                    and if we throw a pencil of rays on the first surface, in the angle which
                    affords complete polarisation, the transmitted portion of the pencil will also
                    fall on the second surface in the angle which again produces complete
                    polarisation.</p>
                <p>Thus, if MN, RS, be the parallel surfaces, OR the incident ray, <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> the index of refraction, and.</p>
                <p>Ο V the refracted ray; the angle of refraction VOP' will always be equal to the
                    angle OVZ, formed by the refracted ray with VZ, the perpendicular to the second
                    surface. Now, according to the assigned law, when POR is the angle of complete
                    polarisation for the first surface, sin. POR: sin. angle of polarisation at the
                    second surface = <hi rend="italic">n</hi>: 1, whence sin. POR = <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> sin. angle of polarisation at the second surface. But from
                    the law of the sines, as in the other cases, we have sin. POR: sin. VOP' = <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi>: 1, therefore sin. POR = <hi rend="italic">n</hi> sin. VOP
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535313" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5313-0230"/><hi
                    rend="italic">= n</hi> sin. ZV Ο; an equation which, combined with the former,
                    gives the angle of complete polarisation at the second surface = ZVO.</p>
                <p>Hence it follows, that if the incident ray, being previously polarised, is such
                    as to escape all partial reflection at its entrance into a substance terminated
                    by parallel surfaces, it will also escape reflection upon its passage out of the
                    substance.</p>
                <p>If ROP has the appropriate value, OF becomes completely polarised, and VK
                    likewise: the subsequent refraction in K makes no alteration in this ray; so
                    that when we wish to procure polarised light by reflection from a transparent
                    plate, there is no occasion to blacken the second surface of the plate;
                    supposing it parallel to the first, the polarisation will be equally complete,
                    and the reflected pencil will be brighter. It will only be proper to take care,
                    by placing at a distance from the plate a black substance, as a piece of velvet,
                    for example, to intercept the rays which might be transmitted by the plate from
                    other objects beyond it.</p>
                <p>The law from which these consequences have been deduced is only a particular case
                    of a more general law, which may be thus enunciated.</p>

                <p>It has been found by experiment, that the sine of the angle at which a certain
                    proportion of a natural pencil is reflected at the first surface of a

                    of the same pencil would be reflected at the second surface, if it arrived there
                    immediately, as the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction. This law of

                <p>We have now seen in what manner light is polarised, either in passing from a
                    vacuum into a given substance, or in returning out of the substance into the
                    vacuum. We must next examine the laws relating to the polarisation which occurs

                <p>Hence it follows that the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each

                    POLARISING LIGHT.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>It was believed for some time that the rays of light were only polarised by
                    transparent substances in the act of reflection, and that the refracted pencil
                    always retained the properties of ordinary light. But this opinion was
                    erroneous. It is true, that the simple transmission of light through one or even
                    two surfaces of any known substance is not sufficient for completely polarising
                    a pencil of light; but at certain obliquities it occasions at least a partial
                    polarisation; for, in examining the rays transmitted obliquely by a plate of
                    glass with parallel surfaces, by means of a crystal possessed of the property of
                    double refraction, it is found that the two images differ sensibly in
                    intensity.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">A!</hi> be the part of the transmitted pencil which is
                    polarised, <hi rend="italic">B'</hi> the portion of the same pencil not so
                    modified, and <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> the
                    analogous portions of the pencil reflected at the same incidence.</p>
                <p>We have already said that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is polarised as an ordinary
                    ray would be, transmitted by a crystal having its principal section coinciding
                    with the plane of reflection; the poles of <hi rend="italic">A!,</hi> on the
                    contrary, are placed like those of the extraordinary ray of the same crystal. If
                    we analyse with a rhomboid the light reflected by a plate of glass, we find, for
                    example, when in a certain position of the principal section, the image on the
                    right hand is the more brilliant; and the relative position of the plate, the
                    crystal, and the eye, remaining unaltered, it will be the opposite image, on the
                    left hand, that will become the most conspicuous when we examine the transmitted
                    light. All these results may be thus enumerated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The plane which contains the poles of the transmitted light is
                    perpendicular to that which contains the poles of the reflected light.</hi></p>
                <p>These different pencils are therefore polarised in directions at right angles to
                    each other.</p>
                <p>If we submit the reflected light <hi rend="italic">A + B</hi> to the action of a
                    crystal of carbonate of lime, of which the principal section coincides with the
                    plane of reflection, the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary pencil
                    will become <hi rend="italic">A + IB</hi> and <hi rend="italic">⅛B.</hi></p>
                <p>In the same position of the plate and of the crystal, the intensities of the same
                    images, furnished by the transmitted pencil, will be i <hi rend="italic">B'</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">A! +</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >B'.</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> will therefore be the quantity by which the
                    <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> image, furnished by the reflected pencil, <hi
                    rend="italic">surpasses</hi> the extraordinary image, while <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> ’ will express, for the transmitted pencil, the quantity by which the
                    <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> image will surpass the ordinary. With
                    respect to this phenomenon, a remarkable result of experiment may here be
                    noticed; that is, that in every possible inclination <hi rend="italic">A =
                    A</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or, in other
                    terms, that the intensities of the two images afforded by the crystal differ in
                    the same degree, whether we consider the reflected or the transmitted
                    pencil.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose that a plate of glass ED is placed in the position that the figure
                    represents, before a medium AB of a uniform tint, for instance a sheet of fine
                    white paper. The eye placed at 0 will receive simultaneously the ray IO,
                    reflected at I, and the ray BIO transmitted at the same point. Place at <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> an opaque diaphragm, blackened, and perforated by a small
                    hole at S. Lastly, let the eye be furnished with a doubly refracting crystal, C,
                    which affords two images of the aperture.</p>
                <p>If, now, by means of a little black screen placed between B and I, we stop the
                    ray BI, which would have been transmitted, the crystal, properly placed, will
                    give an ordinary image = <hi rend="italic">A + ½ B,</hi> and an extraordinary
                    image = ½ <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> But if the screen were placed between A and
                    I, and the ray Al were intercepted, we should still have two images of the hole,
                    and their intensities would be ½ <hi rend="italic">B</hi> ’ and √4' + ½P ’ <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193535326" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5326-0231"/>respectively.
                    Consequently, without any screen, if the whole of the reflected light AIO and
                    the transmitted BIO are allowed to arrive at the eye, we shall have for the
                    ordinary image, <hi rend="italic">A + ½ E + ½ B</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and for the extraordinary, ½7i+√l'
                    + ⅜ <hi rend="italic">B'.</hi></p>
                <p>Now it appears, from actually making the experiment, that the two images are
                    perfectly equal, whatever may be the angle formed by the ray Al with the plate
                    of glass, which can only be because A is always equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >A’.</hi> Consequently, <hi rend="italic">The quantity of polarised light
                    contained in the pencil transmitted by a transparent plate, is exactly equal to
                    the quantity of light polarised at right angles, which is found in the pencil
                    reflected by the same plate.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> p.
                    473.</p></note></p>
                <p>Hence it follows, that at the angle of complete polarisation by reflection, the
                    two images of the transmitted pencil given by a crystal properly placed, differ
                    in intensity by a quantity equal to the whole of the reflected pencil. So that
                    if ever a body should be discovered that could reflect half of the light
                    incident at this angle, the pencil transmitted, at the same inclination, would
                    also be completely polarised.</p>
                <p>In order to simplify this reasoning, we have supposed throughout that there was
                    only one efficient surface in the plate ED; it would be entering into too much
                    detail if we proceeded to demonstrate in what manner this supposition might be
                    justified; and it will be sufficient to remark, that the experiment in question
                    succeeds equally well when ED is a simple plate of glass with parallel surfaces,
                    which implies that the second surface polarises also equal quantities of light
                    by reflection and by refraction. But, lastly, in order to remove every doubt
                    respecting the accuracy of these results, it may be added, that when some
                    natural light, and some light that had passed through a rhomboid of carbonate of
                    lime, was thrown on a plate of glass reflecting at one of its surfaces, or at
                    both, it was found that the reflected light contained the same quantity of
                    polarised rays in both cases. Now the reflecting plate exercises no particular
                    action on the two equal pencils of light transmitted by the rhomboid, and
                    polarised in directions perpendicular to each other; it only divides them
                    unequally; and if the reflected pencil contains an excess of rays polarised in
                    one direction, there will be found in the transmitted pencil an excess precisely
                    equal, of rays polarised in the direction perpendicular to it. In this case, the
                    law here laid down must necessarily be true; and in order to extend it to
                    natural light, it is sufficient to have assured ourselves, as we have done, that
                    it is affected in the act of reflection and in that of refraction, precisely in
                    the same manner as the combination of two equal pencils polarised at right
                    angles to each other.</p>
                <p>One of the best modes of verifying the accuracy of physical laws is, to inquire
                    what their results are in extreme cases. The law now in question, supposing it
                    universally true, leads us, for example, to this conclusion, that where there is
                    no transmission of light, there can be no polarisation; and, in fact, if we
                    cause a pencil of light to fall on the interior surface of a prism, at an
                    inclination which produces complete reflection, we shall find no trace of
                    polarisation in the reflected pencil, although, at incidences but little
                    different, a considerable part of the light, and even the whole, may have been
                    polarised.</p>
                <p>Let us represent by <hi rend="italic">A</hi> the part of the pencil <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> which is polarised by reflection, at the angle of 35° from
                    the two surfaces of a plate of glass; the pencil transmitted will be 7— <hi
                    rend="italic">Aι</hi> now in this quantity of light there will be, according to
                    the law laid down, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> rays of which the plane of
                    polarisation is perpendicular to that of the reflected rays, so that the
                    quantity of natural light remaining will be <hi rend="italic">I 2 A,</hi> which
                    we may call = <hi rend="italic">I'.</hi> Then the pencil <hi rend="italic"
                    >I'</hi><hi rend="italic">+ A</hi> falling on a second plate, parallel to the
                    first, and consequently at the same angle as before, <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
                    will entirely escape the partial reflection, and, abating what may be lost by
                    absorption, will be found entire in the pencil transmitted by the second plate;
                    <hi rend="italic">I'</hi> will be divided in the same manner as <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> was at first; a portion <hi rend="italic">A'</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">1'</hi> is polarised by reflection, the remaining portion <hi
                    rend="italic">F— A!</hi> is transmitted, and will contain <hi rend="italic"
                    >A'</hi> of polarised rays, so that the natural light, after passing through the
                    second plate, will be reduced to <hi rend="italic">I’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">2A</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">A + A</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Making <hi rend="italic"
                    >I'</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">2A'-P,</hi> the light <hi
                    rend="italic">I" + A + A"</hi> will furnish, in its passage through a third
                    plate, parallel to the two former, a new quantity <hi rend="italic">A"</hi> of
                    light polarised by refraction, which will be added to <hi rend="italic">A +
                    A’,</hi> and so forth.</p>
                <p>The pencils, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi><hi rend="italic">P,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >P,</hi> and so forth, consisting of natural light, are polarised in equal <hi
                    rend="italic">proportions</hi> by the respective <hi rend="italic">A A</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">A"</hi> plates: the quotients —, —, j-, will constantly have
                    the same value. If, for instance, ⅜th part of the pencil <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> is polarised by reflection at the surfaces of the first plate, ½th of
                    <hi rend="italic">I'</hi> will be polarised at the surfaces of the second, ½th
                    of <hi rend="italic">I"</hi> by the third, and so forth; and the pencils
                    transmitted by these same plates will contain respectively of natural light, or
                    of light possessing the same properties, ½ths of Z, ½ths of 7', f ths of <hi
                    rend="italic">I'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> and so forth. Hence, whatever may be the number of plates employed, the
                    pencil ultimately transmitted will contain, mathematically speaking, a certain
                    quantity of natural light; but this quantity will be rapidly diminished, and
                    will finally become completely insensible. [Sir David Brewster, on the contrary,
                    maintains that it wholly disappears after transmission through a finite, and
                    even a moderate number of plates.]</p>
                <p>It may be said, in this sense, that a pile of parallel plates polarises the light
                    which passes through them, in a direction perpendicular to the plane in which
                    the rays would be polarised by reflection at the same surfaces.</p>
                <p>We have here supposed the incident light to meet the plate of glass at the
                    inclination capable of polarising it completely by reflection; but the same
                    result is obtained whatever the inclination may be. It is only necessary that it
                    should be composed of a number of elements, so much the greater as the direction
                    of the rays is nearer to the perpendicular.</p>
                <p>With a given inclination, the number of plates necessary to produce by
                    transmission a polarisation nearly complete, depends also on their reflective
                    power: we have already observed, for example, that a single plate, capable of
                    reflecting half the incident light at the angle of polarisation, would of itself
                    be sufficient to constitute a pile.</p>
                <p>There are certain natural bodies, the agate, for example, which modify the
                    transmitted light precisely as a pile of plates would do. If we cut a plate of
                    agate sufficiently thick, in a direction perpendicular to that of its laminae,
                    the light which passes through it acquires a polarity'in the direction of the
                    plates. A similar property is observed in the tourmaline, and it is here the
                    more remarkable, as this mineral, when pure, exhibits no lamellar structure
                    whatever. If the two opposite faces of a prism of tourmaline are polished so as
                    to form it into a plate with parallel surfaces about ⅛-th of an inch in
                    thickness, the light transmitted by it, whatever its angle of incidence may be,
                    will be polarised in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the column.</p>
                <p>It will be proper to mention here the phenomena exhibited by piles of plates when
                    they are exposed to rays that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535339"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-5339-0232"/>have been previously polarised: supposing always
                    that the pile is formed of parallel plates of glass; and, besides, that the
                    angle of inclination to the first surface is about 35°, reckoning from the
                    surface itself.</p>
                <p>If the primitive plane of polarisation of the incident ray coincides with the
                    plane drawn through this ray and the perpendicular to the first plate at the
                    point of incidence, a part of this ray more considerable than if we employed
                    natural light will be reflected; at the point of incidence on the second plate,
                    the luminous pencil transmitted by the first will undergo reflection in the same
                    proportion as the former pencil; the same effect will take place in the third
                    plate, and so forth. The transmitted ray, however intense it may have been in
                    the first instance, will thus be gradually weakened in a geometrical
                    progression, and at last will become insensible; so that if we look at the pile
                    on the opposite end, it will appear to be an opaque body, perfectly impervious
                    to light.</p>
                <p>Everything else remaining in the same state, if we turn the pile round the ray as
                    an axis through an angle of 90°, the new plane of reflection will be
                    perpendicular to the former, and the plate will have reached the situation which
                    has been already mentioned, in which the reflective property wholly disappears,
                    and the whole of the light will pass through it. But the second plate, the
                    third, and all the following plates, which are parallel to the first, will be
                    found in the same circumstances possessing the same properties, and will not
                    reflect any of the incident light; so that, setting aside the effect of
                    absorption, the apparatus actually transmits light without weakening it.</p>
                <p>The pile of plates possesses, therefore, with respect to polarised light, the
                    singular property of being either completely opaque or perfectly transparent,
                    according to the side which it presents to the light, notwithstanding that the
                    inclination of the light to the first surface remains constantly 35°. In the
                    intermediate positions the quantity of transmitted light increases gradually as
                    we proceed from that in which nothing is transmitted, to the other extreme in
                    which the light is only weakened by absorption.</p>
                <p>Tourmalines and agates appear to be true piles of plates, so that they must
                    produce similar effects; and, in fact, a plate cut, for example, in a direction
                    parallel to the axis of a column of tourmaline, transmits rays which are
                    polarised in a plane perpendicular to the axis, and totally stops, on the other
                    hand, rays of which the primitive plane of polarisation is parallel to that
                    axis.</p>
                <p>When we place such a plate between the eye and a reflecting surface of water or
                    glass situated in the open air, and look at it with an inclination producing
                    complete polarisation, it appears either fully enlightened or quite dark, or in
                    intermediate states, according to the situation of the plate in its own plane. A
                    circumstance which adds to the singularity of this experiment is, that it
                    succeeds completely even when the incidence on the plate is perpendicular; while
                    for a pile properly so called, unless it be composed of an immense number of
                    plates, it is necessary that the distance of the ray from the perpendicular
                    should be very considerable.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the cause of these phenomena, it results evidently, from what has
                    been mentioned, that two plates of tourmaline placed so that their axes form a
                    right angle, must compose a system perfectly opaque with respect to light of all
                    kinds. If, for example, the incident light is in its natural state, it is
                    obvious that the portion transmitted will be polarised in the direction of the
                    axis of the plate, and that the second plate, situated in a perpendicular
                    direction, will consequently stop the whole of the light so polarised.</p>

                    type="authorial"><p>See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> p.
                    470.</p></note></p>
                <p>After having examined in what manner ordinary light is converted into polarised
                    light, we must now proceed to study the modifications which this latter
                    undergoes in its turn when it is subjected to reflection or refraction at
                    surfaces of different natures, and differently situated with respect to its
                    poles.</p>
                <p>When a polarised pencil falls on the surface of a well-polished mirror, in such a
                    manner that its plane of polarisation coincides with the plane of reflection, or
                    is perpendicular to it, the light regularly reflected at this surface is
                    completely polarised, like the incident pencil, in a direction parallel or
                    perpendicular to the plane of reflection; and this happens whatever the nature
                    of the mirror may be.</p>
                <p>But whenever the primitive plane of polarisation of the incident pencil is any
                    otherwise situated, it will be found that the reflected pencil is modified, and
                    the modification will depend on the nature of the mirror.</p>
                <p>When we employ for these experiments a mirror either transparent or opaque, which
                    is capable of <hi rend="italic">completely polarising natural light,</hi> the
                    rays previously polarised which fall on this surface will <hi rend="italic"
                    >again be completely polarised,</hi> after their reflection, but <hi
                    rend="italic">not in the plane of their primitive polarisation.</hi> This <hi
                    rend="italic">deviation</hi> of the plane of polarisation of a luminous pencil,
                    produced by its reflection at the first surface of a transparent mirror, depends
                    both on the angle of incidence and on the direction of the plane of reflection
                    with regard to the poles of the ray.</p>
                <p>For given inclination, the deviation is so much more considerable as the plane of
                    reflection makes with the plane of primitive polarisation an angle more nearly
                    approaching to 45°.</p>
                <p>Let us first suppose, in order to assist the imagination, that the reflecting
                    surface is horizontal; that the eye of the observer, and the rhomboid which is
                    to furnish the polarised pencil, remain constantly situated, the one to the
                    north, the other to the south of the point of reflection, so that the plane of
                    reflection may always coincide with the meridian; and that, lastly, the
                    principal section of the crystal, which contains in its plane the poles of the
                    ordinary pencil, makes an angle of 45° with the meridian.</p>
                <p>When this ordinary pencil falls perpendicularly on the mirror, it will be
                    reflected without any deviation of its plane of polarisation: so that this
                    plane, having at first formed, by the suppositions, an angle of 45° with the
                    meridian, the inclination to the meridian will remain the same after the
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>If we cause the direction of the incident light to vary more and more from the
                    perpendicular, we shall first remark that the plane of polarisation of the
                    reflected light approaches by degrees to the plane of reflection, and that it
                    coincides exactly with it when we have arrived at the angle of complete
                    polarisation; that afterwards the reflected ray is polarised in a plane which is
                    more remote from the plane of reflection in proportion as it forms a smaller
                    angle with the surface of the mirror; and that at last, when the ray is nearly
                    parallel to the surface, its plane of polarisation coincides with that of the
                    incident light, as it did when the incidence was perpendicular.</p>
                <p>Let us call the angle of incidence, reckoned from the perpendicular, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> the corresponding angle of refraction for the substance
                    concerned, <hi rend="italic">i'</hi>; the tangent of the angle formed by the
                    plane of polarisation of the reflected light with the plane of reflection will

                    a slight addition is sufficient to accommodate it to all other cases. If we make

                <p>It is easy to observe, that, in the most material cases, this formula correctly
                    corresponds with the experiments; but we are still in want of an experimental
                    demonstration of its truth for any very diversified combinations of the values
                    of <hi rend="italic">α</hi> and ι.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Such experiments will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> p. 465, 466; and in the same article the reader
                    will find a new formula, confirmed by numerous experiments, exhibiting the

                    >refraction.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The deviations of the planes of polarisation follow the same gradations when the
                    reflection takes place at the second surface of transparent mirrors, from the
                    position of perpendicular incidence to that of the beginning of total
                    reflection. But beyond that inclination the phenomenon acquires a character
                    totally different: we have then no longer a simple change of the direction of
                    the primitive poles of the ray; for unless the plane which contains the poles
                    either coincide with the plane of reflection or be perpendicular to it, the ray
                    will undergo a true depolarisation, so that however we place the rhomboid
                    through which we cause it to pass, we shall always observe that two images are
                    formed. The same happens also when the mirror is metallic. The particular and
                    very remarkable modifications which the light undergoes in these two cases will
                    shortly be mentioned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    article in the room and at the table on which he is now writing], that if, after
                    having cut in a thin plate of metal two very fine slits very near to each other,
                    we cause them to be enlightened by a pencil proceeding from the same radiating
                    point, we may observe behind the plate a formation of iridescent fringes,
                    derived from the action exerted by the rays scattered from the lefthand slit on
                    the rays scattered from the right-hand slit, in the points where these two
                    parcels of rays are intermixed.</p>
                <p>This experiment, when studied in· all its details, has led to the simple law,
                    which maybe thus enunciated: Two rays of homogeneous light, <hi rend="italic"
                    >proceeding from the same source,</hi> and arriving from a given point of space
                    by two different routes, a little unequal in length, co-operate with each other,
                    or are destroyed, and form, on a screen which receives them, either a bright or
                    a dark spot, according to the magnitude of the difference of their routes.</p>
                <p>The two rays always co-operate completely when they are united after passing
                    through a route of equal length. If the smallest difference of routes, which
                    will cause them again to co-operate, be called <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> they
                    will co-operate where-ever the distance is any member of the series <hi
                    rend="italic">2d, 3d,</hi> 4c?...;. and the intermediate values 0+∣√7, <hi
                    rend="italic">dA-⅛d,</hi> 2√+½t7..., will show the cases in which the two rays,
                    when combined, produce darkness. The magnitude of the quantity <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> varies with the species of light concerned, and with the nature of the
                    medium which transmits it.</p>
                <p>If two rays destroy each other after having passed through routes differing, for
                    example, by the quantity <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    they will also destroy each other after having passed through, either
                    perpendicularly, or with the same obliquity, two plates of <hi rend="italic">the
                    same nature, and of the same thickness.</hi></p>
                <p>A difference of thickness, or of refractive density, in the two plates
                    interposed, may produce the effect of an inequality in the routes described: the
                    difference will give rise, in certain cases, to a displacement only of the
                    fringes; but in others they will entirely disappear.</p>
                <p>These laws relate to the rays of light in their natural state; if we employ
                    polarised light, we obtain results which, independently of the numerous
                    applications of which they are susceptible, deserve for their singularity to
                    arrest our attention.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535365" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5365-0234"/>
                <p>Let us first suppose, that instead of enlightening <hi rend="italic">the two</hi>
                    slits of the plate of metal with natural rays, we employ polarised light, the
                    fringeswill be formed equally in both cases.</p>
                <p>If we then try the effect of the light polarised in one direction and transmitted
                    by one of the slits on the light polarised in a perpendicular direction, and
                    transmitted by the other; an arrangement which may be obtained by placing two
                    piles properly directed in the passage of the different rays; we shall find,
                    that when the directions are correctly perpendicular, there is no trace of
                    fringes behind the perforated plate.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked, that any material difference in the mediums through which
                    the two rays pass, is sufficient to annihilate the effects of interference which
                    would otherwise be observable. The experiment now mentioned would therefore be
                    wholly inconclusive, if we had not previously assured ourselves that the piles,
                    which are supposed to be of the same nature, are also exactly of the same
                    thickness. The best mode of ascertaining this is evidently to render the two
                    planes of polarisation parallel: if in this case we perceive fringes, and if,
                    after having turned one of the piles one fourth of a revolution round its axis
                    without changing their mutual inclination, we find that they disappear, we may
                    fairly conclude that this disappearance must be attributed to the direction of
                    the polarisation of the rays of light concerned.</p>
                <p>This experiment would be a very difficult one to make with success if the piles
                    had any considerable thickness; but they may be made very thin by means of
                    plates of mica, or of bits of glass blown in a lamp; and then, by dividing them
                    in the middle, we may obtain a pair of piles of thicknesses perfectly equal.
                    Besides, nothing prevents our varying gradually the inclination of one of the
                    piles, so as to compensate in this manner for the effect of a slight difference
                    of thickness, if it exists.</p>
                <p>But there is another mode of observation which is more convenient. We take a
                    crystal of tourmaline cut in a direction parallel to its axis, so as to form a
                    plate with parallel surfaces; we divide it into two parts, and apply the two
                    portions, one to the slit on the right hand of the plate, and the other to that
                    on the left. We then find that fringes are produced when the two axes of the
                    fragments are parallel, and that no traces of them are left when they are
                    perpendicular to each other; and that in changing the positions of the portions
                    of tourmaline from one of these relations to the other, the intensity of the
                    fringes gradually disappears.</p>
                <p>Supposing now the piles to remain fixed to the slits in perpendicular directions,
                    so that no fringe may be visible; and placing a third pile before the eye of the
                    observer, in a plane that forms an angle of 45° with the planes of incidence of
                    the two former; this last plane must reduce to a similar polarisation the rays
                    coming from the two slits, which before they met were polarised at right angles;
                    so that there seems to be no reason why the rays should not again interfere: and
                    yet whatever pains we take in the experiment, we shall discover no trace of
                    fringes. [Might there not, however, be fringes if the rays met behind the third
                    pile rather than before it? <hi rend="smallcaps">Tr.]</hi></p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to remark, that a tourmaline of any kind may be substituted for
                    the third pile, as the two former may be exchanged for the two halves of a piece
                    of tourmaline with parallel surfaces: the result will be precisely the same.</p>
                <p>Let us lastly suppose, in order to exhaust all possible combinations, that the
                    plate of metal is illuminated with polarised light, and that two piles or two
                    tourmalines are so placed as to transform the rays passing through the two slits
                    from rays polarised in the same direction, into rays polarised in directions at
                    right angles to each other; and that, before the interference of the rays, we
                    bring them back to a similar polarisation, either by the assistance of a third
                    pile, or by that of a tourmaline, as in the former experiment: the observer will
                    then find, and no doubt with great surprise, that the rays are again susceptible
                    of interference, or that in mixing together they produce a very visible group of
                    iridescent fringes.</p>
                <p>The series of experiments here related leads us to the following conclusions.</p>
                <p>1. Two pencils converted from natural light into light polarised in the same
                    direction, retain, after this modification, the property of interfering with
                    each other.</p>
                <p>2. Two pencils, which are made to pass directly from the state of natural light
                    to that of light polarised in two perpendicular directions, are no longer
                    capable of interference, either while they remain in this state, or after they
                    have been restored to a similar polarisation.</p>
                <p>3. Two pencils polarised in contrary directions do not interfere, whatever may
                    have been the modifications that they have undergone before they arrive at this
                    state from that of natural light; but when restored to a similar state of
                    polarisation, they become capable of interfering, provided that, in their
                    passage from the natural state to that of polarised light, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the first</hi> planes of polarisation of the two pencils were parallel.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears, that in these phenomena the mode of action of the rays does not
                    depend on <hi rend="italic">what they are</hi> only when they meet, but also <hi
                    rend="italic">on what they have previously been.</hi></p>
                <p>SECT. VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">of</hi> THE KIND OF POLARISATION WHICH IS
                    EXHIBITED IN THE APPEARANCE OF COLOURS, AND WHICH HAS THEREFORE BEEN CALLED
                    COLOURED POLARISATION.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> p. 476-501.</p></note></p>
                <p>We may first examine the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of the new modification of
                    light that is concerned in these appearances; and, secondly, the <hi
                    rend="italic">means</hi> of producing it.</p>
                <p>Supposing a ray of direct light to be polarised in any of the ways that have been
                    described, and then to pass through a plate of rock-crystal cut perpendicularly
                    to the edges of the hexaedral prism, about a quarter of an inch in thickness,
                    and having both its surfaces perpendicular to the ray: when it emerges from the
                    surface, it will no longer possess the properties of common polarised light; and
                    yet it will not have re-assumed the characters of direct light: for if we submit
                    it to the action of a rhomboid of carbonate of lime, instead of affording one
                    image only in a particular position with respect to the principal section of the
                    crystal, it will be <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> subdivided into two
                    pencils; so that it cannot be identical with common polarised light.</p>
                <p>Neither is it simply natural light; for a white pencil of natural light is always
                    divided, by a doubly refracting crystal, into two white pencils of equal
                    intensity. The white pencil which has passed through the plate of quartz, on the
                    contrary, gives always two images, but they are distinguished by the most vivid
                    colours. If the ordinary image is red, the extraordinary is green, and the
                    reverse: and the case is the same with regard to the other prismatic colours;
                    that of the ordinary pencil is complementary to the tint of the extraordinary
                    pencil, and they both vary according to the position of the principal section of
                    the rhomboid which causes the separation.</p>
                <p>The prismatic telescope of Μ. Rochon affords an apparatus perfectly adapted to
                    the performance of these experiments, and which requires to be mentioned, first,
                    because it exhibits the tints with great brilliancy; secondly, because <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193535378" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5378-0235"/> it gives us the
                    means of assuring ourselves that the images viewed lose nothing of their
                    distinctness by the interposition of the plate, and that its effect is not owing
                    to any irregular dissipation of the light concerned; and, thirdly, on account of
                    the facility with which it allows us to show that the tints are complementary to
                    each other.</p>
                <p>This instrument is nothing more than an ordinary telescope, furnished, between
                    the object-glass and the eye-glass, with a prism of rock-crystal or of carbonate
                    of lime rendered achromatic. This prism being moveable at pleasure along the
                    axis of the telescope, the observer is enabled to separate more or less, at his
                    pleasure, the two images of the object which he is viewing.</p>
                <p>Having, then, before the object-glass of this telescope the plate of quartz in
                    question, and adapting besides to the eyeglass a greenish dark glass of a
                    particular kind, which is much employed by astronomers because of its property
                    of absorbing a good deal of light, without sensibly colouring the transmitted
                    pencil; if we observe the sun directly with this instrument, we shall see two
                    images of the sun, both white, and of equal brightness, whence it follows that
                    the plate produces no particular effect on natural light; but if, on the
                    contrary, we look at the sun’s image as reflected by a plate of glass not
                    silvered, we shall perceive two more suns, each of them coloured; and whilst the
                    telescope performs half a revolution on its axis, they will both run through
                    nearly the whole series of the prismatic colours. Thus, the image that was red,
                    will become successively orange, yellow, greenish-yellow, bluish-green, and
                    violet: and at this period the telescope will have made half a turn; its
                    movement being continued, the violet image will become first red, then orange,
                    and so forth. The second image will always give us the complementary colour; for
                    if, instead of completely separating the images, we allow them to overlap each
                    other, the part common to both the discs will remain constantly white, while the
                    remaining lunular portions will exhibit the most vivid colours.</p>
                <p>The reflection of a transparent plate may also be employed for more directly
                    exhibiting the distinctive properties of the light transmitted by the plate of
                    quartz.</p>
                <p>If we cause a plate of glass to turn round a pencil of natural light forming with
                    its surface an angle of about 35t <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, the reflected
                    pencil will be directed in succession to all the points of the horizon, but it
                    will constantly preserve <hi rend="italic">the same intensity.</hi></p>
                <p>But if the incident pencil is polarised, we shall find, on the contrary, two
                    positions diametrically opposite to each other, in which the mirror will not
                    reflect <hi rend="italic">a single ray.</hi></p>
                <p>Making, now, a similar experiment with the light that has been transmitted by a
                    plate of rock-crystal, we shall see that it becomes coloured by reflection,
                    though it falls white on the plate, and that the nature of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >colour</hi> depends on <hi rend="italic">the side of the ray</hi> that is
                    presented to the reflecting surface. These reflected colours succeed each other
                    during the revolution of the plate, in the same order as in the prismatic
                    spectrum; and they are also observed in the transmitted light, being always
                    complementary to those of the light reflected at the same time.</p>
                <p>If the properties of polarised rays depend, as is supposed by the partisans of
                    the system of emission, on the particular arrangements assumed by the molecules
                    of which they are formed, it will be easy to describe the intimate composition
                    of the ordinary polarised ray, and that of the same ray after it has passed
                    through the plate of rock-crystal: in the former, the axes of all the molecules
                    of the different colours must be parallel; in the latter, the molecules of
                    different tints must have their poles turned towards different parts of
                    space.</p>
                <p>It now becomes necessary to examine according to what law the direction of these
                    poles is varied, both as they depend on the particular, tint of each molecule,
                    and on the greater or less thickness of the crystal that they have passed</p>
                <p>If we employ homogeneous polarised light, we shall readily find, that, supposing
                    a given plate of quartz to turn the poles of a certain ray of light through an
                    arc of 20° from their primitive direction, a plate of the same crystal twice as
                    thick will cause a double deviation, and will turn the pole through an arc of
                    40°; a plate of thrice the thickness will cause a triple deviation, amounting to
                    60°; and so forth, without limit.</p>
                <p>With regard to the simple rays of different colours, in passing through a given
                    plate, they undergo deviations so much the more considerable as they are more
                    refrangible, and this in the inverse proportion of the numbers which Newton
                    calls the lengths of the fits; or, what comes to the same result, in the inverse
                    proportion of the quantities which have been designated in this article by the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> (Sect. VII.)</p>
                <p>When, therefore, we know the deviation for a given plate, we may find the effect
                    of a thicker or thinner plate of the same substance by a simple proportion.</p>

                <p>There is no reason to suppose that the angular deviations will undergo any
                    alteration in their values when all the molecules pass through the crystal at
                    the same time. Consequently, in the white pencil transmitted by a plate of a
                    millimetre, the axes of the elementary red rays will form an angle of 8° with
                    the axes of the first orange rays, of about 5° with those of the first yellow
                    rays, and of 26∙5° with the axes of the extreme violet rays; and if we analyse
                    this white pencil by means of a rhomboid, the differently coloured rays will not
                    be divided in the same proportions between the two images: hence there will
                    necessarily be appearances of colour. It is obvious, for example, that when the
                    rhomboid is so placed that its principal section shall coincide with the poles
                    of the red ray, this ray will remain altogether in the ordinary pencil, and the
                    red tint will be wholly wanting in the extraordinary image.</p>
                <p>We may obtain an exact idea of the modification which a plate of quartz produces
                    in a white pencil of polarised light, by conceiving a combination of red rays
                    polarised by reflection at the surface of a certain transparent substance, of
                    orange rays polarised by a second surface placed in a different angular
                    situation, of yellow rays polarised by a third surface, and so forth. The
                    necessity of the intimate mixture of all these kinds of molecules in each line
                    of white light, and some other obstacles, would render it impossible to realise
                    this fiction without a very complicated apparatus; while a simple plate of
                    quartz is sufficient, on the other hand, to give to the different constituent
                    parts of the white pencil these individual polarisations situated in different
                    azimuths.</p>
                <p>The phenomena which have been described are produced by plates of quartz with
                    parallel surfaces cut perpendicularly to the axis of the hexaedral prism. Now,
                    in a direction perpendicular to these surfaces, quartz exhibits no double
                    refraction; so that the causes which in this case <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535391" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5391-0236"/>produce the deviation of the
                    planes of polarisation of the luminous molecules, are different from the causes
                    which occasion the separation of the two pencils in other sections of the
                    crystal. And it is remarkable that the properties of these plates have been
                    found in bodies not possessed of regular crystallization, as flint-glass, and
                    even in perfect fluids, such as the essential oils of turpentine and of lemons,
                    or the solution of camphor in alcohol, the simple syrup of .sugar, and so forth.
                    The only difference is in the absolute value of the thicknesses which afford the
                    same tints, the other laws remaining the same. Thus the thickness of oil of
                    turpentine must be sixty-nine times as great as that of a plate of rock-crystal
                    to produce the same effect; and the action of the oil of lemons is to that of
                    the oil of turpentine as seventeen to ten [or to that of crystal as one to
                    forty-one].</p>
                <p>We have seen that a plate of quartz a millimetre in thickness causes the poles of
                    the red molecules to describe an arc of 17∙5°. We may suppose this motion to
                    have taken place from right to left: then every other plate, of whatever
                    thickness, cut out of <hi rend="italic">the same</hi> crystal, will cause the
                    poles to deviate still farther in the same direction, that is, to turn still
                    from right to left; whilst other plates, on the contrary, cut out of a different
                    crystal, may turn them from left to right. This phenomenon, at first sight, must
                    appear very singular; but if we reflect that the rays pass through the plates in
                    a direction which affords no double refraction, we shall be aware that a
                    deviation of the poles directed constantly the same way in every specimen of the
                    crystal would be not at all less astonishing.</p>
                <p>It has not hitherto been possible to point out any exterior signs which shall
                    indicate the direction of the deviation that will be produced by a given
                    crystal, except in one very remarkable case. In some varieties of quartz, the
                    solid angles, situated at the base of the pyramid by which the prism is
                    terminated, are replaced by as many facets placed obliquely with respect to the
                    edges. Now the direction of the deviation which these <hi rend="italic"
                    >plagiedral</hi> crystals give to the poles of the luminous molecules, is
                    constantly that of the obliquity of these little facets.</p>
                <p>When a polarised ray passes successively through two plates producing contrary
                    rotations, the ultimate deviation of the poles is the difference of the effects
                    which each plate would have produced separately. The ray exhibits exactly the
                    same tints as if it had passed through a single plate, of a thickness equal to
                    the difference of the thicknesses of the two plates.</p>
                <p>If the plates thus combined are equal in thickness, the pencil transmitted,
                    having been turned first in one direction, and then turned back in the contrary
                    direction, seems not to have its polarisation ultimately changed.</p>
                <p>The essential oil of turpentine causes the axes of the molecules of the polarised
                    ray to turn from the right to the left of the observer receiving the ray; the
                    essential oil of lemons from left to right. These fluids do not lose their
                    peculiar properties when they are mixed; so that if their proportions in the
                    mixture are inversely as their rotatory forces, the ray which has passed through
                    them retains its primitive polarisation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>SECT. IX.—ON THE PHENOMENA OF DEPOLARISATION, AND OF COLOURS PRODUCED BY
                    CRYSTALLIZED PLATES NOT CUT PERPENDICULARLY TO THE AXIS OF DOUBLE
                    REFRACTION.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. p.
                    476.</p></note></p>
                <p>We are next to inquire how a white pencil, polarised in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    single direction, is modified in passing through a crystalline plate possessed
                    of double refraction.</p>
                <p>For this purpose we may place the principal section of a rhomboid of calcareous
                    spar in the plane of polarisation of a white pencil, which of course will be
                    subjected to the ordinary refraction only: we may then place the plate in
                    question before the rhomboid, so that the rays may pass through it
                    perpendicularly. If now the principal section of this plate is parallel to that
                    of the rhomboid, we shall still see but one white image; and the same will
                    happen if the principal sections are perpendicular to each other; but in every
                    other situation of the plate, the rhomboid will furnish two pencils, and they
                    will be distinguished by <hi rend="italic">complementary tints.</hi></p>
                <p>The motion of the plate in its own plane does not alter the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nature</hi> of the tints: their brightness only varies, and becomes greatest
                    when the angle formed by the two sections is equal to 45°.</p>
                <p>These tints vary with the thickness of the plate, and degenerate into perfect
                    whiteness when the thickness becomes considerable. In the sulphate of lime, the
                    appearances are no longer observable when the thickness is about half a
                    millimetre, or one fiftieth of an inch.</p>
                <p>Supposing <hi rend="italic">0</hi> to be the tint of the ordinary pencil, and <hi
                    rend="italic">E</hi> that of the extraordinary; the experiment shows that the
                    tint <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is nearly that of one of the coloured rings seen
                    in the light reflected from two object-glasses touching each other, as in the
                    celebrated experiments of Newton; and that the tint <hi rend="italic">0</hi> is
                    that of the corresponding transmitted ring. This rule, however, is not perfectly
                    general; for in many crystals the tints <hi rend="italic">E</hi> by no means
                    resemble those of the rings.</p>
                <p>When the regular sequence of the Newtonian rings is observable, the successive
                    thicknesses of the same crystal, which afford the respective colours <hi
                    rend="italic">E,</hi> are proportional to those which Newton has assigned for
                    substances not crystallized: it is only found that, for any given density, the
                    absolute values of these thicknesses greatly surpass the thicknesses shown in
                    the Newtonian tables.</p>
                <p>We find also a remarkable relation between the tint <hi rend="italic">E,</hi> the
                    thickness of the plate, and the elements of its double refraction, which it is
                    important to point out. The image <hi rend="italic">E</hi> only appears when the
                    principal section of the plate is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the
                    primitive plane of polarisation of the ray which passes through it. If we
                    suppose this plate to possess only the ordinary properties of double refraction,
                    the ray will in general be divided by it into two pencils, one of which will be
                    refracted ordinarily, the other extraordinarily; so that two pencils from the
                    same origin meet, after having passed through different routes, and <hi
                    rend="italic">interfere.</hi> There is a certain inequality of the lengths of
                    these paths at which the red rays destroy each other; at another interval the
                    yellow rays, the green, the blue, and so forth. If we determine, from these
                    principles, the tint resulting from the interference of the different rays,
                    taking into account the thickness and the intensity of the double refraction of
                    the plate, we shall always find a very satisfactory agreement between the
                    calculation and the experiment. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chromatics.)</hi></p>
                <p>The singular deviation which these thin plates seem to produce in the poles of
                    the molecules of different colours which constitute white light, was extremely
                    difficult to be discovered; and nothing shows this difficulty better than the
                    general assent of natural philosophers to the laws which have been the
                    foundation of the <hi rend="italic">theory of moveable polarisation.</hi> It is
                    not therefore sufficient to explain here the true principles on which these
                    phenomena are founded: the confutation of an erroneous theory becomes absolutely
                    necessary in this stage of the investigation, especially when it is plausible in
                    appearance, and when it is brought <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535404"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-5404-0237"/>forward with confidence in the latest works,
                    notwithstanding the decisive objections which had been opposed to it.</p>
                <p>, The fundamental theorem of this <hi rend="italic">moveable polarisation</hi>
                    has been thus enunciated. “When a ray of natural light, polarised in a certain
                    fixed direction, passes perpendicularly through a crystallized plate, which is
                    parallel to the axis of double refraction, the molecules of light penetrate at
                    first to a certain distance without losing their primitive polarisation: after
                    this they begin to perform periodical oscillations round their own centres, so
                    that their axis of polarisation is carried alternately on each side of the
                    principal section of the crystal, or of the line perpendicular to it, like a&gt;
                    pendulum passing from one side to the other of the vertical line which is its
                    quiescent position. Each of these oscillations is performed in a given thickness
                    2e, twice as great as that in which the molecule had made its excursion in one
                    direction. <hi rend="italic">Thus, from the thickness zero to a certain
                    fundamental thickness</hi> e', <hi rend="italic">the homogeneous molecules of
                    which the ray passing through the crystal is composed, are affected, after their
                    emergence, as if they had not quitted th</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    η</hi><hi rend="italic">ir primitive polarisation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">from</hi> e <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 2e <hi
                    rend="italic">they are affected as if they had assumed a new polarisation,
                    differing from the former by the azimuth</hi> 2i; i <hi rend="italic">being the
                    angle which the principal section of the plate forms with the original plane of
                    their polarisation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and they appear, in short,
                    alternatively polarised in their former azimuth, and in an azimuth at the
                    distance 2? from it.”</p>
                <p>To this law it may be objected, first, that whenever the light emerging from a
                    crystal with one axis, whether thin or thick, is composed of two distinct
                    pencils, we find that they are polarised in directions at right angles to each
                    other, whether the incident light may have been natural or polarised; and no
                    exception to this rule has yet been discovered. Now it is difficult, if not
                    impossible, to conceive, in the system of moveable polarisation, how the
                    transition can be made from that state into the state of polarisation in two
                    directions at right angles, which, for the sake of distinction, has been called
                    the fixed polarisation.</p>
                <p>But there is a still more direct objection to this theory. If we place a plate of
                    sulphate of lime in such a manner that its principal section may make an angle
                    of 45° with the primitive plane of polarisation of homogeneous light that is to
                    pass through it, the angle <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> being then equal to 90°,
                    the transmitted pencil, according to the doctrine of moveable polarisation, <hi
                    rend="italic">would be</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">entirely</hi>, po∕αrzsβi∕ <hi
                    rend="italic">either in the primitive plane or in the plane perpendicular to
                    it,</hi> and, when analysed by means of a rhomboid, it would exhibit, in two
                    positions of the principal section of this crystal, only a single image. But
                    this is so far from being true, that <hi rend="italic">if the plate is of a
                    proper thickness,</hi> the pencil will be constantly divided into two images of
                    equal intensities, whatever the direction of the principal section of the
                    rhomboid may be.</p>
                <p>When two pencils, derived from the same origin, and possessing the same velocity,
                    are made to intersect each other at a very small angle, after having travelled
                    by different paths, of which the lengths are slightly different, they may
                    destroy each other completely, as we have already seen; and this destruction
                    would as readily take place if they came by the same path with different
                    velocities. Let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the difference of the paths which
                    determines, in the first case, the periodical series of the points of space in
                    which two rays of a certain homogeneous light produce complete darkness by their
                    interference; the same letter <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will express, in the
                    second case, the quantity by which one of the rays will require to be more
                    advanced than the other by the excess of its velocity, in order that the light
                    may again be destroyed. When, in a crystallized plate, the difference of the
                    tracks described by the ordinary and extraordinary rays of a given kind of
                    light, or when the effect of the difference of velocity is 0, <hi rend="italic"

                    polarised in the primitive plane, or in the azimuth</hi> 2i, as the principles
                    of the doctrine of moveable polarisation require.</p>
                <p>When the plate has such a thickness that the difference of the paths described by
                    the ordinary and extraordinary pencils is included in the general formula <hi

                    already* cen, by no means agrees with the doctrine of moveable polarisation.</p>
                <p>Lastly, when the thickness of the plate employed is not comprehended in any of
                    the preceding expressions, <hi rend="italic">the completely polarised rays,
                    which pass through it, emerge with the characters of a partial
                    polarisation.</hi> This result is no less inconsistent than the former with the
                    laws of moveable polarisation; since, according to these laws, the polarised
                    incident ray ought always to emerge completely polarised, with a simple change
                    of the azimuth of its poles.</p>
                <p>It is not, therefore, generally true, that a pencil of polarised homogeneous
                    light, which passes through thin crystallized plates, either preserves its
                    primitive polarisation, or assumes a new one at the angular distance of <hi
                    rend="italic">2i</hi>; and with this falls the whole fabric of the oscillatory
                    motions attributed to the molecules of light. With respect to the objection
                    already made to this theory, regarding the connection to be established between
                    the phenomena of thin plates and those of thick crystals, it seems to retain its
                    full force, since it has not been established by experiment that the rays
                    concerned in the phenomena of thin plates are polarised in two rectangular
                    directions.</p>
                <p>Supposing, however, for a moment, that this were the case, and that a luminous
                    pencil, passing through a thin plate of sulphate of lime, is divided into two
                    rays, the one ordinary and the other extraordinary, polarised at right angles:
                    let us examine what would be the consequence. Mathematically speaking, these two
                    rays follow in general different routes within the crystal; but it is not
                    possible to separate them physically, because the imperfection of our organs
                    forces us to contemplate objects of a certain extent. The advocates of a
                    moveable polarisation will examine this light <hi rend="italic">in α mass.</hi>
                    They will find in certain cases that it appears to have preserved its primitive
                    polarisation, and in others that it seems to be polarised in an azimuth
                    differing by <hi rend="italic">2i,</hi> and they will hence conclude that thin
                    plates act very differently from a thick crystal.</p>
                <p>This conclusion, however, may be disputed. When we make use of a thick crystal,
                    the ordinary and extraordinary images are separated; we study the properties of
                    each apart. In the case of the thin plates the observer has to do with light
                    which is mixed and complicated. Now, who can affirm, without having made the
                    experiment, that two rays really polarised at right angles, will not seem, in
                    cases of interference, to have lost their primitive polarisations, and will not
                    exhibit an intermediate polarisation, the <hi rend="italic">result</hi> of the
                    others, which might be considered as <hi rend="italic">composing</hi> it?</p>
                <p>The reader will now have conjectured, that, in order to elucidate these
                    mysterious phenomena, it will require to be proved, first, that two pencils are
                    actually formed in the thin plates of crystallized substances, as well as in
                    thicker crystals, polarised at right angles to each other; and, secondly, that
                    these pencils, when they are mixed, may exhibit the <hi rend="italic">appearance
                    of</hi> a polarisation intermediate between the two separate directions. Such,
                    then, is the object of the very delicate experiments which are now to be
                    related.</p>
                <p>A pencil of homogeneous solar light being concentrated <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535417" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5417-0238"/>into a very small point, by
                    the aid of a lens of a short focus, fixed in the shutter of a dark room, the
                    pencil of diverging rays is to be received on two plates of glass slightly
                    inclined to each other, and making an angle with the ray of about 35°: the
                    pencils reflected by the two plates will then be completely polarised, and where
                    they intersect each other they will form light and dark stripes; and whatever
                    the position of the plates may be, the stripes will be polarised in the same
                    direction as the two pencils which afford them.</p>
                <p>If we now take a very transparent plate of sulphate of lime, and divide it in the
                    middle, so as to have two plates of exactly the same thickness; if we fix one of
                    the halves of this plate before the mirror, in such a situation that it may
                    transmit that pencil only which is reflected by the first mirror, and so that
                    the principal section may make an angle of 45° with the primitive plane of
                    polarisation; and then the other half of the plate in the way of the polarised
                    light reflected by the other mirror, but with its principal section at right
                    angles to that of the other plate, and making an angle of 45° with the primitive
                    plane in a contrary direction: <hi rend="italic">then, if these plates act in
                    the same manner as thick plates,</hi> however small the measure of their double
                    refraction may be, they must divide the reflected rays which pass through them
                    into two pencils of the same intensity, and polarised at right angles to each
                    other; but, in the positions here assigned to them, it will evidently happen,
                    that the plane of polarisation of the ordinary pencil, coming, for example, from
                    the right-hand plate, will be parallel to the plane of polarisation of the
                    extraordinary pencil of the left-hand plate; and the same will be true of the
                    two remaining pencils of the respective plates.</p>
                <p>This being admitted, it is easy to see what will happen at the points in which
                    the two pencils intersect each other. The ordinary rays of the right-hand plate
                    will at once interfere with the extraordinary rays of the left-hand plate,
                    •since they are polarised in the same direction, and will form a group of light
                    and dark stripes; and a secend group will be afforded by the extraordinary rays
                    of the right-hand plate and the ordinary of its companion. The two groups will
                    be the farther separated from each other as the plates are thicker, and as their
                    double refraction is more strongly marked. In the intermediate space we find the
                    rays of the same description furnished by the two plates; but as they have now
                    received contrary polarities, they intersect each other without exhibiting any
                    of the phenomena of interference, and the eye has the sensation of a uniform
                    light only.</p>
                <p>A fact which is no less evident than the existence of the two systems of stripes,
                    is, that when we employ the sulphate of lime, each of the systems is completely
                    polarised in a plane perpendicular to the principal section of the plate which
                    is nearest to it.</p>
                <p>Now, there is no one of the consequences of the supposition with which we set
                    out, that is, the supposition that every plate divides polarised light passing
                    through it <hi rend="italic">into two pencils polarised at right angles,</hi>
                    that is not fully confirmed by this experiment. The truth of the hypothesis is
                    therefore demonstrated; for every other mode of separation or of polarisation of
                    the rays, that for example which is deduced from the principles of moveable
                    polarisation, would lead to phenomena totally different from those which have
                    been described.</p>
                <p>A little attention to the passages (Sect. VII.) containing an account of the
                    circumstances under which polarised rays arc capable of occasioning appreciable
                    effects of interference, will be sufficient to convince the reader that the two
                    systems of stripes which have been the subjects of these experiments, can only
                    have been the result of the interference of the ordinary rays of one plate with
                    the extraordinary rays of the other. But if any doubts were entertained on this
                    subject, they might be removed in the following manner.</p>
                <p>We might substitute for the two thin plates which have been employed, two thick
                    crystals, for example two rhomboids of carbonate of lime, in which the double
                    refraction would be manifest. As we might then follow separately the course of
                    each pencil, and intercept them in turn by screens, it might thus be proved, by
                    the most direct evidence, that, for the formation of the two groups of stripes,
                    it is necessary and sufficient that the ordinary pencil of one of the crystals
                    should meet the extraordinary pencil of the other, and the reverse. The
                    direction of the polarisation of these fringes, determined by the aid of a
                    rhomboid, would also be exactly the same as in the case of the employment of
                    thin plates. The only remarkable difference between the two experiments would be
                    in the degree of separation of the two groups of fringes. This distance,
                    depending on the difference of the paths described by the ordinary and
                    extraordinary rays, would be “greater” [or rather smaller] with the crystals
                    than with the plates. It might even happen, if the crystals were very thick,
                    that in order to “bring the stripes within the field of view” [or to render them
                    visible], it would be necessary to compensate for a part of the difference of
                    the lengths of the paths, or of the velocities, by the assistance of a plane
                    glass, fixed in the way of one of the pencils; but in every case the results of
                    the experiment would be equally clear and decisive.</p>
                <p>It may also be added, in the last place, as a full answer to every objection that
                    might be raised against this explanation of the formation of the two groups of
                    stripes in the thin plates, that the interval which separates the two systems is
                    always so dependent on the double refraction of the plates, that its exact
                    numerical value may always be deduced from the elements of the double
                    refraction, as obtained by experiments on other portions of the same substance.
                    (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics.)</hi></p>
                <p>We must now consider how it will be possible to reconcile the experiment which
                    has been related, and which proves the subdivision of the light into two
                    pencils, polarised at right angles to each other, with the other fact, which
                    seems to be opposed to it, that when the plate is of a proper thickness, the
                    whole group of polarised rays that pass through it shall appear to be polarised
                    either in the primitive plane or in another making with it an angle of 2z.</p>
                <p>We make, in a dark room, a very small radiant point of homogeneous light, by
                    means of a lens, as already mentioned. We receive the diverging pencil on a
                    plate of glass, having its posterior surface covered with a black varnish;
                    supposing the plate to be in a vertical position, and the diverging pencil to be
                    nearly horizontal, and to make an angle with the surface not much differing from
                    that of complete polarisation: when this arrangement is completed, we place in
                    the way of the reflected light a rhomboid of calcareous spar, its principal
                    section making with the horizon, or with the plane of reflection, an angle of
                    45°. In this position of the rhomboid the light passing through it is divided
                    into two pencils, the one ordinary and the other extraordinary, polarised at
                    right angles, and of equal intensity. After having passed through the first
                    rhomboid, the two pencils fall on another rhomboid of the same thickness, but
                    having its principal section perpendicular to that of the former. The ordinary
                    pencil will then be subjected to the extraordinary refraction in it, and the
                    reverse; and the two pencils will emerge from the second rhomboid, one polarised
                    in the plane of its principal section, and the other perpendicularly to it.</p>
                <p>Let us now follow the course of each of the pencils. In the first place, it is
                    evident, that on account of their divergence they will intersect each other in a
                    space so much the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535430"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-5430-0239"/>wider as they become more remote from the
                    rhomboid: their points of emergence being distinct and sensibly separated, the
                    observer may intercept, in turn, with a screen, either the ordinary or the
                    extraordinary pencil, and enlighten at pleasure any other object, either with
                    the one or the other separately, or with both at once.</p>
                <p>This delicate and complicated experiment being so far advanced, let us place a
                    glass slightly roughened in a part of the field of view common to the two
                    pencils; marking, by a very fine opening in an opaque plate covering the glass,
                    the precise spot on which we fix our attention; and employing, as usual, a
                    doubly-refracting crystal to analyse the different kinds of light, which, after
                    passing through the slit in the diaphragm, depict an image within the eye.</p>
                <p>It will now easily be observed that the ordinary ray, when it arrives alone at
                    the aperture, wherever it may be placed, undergoes no modification, and remains
                    polarised as it was before; and the same is true of the extraordinary ray: but
                    if both these rays intersect each other in the slit, and enter the eye together,
                    the phenomenon is by no means so simple, and its nature changes according to the
                    place occupied by the slit; so that moving this slit gradually by means of a
                    screw, we soon find the point where the light, composed of the two pencils that
                    pass through it, seems to be wholly polarised, in the same manner as the pencil
                    was at its first reflection from the plate of glass; further on, the plane of
                    polarisation seems to be perpendicular to the primitive plane; and in a position
                    intermediate between these the rays transmitted afford no material traces of
                    polarisation at all.</p>
                <p>This experiment, therefore, offers us the singular phenomenon of two pencils,
                    polarised at right angles, which, after having intersected each other in the
                    ground glass, unite within the eye, and.form together, as the test of the
                    rhomboid shows, a pencil polarised sometimes in one direction and sometimes in
                    an opposite one, or sometimes without any sensible trace of polarisation,
                    according to the magnitude of the difference of the paths described by the two
                    pencils.</p>
                <p>It is only to assist the imagination that the piece of ground glass has been
                    supposed to be employed, for its presence is not necessary to the success of the
                    experiment. A lens alone may be used for observing the stripes formed in the air
                    by the interference of the luminous pencils. If, however, we merely placed
                    ourselves with this lens before the two rhomboids, the eye would only receive a
                    uniform and continued light; but as soon as a doubling crystal is perfectly <hi
                    rend="italic">interposed</hi> between the lens and the rhomboids, or between the
                    lens and the eye, we shall observe two systems of dark and bright stripes, the
                    bright stripes of one of the images corresponding always with the dark stripes
                    of the other. The middle stripes, for example, will be bright in the ordinary
                    image, <hi rend="italic">if the principal section of the interposed crystal is
                    parallel to the primitive polarisation of the rays on the blackened
                    glass</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the same case the middle stripe will
                    be dark in the extraordinary image. The point of space occupied by the middle of
                    the image seems therefore to transmit to the eye, through the cryal, only such
                    light as is polarised in the primitive plane, because it affords only an
                    ordinary image of the light; and this circumstance shows also that the effects
                    of interference in the extraordinary image require, for their computation, the
                    addition of ½d to the difference of the paths described.</p>
                <p>When the principal section of the crystal interposed between the eye and the
                    rhomboid is perpendicular to the original plane of polarisation, the two kinds
                    of pencils interchange their effects; and in this case the central stripe of the
                    ordinary image is bright, and that of the extraordh nary image is completely
                    dark, as if the difference of the paths of the rays forming it were ½√.</p>
                <p>It has been hitherto supposed that the original peneil contained only homogeneous
                    light, so that it produced only bright and dark stripes. But if we employ white
                    light, the stripes will be coloured; because <hi rend="italic">d</hi> has
                    different values for, the rays of different tints, and these tints are precisely
                    the same as are developed by polarised light in their passage through
                    crystallized plates of all possible thicknesses.</p>
                <p>A few words will now be sufficient to show the mode of action of these plates in
                    the phenomena of the colours first described.</p>
                <p>A polarised ray passing through a crystallized plate which possesses the power of
                    double refraction is divided by it, mathematically speaking, into two pencils
                    polarised at right angles; but two pencils of this description do not interfere;
                    the plate will therefore not exhibit colours to the naked eye, whatever its
                    thickness may be, even when it is only exposed to polarised light; and this
                    result is confirmed by experiment.</p>
                <p>Each of the ordinary and extraordinary pencils transmitted by the plate will
                    again be divided into two when it passes through an achromatic prism of crystal,
                    or a rhomboid of calcareous spar. Of these four emergent pencils, the two which
                    follow the ordinary path will be no more separated than they were at their
                    emergence from the plate; and the same is true of the two extraordinary pencils,
                    so that the eye will ultimately perceive but two distinct images.</p>
                <p>Of the two pencils which thus concur in the formation of the ordinary image, the
                    one was ordinary in its passage through the plate, and has remained ordinary in
                    the rhomboid placed near the eye, while the action of this rhomboid has been
                    required for bringing the other pencil from the extraordinary to the ordinary
                    refraction. The different kinds of rays have different velocities in crystals
                    capable of double refraction; and an inequality of velocity gives rise to the
                    phenomena of interference, as well as an inequality of distance described. If,
                    in the plate employed, the difference between the velocities of the ordinary and
                    extraordinary ray corresponds, either on account of its thickness or of the
                    diversity of the two refractions, to a certain quantity, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> or its multiple, the kind of rays of which the interval <hi
                    rend="italic">nd</hi> determines the destruction, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being
                    a whole number, will be wanting in the ordinary image transmitted by the
                    rhomboid. And this effect, it must again be repeated, depends on the
                    interference of the two pencils of which this image is really formed, and which,
                    <hi rend="italic">in the plate,</hi> possessed different velocities.</p>
                <p>If the experiment with the two rhomboids had not taught us, that, in order to
                    calculate the mutual actions of the luminous rays, which in passing through
                    different crystals possessed of doubly refractive powers, have several times
                    changed their planes of polarisation, the ordinary laws of interference require
                    some modification, we should have found ourselves arrested by a considerable
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>The difference of the velocities being the same for the two pencils of which the
                    extraordinary image afforded by the rhomboid consists, and for the two which
                    concur in the formation of the ordinary image, it would seem that the rays of
                    the same colour ought to be destroyed at once in both the images, and that they
                    ought to exhibit the same tint; but if we recollect that, after having
                    calculated for one of the images the effect of interference corresponding to the
                    difference <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in the path, we are obliged, when we proceed
                    to the other image, in order to obtain results conformable to experiment, to add
                    <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> to the difference of the paths,
                    or to the effect of the difference of the velocities, this difficulty will
                    disappear. Supposing “ &lt;f ’ <hi rend="italic">[nF]</hi> in the ordinary image
                    to occasion the destruction of the red rays, “<hi rend="italic">d + ½rf”
                    [nd</hi> + ½cQ will correspond, on the contrary, to their most complete
                    agreement in the extraordinary image, and these two images will exhibit tints
                    rigorously complementary to each other, as the experiment shows.</p>

                <p>The colours developed by polarised light, in passing through crystallized plates
                    being only, to speak correctly, portions of stripes produced by interference, we
                    must expect to find in them, by varying the thicknesses of the plates, the same
                    apparent deviations of the planes of polarisation as we found in the experiment
                    on the narrow stripes produced by means of the rays transmitted by two plates of
                    sulphate of lime, of which the principal sections were perpendicular to each

                    light; which seemed to enable them to discover, in those particles, an axis of
                    rotation, a pair of poles, and an equator; and even a kind of precession of the
                    equinoctial points: these phenomena are in fact only, as we have just seen, the
                    immediate and unavoidable consequences of the simple but inexhaustible laws of
                    interference.</p>

                <p>The kind of polarisation which is now to be considered differs essentially from
                    those which have been hitherto examined.</p>
                <p>Suppose that, having polarised a pencil of light, we cause it to undergo twice
                    over, at the angle of 54°, a total reflection within a parallelopiped of glass,
                    as seen in the figure; the new planes of reflection being also supposed to be
                    inclined at an angle of 45° to the plane of primitive polarisation; the emergent
                    pencil will then have acquired some particular properties, which are very
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>When this emergent pencil is analysed with a rhomboidal crystal, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">constantly</hi> decomposed into two rays of the same intensity,
                    whatever may be the direction of the principal section. From this circumstance
                    it might be supposed that it had resumed the character of ordinary light; but if
                    it be transmitted through a crystallized plate before it is subjected to the
                    action of the rhomboid, we shall soon perceive a distinction: for, in this case,
                    common white light would afford two white images of the same intensity, while
                    the light of the parallelepiped is divided into two pencils, both strongly
                    coloured.</p>
                <p>This new kind of rays has also some other peculiarities. It has already been
                    remarked (Sect. V.), that one or more total reflections make no difference in
                    the properties of ordinary light; but they modify, on the contrary, in a
                    remarkable manner, the pencil which has passed through the parallelopiped: for
                    this pencil resumes all the qualities of polarised light when it has been
                    subjected to two total reflections similar to the first, whatever may be the
                    azimuth of the latter planes of reflection with regard to the former.</p>
                <p>The pencil of light in question is decomposed, then, into two coloured images,
                    when it is only analysed by a rhomboid after having been transmitted through a
                    crystallized plate; but it must be remarked, that the colour of each of these
                    images, on the chromatic circle of Newton, is about one fourth of the
                    circumference distant from the place which the colour of the same image would
                    have occupied if we had employed only common polarised light.</p>
                <p>It may also be added, as another distinguishing character, that this last kind of
                    light gives rise to no phenomena of colour after being transmitted through
                    plates of rock-crystal perpendicular to the axis, or through columns of oil of
                    turpentine, or of other essential oils.</p>
                <p>A polarised ray, modified by two total reflections, has therefore some very
                    particular characters, which distinguish it equally from a direct ray and from
                    an ordinary polarised ray; and as these characters have no relation to the
                    different sides of the ray, the modification thus obtained has received the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">circular polarisation.</hi> If any person <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535456" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5456-0241"/>should think the denomination
                    too little supported by the facts described, he may be informed, that it has
                    been partly derived from some theoretical considerations, which appear to
                    justify it.</p>
                <p>The mode of obtaining the circular from the ordinary polarisation by means of two
                    total reflections having been described, there remains to be mentioned a very
                    remarkable method of procuring the circular polarisation more immediately from
                    common light.</p>
                <p>We cut out of a column of rock-crystal a very obtuse prism, with its two faces
                    forming an angle of about 150°, and equally inclined to the axis of the column,
                    and we make it achromatic as well as we can, with two prisms of glass cemented
                    to its opposite faces: or, since this method must always be imperfect, we
                    employ, instead of the glass, two other prisms of rock-crystal, taken from
                    pieces which possess the opposite qualities which have been described in
                    speaking of plagiedral crystals; and this arrangement has also the advantage of
                    a separation of the images to a double distance. We obtain by means of this
                    little combination the effects of double refraction; but the two pencils to
                    which it gives birth, when they have been transmitted in a direction parallel to
                    the axis of the column, have not acquired the same modification which Iceland
                    spar, for example, would produce in them, but they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >circularly</hi> polarised. Thus, if we analyse them with a rhomboid, they are
                    always divided into two pencils of equal intensity; and when they have undergone
                    two total reflections within a parallelepiped of glass at an angle of incidence
                    of 54°, they are found completely polarised in two planes inclined 45° to the
                    plane of reflection, the plane of polarisation of the one being to the right,
                    and that of the other to the left.</p>
                <p>There exists, therefore, a particular kind of double refraction, which
                    communicates to the rays of light a circular polarisation, as the double
                    refraction of the Iceland crystal produces in them the ordinary
                    polarisation.</p>
                <p>It follows, besides, from all the phenomena of this class, and from the general
                    laws of interference, that a pencil circularly polarised may be considered as
                    composed of two ordinary pencils polarised at right angles, one of them,
                    however, being supposed to be retarded in its path, in comparison with the
                    other, by a quarter of the interval which has been already noted by <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>The properties of rays circularly polarised afford us a very curious mode of
                    reproducing exactly all the phenomena of colours, that we have observed in the
                    plates of rock-crystal cut perpendicularly to the axis, and in certain
                    liquids.</p>
                <p>For this purpose we must place a thin crystallized plate between two
                    parallelopipeds of ordinary glass crossed at right angles, and similar to that
                    which has been already represented by a figure. A pencil, passing
                    perpendicularly through the first parallelopiped, undergoes within it two total
                    reflections at the angle of 54°; after its emersion, it is transmitted by the
                    crystallized plate, and further on it enters the second parallelopiped, and is
                    again twice reflected within it, but in a plane perpendicular to that of the
                    former reflections: at last it emerges into the air, perpendicularly to die last
                    surface of the parallelopiped. Now we may always obtain, in the emergent ray,
                    the appearances of a polarised ray which passed through a plate of rock-crystal
                    cut perpendicularly to the axis, or a certain depth of the essential oil of
                    turpentine; and it will be sufficient for this purpose, that the pencil incident
                    upon the first parallelopiped should be previously polarised, and that the axis

                <p>iii. The crystals which have been enumerated appear to be symmetrical with
                    respect to a single axis, so as to have similar properties in every plane
                    passing through that axis; but Sir David Brewster discovered, in 1816, that in a
                    great multitude of crystals the refractive powers are different in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193535469" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5469-0242"/> different planes
                    passing through the principal axis; the phenomena and the laws of refraction
                    being such as may be explained from the combined effects of two axes
                    perpendicular to each other, and unequal in the ellipticity of the spheroids to
                    which they belong.</p>
                <p>“All regular crystals which belong to the <hi rend="italic">primitive</hi> system
                    of Mohs, or whose primitive forms are the <hi rend="italic">right prism,</hi>
                    with its base a rectangle, a rhomb, or an oblique parallelogram; the <hi
                    rend="italic">oblique prism,</hi> with its base a rectangle, a rhomb, or an
                    oblique parallelogram; or the <hi rend="italic">rectangular and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rhomboidal</hi><hi rend="italic">octaedron;</hi> have <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> axes of double refraction, coincident with some permanent
                    line in the primitive form.”</p>
                <p>1. Thus, all the combinations of the sulphuric, tartaric, and acetic acids, with
                    single earthy, metallic, and alkaline bases, have two axes of double
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>2. The two <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> axes of crystals with two axes [or
                    .the lines in which the double refraction seems to be neutralised] have no
                    symmetrical relation either with the faces or prominent lines of the primitive
                    or secondary forms of minerals.</p>
                <p>3. The two <hi rend="italic">rectangular</hi> axes, the principal one of which is
                    in the same plane with the two apparent axes, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >equidistant</hi> from them, have a constant symmetrical relation to the faces
                    and axes of the primitive forms in which they crystallize.</p>
                <p>4. The line exhibited at any point of the sphere, by the joint properties of two
                    axes, is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram, of which the sides
                    correspond to the tints belonging to the separate axes, and make with each other
                    an angle twice as great as the angle formed by the planes passing through the
                    given point and the two axes; and the increment or decrement of the square of
                    the velocity of the light may be computed in the same manner as this line
                    representing the tint.</p>
                <p>iv. The necessity of any very minute investigation of th.e properties of
                    particular substances, with regard to double refraction, is in great measure
                    superseded by the very important facts, first observed by Sir David Brewster in
                    1814 and 1815, relating to the effects of heat and compression in producing
                    double refraction and polarisation. He found that compression was capable of
                    producing colour when a soft animal jelly was only touched by the finger; and
                    that when a “negative” crystal, like that of the carbonate of lime, is
                    compressed in the direction of the axis, the tints that it affords “descend,”
                    and that they “rise” when it is dilated: whence it seems to follow, that simple
                    dilatation of a homogeneous substance in a given line will constitute that line
                    the axis of an oblate spheriod; but the results require to be distinguished by a
                    greater variety of experiments. Μ. Fresnel has succeeded in exhibiting not only
                    colours by a strong pressure, but a very manifest reduplication of the image of
                    a line, seen through a piece of glass strongly compressed by screws; and he
                    performed this experiment very successfully at a meeting of the Parisian Academy
                    of Sciences in 1822.]</p>

                    PROPERTIES OF LIGHT CONCERNED IN POLARISATION.</p>
                <p>It will now be necessary to enumerate the natural philosophers to whom we arc
                    indebted for the discoveries of which the importance has been explained in this
                    article; and it will be convenient to do this in the order of the sections.</p>
                <p>i. Huygens appears to be the first person that observed, in the two pencils
                    derived from a single one, by means of double refraction, the existence of
                    particular properties af ter their passage through the crystal, which they did
                    not possess when they entered it. “It seems,” he says, “that we are obliged to
                    conclude, that the undulations of light, by passing through the first crystal of
                    Iceland spar, acquire a certain form, or a certain disposition, by which, when
                    they fall on the substance of a second crystal, in a certain position, they are
                    enabled to affect both the kinds of matter which serve for the two species of
                    refraction; and when they fall on it in another position, they only act on one
                    of these substances.”</p>
                <p>Thus, according to this great philosopher, in the act of double refraction, the
                    undulation, or the ray, changes its <hi rend="italic">form,</hi> and loses its
                    symmetry, so as to give room for the distinction of its different <hi
                    rend="italic">sides,</hi> or, changing the expression only, its different <hi
                    rend="italic">poles.</hi></p>
                <p>Huygens is therefore the first that observed a phenomenon of polarisation, and
                    this discovery was made in 1678, though it was not published till 1690. From the
                    time of Huygens to the year 1809, no observer, with the exception of the
                    immortal author of the <hi rend="italic">Opticks,</hi> had studied the subject
                    of double refraction in this point of view; and it must even be acknowledged
                    that, with respect to the facts in question, nothing was added by Newton to what
                    the Dutch mathematician had discovered. He only insisted much more strongly on
                    the necessity of admitting poles in each of the rays derived from the
                    subdivision which light undergoes in passing through an Iceland crystal. To
                    Malus belongs the honour of having brought back the attention of natural
                    philosophers to the properties of light which form the subject of this article.
                    It was he that first pointed out the singular phenomena exhibited by the
                    ordinary and extraordinary rays when they meet with transparent reflecting
                    surfaces at certain inclinations; and it is to him that we are indebted for the
                    mathematical law which appears to connect intensities of the different pencils
                    into which the light is divided when it passes through two rhomboids of the spar
                    in succession.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Miinoires d’Aicιιeil,</hi> ii. 8vo, Par. 1809.</p></note> ii. The
                    anecdote, which has been often told, of the fortunate circumstance that led
                    Malus to the discovery of the polarisation of light by reflection from
                    transparent substances, is perfectly correct. This philosopher, so early
                    arrested in his pursuit of science by a premature death, and so universally
                    lamented by his friends, has often related to the author of this article, that
                    as he happened to be decomposing, by means of a rhomboid of carbonate of lime,
                    towards the end of the year 1808, the light of the setting sun, reflected from
                    the glass of the windows of the Luxembourg, he first observed the difference of
                    the intensity of the two images in different positions of the rhomboid; but it
                    is not true, as has sometimes been stated, that one of the images actually
                    disappeared in this observation; for the polarisation of the light, at the
                    moment of the experiment, was only partial. A similar difference of intensity
                    must have been before the eyes of mineralogists whenever they had been trying to
                    examine the double refraction of crystals, and had projected the needle which
                    they used for an object of view on a clear and serene sky, which affords a
                    curtain of polarised light. But the fact had not excited their attention. Malus
                    observed it, was struck with all its importance, completely analysed it in all
                    its forms, with the most singular sagacity, and thus became the creator of a new
                    branch of optics. It is to this celebrated observer that we are indebted for all
                    the experiments related in the second section.<note anchored="true"

                    iii. The measurements related in the third section, which appear to show that,
                    at equal angular distances above and below the angle of complete polarisation,
                    the reflected rays contain nearly equal quantities of polarised light, were
                    obtained by Μ. Arago.</p>

                <p>iv. It was Sir David Brewster that discovered the remarkable law which connects
                    the angle of complete polarisation with the refractive density of the substance.
                    It was communicated to the Royal Society on the 16th March 1815.<note

                <p>The relation of the angle of complete polarisation, at the second surface of a
                    transparent medium, to the angle belonging to the first surface, had before been
                    shown by Malus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Μim. d’Αrcueil,</hi> ii.</p></note> The same relation may be
                    extended to the angles, at the same surfaces, which afford polarisation of <hi
                    rend="italic">equal proportions</hi> of the light falling on them. So that the
                    rule given by Malus is only a particular case of a general theorem, which Μ.
                    Arago has deduced from a long series of experiments that have not been
                    published.</p>
                <p>V. It was discovered also by Malus, that the pencil <hi rend="italic"
                    >transmitted</hi> by a transparent plate is partially polarised in a plane at
                    right angles to the plane of polarisation of the reflected pencil. This fact was
                    communicated to the Institute on the 11th March 1811, and published the next day
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur.</hi> See also the Memoirs of the Mathematical
                    Class for 1810. The photometrical experiments of Μ. Arago have established a
                    relation between these two kinds of polarisation which had been unobserved by
                    Malus; it is contained in this simple enunciation. “The quantity of polarised
                    light contained in the pencil which any transparent plate transmits, is exactly
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">the quantity</hi> polarised in the contrary
                    direction, which is found in the light reflected by the same plate.” These
                    experiments were made in 1812, but they were first published in 1814 by Μ. Biot,
                    to whom Μ. Arago had communicated them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Recherche» Expérimentales et

                    1814.</p></note></p>
                <p>It follows from this law, as Μ. Arago had also observed, that at the angle of
                    total reflection, and at all greater obliquities, the light wholly escapes
                    polarisation.</p>
                <p>The phenomena exhibited by piles of plates were analysed by Malus immediately
                    after his discovery of polarisation by refraction.</p>
                <p>The observation that some natural bodies, agates, for example, act on light
                    precisely like these piles of plates, is due to Sir David Brewster.<note

                    related in the sixth section belong to Μ. Fresnel. Malus had before attempted to
                    discover in what manner the planes of polarisation changed their directions; but
                    there are several inaccuracies in the results which he has published.<note

                    Fresnel are some of the most valuable additions that have been made of late to
                    the science of optics. A general account of the deviations undergone, in
                    reflection, by the plane of polarisation of a ray previously polarised, is found
                    in two memoirs presented to the academy by Μ. Fresnel, on the 24th November
                    1817, and the beginning of January 1818; but the mathematical laws of the
                    phenomena were not discovered and published till 1821.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et de
                    Physique,</hi> xvii.</p></note> vii. Μ. Arago and Μ. Fresnel are hitherto the
                    only philosophers who have examined the effect of polarisation in modifying the
                    phenomena of interference. The memoir in which they first recorded the results
                    which are inserted in the seventh section, appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales de Chimie</hi> for 1819, vol. x.</p>
                <p>viii. It was Μ. Arago that first observed the changes in the properties of
                    polarised rays when they pass through crystalline plates. He showed that they
                    acquire the property of being divided by calcareous spar into two coloured
                    pencils, and of being reflected by transparent substances with tints which vary
                    according to the angular position of their surfaces. His memoir was read to the
                    Institute on the 11th of August 1811, and printed in the volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of that year.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster published some similar experiments in his Treatise on
                    Philosophical Instruments, which appeared in 1813.</p>
                <p>The phenomena exhibited by plates cut perpendicularly to the axis were also
                    described by Μ. Arago in the same memoir.</p>
                <p>We are indebted to Μ. Biot for the rule, according to which the deviation of the
                    poles is effected, whether on account of the particular kind of “each luminar
                    molecule,” or on account of the more or less considerable thicknesses of the
                    plates by which these “molecules” have been transmitted. His memoir was read to
                    the Institute in September 1818, and printed shortly afterwards.</p>

                <p>The extension of the properties of plates perpendicular to the axis, by which
                    they are assigned to the strata of certain liquids, was made by Μ. Biot in
                    1815.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulletin des Sciences,</hi> Dec. 1815; see also the article <hi

                    depolarisation produced by crystallized plates, parallel to the axis, are
                    reduced to the three following.</p>
                <p>1. The motion of the plate in its plane does not alter the tints of the images
                    furnished by a rhomboid. This result is implicitly comprehended in the first
                    memoir of Μ. Arago; since in the description of all the motions which cause a
                    change of the tints, the motion of the plate in its own plane is not
                    included.</p>
                <p>2. The tints of the two images are those of the coloured rings of Newton, seen by
                    reflection or by transmission. This law had been laid down by Μ. Biot; but Mr
                    Herschel has shown in the Cambridge Transactions that it is not universally
                    true,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1818,
                    p. 243, 252; see also the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> p.
                    487.</p></note> so that its theoretical importance is lost.</p>
                <p>3. In a crystal of variable thickness, the same phenomena of polarisation are
                    reproduced at thicknesses which form a series like that of the coloured rings of
                    Newton. When we examine with a rhomboid a crystal cut in a proper manner, so
                    that two of its faces form an angle, and which is projected on a back ground
                    affording polarised light, each image appears bordered by regular streaks,
                    parallel to the angular edge of the prism, and separated by equal spaces. Μ.
                    Arago, when he described this phenomena in August 1811, advanced it as a
                    sufficient proof of this third law. The Academy of Sciences, and Μ. Laplace in
                    particular, did not admit the conclusion as demonstrated, and a direct
                    admeasurement of the thicknesses was required. Count Rumford, who was present,
                    offered the use of an instrument which he had employed for some other purposes,
                    and which seemed to promise a sufficiènt degree of precision: the common
                    comparer was also mentioned as proper for the purpose. Μ. Arago, upon these
                    suggestions, undertook to make these further experiments. But Μ. Biot
                    anticipated him; and he has <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> a claim to the <hi
                    rend="italic">first direct demonstration</hi> of the law of the thicknesses.</p>
                <p>4. The brilliant tints of each of these images may be calculated from the laws of
                    interference, according to the difference of the paths and of the velocities of
                    the ordinary and extraordinary rays. This important remark is due to Dr Thomas
                    Young, who is believed to have published it in the Quarterly Review, xi. 1814,
                    p. 42-49.</p>
                <p>It affords the true key of all these phenomena. It must <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535495" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5495-0244"/>howevèr be added, that Dr
                    Young had not explained either in what circumstances the interference of the
                    rays can take place, nor why we see no colours unless the crystallized plates
                    are exposed to light previously polarised. The new properties which required to
                    be combined with the ordinary laws of interference, in order to obtain a <hi
                    rend="italic">complete</hi> explanation of the facts, were discovered by Μ.
                    Arago and Μ. Fresnel, as they have been described in the seventh section. The
                    dates of the memoirs in which Μ. Fresnel published this explanation are 1816 and
                    1818.</p>
                <p>The ingenious and delicate experiments which have been employed as tests of the
                    inaccuracy of the theory of moveable polarisation are also due to Μ. Fresnel,
                    one of the most inventive theorists as well as one of the most skilful
                    experimenters that have devoted themselves to science in this or in any age: the
                    formulae found at the end of the section are also Μ. Fresnel’s.</p>
                <p>• X. The phenomena of circular polarisation were discovered by Μ. Fresnel, who
                    described and analysed them in a memoir read to the Academy of Sciences in
                    November 1817 and in January 1818. His later researches on this subject are

                    December 1822 and February 1823.</p>

                <p>BY THE TRANSLATOR.</p>
                <p>We are led, from the facts which have been enumerated in the eleventh section, to
                    the remarkable coincidence between the discoveries of Sir David Brewster
                    respecting crystals with two axes, and a theory which had been published a few
                    years <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> in order to illustrate the propagation of
                    an undulation in a medium compressed or dilated in a given direction only, and
                    to prove that such an undulation must necessarily assume a spheroidal form, upon
                    the mechanical principles of the Huygenian theory. As every contribution to the
                    investigation of so difficult a subject may chance to be of some value, it will
                    be worth while to copy this demonstration here, from the Quarterly Review for
                    November 1809, vol. ii. p. 345.</p>
                <p>“The proposition to be demonstrated was this: <hi rend="italic">An impulse is
                    propagated through every perpendicular section of a lamellar elastic substance
                    in the form of an elliptic undulation.</hi></p>
                <p>“When a particle of the elastic medium is displaced in an oblique direction, the
                    resistance produced by the compression is the joint result of the forces arising
                    from the elasticity in the direction of the laminae, and in a transverse
                    direction; and if the elasticities in these two directions were equal, the joint
                    result would remain proportional to the displacement of the particle, being
                    expressed, as well in magnitude as in direction, by the diagonal of the
                    parallelogram, of which the sides measure the relative displacements, reduced to
                    their proper directions, and express the forces which are proportional to them.
                    But when the elasticity is less in one direction than in the other, the
                    corresponding side of the parallelogram expressing the forces must be
                    diminished, in the ratio which we may call that of 1 to <hi rend="italic"
                    >m;</hi> and the diagonal of the parallelogram will no longer coincide in
                    direction with the line of actual displacement, so that the particle displaced
                    will also produce a lateral pressure on the neighbouring particle of the medium,
                    and will itself be urged by a lateral force. This force will, however, have no
                    effect in promoting the direct propagation of the undulation, being probably
                    employed in gradually changing the direction of the actual motions of the
                    successive particles; and the only efficient force of elasticity will be that
                    which acts in the direction in which the undulation is advancing, and which is
                    expressed by the portion of the line of displacement, cut off by a perpendicular
                    falling on it from the end of the diagonal of the parallelogram of forces; and
                    the comparative elasticity will be measured by this portion, divided by the
                    whole line of displacement. Calling the tangent of the angle formed by the line
                    of displacement with the line of greatest elasticity <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    the radius being 1, the force in this line being also 1, the transverse force

                <p>and the elasticity, in the given direction, by — <hi rend="italic">γ^~~∙</hi>
                    Hence it follows, that the velocity of an impulse, moving in that direction,
                    will be expressed by √ ’ “It is next to be proved, that the velocity of an
                    elliptical undulation, increasing so as to remain always similar, by means of an
                    impulse propagated always in a direction perpendicular to the circumference, is
                    such as would take place in a medium thus constituted. It is obvious that the
                    increment of each of the diameters of the increasing figure must be proportional
                    to the whole diameter; and this increment, reduced to a direction perpendicular
                    to the curve, will be proportional to the perpendicular falling on the conjugate
                    diameter, which will measure the velocity. We are therefore to find an
                    expression for this perpendicular when it forms an angle with the greater axis,
                    of which the tangent is <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Let the greater semiaxis be 1,

                    circumscribing circle is found —, and the semidiameter itself, equal to unity,
                    reduced in the ratio of the secants of these angles, that is, to « √ -∙^^ <hi

                    velocity in the given medium will always be such as is required for the
                    propagation of an undulation, preserving the form of similar and concentric
                    spheroids, of which the given ellipsis represents any principal section.</p>
                <p>“If the whole of the undulation were of equal force, this <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535508" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5508-0245"/>reasoning would be sufficient
                    for determining its motion; but when one part of it is stronger than another,
                    this supe- ,riority of pressure and motion will obviously be propagated in the
                    direction of the actual resistance produced by the displacement of the
                    particles, since it is this resistance which carries on the pressure, and
                    consequently propagates the motion. It is very remarkable that the direction of
                    the resistance will be found, on the supposition which has been advanced
                    respecting the constitution of the medium, to coincide everywhere with the
                    diameters of the ellipsis when the displacement is perpendicular to the surface.
                    For it is proved by authors on conic sections, that the subnormal of the
                    ellipsis is to the absciss as the square of the lesser axis is to the square of
                    the greater, that is, in this case, as <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> to 1, or as <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> to 1; but if we divide the ordinate to the same ratio of
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to 1, and join the point of division with the extremity
                    of the subnormal, this line, which will evidently be parallel to the diameter,
                    will express, as we have already seen, the direction of the force when the
                    normal represents that of the displacement. An immediate displacement in the
                    direction of any diameter, making an angle with the axis of which the tangent is

                    however, be remembered, that the rectilinear direction of the beam is not
                    supposed to depend on this circumstance alone. Huygens considers each point of
                    the surface of the crystal, On which a beam of light impinges, as the centre of
                    a new undulation, which spreads in some measure in every direction, but produces
                    no perceptible effect except where it is supported by, and co-operates with, the
                    neighbouring undulations, that is, in the surface which is a common tangent of
                    the collateral undulations; but if this principle were applied to extraordinary
                    refraction without the assistance of the obliquity of force, which may be
                    deduced from the supposition of a stratified medium, it would lead us to expect
                    that the elementary impulses, being propagated in a curvilinear trajectory,
                    might be intereepted by an object not situated in the rectilinear path of the
                    beam; a conclusion which is not warranted by experiment.”</p>
                <p>However satisfactorily this mode of viewing the extraordinary refraction may be
                    applied to the subsequent discoveries relating to the effects of heat and
                    compression, there is another train of ideas, which arises more immediately from
                    the phenomena of polarisation, and which might lead us to a more distinct notion
                    of the separation of the pencil into two or more portions, though it does not
                    seem to comprehend so entirely the phenomena depending on spheroidal
                    undulations.</p>
                <p>We may begin this mode of considering the subject in the words which have already
                    been employed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics,</hi> vol. vi. p.
                    649. “If we assume as a mathematical, postulate, in the undulatory theory,
                    without attempting to demonstrate its physical foundation, that a transverse
                    motion may be propagated in a direct line, we may derive from this assumption a
                    tolerable illustration of the subdivision of polarised light by reflection in an
                    oblique plane. Supposing polarisation to depend on a transverse motion in the
                    given plane; when a ray completely polarised is subjected to simple reflection
                    in a different plane, at a surface which is destitute of any polarising action,
                    and which may be said to afford a neutral reflection, the polar motion may be
                    conceived to be reflected, as any other motion would be reflected, at a
                    perfectly smooth surface, the new plane of the motion being always the image of
                    the former plane; and the effect of refraction will be nearly of a similar
                    nature. But when the surface exhibits ä Hew polarising in fluence, and the beams
                    of light are divided by it into two portions, the intensity of each may be
                    calculated, by supposing the polar motion to be resolved instead of being
                    reflected, the simple velocities of the two portions being as the cosines of the
                    angles formed by the new planes of motion with the old, and the energies, which
                    are the true measure of the intensity, as the squares of the sines. We are thus
                    insensibly led to confound the intensity of the supposed polar motion with that
                    of the reflected light itself-, since it was observed by Malus, that the
                    relative intensity of the two portions into which light is divided under such
                    circumstances, is indicated by the proportion of the squares of the cosine and
                    sine of the inclination of the planes of polarisation. The imaginary transverse
                    motion might also necessarily be alternate; partly from the nature of a
                    continuous medium, and partly from the observed fact, that there is no
                    distinction between the polarisations produced by causes precisely opposed to
                    each other in the same plane.” Another analogous hint is found in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1818, p. 273. “Supposing the experiments to be
                    perfeetly represented by [Dr Brewster’s] general law, it will follow that the
                    tint exhibited depends not on the difference of refractive densities in the
                    direction of the ray transmitted, but on the greatest difference of refractive
                    densities in directions perpendicular to that of the ray. These two conditions
                    lead to the same result where the effect of one axis only is considered, but
                    they vary materially where two axes are supposed to be combined</p>
                <p>There can be little doubt that the direction of the polarisation, in such eases,
                    must be determined by that of the greatest and least of the refractive densities
                    in question a “supposition” which Dr Brewster finds “quite correct.”</p>
                <p>We may add again to these hints the consideration, that when simple pressure or
                    extension in the direction of any given axis produces a spheroidal undulation in
                    a medium before homogeneous, this state is always accompanied by the condition,
                    that a ray describing the axis, while the densities in all transverse directions
                    remain equal, undergoes no subdivision; but that a ray moving in the plane of
                    the equator, to which the perpendiculars are the axis and another equatorial
                    diameter, undergoes the greatest possible separation into parts that are
                    respectively polarised in the planes passing through these directions.</p>
                <p>From these phenomena we are led to be strongly impressed with the analogy of the
                    properties of sound, as investigated cursorily by Mr Wheatstone, and in a more
                    elaborate manner by the multiplied experiments of Μ. Savart, which have shown
                    that, in many cases, the elementary motions of the substances transmitting sound
                    are transverse to the direction in which the sound is propagated, and that they
                    remain in general parallel to the original impulse.</p>
                <p>The next transition carries us from the <hi rend="italic">mathematical
                    postulate</hi> here mentioned, to the <hi rend="italic">physical condition</hi>
                    assumed by M∙ Fresnel, that the relative situation of the particles of the
                    ethereal medium with respect to each other, is such as to produce an elastic
                    force tending to bring back a line of particles which has been displaced,
                    towards its original situation, by the resistance of the particles <hi
                    rend="italic">surrounding the line,</hi> and at the same time to impel these
                    particles in its own direction, and in that direction only, or principally,
                    while the aggregate effect is propagated in concentric surfaces.</p>
                <p>This hypothesis of Μ. Fresnel is at least very ingenious, and may lead us to some
                    satisfactory computations; but it is attended by one circumstance which is
                    perfectly <hi rend="italic">appaling</hi> in its consequences. The substances on
                    which M∙ Savart made his experiments were <hi rend="italic">solids</hi> only,
                    and it is only to solids that such a <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> resistance
                    has ever been attributed; so that if we adopted the distinctions laid down by
                    the reviver of the undulatory system himself in his Lectures, if might be
                    inferred that the luminiferous ether pervading<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535521" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5521-0246"/> all space, and penetrating
                    almost all substances, is not only highly elastic, but absolutely solid. The
                    passage in question is this :—</p>
                <p>“The immediate cause of solidity, as distinguished from liquidity, is the lateral
                    adhesion of the particles to each other, to which the degree of hardness or
                    solidity is always proportional. This adhesion prevents any change of the
                    relative situation of the particles, so that they cannot be withdrawn from their
                    places, without experiencing a considerable resistance from the force of
                    cohesion, while those of liquids may remain equally in contact with the
                    neighbouring particles, notwithstanding their change of form. When a perfect
                    solid is extended or compressed, the particles, being retained in their
                    situations by the force of lateral adhesion, can only approach directly to each
                    other, or be withdrawn farther from each other; and the resistance is nearly the
                    same as if the same substance, in a fluid state, were enclosed in an unalterable
                    vessel, and forcibly compressed or dilated. Thus the resistance of ice to
                    extension or compression is found by experiment to differ very little from that
                    of water contained in a vessel; and the same effect may be produced even when
                    the solidity is not the most perfect that the substance admits; for the
                    immediate resistance of iron or steel to flexure is the same, whether it may be
                    harder or softer. It often happens, however, that the magnitude of the lateral
                    adhesion is so much limited as to allow a capability of extension or
                    compression, and it may yet retain a power of restoring the bodies to their
                    original form by its re-action. This force may even be the principal or the only
                    source of the body’s elasticity. Thus, when a piece of elastic gum is extended,
                    the mean distance of the particles is not materially increased...and the change
                    of form is rather to be attributed to a displacement of the particles than to
                    their separation to a greater distance from each other, and the resistance must
                    be derived from the lateral adhesion only. Some other substances, also,
                    approaching more nearly to the nature of liquids, may be extended to many times
                    their original length, with a resistance continually increasing; and in such
                    cases there can scarcely be any material changes of the specific gravity of
                    these substances. Professor Robison has mentioned the juice of bryony as
                    affording a remarkable instance of such viscidity.</p>
                <p>“It is probable that the immediate cause of the lateral adhesion of solids is a
                    symmetrical arrangement of their constituent parts. It is certain that almost
                    all bodies are disposed, in becoming solid, to assume the form of crystals,
                    which evidently indicates the existence of such an arrangement; and all the
                    hardest bodies in nature are of a crystalline form. It appears, therefore,
                    consistent both with reason and with experience to suppose, that a
                    crystallization more or less perfect is the universal cause of solidity. We may
                    imagine, that when the particles of matter are disposed without any order, they
                    can afford no strong resistance to a motion in any direction; but when they are
                    regularly placed in certain situations with respect to each other, any change of
                    form must displace them in such a maħner as to increase the distance of a whole
                    rank at once; and hence they may be enabled to co-operate in resisting such a
                    change. Any inequality of tension in a particular part of a solid is also
                    probably so far the cause of hardness, as it tends to increase the strength of
                    union of any part of a series of particles which must be displaced by a change
                    of form.”</p>
                <p>It must, however, be admitted, that this passage by no means contains a
                    demonstration of the total incapability of fluids to transmit any impressions by
                    lateral adhesion, and the hypothesis remains completely open for discussion,
                    notwithstanding the apparent difficulties attending it; which have appeared to
                    bring us very near to the case stated in the same lectures as a possible one,
                    that there may be independent worlds, some existing in different parts of space,
                    others pervading each other unseen and unknown in the same space. We may perhaps
                    accommodate the hypothesis of Μ. Fresnel to the phenomena of the ordinary and
                    extraordinary refraction, by considering the undulations as propagated through
                    the given medium in two different ways; some by the divergence of the elementary
                    motions in the direction of the ray, and others by their remaining parallel to
                    the direction of the impulse or of the polarisation. The former must be supposed
                    to furnish the spheroidal, the latter the spherical refraction. It would indeed
                    follow that the velocity of the spherical undulation ought to vary by
                    innumerable degrees, within certain limits, according to the direction of the
                    supposed elementary motion; whilst in fact the actual velocity of the spherical
                    undulations seems to be uniformly equal to the velocity in the direction of the
                    axis; but this objection may be obviated by supposing the surface so
                    constituted, that for some unknown reason the parallel elementary motion can
                    only be propagated in the regular manner when it takes place in the direction of
                    the axis, or when it is made to assume that direction; a condition not very
                    simple or natural, but by no means inconceivable, unless we saw any reason to
                    consider the adhesion as a constant force, independent of the direction, and
                    equal to the least or greatest elasticity, or unless it were possible to derive
                    the phenomena of two supposed axes of polarisation, which Μ. Fresnel has
                    explained on the hypothesis of two spheroids, from the supposition of two
                    spherical undulations propagating oblique elementary motions in the direction of
                    the actual polarisation, as already determined for these crystals.</p>
                <p>If these conjectures should be found to afford a single step in an investigation
                    so transcendently delicate, it will be best to pause on them for a time, and to
                    wait for further aid from a new supply of experiments and observations.] (τ. τ.
