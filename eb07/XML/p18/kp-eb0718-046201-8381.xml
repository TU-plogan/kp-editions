                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Portugal,</hi> the most westerly kingdom of Europe, is
                    bounded on the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the east and north
                    by Spain. By modern writers we find this country constantly styled in Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Lusitania</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is certain, that
                    anciently a part of Spain went by that name; but it does not by any means appear
                    that the country called by the ancients <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> had the
                    same boundaries with the modern kingdom of Portugal. Before the time of Augustus
                    Caesar, Lusitania seems to have been bounded on the north by the ocean, and on
                    the south by the river Tagus; thus comprehending all Galicia, and excluding two
                    out of the six provinces of Portugal. But in the more strict and limited sense
                    of the word, it was bounded on the north by the <hi rend="italic">Durius,</hi>
                    or the Douro, and on the south by the river <hi rend="italic">Anas, or</hi> the
                    Guadiana; so that it was not quite equal to modern Portugal in length, but
                    considerably exceeded it in breadth.</p>
                <p>The commonly received opinion with regard to the etymology of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Portugal</hi> is, that a great number of Gauls landed at Porto, or
                    Oporto, whence it received the name of <hi rend="italic">Portus Gallorum,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">the Port of the Gauls</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that
                    in process of time the name gradually extended over the whole country, being
                    softened, or rather shortened, into <hi rend="italic">Portugal.</hi> But the
                    time when this event happened, the reason why these Gauls went thither, and what
                    became of them afterwards, are all particulars which lie buried in oblivion. It
                    is pretended, however, that, upon an eminence which overlooks the mouth of the
                    Douro, there stood an ancient town called <hi rend="italic">Cale,</hi> strong
                    and well peopled, but ill suited for trade; and that this occasioned the
                    construction of a lower town or hamlet, which was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Portus</hi><hi rend="italic">Cale,</hi> or the haven of Cale, and, in process
                    of time, <hi rend="italic">Portucalia.</hi> At length, when this place became so
                    considerable as to be erected into an episcopal see, the bishops subscribed
                    themselves, as the records of ancient councils testify, <hi rend="italic">Portu~
                    calxnses,</hi> the name of the city being transferred to the diocese. It is true
                    that these bishops afterwards changed their title, and subscribed themselves <hi
                    rend="italic">Portuenses,</hi> or “bishops of Portu.” But the facts just
                    mentioned are actually recorded in authentic histories; and as the diocese of
                    Portucalia in a great measure contained that little country in which the
                    sovereignty originally commenced, the name extended itself with the acquisitions
                    of the sovereigns, and came to be applied to the whole kingdom, though the
                    diocese itself has changed its name.</p>
                <p>Portugal, though even yet but a small kingdom, was originally much smaller. The
                    Spanish and Portuguese historians agree, that Don Alonso, king of Leon and
                    Castille, and son of Don Ferdinand the Great, bestowed his daughter, Donna
                    Theresa, in marriage upon an illustrious stranger, Don Henry, and with her gave
                    him the frontier province, which he had conquered from the Moors, small indeed
                    in extent, but excellently situated, and so pleasant and fertile that it has
                    sometimes been styled <hi rend="italic">Medulla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hispanica,</hi> or the Marrow of Spain. To this territory was added the title
                    of Count; but authors are very much divided respecting the time when this
                    stranger came into Spain, and who he was. The more probable opinion appears to
                    be, that he was a grandson of Robert, the first duke of Burgundy. The manner in
                    which he obtained the principality may be briefly related.</p>
                <p>The king, Don Alonso, apprehensive that his success in taking the city of Toledo
                    would bring upon him the whole force of the Moors, sent to demand assistance
                    from Philip I. of France, and the Duke of Burgundy, whose daughter he had
                    married. His request was granted by both princes; and a numerous body of troops
                    was speedily collected for his service, having at their head Raymond count of
                    Burgundy, Henry, younger brother of Hugh duke of Burgundy, Raymond count of
                    Toulouse, and many others. In the year 1087 they arrived at the court of Don
                    Alonso, where they were received and treated with all possible marks of esteem;
                    and having in the course of two or three years given great proofs of their
                    courage and conduct, the king resolved to bestow his only daughter, named
                    Urraca, then at most in her ninth year, upon Raymond count of Burgundy, and
                    assigned them the province of Galicia for the support of their dignity. About
                    four years afterwards, Don Alonso, being desirous to express his gratitude to
                    Henry of Burgundy, gave him in marriage a natural daughter of his, born whilst
                    he remained in exile at Toledo, whose name was Donna Theresa; and upon this
                    marriage he conveyed in full property the country which has already been
                    mentioned. The new sovereign, with his consort, fixed their residence in the
                    town of Guimaraens, pleasantly situated on the banks of the river Ave. The
                    remains of an ancient palace belonging to their successors are still to be seen;
                    and on account of its having been anciently the capital, the king granted the
                    inhabitants an immunity from taxes.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese, finding themselves now independent, immediately began, like most
                    other nations, to attempt the subjugation of their neighbours. Henry is said to
                    have performed great exploits against the Moors; but the accounts given of t <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∙.em are extremely indistinct and unsatisfactory. He
                    died in 1112, and was succeeded by his son Don Alonso, then in the third year of
                    his age. In the minority of the latter the kingdom was governed by the
                    queen-mother Donna Theresa, assisted by two able ministers. During the first
                    nine years of their administration nothing remarkable happened; but, after that
                    period, some differences took place between the queen regent and Urraca queen of
                    Castille. Theresa insisted that some part of Galicia belonged to her in virtue
                    of her father’s will, and therefore seized upon Tuy, an episcopal town, and a
                    place of some consequence. Urraca, having assembled a numerous army, proceeded
                    in person into Galicia, where Theresa was obliged to abandon Tuy, and take
                    shelter in one of her own fortresses. The consequence would probably have been
                    fatal to the new kingdom, had not the archbishop of Compostella, without whose
                    assistance Urraca could perform nothing, demanded leave to retire with his
                    vassals. This offended the queen so much that she threw him into prison; an act
                    of violence which excited such a commotion amongst her own subjects, that the
                    Portuguese were soon delivered from their apprehensions. Theresa immediately
                    afterwards fell into a similar error, by throwing into prison the archbishop of
                    Braga, who had not espoused her cause so warmly as she expected. The bishop,
                    however, was quickly delivered by a bull from the pope, who also threatened the
                    kingdom with an interdict. Soon after this, Urraea died, and all differences
                    were amicably settled at an interview between Theresa and Don Alonso Raymond,
                    who succeeded to the kingdom of Castille. But, in 1126, the king of Castille
                    being obliged to march with the whole strength of his dominions against his
                    father-in-law, the king of Aragon and Navarre, Theresa took the opportunity of
                    again seizing upon Tuy; but the king having soon returned with a superior army,
                    she was again obliged to abandon her conquest.</p>
                <p>But the greatest misfortune which befell this princess was a quarrel with her own
                    son, Don Alonzo Enriquez. It does not appear indeed that Theresa had given him
                    any just cause of offence; but 'it is certain that a civil war ensued, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193538394" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8394-0463"/> in which the
                    queen’s forces were totally defeated, and herself made prisoner, a situation in
                    which she continued during the remainder of her life. Enriquez having thus
                    attained to the free and full possession of his dominions, made several attempts
                    upon various places in Galicia, but without success; and he was at last
                    constrained to conclude a peace with Alonso, king of Castille and Leon, who had
                    assumed the title of <hi rend="italic">Emperor of the Spams,</hi> more
                    especially as his dominions happened to be at that time invaded by the Moors.
                    The number of infidels was so great that the Count of Portugal had but little
                    hopes of subduing them; but a plague having broken out in the Moorish army, they
                    were obliged to retreat, after which he reduced several places belonging to that
                    nation. In the mean time, the Emperor Don Alonso, having made an irruption into
                    the Portuguese territories, destroyed everything with fire and sword. The king
                    of Portugal surprised and cut off a considerable part of his army; but this did
                    not prevent the emperor from marching directly towards him. At the intercession
                    of the pope’s legate, however, all differences were accommodated, a peace
                    concluded, and all places and prisoners taken on both sides were delivered
                    up.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the progress of the Christian arms in Spain being reported to Abu-Ali
                    Texefien, the miramamolin or chief monarch of the Moors in Barbary, he directed
                    Ishmael, his lieutenant in Spain, to assemble all the forces in the southern
                    provinces, and to drive the Christians beyond the Douro. Ishmael immediately
                    began to prepare for putting these orders in execution; and having added a
                    considerable body of troops which had arrived from Barbary to those whom he had
                    raised in Spain, the whole army was very numerous. He was met by Don Alonso of
                    Portugal on the plains of Ourique, upon the banks of the river Tagus, where
                    Ishmael took all possible means to prevent the Christians passing that river,
                    because his own cavalry, in which consisted the strength of his army, would thus
                    have more room to act. The Portuguese forces were inconsiderable in number in
                    comparison with the Moors; but Ishmael, being too confident of victory, divided
                    his army into twelve bodies, and disposed them in such a manner as might best
                    prevent the flight, not sustain the attack, of the Christians. The consequence
                    was, that his army was overthrown with incredible slaughter, and a vast number
                    of prisoners taken, amongst whom were one thousand Christians of the sect styled
                    Moz-arabians, whom, at the request of Theotonus, prior of the Holy Cross, Don
                    Alonso set at liberty with their wives and children, and procured them
                    settlements in his own dominions.</p>
                <p>After this signal victory, gained in the year 1139, Don Alonso was proclaimed
                    king by his soldiers, and ever afterwards retained that title, renouncing all
                    kind of subjection to the crown of Spain. Being very desirous, however, of
                    reducing the power of the emperor, he formed a league with Raymond, count of
                    Barcelona, and regent of the kingdom of Aragon, against that prince. In virtue
                    of this treaty, he entered Galicia with a considerable force on one side, whilst
                    Don Raymond simultaneously invaded it on the other. But neither of these
                    enterprises succeeded. The Portuguese monarch met with a severe check in his
                    expedition into Galicia, where he received a dangerous wound, whilst some of the
                    nobility who attended him were taken prisoners. At the same time, having
                    received intelligence that the Moors had invaded his dominions, he was obliged
                    to retire; but his retreat was not made in sufficient time to prevent the strong
                    fortress of Leiria from falling into their hands. This fortress they demolished,
                    and put the garrison to the sword; but the king caused it to be reconstructed of
                    greater strength than before, and placed in it a more numerous garrison. Yet he
                    undertook nothing farther during this campaign. The war continued with various
                    success till the year 1145, when the king projected an enterprise against
                    Santa-</p>
                <p>rem, a strong city, at no great distance from Lisbon. In this he luckily
                    succeeded, and thus gained a considerable tract of country, with a strong
                    barrier to his dominions.</p>
                <p>After this success Don Alonso caused himself to be crowned king of Portugal
                    before an assembly of the states, where he also solemnly renounced all
                    dependence upon the crown of Spain; declaring, that if any of his successors
                    should condescend to pay tribute or to do homage to that crown, he ought to be
                    deemed unworthy of enjoying the kingdom of Portugal. The next year the king
                    undertook to recover Lisbon from the Moors; but there are so many fables related
                    of this expedition that it is impossible to come at the truth. All that can be
                    gathered from these accounts is, that he undertook the siege with a small army,
                    and was able to make little progress in it, partly from the strength of the
                    place, and partly also from the numerous garrison by which it was defended. At
                    length, fortunately for Don Alonso, a fleet of adventurers, French, English,
                    Germans, and Flemings, who were on their way to the Holy Land, having anchored
                    at the mouth of the Tagus, he demanded their assistance, as not altogether
                    foreign to their design of making war upon the infidels. His request was readily
                    granted; and, with their assistance, Lisbon was speedily reduced; a conquest
                    which so much enhanced the reputation of this monarch, and brought such numbers
                    to recruit his army, that before the end of the year 1147 he had reduced twelve
                    other considerable cities.</p>
                <p>For many years after this, Don Alonso was successful in all his undertakings. He
                    settled the internal government of his kingdom; procured a bill from Pope
                    Alexander III. confirming his regal dignity; undertook many successful
                    expeditions against the Moors; and became master of four out of the six
                    provinces which compose the present kingdom of Portugal. In all his undertakings
                    he was assisted by the counsels of his queen, Matilda, a woman of great
                    capacity, and capable of governing the kingdom in her husband’s absence. By her
                    he had a numerous offspring, including three daughters, the eldest of whom,
                    Donna Matilda, was married to the king of Aragon; the second, Urraca, to Don
                    Ferdinand king of Leon; and the third, Theresa, to Philip earl of Flanders. In
                    1166, however, the king thought proper, from what cause we know not, to invade
                    the dominions of his son-in-law Don Ferdinand, and to seize upon Limmia and
                    Turon, two cities of Galicia, in which he placed strong garrisons. Elated with
                    his success, he next year marched with a numerous army towards Badajoz, which he
                    invested. On receiving the news of this attack, Don Ferdinand, who had assembled
                    a large army at Ciudad Rodrigo, marched to its relief. But before he came in
                    sight of the fortress it had surrendered to the king of Portugal; upon which Don
                    Ferdinand resolved to besiege his antagonist in his newly-conquered city. Don
                    Alonso perceiving his design, endeavoured to draw out his forces into the field.
                    Though at that time upwards of seventy years of age, he placed himself on
                    horseback, and pushing forward at the head of his horse to get out at the gate,
                    struck his leg against one of the bolts with such violence that the bone was
                    shattered to pieces. This accident occasioned such confusion that the Portuguese
                    troops were easily beaten, and Don Alonso was taken prisoner. He was exceedingly
                    mortified by this reverse, especially as he had no great reason to expect kind
                    treatment from his son-in-law. However, the king of Leon behaved towards him
                    with the greatest respect and affection. He desired him to lay aside all
                    thoughts of business, and attend to his cure; but finding him restless and
                    impatient, he assured him that he expected nothing more than to have things put
                    into the same condition as before the war, and that in future they should live
                    in peace and friendship. To this proposal the king of Portugal most readily
                    assented; but he returned to his dominions before his cure was perfected, and
                    thus became lame all the rest of his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538407"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8407-0464"/>life. This, however, did not abate his military
                    ardour; for his courage transported himinto the field whenever he was called
                    thither by the interests of his subjects. Towards the end of his reign, an
                    opportunity seemed to present itself of obtaining once for all an entire release
                    from the disagreeable pretensions of the king of Leon, who, it seems, had
                    insisted on the king of Portugal doing homage for his kingdom. This was a
                    quarrel between the king of Leon and his nephew Don Alonso king of Castille. The
                    latter solicited assistance from the king of Portugal, which was readily
                    granted. But Don Ferdinand having received intelligence that the infant Don
                    Sancho, the king’s eldest son, was advancing towards Ciudad Rodrigo, assembled
                    his troops with such diligence on that frontier, that being enabled to attack
                    him unexpectedly, he entirely defeated him.</p>
                <p>Understanding, however, that Don Sancho was recruiting his forces with great
                    diligence, he suggested that they might be much better employed against the
                    infidels, who remained careless and unprepared, expecting the issue of the
                    contest. Don Sancho did not fail to profit by this advice; and after some
                    movements intended to amuse the enemy, he made a sudden irruption into
                    Andalusia, penetrating as far as Triana, one of the suburbs of Seville. The
                    Moors assembled their forces in order to attack him on his retreat; but Don
                    Sancho having first fatigued them by the celerity of his march, at length chose
                    a strong camp, and, having given his troops time to repose, drew them out and
                    offered the enemy battle. The Moors accepted the challenge, but were entirely
                    defeated; and Don Sancho returned to Portugal loaded with spoil. For some years
                    afterwards the war continued without producing any remarkable event; but, in
                    1184, Joseph king of Morocco having already transported multitudes of men from
                    Barbary, at length followed in person with a prodigious army, and carried all
                    before him as far as the Tagus. He appeared before the city of Santarem; but
                    having exhausted and reduced his army by unsuccessful assaults on that place, he
                    was attacked by the Portuguese assisted by Ferdinand of Leon, and entirely
                    defeated and slain. By this victory the Portuguese were left at liberty to
                    improve the interior of thcif country, and to fortify their frontiers; but not
                    long afterwards, that is, in the year 1185, the king died, in the seventy-sixth
                    year of his age.</p>
                <p>Don Alonso was succeeded by his son Don Sancho I. Of this prince it is
                    remarkable, that before he ascended the throne he was of a restless and warlike
                    disposition; but no sooner did he come to the possession of the kingdom than he
                    became a lover of peace, and began with great assiduity to repair the cities
                    which had suffered most by the war, and to rcpeople the country around them. By
                    his steady attention to the work of restoration, he in a short time quite
                    changed the appearance of his territories, and procured to himself the glorious
                    title of The Restorer of Cities, and Father of his Country. In the year 1189, a
                    fleet, composed for the most part of English vessels, but having on board a
                    great number of adventurers of other nations, bound for the Holy Land, entered
                    the river Tagus.. They were very kindly received and supplied with all kinds of
                    refreshments by Don Sanctio, who took this opportunity of soliciting them to
                    assist him in a design he had formed of attacking the city of Silvas in Algarve,
                    to which they readily assented. Having joined them with a squadron of his own
                    galleys, and marched a body of troops by land, the place was reduced, and the
                    English, according to agreement, were rewarded with the plunder. But in a short
                    time, the Moors from Africa having once more invaded Portugal, the town was
                    several times taken and retaken, until at last Don Sancho, sensible of the
                    difficulties of retaining it, caused it to be demolished. His last enterprise
                    was the reduction of Elvas; soon after which he died, leaving the reputation of
                    being the best economist that ever sat on the throne of Portugal. With the
                    character of being rather liberal than avaricious, he had amassed a treasure of
                    more than seven hundred thousand crowns in ready money, besides fourteen hundred
                    merks of silver, and one hundred of gold plate, which he disposed of some time
                    before his death. He was interred by his own command in the cathedral of
                    Coimbra; and when his body was taken up four hundred years afterwards, that it
                    might be laid in a new tomb, it was found uncorrupted.</p>
                <p>The history of Portugal presents scarcely any event of importance till the year
                    1289; when, in the rcign of Don Denis, a difference commenced with Castillo,
                    which subsisted for a long period. Frequent reconciliations took place; but
                    these were either of short duration, or never sincere. At length, in the reign
                    of John L, Don Juan of Castille, who had also pretensions to the crown of
                    Portugal, invaded that kingdom at the head of the whole force of his dominions,
                    and with the flower of the Castillian nobility entered the province of Alemtejo∙
                    According to the Portuguese historians, he besieged Elvas, but without effect; a
                    disappointment which enraged him to such a degree that he determined the
                    following year to invade Portugal a second time, and lay waste the country
                    before him. Accordingly, having collected an army of thirty thousand men, he
                    invaded Portugal, and took and ruined several places, whilst King John lay
                    inactive, with a small army, waiting for some English succours which he
                    expected. At last he ventured an engagement with the forces which he had, and,
                    notwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy, obtained a complete victory;
                    after which he made an irruption into Castille, and had the good fortune to gain
                    another battle, which fixed him firmly upon the throne of Portugal. The
                    Castillians were obliged to consent to a truce of three years, which was soon
                    afterwards improved into a lasting peace.</p>
                <p>In 1414, King John undertook an expedition against the Moors in Barbary, where he
                    commanded in person; but before he set out, his queen Philippa, the daughter of
                    John duke of Lancaster, died of grief at the thoughts of his absence. The
                    expedition, however, proved successful, and the city of Ceuta was taken from the
                    Moors almost at the first assault; but scarcely had the king left that country,
                    when the princes of Barbary formed a league for the recovery of the place; and
                    though they were defeated by the young princes of Portugal, whom John again sent
                    into Barbary, yet the trouble of keeping it was so great that some of the king’s
                    council were of opinion the town should be demolished. But John, having
                    considered the arguments on both sides, determined to preserve the city; and
                    therefore enlarged and strengthened the fortifications, augmenting his forces
                    there to six thousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse, which he hoped
                    would prove sufficient for repelling the attacks of the Moors.</p>
                <p>King John died in 1428, and was succeeded by his eldest son Edward. The latter
                    undertook an expedition against Tangier, in Barbary, but the event proved very
                    unfortunate; the Portuguese being so shut up by the Moors, that, to obtain leave
                    to return to Portugal, they were obliged to give up Ceuta. The king’s son, Don
                    Ferdinand, was left as a hostage for the delivery of Ceuta; but, with the utmost
                    cruelty and injustice, the king and council of Portugal constantly refused to
                    deliver up the place. Many preparations indeed were made for recovering the
                    prince by force; but before any thing could be accomplished the king died in
                    1430, which put an end to all these designs.</p>
                <p>The war with Barbary continued at intervals, but with little success on the part
                    of the Portuguese; and, till 1497, there is no event of any consequence recorded
                    in the history of Portugal. This year, however, was remarkable for the discovery
                    of the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. The enterprising
                    spirit of the Portuguese had, for a considerable time before, prompted them to
                    undertake voyages along the coast of Africa; yet, w4ιcn they undertook their
                    first· voyage of discovery, it is probable that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538420" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8420-0465"/>they had nothing farther in
                    view than to explore those parts of the coast of Africa which lay nearest to
                    their own country. But a spirit of enterprise, when roused and put in motion, is
                    always progressive; and that of the Portuguese, though slow and timid in its
                    first operations, gradually acquired vigour, and prompted them to advance
                    alongthe western shore of the African continent far beyond the utmost boundary
                    of ancient navigation in that direction. Encouraged by success, they became more
                    adventurous, despised dangerswhich formerly appalled them, and surmounted
                    difficulties which were once deemed insuperable. When the Portuguese found in
                    the torrid zone, which the ancients had pronounced to be uninhabitable, fertile
                    countries, occupied by numerous nations, and perceived that the continent of
                    Africa, instead of extending in breadth towards the west, according to the
                    opinion of Ptolemy, appeared to contract itself, and to bend eastwards, more
                    extensive prospects opened to their view, and inspired them with hopes of
                    reaching India, by continuing to hold the same course which they had so long
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>After several unsuccessful attempts to accomplish what they had in view, a small
                    squadron sailed from the Tagus, under the command of Vasco de Gama, an officer
                    of rank, whose abilities and courage fitted him to conduct this difficult and
                    arduous enterprise. From ignorance, however, of the proper season and route of
                    navigation in that vast ocean through which he had to steer his course, his
                    voyage was long and dangerous. At length he doubled that promontory which had
                    been descried by Diaz, and which, for several years, had been the object of
                    terror and of hope to his countrymen. After a prosperous navigation along the
                    southeast coast of Africa, he arrived at the city of Melinda, and had the
                    satisfaction of discovering there, as well as at other places where he touched,
                    people of a race very different from the rude inhabitants of the western shore
                    of that continent, which alone the Portuguese had hitherto visited. 'These he
                    found to be so far advanced in civilization and acquaintance with the various
                    arts of life, that they carried on an active commerce, not only with the nations
                    on their own coast, but with remote countries of Asia. Conducted by their
                    pilots, who held a course with which experience had rendered them well
                    acquainted, he sailed across the Indian ocean, and landed at Calicut, on the
                    coast of Malabar, on the 22d of May 1498, ten months and two days after his
                    departure from the port of Lisbon. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gama.)</hi></p>
                <p>The samorin or monarch of the country, astonished at this unexpected visit of an
                    unknown people, whose aspect, and arms, and manners, bore no resemblance to
                    those of any of the nations accustomed to frequent his harbours, and who arrived
                    in his dominions by a route hitherto deemed impracticable, received them at
                    first with that fond admiration which is often excited by novelty; but in a
                    short time, from whatever motives, he formed various schemes to cut off Gama and
                    his followers. The Portuguese admiral, however, was not to be overreached by
                    such politics as his. From every danger to which he was exposed, either by the
                    open attacks or secret machinations of the Indians, he extricated himself with
                    singular prudence and dexterity, and at last sailed from Calicut with his ships,
                    loaded not only with the commodities peculiar to that coast, but with many rich
                    productions of the eastern parts of India. He returned to Portugal in two years
                    after his sailing from the Tagus, but with a great loss of men; for out of one
                    hundred and forty-eight persons who sailed with him, only fifty-five returned.
                    The king received him with all possible testimonies of respect and kindness;
                    created him Count of Videgueira; and not only declared him admiral of the
                    Indies, but also made that office hereditary in his family.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese entered upon the new career opened to them with activity and
                    ardour, and made exertions, both commercial and military, far beyond what could
                    have been expected from a kingdom of such inconsiderable extent. All these were
                    directed by an intelligent monarch, capable of forming plans of the greatest
                    magnitude with systematic wisdom, and of prosecuting them with unremitting
                    perseverance. The prudence and vigour of his measures, however, would have
                    availed but little without proper instruments to carry them into execution.
                    Happily for Portugal, the discerning eye of Emanuel selected a succession of
                    officers to take the supreme command in India, who, by their enterprising
                    valour, military skill, and political sagacity, accompanied with disinterested
                    integrity, public spirit, and love of their country, have established a title to
                    be ranked amongst the persons most eminent for virtue and abilities in any age
                    or nation. Greater things perhaps were achieved by them than were ever
                    accomplished in so short a time. Within twenty-four years after the voyage.of
                    Gama the Portuguese had rendered themselves masters of the city of Malacca, in
                    which the great staple of trade carried on amongst the inhabitants of those
                    regions in Asia which Europeans have distinguished by the general name of the
                    East Indies, was then first established. This conquest secured to them great
                    influence over the interior commerce of India, whilst, at the same time, by
                    their settlements at Goa and Diu, they were enabled to engross the trade of the
                    Malabar coast, and to obstruct greatly the long-established intercourse of Egypt
                    with India by the Red Sea. In every part of the East they were received with
                    respect; in many they had acquired the absolute command. T hey carried on trade
                    there without rivalry or control; they prescribed to the natives the terms of
                    their mutual intercourse; they often fixed what price they pleased on the goods
                    which they purchased; and they were thus enabled to import from Hindustan, and
                    the regions beyond it, whatever was useful, rare, or agreeable, in greater
                    abundance, and of more various kinds, than had been formerly known in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Not satisfied with this ascendant which they had acquired in India, the
                    Portuguese early formed a scheme not less bold than interested, of excluding all
                    other nations from participating in the advantages of commerce with the East;
                    and they accomplished one half of what their ambition had planned. In
                    consequence of this the Venetians soon began to feel that decrease of their own
                    Indian trade which they had foreseen and dreaded. In order to prevent the
                    farther progress of this evil, they incited the soldan of the Mam-lukes to fit
                    out a fleet in the Red Sea, and to attack those unexpected invaders of a gainful
                    monopoly, of which he and his predecessors had long enjoyed undisturbed
                    possession. The Portuguese, however, encountered his formidable squadron with
                    undaunted courage, entirely defeated it, and remained masters of the Indian
                    Ocean. They continued their progress in the East almost without obstruction,
                    until they established there a commercial empire; to which, whether we consider
                    its extent, its opulence, the slender power by which it was formed, or the
                    splendour with which the government of it was conducted, there had hitherto been
                    nothing comparable in the history of nations. Emanuel, who laid the foundation
                    of this stupendous fabric, had the satisfaction to see it almost completed.
                    Every part of Europe was supplied by the Portuguese with the productions of the
                    East; and if we except an inconsiderable quantity which the Venetians still
                    continued to receive by the ancient channels of conveyance, our quarter of the
                    globe had no longer any commercial intercourse with India, and the regions of
                    Asia beyond it, except by the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>In September 1522, King Emanuel died of an epidemical fever, and was succeeded by
                    his son John III. The most remarkable transaction of this prince’s reign was the
                    introduction of the inquisition into his dominions. This happened in the year
                    1525, or, as some say, in 1535. A famine happening to cease in a short time
                    after the Holy Office was introduced, the priests persuaded the ignorant
                    multitude that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538433" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8433-0466"
                    />it was a blessing from heaven on account of erecting such a tribunal. It was
                    not long, however, before the bulk of the nation perceived what kind of a
                    blessing the inquisition had conferred. But their discernment came too late; for
                    by that time the inquisitors had acquired such power, that it became equally
                    ineffectual and dangerous to attempt disclosing any ’ of their mysteries.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Solyman the Magnificent, the most enlightened monarch of the
                    Ottoman race, observing the rising power and opulence of the Portuguese,
                    attributing it to its proper cause, and eager to supplant them, sent orders to
                    the pasha of Egypt to employ his whole strength against the Christians in the
                    East Indies. The pasha, in obedience to these orders, sailed from the Red Sea
                    with a greater naval force than ever the Mahommedans had employed before, having
                    four thousand Janizaries and sixteen thousand other troops on board. Yet, by the
                    courage and conduct of the Portuguese officers and soldiers, all this mighty
                    armament was defeated, and their East India possessions were saved from the
                    danger which threatened them. In Africa, likewise, the king of Fez was baffled
                    before the town of Safi, whilst fresh quarrels breaking out amongst the native
                    princes, gave great relief to the Christians, who had long been obliged to carry
                    on a defensive war, and had more than once been on the very brink of ruin. For a
                    long time indeed their safety had depended solely on the quarrels of the Moors
                    amongst themselves; for such were the envy and jealousy which reigned amongst
                    the Portuguese, that they could never combine heartily in opposing the common
                    enemy; and therefore, had their enemies united against them, they must certainly
                    have been cut off. But whenever the scheriffs quarrelled with each other, one
                    party was sure to have recourse to the Portuguese, who, by sending them a small
                    supply, secured quiet to themselves, and had the pleasure of seeing their
                    enemies destroy one another. Yet in the end even this had bad consequences. For,
                    on the one hand, it kept up a martial spirit amongst the Moors, and on the other
                    it made them acquainted with the Portuguese discipline; so that after every
                    short interval of repose, they not only found them as much enemies as before,
                    but more formidable than ever. The consequence of all this was, that King John
                    began to apprehend that the conquest of Barbary was impossible, and therefore
                    limited his ambition to keeping those few fortresses which he had already
                    acquired; a necessary and prudent measure, which nevertheless displeased the
                    generality of his subjects.</p>
                <p>King John exerted himself greatly in the settlement of Brazil in South America,
                    which he brought into a good state, caused several strong towns to be erected
                    there, and took all possible methods to encourage the conversion of the natives
                    to Christianity. He also introduced many regulations for the welfare and
                    happiness of his subjects. The disputes of the nobility about precedency were
                    frequently attended with disagreeable consequences, which made the king resolve
                    to settle them definitively by established rules; and the principles established
                    by him on this occasion have subsisted ever since, and serve in a great measure
                    to prevent such altercations. He had also other designs in his mind,
                    particularly with regard to the reformation of religious persons of both sexes;
                    but, on a close examination of bis affairs, he found that b.is subjects in
                    general had been so much injured by his leaving their concerns to the inspection
                    of his council, that he was thrown by grief into a kind of apoplexy, from which
                    he never recovered. His death happened in June 1557; and he was succeeded by his
                    son Dorn Sebastian III. an infant of three years of age.</p>
                <p>After the death of King John, the administration remained in the hands of the
                    queen, grandmother of Sebastian, who behaved with great prudence and
                    circumspection. The Moors, however, supposing that under a minority they might
                    be able to dispossess the Christians of such places as they held in Barbary,
                    laid close siege to Masagan. But the queen regent speedily sent succours, and
                    promised such rewards to those who distinguished themselves, that the Moors,
                    although they brought eighty thousand men into the field, were obliged to
                    abandon the enterprise. This was at first magnified as a conspicuous instance of
                    the queen’s capacity and wisdom; but, in a short time, the natural aversion
                    which the Portuguese have to the government of women, together with the
                    prejudice they had conceived against her country, as being a Castillian,
                    appeared so plainly, and gave her so much uneasiness, thatof her own accord she
                    resigned her authority into the hands of Cardinal Dom Henry, the king’s brother.
                    Dorn Alexis de Moneses was now appointed the governor to the king, and Gonsales
                    de Gomera and two other priests his preceptors. By these instructors the king’s
                    education was totally marred. His governor assiduously inculcated upon his mind
                    that the chief virtue of a king was courage, and that danger was never to be
                    avoided, but always surmounted; whilst his other tutors, instead of instructing
                    him in the true religion, only inspired him with an abhorrence of professed
                    infidels. The consequence was, that he became rash, inconsiderate, and
                    obstinate, displaying all those qualities that conspired to draw upon him the
                    catastrophe which ruined both him and the kingdom.</p>
                <p>After the king had grown up to man’s estate, his desire was to distinguish
                    himself against the infidels. He himself intended to conduct an expedition to
                    the East Indies; but the prime minister Alcoçova, who did not choose to attend
                    his monarch to such a distance, substituted Africa in its stead. This expedition
                    the king entered into in the most inconsiderate and absurd manner. He first sent
                    for Dorn Antonio, prior of Crato, with some hundreds of soldiers; next he
                    carried his principal courtiers with him from a hunting match, and without
                    equipages; he then sent for the Duke of Avey-ro, who brought with him such
                    troops as he could collect on so short a warning; and when all these were
                    assembled, the king spent his time in hunting, and slight excursions against the
                    enemy, without doing any thing of consequence, except exposing his person upon
                    all occasions. At length he returned to Portugal in tempestuous weather, and his
                    unexpected arrival was celebrated with the greatest rejoicings.</p>
                <p>The trifling success which had attended the king in this expedition served only
                    to inflame him with a greater desire for another; and from the time of his
                    return he seemed to think on nothing else. He was highly delighted also with an
                    accident which furnished him with a pretence for war, of which, however, he
                    stood in no great need. Muley Harnet, king of Fez and Morocco, had been
                    dispossessed of his dominions by his uncle Muley Moloch. At the beginning of
                    this war Dorn Sebastian had offered him the Portuguese troops in Africa, a
                    tender which was rejected with contempt; but now being a fugitive, and having in
                    vain solicited assistance from Philip of Spain, Muley Hamet applied to the king
                    of Portugal; and, that, he might the more easily succeed, he , caused the
                    fortress of Arzila, which his father had recovered, to be restored to the
                    Portuguese. The king was in rapture at this event, and fancied that his glory
                    would exceed that of all his predecessors. He was, however, dissuaded against
                    engaging in this expedition by all his friends. Philip of Spain, having done
                    everything to dissuade him ata personal conference, sent Francisco Aldana, an
                    old and experienced officer, to Morocco; and, at his return, ordered him to
                    attend Dom Sebastian, in order to give him an account of the state of affairs in
                    that country. This he performed with the greatest fidelity, but without any
                    effect. The queendowager and the cardinal united in their endeavours to divert
                    him from this unfortunate enterprise; but he treated them both with so little
                    respect that his grandmother broke her heart; and the cardinal, to show his
                    distaste of the measure, retired to Evora without coming either to court or to
                    council, an example which was followed by many of the nobles. Many of these,
                    however, transmitted remonstrances <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538446"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8446-0467"/>to the king on the impropriety of his conduct; and
                    Philip sent to him the Duke de Medina Cell to lay before him once more the
                    reasons why he thought his scheme impracticable, and to put him in mind that he
                    had no hand in pushing him upon his destruction, or of concealing from him the
                    dangers into which he seemed determined to plunge himself and his subjects.
                    Lastly, he received a letter on the subject from Muley Moloch himself, in which
                    that prince explained to him his own right to the crown of Fez, and showed that
                    he had only dispossessed a tyrant and a murderer, who had therefore no rightto
                    his friendship or assistance. TheMoorish princenext assured him that he had no
                    reason to fear either the power or the neighbourhood of the Portuguese; and as a
                    proof of this, as well as a mark of his esteem, he was content to make him a
                    present of some ten miles of arable ground round each of the fortresses he
                    possessed in Africa, viz. Tangier, Ceuta, Masagan, and Arzila. At the same time,
                    he addressed himself to Philip king of Spain, with whom he was on good terms,
                    desiring him to interpose with his nephew Sebastian, that things might yet be
                    adjusted without the effusion of human blood. But the king of Portugal was deaf
                    to all salutary advice; and therefore paid no regard to this letter, nor to the
                    remonstrances of his uncle.</p>
                <p>On the 24th of June 1577, he set sail from the bar of Lisbon with a fleet of
                    fifty ships and five galleys, twelve pieces of cannon, and many transports and
                    tenders, making in all near a thousand sail. His troops consisted of nine
                    thousand Portuguese infantry; three thousand Germans; seven hundred Italians,
                    commanded by Sir Thomas Stukeley, an English exile, remarkable for his bravery;
                    two thousand Castillians and three hundred volunteers, commanded by Dorn
                    Christoval de Tuvara, master of the horse, a man of courage, but without either
                    conduct or experience. He touched first at Lagos Bay in the kingdom of Algarve,
                    where he remained for four days; and thence he proceeded to Cadiz, where he was
                    magnificently feasted for a week by the Duke de Medina Sidonia, who once more
                    endeavoured to dissuade him from proceeding further in person. But this
                    exhortation proved as fruitless as the rest; and the king having sailed with a
                    strong detachment for Tangier, ordered Doni Diego de Souza, the
                    commander-in-chief, to follow with the remainder of the army.</p>
                <p>The troops landed on the coast of Africa without any accident, and joined at
                    Arzila. Here the king was met by the Scheriff Mulcy Hamct, on whose account he
                    had undertaken the war, who delivered him his son Muley, a boy of twelve years
                    of age, as a hostage, and brought a reinforcement of three hundred Moors. The
                    boy was sent to Masagan under a strong guard; but the father remained in the
                    Portuguese camp. Here it was resolved in a council of war to reduce the town of
                    Larache, but it was disputed whether the troops should proceed thither by land
                    or by sea. Don Sebastian, who espoused the former opinion, finding himself
                    opposed by Muley Hamet, answered him so rudely that he leit his presence in
                    disgust; after which the king’s opinion prevailed, and the army began its march
                    on the 29th of July. As they proceeded, the king received a letter from the Duke
                    of Alba, requesting him to attempt nothing beyond the taking of the town of
                    Larachc. Along with the latter was sent an helmet which had been worn by Charles
                    V.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Muley Moloch, having received intelligence of this formidable
                    invasion, took the field with forty thousand foot and sixty thousand horse, and
                    conducted everything with the greatest prudence, notwithstanding he was so
                    enfeebled by fever that he could not sit upon horseback. Finding reason to
                    suspect that part of his army were desirous of going over to his rival, he
                    proclaimed that such as inclined to join their old master were at liberty to do
                    so. This at once put a stop to the defection, and only a few availed themselves
                    of the liberty which was granted them. Being likewise doubtful of the fidelity
                    of a body of three thousand horse, he sent them to reconnoitre the enemy, by
                    which act of confidence he secured them. Still, however, fearing that his
                    officers might be corrupted by Portuguese gold, he entirely changed the
                    disposition of his army, so that none of his officers commanded the corps to
                    which they had been accustomed, and having new men to deal with, had none in
                    whom they could confide.</p>
                <p>Having taken these precautions, he advanced against the Portuguese army with such
                    celerity that he came in sight of them on the 3d of August. On this Dorn
                    Sebastian called a council of war, in which many w ho out of complaisance had
                    dcclared for this march, were now for returning. They were separated from the
                    enemy by a river, but the Moors being masters of the ford, it was impossible to
                    force them immediately from their post; neither was it practicable for them to
                    wait for a more favourable opportunity, because they had no provisions. The
                    foreign officers, on the contrary, were of opinion that fighting had now become
                    necessary, and a retreat dangerous. This, however, was violently opposed by the
                    scheriff, who saw plainly that they ran a great risk of being defeated, and of
                    losing all, whilst, at the same time, they were not certain of gaining any thing
                    of consequence should they prove victorious; whereas, if they withdrew towards
                    the sea, they might entrench themselves till they were relieved by their fleet;
                    and during this interval, if Muley Moloch should die, he looked upon it as
                    certain that a great part of the army would desert to him, which would render
                    him master not only of the kingdom, but of the fate of the Christians also. When
                    he found that the king was bent upon fighting, he only requested that the
                    engagement might be delayed till four o’clock in the afternoon, that, in case of
                    a defeat, they might have some chance of escaping. But even in this he could not
                    prevail; for the king having disposed everything for a battle the next day, was
                    impatient to begin the onset as soon as it was light.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Mulcy Moloch was so sensible of the advantages of his
                    situation, that he was inclined to take the whole Portuguese army prisoners; but
                    finding his disease increase to such a degree that he had no hopes of recovery,
                    he came to the resolution to fight, that his antagonist might not avail himself
                    of his death. The disposition of the Christian army was, through the care of
                    some old officers in Don Sebastian’s service, regular and correct. The infantry
                    were disposed in three lines; the battalion of volunteers formed the vanguard;
                    the Germans, commanded by Colonel Amberg, and the Italians by Sir Thomas
                    Stukeley, were stationed on the right; the Castillian battalions occupied the
                    left, and the Portuguese were in the centre and rear; the cavalry, consisting of
                    about fiftecu hundred men, being partly on the right, under the command of the
                    Duke d’Avegro, to whom the scheriff joined himself with his horse. On the left
                    was the royal standard, with the rest of the cavalry, under the command of the
                    Duke of Barcelos, eldest son of the Duke of Braganza, Dem Antonio, prior of
                    Crato, and several other persons of rank. The king took post at first with the
                    volunteers. Mulcy Moloch also disposed his troops in three lines. The first
                    consisted of the Andalusian Moors, commanded by three officers who had
                    distinguished themselves in the wars of Granada; the second was composed of
                    renegadoes; and the third consisted of the natives of Africa. They were formed
                    in a crescent, with ten thousand horse on each wing, and the rest in the rear,
                    with orders to extend themselves in such a manner as to encompass the Christian
                    army. Muley Moloch, though extremely weak, was taken out of his litter, and set
                    on horseback, that he might see how his commands had been obeyed; and being
                    perfectly satisfied with the situation of his troops, he directed the signal of
                    battle to be given.</p>
                <p>The Christians advanced with the greatest resolution, broke the first line of the
                    Moorish infantry, and disordered the second. On this Muley Moloch drew his
                    sword, and would <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538459"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8459-0468"/>have advanced to encourage his troops; but his
                    guards prevented him, on which his emotion of mind became so great that he fell
                    from his horse. One of his guards caught him in his arms, and conveyed him to
                    his litter, where he immediately expired, having only time to lay his finger on
                    his lips by way of enjoining them to conceal his death. But by this time the
                    Moorish cavalry had wheeled quite round, and attacked the Christian army in the
                    rear; upon which the cavalry in the left wing made such a vigorous effort that
                    they broke the Portuguese on the right; and at this time the scheriff, in
                    passing a rivulet, was drowned. In this emergency, the Germans, Italians, and
                    Castillians, performed prodigies; but the Portuguese, according to their own
                    historians, behaved indifferently. Attacked on all sides, however, they were
                    unable to resist; and the whole army, except about fifty men, -were killed or
                    taken prisoners. The fate of the king is variously related. According to some,
                    he had two horses killed under him, and then mounted a third. His bravest
                    officers were killed in his defence; after which the Moors surrounding him,
                    seized his person, stripped him of his sword and arms, and secured him. They
                    immediately began to quarrel about the prisoner, upon which one of the generals
                    rodc in amongst them, crying, “What, you dogs, when God has given you so
                    glorious a victory, would you cut one another’s throats about a prisoner ?” At
                    the same time, discharging a blow at Sebastian, he brought the king to the
                    ground, when the rest of the Moors soon despatched him. Others affirm, that one
                    Louis de Brito meeting the king with the standard wrapped round him, Sebastian
                    cried out, “Hold it fast; let ns die upon it ;” upon which, charging the Moors,
                    he was seized, but rescued by Brito, who was himself taken with the standard and
                    carried to Fez. The latter affirmed, that after he was taken, he saw the king at
                    a distance, and ιmpursued. Dom Louis de Lima met him afterwards making towards
                    the river; and this is the last account of his being seen alive.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the battle, Mnley Hamet, the brother of Muley Moloch, was
                    proclaimed king by the Moors. The next day, having ordered all the prisoners to
                    be brought before him, the new sovereign gave orders to search for the body of
                    Dorn Sebastian. The king’s valet-de-chambre brought back a body, which he said
                    was that of his master, but so disfigured with wounds that it could not well be
                    known; and, notwithstanding the most diligent search, this monarch’s death could
                    never be properly authenticated. This body, however, was preserved by Muley
                    Hamet, who delivered it up as the body of the unfortunate Dom Sebastian to
                    Philip king of Spain. By the latter it was sent to Ceuta, thence transported to
                    Portugal, and buried amongst his ancestors in the monastery at Belem, with all
                    possible solemnity.</p>
                <p>By this disaster, the kingdom of Portugal, from being the most eminent, sunk at
                    once into the lowest rank of the European states. All the young nobility were
                    cut oft'or carried into slavery, and the kingdom was exhausted of men, money,
                    and reputation; so that Dom Henry, w ho assumed the government after the death
                    of his brother Dom Sebastian, found himself in a very disagreeable situation.
                    The transactions of his reign were trifling and unimportant; but after the death
                    of the king a great revolution took place. The crown of Portugal was claimed by
                    three different competitors, viz. the Prince of Parma, the Duchess of Braganza,
                    and Philip of Spain. Whatever might have been the merits of their respective
                    claims, the power of Philip quickly decided the contest in his favour. He found
                    his schemes facilitated by the treachery of the regents, who took the most
                    scandalous methods of putting the kingdom into his hands. Under pretence of
                    inspecting the magazines, they withdrew some of the powder, and mixed the rest
                    with sand; they appointed an agent to repair for succours to France, whence they
                    knew that they could not arrive in time; they dissolved the states as soon as
                    they discovered that they were bent upon maintaining the freedom of the nation;
                    and, under a show of confidence, they sent off to distant places such of the
                    nobility as they suspected.</p>
                <p>Philip finding everything in his favour, commanded the Duke of Alva to invade
                    Portugal at the head of twenty thousand men. The people, perceiving that they
                    were betrayed, exclaimed against the governors, and placed on the throne Don
                    Antonio, prior of Crato. But his forces being inexperienced, and his own conduct
                    indifferent, he was quickly defeated by the Duke of Alva, and forced to leave
                    the kingdom. On his flight the whole kingdom submitted, together with the
                    garrisons of Barbary, and also the settlements upon the coast of Africa, in
                    Brazil, and in the East Indies. The Madeiras, how ever, excepting the isle of St
                    Michael, held out for Don Antonio until they were reduced, and the French navy,
                    which came to their assistance, entirely defeated and destroyed.</p>
                <p>Philip made his entry into Lisbon as soon as the kingdom had been totally
                    reduced, and endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by
                    confirming the terms which he had before offered to the states. These terms
                    were, that he would take a solemn oath to maintain the privileges and liberties
                    of the people; that the states should be assembled within the realm, and nothing
                    proposed in any other states that related to Portugal; that the viceroy or chief
                    governor should be a native, unless the king should give that charge to one of
                    the royal family; that the household should be kept on the same footing; that
                    the post of first president, and all offices, civil, military, and judicial,
                    should be filled by Portuguese, all dignities in the church and in the orders of
                    knighthood confined to the same, the commerce of Ethiopia, Africa, and the
                    Indies, reserved also to them, and to be carried on only by their merchants and
                    vessels; that he would remit all imposts on ecclesiastical revenues; that he
                    would make no grant of any city, town, or jurisdiction royal, to any but
                    Portuguese; that estates resulting from forfeitures should not be united to the
                    domain, but go to the relations of the last possessor, or be given to other
                    Portuguese in recompense of services; that when the king came to Portugal, where
                    he should reside as much as possible, he should not take the houses of private
                    persons for his officers’ lodging, but keep to the custom of Portugal; that
                    wherever his majesty resided, he should have an ecclesiastic, a treasurer, a
                    chancellor, two masters of requests, with inferior officers, all of them
                    Portuguese, who should despatch everything relating to the kingdom; that
                    Portugal should ever continue a distinct kingdom, and its revenue be consumed
                    within itself; that all matters of justice should be decided within the realm;
                    that the Portuguese should be admitted to charges in the households of the king
                    and queen of Spain; that all duties on the frontiers should be taken away; and,
                    lastly, that Philip should give three hundred thousand ducats to redeem
                    prisoners, repair cities, and relieve the miseries which the plague and other
                    calamities had brought upon the people. All these conditions, formerly offered
                    and rejected by the Portuguese, the king now confirmed; but although the Duke of
                    Ossuna, by way of security, had promised them a law, that if the king did not
                    adhere to them, the states should be freed from their obedience, and might
                    defend their right by the sword, without incurring the reproach of perjury or
                    the guilt of treason, this he absolutely refused to ratify.</p>
                <p>All these concessions, however, failed to answer the purpose; nay, although
                    Philip was to the last degree lavish of honours and employments, the Portuguese
                    were still dissatisfied. This had also an effect which was not foreseen. It
                    weakened the power and absorbed the revenues of the crown; and, by putting it
                    out of the power of any of his successors to be liberal in the same proportion,
                    it raised only a short-lived gratitude in a few, and left a number of
                    malcontents, to which time was continually adding.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538472" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8472-0469"/>
                <p>Thus Philip, with all his policy and endeavours to please, found his new subjects
                    still more and more disgusted with his government, especially when they found
                    their king treating with the utmost severity all those who had supported Don
                    Antonio. The exiled prince, however, still styled himself, “king of Portugal.”
                    At first he retired to France, and there demanded succours for the recovery of
                    his dominions. Here he found so much countenance, that with a fleet of nearly
                    sixty sail, and a considerable body of troops on board, he made an attempt upon
                    Tcrceira, where his fleet was beaten by the Spaniards, and many prisoners being
                    taken, all the officers and gentlemen were beheaded, and a great number of
                    meaner people hanged. Dorn Antonio, however, kept possession of some places,
                    coined money, and performed many other acts of sovereign power; but he was at
                    length constrained to retire, which he did with some difficulty, and returning
                    into France, he passed thence into England, where he was well received; and many
                    fitted out privateers to cruize against the Spaniards under his commission. But
                    after Philip had ruined the naval power of Portugal as well as that of Spain, by
                    equipping the Armada, Queen Elizabeth made no difficulty of owning and assisting
                    Dorn Antonio, and even of sending Sir John Norris and Sir Francis Drake with a
                    strong fleet and a considerable army to restore him. Upon this occasion Don
                    Antonio sent his son Don Christoval a hostage to Muley Hamet, king of Fez and
                    Morocco, who was to lend him two hundred thousand ducats. But Philip prevented
                    this by surrendering Arzila; which, with the unseasonable enterprise against
                    Corunna, and the disputes that arose between Norris and Drake, rendered the
                    expedition abortive; so that, except carrying the plague into England, it was
                    attended with no consequences worthy of notice. Dorn Antonio remained some time
                    afterwards in England; but finding himself disregarded, he withdrew once more
                    into France, where he fell into great poverty and distress; and having at length
                    died in the sixty-fourth year of his age, his body was buried in the church of
                    the nuns of Ave Maria, with an inscription on his tomb, in which he is styled,
                    “king.” He left behind him several children, who, on account of his being a
                    knight of Malta, and having made a vow of chastity at his entrance into the
                    order, were looked upon as illegitimate.</p>
                <p>But Dorn Antonio was not the only pretender to the crown of Portugal. The people,
                    partly from love of their prince, and partly from their hatred to the
                    Castillians, were continually feeding themselves with the hopes that Dom
                    Sebastian would appear and deliver them; and in this respect such a spirit of
                    credulity reigned, that they would probably have taken a ncgro for Dorn
                    Sebastian. This humour induced the son of a tiler at Alcobaça, who had led a
                    profligate life, and at length turned hermit, to give himself out as that
                    prince; and having with him two companions, one of whom styled himself Dorn
                    Christoval de Tavora, and the other the bishop of Guarda, they began to collect
                    money, and were in a fair way of creating much disturbance. But the cardinal
                    archduke caused them to be apprehended, and after leading them ignominiously
                    through the streets of Lisbon, he who took the name of Sebastian was sent to the
                    galleys for life, and the pretended bishop was hanged. Not long afterwards,
                    Gonsalo Alvarez, the son of a mason, gave himself out as the same king, and
                    having promised marriage to the daughter of Pedro Alonso, a rich yeoman, whom he
                    created count of Torres Novas, he assembled a body of about eight hundred men,
                    and some blood was spilt before he was apprehended. At length, being clearly
                    proved to be an impostor, this person and his intended father-in-law were
                    publicly hanged and quartered at Lisbon. The punishment, however, instead of
                    extinguishing public credulity, served only to increase it.</p>
                <p>About twenty years after the fatal defeat of Sebastian, there appeared at Venice
                    a person who created much more trouble. He assumed the name of Don Sebastian,
                    and gave a very distinct account of the manner in which he had passed his time
                    since that defeat. He affirmed, that he had preserved his life and liberty by
                    hiding himself amongst the slain; that, after wandering in disguise for some
                    time in Africa, he returned with two of his friends into the kingdom of Algarve;
                    that he gave notice of this to the king Don Henry; that finding his life sought,
                    and being unwilling to disturb the peace of the kingdom, he returned again
                    amongst the Moors, and passed freely from one place to another in Barbary, in
                    the habit of a penitent; and that after this he became a hermit in Sicily, but
                    at length resolved to go to Rome, and discover himself to the pope. On the road
                    he was robbed by his domestics, and came almost naked to Venice, where he was
                    known and acknowledged by some Portuguese. Complaint, however, being made to the
                    senate, he was obliged to retire to Padua. But as the governor of that city also
                    ordered him to depart, he, not knowing what to do, returned to Venice, where, at
                    the request of the Spanish ambassador, who charged him not only with being an
                    impostor, but also with many black and atrocious crimes, he was seized, and
                    thrown into prison. He underwent, before a committee of noble and impartial
                    persons, twenty-eight examinations, in which he not only acquitted himself
                    clearly of all the crimes which had been laid to his charge, but entered into so
                    minute a detail of the transactions which had passed between himself and the
                    republic, that the commissioners were perfectly astonished; and, moved by the
                    firmness of his behaviour, his singular modesty, the sobriety of his life, his
                    exemplary piety, and his admirable patience under affliction, they showed no
                    disposition to declare him an impostor. The noise of this was diffused
                    throughout Europe, and the enemies of Spain endeavoured everywhere to give it
                    credit.</p>
                <p>The state, however, refused to discuss the point, whether lx was or was not an
                    impostor, unless they were requested so to do by some prince or state in
                    alliance with them. Upon this the Prince of Orange sent Dom Christoval, the son
                    of the late Dorn Antonio, to make that demand; and at his request an examination
                    was instituted with great solemnity. But no decision followed; only the senate
                    set him at liberty, and ordered him to depart from their dominions in three
                    days. By the advice of his friends, therefore, he proceeded to Padua in the
                    disguise of a monk, and from thence to Florence, where he was arrested by the
                    command of the grand duke, who delivered him up to the viceroy of Naples. He
                    remained several years prisoner in the castle Del Ovo, where he endured
                    incredible hardships. At length he was brought forth, led with infamy through
                    the streets of the city, and declared to be an impostor, who assumed the name of
                    Sebastian; at which words he said gravely, “And so I am.” In the same
                    proclamation it was affirmed that he was in truth a Calabrian; but as soon as he
                    heard this he said, “It is false.” He was next shipped on board a galley as a
                    slave, and carried to San Lucar, whence, after being for some time confined
                    there, he was transferred to a castle in the heart of Castille, and never heard
                    of more. Some persons were executed at Lisbon for their endeavours to raise an
                    insurrection in his behalf; but it was thought strange policy, or rather a
                    strange want of policy, in the Spaniards, to make this affair so public without
                    proofs; and the attempt to put down the objection, by affirming that he was a
                    magician, justly excited ridicule and contempt.</p>
                <p>The administration of affairs in Portugal, during the reign of Philip, was
                    certainly detrimental to the nation; and yet it does not appear that this
                    proceeded so much from any ill intention in that monarch, as from errors in
                    judgment. His prodigious preparations for the invasion of England impoverished
                    all his European dominions; but it absolutely exhausted Portugal. The
                    pretensions of Dom <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538485"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8485-0470"/>Antonio, and the hopes of despoiling their Indian
                    fleets, exposed the Portuguese to the resentment of the English, from which the
                    king wanted power to defend them. Their clamours were not the less loud for
                    their being in some measure without cause. The king, in order to pacify them,
                    borrowed money from the nobility upon the customs, which was the only remedy he
                    had left; and this was attended with fatal consequences. The branches, thus
                    mortgaged, became fixed and hereditary; so that the merchant was oppressed,
                    whilst the king in fact received nothing. This expedient failing, a tax of three
                    per centum was imposed, in the nature of ship-money, for the defence of the
                    coasts and the commerce of the country, and for some years it was properly
                    applied; but it then became a part of the ordinary revenue, and went into the
                    king’s exchequer without account. This made way for diverting other appropriated
                    branches; as, for instance, that for the repair of fortifications, the money
                    being strictly levied, whilst the works were suffered to decay and tumble down;
                    and also that for the maintenance of the conquests in Africa, by which the
                    garrisons mouldered away, and the places were lost. Upon the whole, in the space
                    of eighteen years, the nation was visibly impoverished; and yet the government
                    of Plulip was so incomparably preferable to that of his immediate successors,
                    that his death was justly regretted, and the Portuguese were taught by
                    experience to confess, that of bad masters he was the best.</p>
                <p>His son Philip, the second of Portugal and the third of Spain, sat twenty years
                    upon the throne before he paid a visit to Portugal, where the people put
                    themselves to a most enormous expense to receive him. He held an assembly of the
                    states, in which his son was sworn as his successor. Having done all that he
                    wanted for himself, he acquired a false idea of the riches of the nation, from
                    the immoderate and foolish display made during his stay at Lisbon; and having
                    shown himself little, and done less, he returned into Spain, where he acted the
                    part of a good king upon his death-bed, in deploring bitterly that he had never
                    thought of acting it before. The reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV. were
                    characterised by a series of bad measures, and worse fortune. All their
                    dominions suffered greatly; Portugal most of all. The loss of Ormus in the east,
                    and of Brazil in the west, together with the shipwreck of a fleet sent to escort
                    one of merchantmen from Goa, brought the nation incredibly low, and encouraged
                    the Conde Duke to hope that they might be entirely crushed. These are the heads
                    only of the transactions of forty years. To enter in any degree into
                    particulars, would only be to point out the breaches made by the Spanish
                    ministers in the conditions granted by Philip; which, with respect to the
                    nation, was the original contract and unalterable constitution of Portugal
                    whilst subject to the monarchs of Castille, but which notwithstanding, they
                    often flagrantly violated.</p>
                <p>The very basis and foundation of their privileges was, that the kingdom should
                    remain separate and independent, and consequently that Lisbon should continue as
                    much its capital as ever. But so little was this observed, that neither
                    promotion nor justice was to be obtained without journeys to Madrid, which was
                    not more the capital of Castillc than it was that of Portugal. The general
                    assembly of estates was to be held frequently, and they were only held thrice in
                    the space of sixty years; two of them being held within the first three years.
                    The king was to reside in this realm as often and as long as possible. Philip
                    I., however, was there but once; Philip II. resided only four months; and Philip
                    III. never at all. The household establishment was suppressed during all these
                    reigns. The viceroy was to be a native of Portugal, or a prince or princess of
                    the blood; yet when any of the royal family bore the title, the power was in
                    reality in the hands of a Spaniard. Thus, when the Princess of Mantua was
                    vice-queen, the Marquis de la Pue bla was sent to assist her in council, and she
                    could do nothing without his advice. The council of Portugal, which was to be
                    composed entirely of natives, was filled with Castillians, as the garrisons also
                    were, though the contrary had been provided. The presidents of provinces, or
                    corregidors, were to be natives; but, by keeping those offices in his own hands,
                    the king eluded this article. No city, town, or district, was to be given to any
                    except Portuguese; yet the Duke of Lerma had Beja, Scrpa, and other parts of the
                    demesnes of the crown, which were formerly appendages of the princes of the
                    blood. None but natives were capable of offices in the courts of justice, in the
                    revenue, in the fleet, or of holding any post civil or military; yet these were
                    given promiscuously to foreigners, or sold to the highest bidder, not excepting
                    the government of castles, cities, and provinces. The natives were so far from
                    having an equal chance in such cases, that no situations in the presidios were
                    ever given to them, and scarcely any in garrisons; and whenever it occurred, in
                    the case of a person of extraordinary merit, whose pretensions could not be
                    rejected, he was either removed, or not allowed to exercise his charge, as
                    happened to the Marquis of Marialva and others. The forms of proceeding, the
                    jurisdiction, the ministers, the secretaries, were all changed in the council of
                    Portugal, being reduced from five to three, then two, and at last to a single
                    person.</p>
                <p>By reason of these and many other grievances too tedious to be enumerated, the
                    detestation of the Spanish go- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> vernment became
                    universal; and in 1640 a revolution took place, in which John duke of Braganza
                    was declared king, by the title of John IV. This revolution, as being determined
                    by the almost unanimous voice of the nation, was attended with very little
                    effusion of blood; neither were all the efforts of the king of Spain able to
                    regain his authority. Several attempts, indeed, were made for this purpose. The
                    first battle was fought in the year 1644, between a Portuguese army of six
                    thousand foot and eleven hundred horse, and a Spanish army of nearly the same
                    number. The latter were entirely defeated; and this contributed greatly to
                    establish the affairs of Portugal on a firm basis. The king carried on a
                    defensive war during the remainder of his life; and after his death, which
                    happened in 1655, the war was renewed with great vigour.</p>
                <p>This was what the Spaniards did not expect; for they expressed an indecent joy at
                    his death, hoping that it would ∣ be followed by a dissolution of the
                    government. It would not, indeed, be easy to conceive a kingdom left in more
                    perilous circumstances than Portugal was at this time. The king, Dorn Alonso
                    Enriquez, was a child not more than thirteen years of age, reputed of unsound
                    constitution both of body and mind; the regency was in a woman, and that woman a
                    Castillian; the nation was involved in a war respecting the title to the crown;
                    and the nobility, some of them secretly disaffected to the rcigning family, were
                    almost all of them embarked in feuds and contentions with each other; so that
                    the queen scarcely knew whom to trust or how she should be obeyed. She acted,
                    however, with great vigour and prudence. By marrying her only daughter, the
                    Princess Catherine, to Charles II. king of Great Britain, she procured for
                    Portugal the protection of the English fleets, with reinforcements of some
                    thousands of horse and foot; and at last, in 1665, the war was terminated by the
                    glorious victory of Montesclaros. This decisive action broke the power of the
                    Spaniards, and fixed the fate of the kingdom, though not that of the king of
                    Portugal. Alonso was a prince whose education had been neglected in his youth,
                    who was devoted to vulgar amusements and mean company, and whom the queen for
                    these reasons wished to deprive of the crown, that she might place it on the
                    head of his younger brother Dorn Pedro. To accomplish this object, she attempted
                    every method of stern authority and secret artifice; but her endeavours of every
                    kind were vain. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538498"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8498-0471"/>Portuguese would not consent to set aside the
                    rights of primogeniture, and involve the kingdom in all the miseries attending a
                    disputed succession.</p>
                <p>But after the death of the queen-mother, the infant entered into cabals against
                    the king, of a much more dangerous nature than any that she had carried on.
                    Alonso had married the Princess of Nemours; but being impotent, and less
                    handsome than his brother, that lady transferred her affection to Dorn Pedro, to
                    whom she lent her assistance to hurl the king from the throne. Alonso was
                    compelled to sign a resignation of the kingdom; and his brother, after governing
                    a few months without any legal authority, was in a meeting of the states
                    unanimously proclaimed regent, and vested with all the powers of royalty. Soon
                    after this revolution, for snch it may be called, the marriage of the king and
                    queen was declared mdl by the chapter of Lisbon; and the regent, by a pontifical
                    dispensation, and with the consent of the states, immediately espoused the lady
                    who had been the wife of his brother. He governed, under the appellation of
                    regent, fifteen years, when, upon the death of the king, he mounted the throne
                    by the title of Dorn Pedro II.; and after a long reign, during which he
                    conducted the affairs of the kingdom with great prudence and vigour, he died on
                    the 9th of December 1706.</p>
                <p>Dom John V. succeeded his father; and though he was then little more tnan
                    seventeen years of age, he acted with such wisdom and resolution, adhered so
                    steadily to the grand alliance formed against France and Spain, and showed so
                    great resources in his own mind, that though he suffered severe losses during
                    the war, he obtained such terms of peace at Utrecht, that Portugal was in all
                    respects a gainer by the treaty. The two crowns of Spain and Portugal were not,
                    however, thoroughly reconciled until the year 1737; but from this period they
                    became every day more united, which gave much satisfaction to some courts, and
                    no umbrage to any. In this situation of things a treaty was concluded in 175Ó
                    with the court of Madrid, by which Nova Colonia, on the river Plata, was ceded
                    to his Catholic majesty, to the great regret of the Portuguese, as well on
                    account of the value of that settlement, as because they apprehended that their
                    possession of the Brazils would by this cession be rendered precarious. On the
                    last of July the same year, this monarch, worn out by infirmities, died in the
                    sixty-first year of his age, and the forty-fourth of his reign.</p>
                <p>lie was succeeded by his son Joseph I., who ascended the throne of Portugal under
                    very favourable circumstances; but his reign, although short, was marked by
                    great national calamities. The most remarkable event which occurred was the
                    memorable earthquake, which, in November 175.5, destroyed one half of the city
                    of Lisbon, and buried thirty thousand people under the ruins. Two hours had
                    scarcely elapsed after this terrible convulsion, when, to aggravate its horrors,
                    flames burst forth from different quarters of the city, and the conflagration
                    raging with terrific violence for three days, Lisbon was completely desolated.
                    The royal family were fortunate enough to escape; but amongst the victims were
                    the Spanish ambassador, and many other persons of distinction. Britain promptly
                    afforded relief to the sufferers; an act of generosity the more honourable to
                    her, as she had every reason to be dissatisfied with the conduct of the king of
                    Portugal. From the commencement of his reign, he had thrown great obstructions
                    in the way of our commerce, evading treaties, and imposing vexatious imposts;
                    and it seemed perfectly clear, that his object was to annihilate the commercial
                    intercourse which had for so many ages subsisted between the two countries. The
                    same spirit of humanity was evinced by Spain; but both nations received an
                    unworthy return, although Britain had most to complain of. The Spaniards were
                    only treated with silent ingratitude, but the English were detested as
                    heretics.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had the agitation which these great calamities gave rise to subsided,
                    wΙιen Portugal was again thrown into commotion by a pretended conspiracy against
                    the life of the king. No light has yet been thrown upon this dark transaction.
                    The leading parties involved in it, and the ultimate object which they aimed at,
                    are alike unknown. Suspicion fell on various classes of persons, particularly on
                    certain ecclesiastics, who were said to have been incensed at the reform
                    introduced by Dorn Joseph; on the creatures of Spain, who aspired to the reunion
                    of the two kingdoms under one seeptre; on the Jesuits, who were represented as
                    indignant at the restriction of their ancient privileges; and on a prince of the
                    royal family. All that is knowm with certainty is, that the seaftbld flowed with
                    noble blood; and that the Jesuits, against whom Pombal had artfully inflamed the
                    passions of the multitude, were stripped of their possessions, whilst their
                    expulsion was decreed by the crown. In fact, the members of the company of Jesus
                    were supposed to be at the bottom of every calamity; whether it was a
                    dispensation of Providence, or an act of human depravity. Even the earthquake
                    was boldly ascribed to them. Pombal had sworn their destruction, and the gross
                    ignorance of the people ministered to his vengeance. Another occurrence of this
                    reign was a rupture with the see of Rome, every servant of the pope being
                    expelled from Portugal, and all intercourse between the two courts suspended for
                    about two years. A more important event was the invasion of the country by
                    Spain. This aggression originated in the refusal of the king to join the
                    alliance of France and Spain against England. War was immediately declared
                    against him, and troops marched to the frontiers of his kingdom. The ally whom
                    he had so long neglected, and even deliberately ill used, was appealed to, and
                    not in vain. Troops, arms, and all necessary munitions of war, arrived from
                    Britain; and although the invaders succeeded in capturing Miranda, Braganza, and
                    Almeida, their triumphs were speedily put a stop to by the combined forces of
                    Britain and Portugal. At the instance of the British cabinet, the Count de Lippe
                    was brought from Germany to assume the command of the whole army. This commander
                    was ably assisted in his operations by General Burgoyne, and they had soon the
                    glory of freeing the country from the Spanish army. The consequence of this
                    triumph was a peace, solicited and obtained by the two hostile courts, now
                    hopless of success, and in apprehension of fresh disasters.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this king’s reign, extending from the year 1763 to 1777, was
                    occupied by the introduction of measures for social, agricultural, and
                    commercial improvement. He laboured to improve the police and judicial
                    administration, and not without success. He founded schools in the large towns,
                    and improved the system of study in the university of Coimbra. He encouraged
                    agriculture, the fisheries, and trade with the colonies; but in attempting to
                    give a stimulus to home manufactures, by laying such duties on articles of
                    British produce as amounted to an almost total exclusion of them from the
                    Portuguese market, he acted with equal short-sightedness and ingratitude. One
                    monument to his honour, more noble than the statue of bronze which his grateful
                    subjects erected to him in Lisbon during his life-time, remains to be mentioned.
                    This was a decree by which the grandsons of slaves, and all who should be born
                    after the date thereof, were declared free. Although this benefit was confined
                    to Portugal alone, yet, considering the state of matters at the time it was
                    conferred, it must be regarded as an amazing stride in the career of
                    improvement. Joseph I. died in 1777, and was mourned by his people as the best
                    monarch who had swayed the seeptre of Portugal smce the days of Philip I. It
                    must, however, be added, that the administration of Pombal threw a false
                    splendour on the reign of this monarch. In principle a freethinker, in
                    profession a reformer, and in character a cruel and cold∙blooded <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538511" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8511-0472"/>tyrant, this man was lauded
                    to the skies by the infidel philosophers of France, because he had expelled the
                    Jesuits from Portugal with every circumstance of barbarity and iniquity. But few
                    or none of his pretended reforms survived his fall, which was hailed with
                    satisfaction by the whole nation; and his name is now remembered only in
                    connection with some of the darkest and foulest deeds recorded in the historical
                    annals of Portugal.</p>
                <p>Joseph was succeeded by his daughter Maria, whom the necessities of state had
                    induced her father to give in marriage to his own brother. Such revolting
                    connections are unhappily far from rare in the modern history of Portugal. Some
                    attempts were made to exclude her in favour of a nephew,but they proved
                    completely abortive. Though the abilities of this queen were limited, yet she
                    was actuated by good intentions. Her administration was feeble, but upon the
                    whole beneficial. She followed the example of her father in encouraging national
                    industry and reforming the administration of justice. She founded the Academy of
                    Sciences, and introduced into the convents of friars a compulsory form of
                    education, embracing useful literature, philosophy, and the sciences. She
                    likewise endowed several admirable charitable institutions, and went so far in
                    judicial reform as to abolish the law of imprisonment for debt. In short, had
                    her foreign policy resembled her domestic administration, Portugal would have
                    had no reason to complain of her. Maria was forced into a family compact by her
                    powerful neighbours of France and Spain, by which the influence of the latter
                    was strengthened and confirmed, whilst in the same degree that of England was
                    weakened. This alliance was accompanied by a treaty of limits, which fixed the
                    boundarics of Brazil, Paraguay, and Peru, the arrangement being peculiarly
                    favourable to Spain.</p>
                <p>In the year 1792 the queen exhibited symptoms of mental alienation, and John
                    Maria Joseph, prince of Brazil, was appointed regent. One of the first acts of
                    his administration was a declaration of war against the French republic, a step
                    which he was induced to take from his connection with England. But commercial
                    distress, the accumulating debt of the country, and the menacing language which
                    France compelled Spain to adopt towards her neighbour, led to a peace in 1797.
                    In 1799 the malady of the queen appearing to be incurable, the prince was
                    confirmed in the regency, with full regal powers; but he made no change in the
                    policy of the government. The same year he was again encouraged to arm against
                    French aggression, in alliance with England and Russia; the victorious career of
                    the revolutionists having received a severe, although, as it proved, only a
                    temporary check. But the glory of the French arms was restored by the genius of
                    Napoleon. After this conqueror had fully confirmed his ascendency, Spain was
                    under the necessity of declaring war against Portugal in the year 1801; but it
                    was soon terminated by the treaty of Badajoz, in consequence of which Portugal
                    was compelled to cede Olivenza to Spain, and likewise to pay a considerable sum
                    of money. After this the prince enjoyed but a mere shadow of power, and at
                    considerable sacrifices maintained a nominal independence, until at la-t, in
                    1807, a hostile army under Marshal Junot invaded Portugal; and the house of
                    Braganza was declared by Napoleon to have forfeited the throne. This bold
                    declaration was owing to the prince having refused to seize the English property
                    in his dominions. Having embarked with his family for Brazil, the French general
                    immediately afterwards took possession of his capital, and Portugal sank into
                    the condition of an appendage of France.</p>
                <p>General Junot issued a proclamation, in which he declared that justice should be
                    duly administered, tranquillity preserved, and the future happiness of the
                    people solicitously guarded. But these professions were far from satisfying a
                    people of whom the lower classes were dying of absolute want, and two thirds of
                    the merchants were bankrupt. A British force under the Duke of Wellington (then
                    Sir Arthur Wellesley) was promptly despatched to Portugal, where it was joined
                    by a considerable body of national troops, now mustered in the northern
                    provinces, and determined to maintain the struggle for freedom. A junta was
                    immediately established in Oporto, to conduct the government. After some sharp
                    skirmishing between the two armies, the decisive battle of Vimicro,<note

                    power of France in Portugal. The convention of Cintra followed, and the country
                    was evacuated by the French troops. The immediate consequences of this
                    convention, which at the time was severely censured, were highly beneficial. The
                    government displayed an energy which restored subordination, and was felt all
                    over the kingdom. A levy <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse
                    of</hi> the whole male inhabitants, from fifteen to sixty years of age, was
                    demanded; but it does not appear that the call was responded to with much
                    alacrity. Towards the close of the year 1808, Madrid having surrendered, and the
                    British army under Sir John Moore having been compelled to retreat through the
                    mountains of Galicia to Corunna, the subjugation of Portugal was again resolved
                    upon by the French. The intelligence of the approaching invasion at first spread
                    consternation and dismay throughout Portugal, for it was in no condition to
                    offer any serious resistance to the force of the enemy that menaced the
                    frontiers. But fresh reinforcements arrived from Britain, and General Beresford,
                    who had been appointed commander-in-chief of the armies of Portugal, having
                    established a system of subordination and discipline amongst the troops,
                    confidence was in a great measure restored before a blow could be struck.</p>
                <p>Marshal Soult entered the kingdom of Portugal at the head of the French army,
                    after dispersing the Spanish force in Galicia. He was feebly opposed by the
                    Portuguese, who, however, displayed a laudable eagerness to fight. Their
                    commander, General Freyre, was opposed to a regular engagement; but his unruly
                    troops rose in mutiny, and massacred both him and his supporters, under the
                    suspicion of treachery. They were led against the enemy by Baron Eben, a German
                    in the British service, and the battle of Carvalho da Este was fought and lost.
                    Soult then invested Oporto, and although the city had been strongly fortified
                    and garrisoned, it was carried by assault on the 29th of March 1809, after a
                    feeble defence of only three days. Immediately on entering the town, the French
                    soldiery commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of the inhabitants; and although
                    their commander used every effort to repress their fury, the plunder and
                    licentiousness had continued a day and a night before subordination could be
                    restored. The defeat of the Spanish army at Medellin opened an easy road to
                    Lisbon; but the French force was divided into three separate bodies, under three
                    independent commanders, Soult, Victor, and Lapisse, though, from fear of being
                    separately committed, the whole remained inactive, or only engaged in
                    insignificant manoeuvres. Each commander appears to have waited for intelligence
                    as to the movements of the others, and by this delay the capital was saved. Such
                    was the situation of affairs when Sir Arthur Wellesley landed at Lisbon on the
                    23d of April, and assumed the chief command of the armies of England and
                    Portugal. By a series of brilliant manoeuvres, the British commander compelled
                    the French to abandon Portugal. But Napoleon being pledged to his people and the
                    world to conquer that country, early in 1810 an army of seventy-two thousand men
                    was assembled in the vicinity of Salamanca, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538524"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8524-0473"/>and the command of it intrusted to Marshal
                    Massena. After clearing his way to Portugal, by the capture of several
                    strongly-fortified places, the French general advanced upon Lisbon. But his
                    vigilant enemy had well employed the time afforded him, by preparing a secure
                    asylum for his troops, by which he at once kept his footing in the peninsula,
                    and defended Lisbon against a greatly superior force. This formidable defensive
                    position is celebrated in military annals by the name of the lines of Torres
                    Vedras. The advance of Massena, the battle of Busaco, the stand made at Torres
                    Vedras, the retreat of the French, and their final evacuation of Portugal, will
                    be found described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain.</hi> It is true,
                    that in the subsequent operations of the war, some parts of the kingdom were
                    included in the theatre of hostilities, yet they never extended much beyond the
                    frontiers. During the remainder of the war, however, the troops of Portugal bore
                    an active and creditable part in almost every encounter with the enemy.</p>
                <p>On the death of Maria, John VI. ascended the throne of Portugal and Brazil. The
                    establishment of the court of Lisbon in an American settlement, though
                    productive of little good to the mother country, led to important results. In
                    the first place, it induced Brazil to withdraw itself from dependence on
                    England; and, secondly, it paved the way for that colony erecting itself into a
                    separate state. But the influence of England in Portugal continued, and the
                    condition of the kingdom for the present remained essentially unchanged by the
                    transference. The peace of Paris, concluded in May 1814, which, it was believed,
                    would place everything on a proper basis, did not realize the expectations of
                    the nation. Spain evaded the restitution of Olivenza, which had been provided
                    for by the congress of Vienna; whilst, at the same time, Portugal was required
                    to restore French Guiana to France. The court of Rio therefore took possession
                    of the Banda Oriental; but an account of these transactions has been given in
                    another part of this work (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Brazil.)</hi> These
                    circumstances rendered the condition of Portugal far from tranquil. The country
                    felt that the order of things had been inverted, and the parent state had become
                    a dependent on her colony. A conspiracy of a very extensive nature was timeously
                    discovered in the army, and its progress checked; but the spirit which generated
                    it was not extinguished. In short, everything was ripening for a fundamental
                    change in the administration and constitution of government; and the Portuguese
                    people were soon afforded an opportunity of showing their dislike of the absence
                    of the court, and the predominance of English influence. The continual
                    bickerings between the commander of the forces and the regency induced Marshal
                    Beresford to repair to Rio de Janeiro, to obtain fresh instructions, and, it
                    might be, fresh powers, from the king; but during his absence that revolution
                    burst forth which completely changed the whole political aspect of the kingdom.
                    ,</p>
                <p>The first symptoms of this revolution were exhibited at Oporto on the 24th of
                    August 1820, both the citizens and the army acting in concert. The soldiers
                    swore fealty to the king, the cortes, and the constitution which might be
                    adopted, and the civil authorities declared in favour of the measure. A junta of
                    thirteen members was chosen by acclamation; and a declaration was addressed to
                    the nation,, stating, that the assembling of the cortes and the adoption of a
                    new constitution were the only means of saving the state. On the 15th of
                    September, the day on which it was usual to celebrate the deliverance of
                    Portugal from France, the regency in Lisbon, fearing to assemble such a
                    multitude of people as generally met on that day, resolved to omit the ceremony.
                    But the troops and the citizens met, and deposed the government; declared
                    for,the king, the cortes, and the constitution; and installed a temporary
                    council as a provisional government. Thus a complete revolution was effected,
                    without either violence or bloodshed. The provisional government formed a union
                    with the junta of Oporto on the 1st of October; and one of the earliest acts of
                    this united body was to despatch Count Palmella, the head of the royal regency,
                    to Brazil, with an account of the transactions which had just taken place, and a
                    petition that either the king or the prince royal would return to Europe and
                    assume the sovereignty of Portugal. In the mean while, dissensions of the most
                    inveterate description arose amongst the members of the two juntas. One party,
                    being eager for the immediate adoption of the constitution which had been given
                    to Spain, compelled the supreme junta to declare for, and oblige the troops to
                    take the oath of fealty to, that constitution. But the ascendency of this party
                    was of short duration, and ultimately it was agreed that, for the present, no
                    part of the Spanish constitution should be in force except that which related to
                    the mode of electing the cortes. I his was to choose one deputy for every thirty
                    thousand inhabitants. Clergymen, lawyers, and officers, were the sorts of
                    persons who were chiefly elected, few men of wealth or family being chosen. On
                    the 26th of January 1821, the cortes met, and named a regency and ministry,
                    declared the late insurrections legal and necessary, and abolished the
                    inquisition. On the 9th of March, the articles of the new constitution were
                    adopted almost unanimously. By these, freedom of person and property was
                    guaranteed, and the liberty of the press, legal equality, the abolition of
                    privileges, the admission of all citizens to all offices, and the sovereignty of
                    the nation, were secured. One chamber and a conditional royal veto were likewise
                    resolved upon.</p>
                <p>John VI. returned from America, leaving his eldest son, Dorn Pedro, viceroy or
                    regent of Brazil; but the aged monarch found, on his arrival in Europe, greater
                    troubles than those from which he had fled. He was under the necessity of
                    acceding to certain restrictions on his power, imposed by the cortes, before he
                    was permitted to disembark. On landing, he swore to observe the new
                    constitution, and concurred in all the succeeding acts of the cortes. To add to
                    his disquiet, Dom Pedro accepted the dignity of constitutional Emperor of
                    Brazil, in May 1822, and a complete separation took place between the two
                    countries. The constitution of Portugal was finally completed and sworn to by
                    the king on the 1st of October 1822; and, shortly afterwards, the session of
                    this extraordinary cortes closed. The members of the old cortes occupied several
                    months in reorganizing the different departments of the administration; but
                    measures were rapidly maturing for the total overthrow of the new order of
                    things. After several sanguinary engagements, the insurgents were driven from
                    the northern provinces into Spain, and a Portuguese regency was established at
                    Valladolid in May 1823. At the head of the plot for abolishing the new
                    constitution was the queen, a Spanish Infanta; and several of the nobility and
                    clergy were likewise engaged in it. Everything was now ripe for execution. Dorn
                    Miguel violated the promise which he had solemnly given to his father, by
                    becoming the leader of the counter-revolutionists, and inviting the nation to
                    rise under the royal standard against the anarchical policy of the cortes. The
                    greater part of the troops declared for the In-, fant, and John VI., yielding to
                    the force of circumstances, named a new ministry, and declared the constitution
                    of 1822 null and void. Sixty members of the cortes protested against this
                    proceeding; but the king, a mere puppet in the hands of his son, was borne along
                    by the force of the current, without being able to give any effectual check to
                    its course.</p>
                <p>The events which subsequently occurred in Portugal are still too recent to have
                    yet assumed their just historical proportions. The object of the queen and the
                    Infant was to induce the king to résumé absolute power; but John VI. firmly <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193538537" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8537-0474"/> declared his
                    resolution not to comply with this request. The counter-revolutionists, however,
                    began to act independently of his authority. The national guards and militia
                    were disarmed, a censorship of the press was established, many of the staunchest
                    constitutionalists were disposed of by imprisonment or expatriation, and the
                    highest offices were conferred on the absolutists. Finally, a junta, with
                    Palmella at its head, was organized, to draw up a constitution adapted to a
                    representative monarchy. The queen and the Infant, with their followers, exerted
                    their whole energies to prevent the establishment of a constitution. Palmella
                    and his coadjutors drew up a constitutional charter. By this act he rendered
                    himself obnoxious both to the queen and Dorn Miguel, as well as to the
                    absolutist party; and the king, probably more in compliance with their wishes
                    than from his own conviction that the plan was bad, rejected it. The intrigues
                    of the absolutists still continued. Dorn Migucl was appointed commander-in-chief
                    of the army, and, having obtained this office, determined at one blow to
                    extinguish all the hopes of the constitutionalists, and to put an end to the
                    system of moderation, according to which the king continued to act. Upon the
                    30th of April 1824, Miguel called the troops to arms, and issued proclamations,
                    in which he declared it as his intention to complete the work of the 27th May
                    1823, and to emancipate the king from the control of free-masons and others by
                    whom he was surrounded. The ministers and other civil officers, to the number of
                    one hundred persons, were on the same day put under arrest; but when the king
                    ascertained what had occurred, he declared that the whole had been done without
                    his orders. As an excuse for his conduct, the Infant said that he had taken
                    these steps for the purpose of frustrating a conspiracy which had been formed
                    against the king’s life. On the representations of the foreign ambassadors, the
                    individuals imprisoned were released; and on the 3d of May the king issued a
                    decree, commanding an immediate investigation of the pretended treason. He also
                    pardoned the Infant for his usurpation of the royal name; but this incorrigible
                    person still acted on his own authority, as if he were absolute sovereign,
                    continuing to arrest obnoxious or suspected individuals. John, finding himself
                    in danger of falling a victim to the intrigues of his son, contrived to escape
                    on board of an English vessel which lay in the Tagus. He deprived the Infant of
                    his command, and summoned him into his presence. The prince obeyed, and having
                    confessed his various delinquencies, received the royal pardon, with permission
                    to travel. The king returned on shore, proclaimed an act of amnesty in favour of
                    the adherents of the cortes of 1820, and, reviving the old constitution of the
                    estates, summoned the cortes of Lamego. A new junta was appointed to prepare a
                    constitution; but the convocation of the old cortes was resisted, and
                    conspiracies were formed against the king and his ministers. The latter were
                    themselves far from being unanimous, chiefly in regard to Brazil, so that a new
                    ministry was appointed in January 1825. Portugal and Brazil assumed a hostile
                    attitude, but atTength John VI. concluded a treaty with the emperor Dorn Pedro
                    I. of Brazil, in which he acknowledged the entire independence of that country,
                    and resigned the sovereignty of it to his son, reserving for himself only the
                    title of emperor. This good-natured monarch, who was incompetent to struggle
                    with the troubles of his age, and the political degeneracy of his nation, died
                    on the lOth of March 1826, having previously appointed his daughter Isabella
                    regent of Portugal.</p>
                <p>Isabella for a short time governed Portugal in the name of the emperor of Brazil,
                    Dorn Pedro, who was the legitimate successor to both the European and American
                    possessions of the house of Braganza. On the 23d of April 1826 he granted a
                    constitution to Portugal, which established two chambers, and in some other
                    respects resembled the French charter. Not long afterwards, he surrendered
                    Portugal to his daughter, Donna Maria, as an independent queen, on condition of
                    her marrying her uncle, Dorn Miguel. The prince at once agreed to this
                    arrangement, but, with his characteristic duplicity, resolved on evading its
                    conditions. The absolutists, of whom he was the recognised chief, were still
                    very strong in the country; and a party was formed, the very object of which was
                    to overthrow the constitution, and proclaim Dorn Miguel absolute king of
                    Portugal. The attempt was made, but it proved unsuccessful. A strong British
                    army was landed at Lisbon, and the country, thus-overawed, was in some measure
                    restored to tranquillity. Spain, which had secretly fomented the insurrection,
                    was now forced to yield. In July 1827, Dorn Miguel was appointed by his brother
                    lieutenant and regent of the kingdom. The prince immediately quitted Vienna and
                    returned to Portugal, taking Paris and London on his way. He was much caressed
                    whilst in England, and pledged himself to abide by the terms required by Pcdro.
                    He arrived in Lisbon on the 26th of February 1828, and immediately assumed the
                    administration of the government, at the same time taking the oath to maintain
                    the constitution. But oaths were in his eyes a mere formality of state,
                    involving no moral obligation. He assumed the sceptre as absolute king; changed
                    the ministry to make room for his tools; dissolved the chamber of deputies,
                    which was much too liberal for his view’s; altered the mode of election; and, in
                    short, restored the reign of absolutism. The recall of the British troops
                    removed another obstacle from his path. He convoked the ancient cortes of
                    Lamego, and was in a fair way of carrying everything before him. But the
                    military in general were unfavourable to his projects. The garrison of Oporto
                    declared for Dorn Pedro and the charter; other bodies of troops followed their
                    example; and a corps of six thousand men advanced towards the capital. But they
                    were defeated by a superior force, and the efforts of the constitutionalists
                    were for the present baffled.</p>
                <p>The object of Dorn Miguel -was now to consolidate his power, and get himself
                    proclaimed king. The cortes met, and all who were likely to oppose him having
                    been carefully consigned to dungeons, or driven into exile, this body
                    unanimously declared Dorn Miguel lawful king of Portugal and the two Algarves.
                    The pretext by which the cortes endeavoured to vindicate its conduct was, that
                    as Dorn Pedro had become a foreigner, he had neither a right to succeed himself,
                    nor to appoint a successor. On the 4th of July 1828, Dorn Miguel confirmed the
                    decree of the cortes, and assumed the title, as he had already done the powers,
                    of royalty. The punishment of those implicated in the Oporto insurrection
                    followed as a matter of course. An expedition was likewise sent against the
                    refractory islands, which had refused to acknowledge the usurper; and Madeira
                    and the Azores were, with one exception, reduced. The whole dominions of
                    Portugal now became a scene of terror, distrust, and misery, under the sway of
                    this hypocritical and merciless usurper.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, Donna Maria had set sail from Brazil for Europe; but on
                    arriving before Gibraltar, she found that, under actual circumstances, it would
                    be injudicious, if not dangerous, to land at Lisbon, and accordingly steered for
                    the English shores. She remained some time in London, and during her stay was
                    entertained as queen of Portugal. In August 1829 she returned to Brazil, in
                    which a revolution suddenly deprived her father of his American empire. ∙ Having
                    abdicated a crown which he could no longer retain, in favour of his infant son,
                    the ex-emperor sailed for Europe with his daughter, to assert her claims to the
                    throne of Portugal. Under the title of Duke of Braganza he was hospitably
                    received in England, and instantly set to work in making arrangements for
                    effecting the dethronement of Dom Miguel. The usurper still pursued the same
                    course of oppression, and, not content with confining and despoiling <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193538550" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8550-0475"/> his own
                    countrymen, he extended his outrages to British and French subjects. In the year
                    1830 it was calculated that forty thousand individuals were under arrest for
                    political causes alone; and that five thousand persons were concealed in
                    hiding-places in different parts of the country. How many had been devoted to
                    destruction by being sent to the fatal shores of Africa, and how many had
                    voluntarily exiled themselves, it is impossible to estimate. The British
                    government demanded redress for the acts of violence committed against its
                    subjects; and, on this being refused, a British fleet entered the Tagus, and
                    terrified the tyrant into compliance. France acted in a similar manner, and with
                    even more success; demanding an indemnity for the expenses incurred by the
                    expedition. Even'the United States despatched a fleet to Lisbon to obtain
                    satisfaction for injuries done to American commerce. But these repeated
                    humiliations wrought no change in the policy of Dorn Miguel. The petty
                    insurrections which frequently broke out were speedily suppressed by the vigour
                    of the government, or the want of concert in the insurgents; and hence these
                    ebullitions of popular indignation caused him little uneasiness. But his
                    finances were now falling into inextricable confusion. The revenue scarcely
                    sufficing for the household expenses and the maintenance of the troops, ths
                    usurper was driven to all manner of expedients to relieve his necessities. The
                    island of Tcrceira, one of the Azores, resisted his claims; and here a regency
                    was formally installed, with the Marquis of Palmella at its head. From this spot
                    Dorn Pedro issued a decree in favour of his daughter Donna Maria, at the same
                    time representing Dom Miguel in his true character, as a rebel and perjured
                    usurper.</p>
                <p>Although neither the government of France nor that of England gave open
                    assistance to Dorn Pedro, both abstained from opposing any obstacles to his
                    measures of recruiting. Many officers of each nation enlisted in his ranks; and
                    towards the end of December three hundred half-pay officers and volunteers
                    sailed for Belleisle on the coast of France, which had been fixed upon as the
                    place of rendezvous. The intelligence of these preparations, whilst it gave
                    encouragement to the constitutionalists, was productive of great alarm to Dorn
                    Miguel, who soon discovered that a considerable portion of his own army was not
                    to be trusted. Lisbon became the scene of anarchy, violence, and bloodshed. A
                    regiment of the line broke oùt into open mutiny, and, dividing itself into three
                    bodies, marched upon three different points, where other troops were stationed,
                    expecting to be joined by them. Butthey were sadly disappointed in this
                    expectation. Several bloody conflicts took place, and the insurrection was
                    ultimately suppressed. Many persons were shot for treason, and every dungeon and
                    fortress in the kingdom was filled with suspected persons. Meanwhile the island
                    of St Michael’s was captured by a force from Terceira, under Villa Flor, one of
                    the members of the regency. Afraid that Madeira would be the next object of
                    attack, Dorn Miguel sent a small armament for its defence; indeed a large one
                    could not well be spared at a time when the preparations of Dorn Pedro
                    threatened to bring the contest nearer home. This prince had prosecuted his
                    measures with great activity and perseverance; nevertheless, his means appeared
                    altogether inadequate for the conquest of a kingdom. His levies consisted of a
                    motley group of raw recruits, men of desperate fortunes or suspicious
                    characters, idle persons whose object was plunder, disbanded troops from Brazil,
                    Portuguese refugees, and the regiments which had so successfully maintained the
                    cause of the young queen in the Azores. But a kingdom was at stake, and Pedro
                    resolved to hazard a descent upon Portugal. The expedition sailed from the
                    island of St Michael on the 27th of June 1832. It consisted of two frigates,
                    three corvettes, three armed brigs, and four schooners, besides transports, and
                    a number of gun boats to cover the landing. An officer who held a commission in
                    the British army undertook the command of the naval department. He had been
                    deprived of his rank as a British officer, but became a Portuguese admiral. The
                    whole army on board did not amount to ten thousand men, scantily provided with
                    artillery, and still more scantily with cavalry.</p>
                <p>Dorn Miguel made every preparation in his power to repulse the threatened attack.
                    On the 8th of July Dorn Pedro appeared before Oporto, landed his troops, and
                    took possession of the town, without the loss of a single man. The advantages
                    likely to result from the capture of the second city in the kingdom need not be
                    pointed out, nor was Dorn Miguel ignorant of them. He acted with decision, and
                    immediately menaced Oporto from two points. On the 22d of July an action took
                    place, in which his troops were repulsed, and compelled to fall back; but, on
                    the other hand, Dorn Pedro was not in a condition to follow up the victory.
                    Another attempt in a different quarter was with more difficulty repelled; but
                    the most discouraging circumstance for the invaders was the utter disappointment
                    of the hopes they had entertained that the population of the country would rise
                    in their favour, and that the army of Dorn Miguel would desert its master.</p>
                <p>The operations of the naval squadron were attended with little success. Several
                    partial engagements took place between the fleet of Dorn Miguel and that <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the young queen under Sartorius; but no advantage was
                    gained on either side. Dorn Pedro had continued to fortify Oporto from the
                    period of his landing; whilst Miguel, with equal industry, was increasing his
                    army, the greater part of which lay on the north side of the Douro. On the 8th
                    of September the Miguclites made an attack upon Villa Nova, the suburb of
                    Oporto, which they carried; and the possession of this place enabled them to
                    harass the city with a constant fire both of musketry and artillery. An attempt
                    to recover this position utterly failed; but a convent which formed part of it
                    still held out against all the efforts of the Miguclites. The city began to be
                    seriously injured by the incessant fire which was kept up from Villa Nova, and
                    all attempts to dislodge the Miguelites from their position proved abortive. On
                    the 29th of September Dorn Miguel made a general assault upon the works with
                    which Oporto was surrounded; but, after manfully maintaining the contest for
                    seven hours, he was compelled to retreat to his former positions. The commanders
                    of Dorn Miguel now changed their tactics. Finding that it was impossible to
                    carry Oporto by storm, they determined to prevent all supplies from reaching the
                    city, by erecting batteries on the Douro, so as to command the bar and channel,
                    and thus prevent all vessels from approaching. They effected their purpose, and
                    Dorn Pedro found himself reduced to the greatest difficulties.</p>
                <p>The operations of 1833, like those of the precc'ding year, consisted in partial
                    bombardments across the river, or engagements of detachments, occasionally
                    varied by more regular attacks and sallies to destroy works already erected, or
                    prevent new ones from being raised. The casualties were nor great on either
                    side, nor was any permanent change effected in the relative situation of the
                    armies. Dorn Pedro began the year by placing at the head of his troops the
                    French general Solignac, whom he had created a marshal. A few months afterwards
                    he had a quarrel with his admiral, Sartorius, which for a time threatened
                    serious consequences; but the naval commander being ultimately removed, his
                    place was supplied by another British officer, Captain, now made Admiral Napier.
                    In a short time the latter inflicted a severe blow on Dorn Miguel, by the
                    capture of several of his largest vessels, in as gallant a style as any thing
                    recorded in naval history. In short, the fleet of the usurper was utterly
                    annihilated, and he had now only the land force to look to. Previously to this
                    achievement, a body of queen’s troops <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538563"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8563-0476"/>had landed at another point of the coast, and in a
                    few days the whole of the Algarves declared for Donna Maria. This small army,
                    under the command of Villa Flor, now Duke of Terceira, marched upon Lisbon, and
                    on the way completely routed a greatly superior force. The capital rvas deserted
                    by the garrison; the inhabitants rose <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse,</hi> and declared Donna Maria their lawful sovereign; and the Duke of
                    Terceira entering Lisbon in triumph, hoisted the queen’s colours on the citadel.
                    Dorn Pedro instantly set sail from Oporto to assume the government, and no
                    sooner had the intelligence reached France and England, than both immediately
                    acknowledged Donna Maria as queen of Portugal.</p>
                <p>Great preparations were made for the defence of Lisbon against the Miguelite
                    army, 18,000 strong, which, under Marshal Bonrmont, an experienced general, was
                    now advancing towards the capital. Several attacks were made on the defences
                    during the rest of the year 1833, but the results were unimportant. The
                    liberation of Lisbon led to the recovery of the Cape de Verd Islands, and
                    immediately afterwards Bonavista proclaimed the queen and the constitutional
                    charter. The political measures of Dom Pedro, after assuming the government at
                    Lisbon, were not looked on with a favourable eye. He confiscated the property of
                    all who had served under Dorn Miguel, and was guilty of some other arbitrary
                    acts, which did not tend to strengthen his cause.</p>
                <p>The affairs of Dorn Miguel now began to wear a very unpromising appearance. His
                    authority, indeed, was recognised over a large tract of country; but his navy,
                    which secured him reinforcements from abroad, was destroyed, and events had
                    taken place in Spain which prevented the government of that country from
                    affording him any assistance. The first military operation of importance which
                    took place in 1834 was the capture of Leiria, an important town between Lisbon
                    and Coimbra, which capitulated to the queen’s troops on the 18th of February. A
                    battle was lost by the Miguelites near Almoster, where Saldanha was posted; and
                    towns and provinces began to declare for the queen so rapidly, that the cause of
                    the usurper became desperate. He shut himself up at Santarem with a view of
                    keeping up his communications with the frontiers of Spain, whence he expected
                    aid. But from this very point destruction awaited him. It was a singular
                    eincidence, that in Spain as well as in Portugal, an infant queen was supporting
                    her cause by favouring popular privileges, with an uncle for her rival, as a
                    representative of more despotic principles of government. The cause of the two
                    queens being so far the same, a community of interest led to an alliance, to
                    which the courts of Britain and France became parties. Each was recognised as
                    lawful successor to the throne to which she aspired, and they both agreed to
                    employ their arms jointly against their two rivals. Don Carlos was compelled to
                    fly from Spain into Portugal, and thither he was pursued by a Spanish army,
                    which proved even more fatal to Dorn Miguel than to Don Carlos. The Miguelites,
                    seeing all hope lost, rapidly disbanded, and only the miserable remnant of an
                    army remained attached to the usurper. A suspension of arms was agreed to; and
                    on the 26th of May a convention was entered into, by which Miguel formally
                    consented to abandon the country. The terms granted him were, that he should
                    never again set foot either in Portugal or Spain, nor in any way concur in
                    disturbing these kingdoms; that he should leave the country within fifteen days;
                    that he should have a pension of about L.15,000, and be permitted to dispose of
                    his personal property, after restoring the crown jewels and other articles; and,
                    finally, that, by his command, the troops still adhering to his cause should
                    instantly lay down their arms, and the fortresses surrender to the queen. On the
                    2d of June he embarked for Genoa, where he had no sooner arrived than he issued
                    a declaration, declaring that he had acted under compulsion in relinquishing the
                    throne, and that the transaction was null and void.</p>
                <p>The civil war being thus terminated, and the authority of the queen acknowledged
                    all over the kingdom, an extraordinary eortes was assembled on the 14th of
                    August. Without the intervention of this assembly, however, the government had
                    previously adopted legislative measures of great moment. It had declared free
                    trade with all countries; fixed the duties on all foreign imports at fifteen per
                    cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> reduced all
                    religious houses and regular orders of monks, incorporating their estates with
                    the national domains; changed the state of the currency, and abolished paper
                    money; and made various other sweeping alterations. The measures were well
                    meant, but they were harsh and despotic notwithstanding. After the meeting of
                    eortes, one of the first proceedings of the legislature was to consider how the
                    executive power should be exercised during the minority of the queen. The
                    regency was ultimately conferred on Dorn Pedro, but he did not long enjoy it. He
                    expired on the 22d of September 1834, having, during the latter years of his
                    life, acted a part which the earlier stages of bis career gave the world little
                    reason to expect. Previously to this, the queen had set about the formation of a
                    new ministry, in which she united some of the more moderate constitutionalists
                    with the former ministers. Her marriage with the Duke of Leuchtenberg, the son
                    of Eugene Beauharnois, and the brother of Dorn Pedro’s wife, was soon afterwards
                    resolved upon. A bill to exclude Dorn Miguel and his descendants from the throne
                    of Portugal was passed without one dissentient voice. The budget for the year
                    1834 showed a considerable deficit, and this forrhed an excuse for treating the
                    British auxiliaries, to whom they owed so much, with the most shameful and
                    disgusting ingratitude.</p>
                <p>During the year 1835, Portugal presented a peaceful and even prosperous picture,
                    darkened a little by the intrigues of political parties. The principal object of
                    the cortes was to reduce the public debt, or to convert it into securities which
                    should bear a lower rate of interest than that then paid. The fund which was
                    principally looked to for accomplishing this object was the national property,
                    and measures were adopted for effecting sales thereof. The budget for the year
                    ending 30th June 1836 stated the expected receipts at 8,420,257,408 milreis, and
                    the expenditure at 12,744,161,266, being a revenue of about L.2,200,000, and an
                    expenditure of more than L∙3,000,000. No new taxes were, however, imposed to
                    cover the deficit, because it was expected that the expenditure would decrease,
                    whilst the receipts would remain stationary or rise.</p>
                <p>Prince Augustus of Leuehtenberg, the husband of the young queen, having arrived
                    in Portugal in the beginning of the year 1835, was appointed commander-in-chief
                    of the Portuguese army, a nomination which gave rise to much contention. But
                    death soon cut short the discussion, for the young prince expired on the 28th of
                    March. The chambers, however, did not allow the queen to indulge long in the
                    sorrows of widowhood. The constitutional system depended greatly on a direct
                    succession to the throne, and before the end of the year the queen’s second
                    marriage was arranged. The bridegroom was selected from the house of
                    Saxe-Cobourg (a great nursery for the supply of such wants), and he had the
                    honour to be a nephew of the king of the Belgians.</p>
                <p>On the 8th of April 1836, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Cobourg arrived at Lisbon, and
                    on the following day was formally united to his royal spouse. Government now
                    became extremely annoyed by the question, whether the king should be appointed
                    to the command of the army, when it turned out that this was one of the special
                    conditions of the marriage treaty. The proceeding proved very unpopular, not
                    only with politicians, but the country, and materially <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538576" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8576-0477"/>hastened a revolution, in
                    which the ministry and the constitution were shipwrecked together. It does not
                    appear, however, that the government anticipated any serious changes, as the
                    country exhibited no dangerous symptoms of discontent, although a good deal
                    irritated by the appointment which the queen had made. Yet the revolutionary
                    plot must have been arranged beforehand, for even the troops of the line were
                    seduced. On the night of the 9th of September 1836, the drums of the national
                    guards beat to arms, and they were soon joined by the garrisons and many
                    influential civilians. An address to the queen was drawn up, requesting her
                    majesty forthwith to dismiss the ministry, to annul the charter, and to proclaim
                    the constitution of 1820. The queen at first hesitated to yield to force, and to
                    recognise statements as to the alleged jeopardy to which the nation was exposed;
                    but she was ultimately compelled to give way. The political constitution of the
                    23d of September 1822 was declared to be in vigour: but it was at the same time
                    agreed that it should undergo such modifications as circumstances had rendered
                    necessary. A new ministry was immediately appointed, and Prince Ferdinand was
                    deprived of his military commission. But neither the great body of the people
                    nor the more influential classes showed any indications of accordance with the
                    remodellers of government. Almost all the nobility, the superior clergy, and an
                    immense number of persons holding official situations of greater or of less
                    importance, refused peremptorily to take the oaths to the new constitution. The
                    peers, whose existence as a separate legislative assembly was thus abolished,
                    protested to the queen against the measure, and called for vengeance on those
                    who had compelled her majesty to declare it in force. But this only served to
                    irritate the revolutionists. Not long afterwards a counter-revolution was
                    attempted. Commenced without any well-concerted plan, it was prosecuted without
                    energy, and the results were altogether unimportant. At last negotiations being
                    entered into between the queen and the rebels, it was proposed by the court,
                    first, that the general cortes should be immediately convoked, but that the
                    members should be furnished with special powers to make such alterations in the
                    charter of 1820 as were deemed necessary to secure the liberties of the nation
                    and the prerogatives of the crown; and, secondly, that the Chamber of Peers, as
                    it was instituted before the revolution of the 10th of September, should vote
                    upon these alterations, with the exception of those which might relate to the
                    organization of the chambers. To the latter proposition the rebels refused their
                    assent. They likewise demanded of the queen to dismiss her ministers, and form a
                    new cabinet; and she was under the necessity of complying with their demands.
                    Her majesty, indeed, became partially a prisoner in the hands of the democrats,
                    and many of the most distinguished persons of her court sought refuge in
                    voluntary exile.</p>
                <p>The principal events which followed these changes were, the economising of the
                    expenditure, the imposition of a tax for the support of the priesthood, the
                    introduction of a uniform system of duties on vessels sailing from Portuguese
                    harbours, the abolition of the slave-trade, and other measures of more or less
                    moment, which had for their object the pacification of the country and the
                    promotion of the general welfare. During the years 1837 and 1838, some provinces
                    of Portugal were kept in constant terror, and, to a certain extent, ravaged by
                    rebel banditti, whose ostensible object was to excite a rising in favour of Dorn
                    Miguel. The most noted of these guerilla chiefs was Re-mcchido, who contrived to
                    muster a formidable gang, and, by his daring exploits, to spread dismay
                    throughout Algarve, the scene of his depredations. A military force was at
                    length sent against him, by which the rebels were completely routed on the 28th
                    of July 1838, and their leader, being taken prisoner, unceremoniously shot.</p>
                <p>STATISTICS.</p>
                <p>Portugal, the most westerly kingdom of Europe, lies between 36° 55' and 42° 13'
                    of north latitude, and between 6 ’ 15'and 8° 55' of longitude west from
                    Greenwich. According to the geographer Ebeling, its length from north to south
                    is 301 geographical miles, and its breadth from east to west is 128 miles. It is
                    bounded on the north and east by the Spanish provinces of Galicia, Valladolid,
                    Salamanca, Estremadura, and Seville, and on the south and west by the Atlantic
                    Ocean. It has the figure of a parallelogram, with its longest side from north to
                    south.</p>
                <p>Portugal has a coast-line of nearly five hundred miles in length, the only
                    province not washed by the ocean being Tras-os-Montes, and Alemtejo is less so
                    than the remaining four. On the north the coast is low at first, but it
                    afterwards becomes rugged and steep. In Beira it again gets flat, sandy, and
                    marshy; in Estremadura it is in one part steep, and in another almost a dead
                    level, and very insecure; in Alcmtejo it is low, being full of rocks and
                    shallows; and although at Cape St Vincent it is high and rocky, as we proceed
                    towards the Spanish frontier the country sinks into low sandy downs. The
                    promontories most worthy of notice are, Mondego in Beira; Carvoeiro de Rocha and
                    Espichel in Estremadura; and San Vincente, Carvoeiro, and Santa Maria, in
                    Algarve. On the low coasts there are inlets of the sea, which afford
                    opportunities for the formation of a number of excellent harbours.</p>
                <p>Portugal is only separated from Spain politically, not by natural boundaries or
                    peculiarities. Hence, in all its physical relations it is to be considered as a
                    westerly continuation of that country. The principal chains of mountains are
                    prolongations of those which traverse Spain. In the north, between the Minho and
                    Douro, the country is intersected in various directions by the southerly and
                    westerly procession of the Galician and Asturian mountain ranges, which
                    terminate at. the sea in a steep and broken coast. The provinces situated in
                    this quarter are alternating mountain and high table-land, a continuation of the
                    lofty table-land of Old Castille and Leon. The Serra de Montezinho, near the
                    northern frontier, is a very lofty range, on the summits of which snow not
                    unfrequently remains during the tvhole year. The lofty peak of Gaviarra,
                    however, which forms part of the Serra de Suazo, is crowned with perpetual snow.
                    This range runs parallel with the river Lima to the sea, where it terminates
                    under the name of the Serra de Estrica. On the left bank of the Lima extends the
                    Serra de Gerez, in the province of Entre Minho e Douro, and, passing into
                    Tras-os-Montes, declines towards the Lower Douro, where it bears the name of the
                    Serra de San Catarina. In this last-named province is the Serra de Amarao, on
                    the left bank of the Tamega, and stretching down almost to the Douro. To the
                    east of it is the plateau of Guarda, between two and three thousand feet in
                    height, and which on the north-east is bounded by the Serra de Montezinho. In
                    the province of Beira extends the Serra de Estrella, a continuation of a chain
                    which traverses Leon and Castille. This mountain ridge consists of granite and
                    layers of sandstone. It presents a shattered and savage aspect, is covered with
                    snow during the greater portion of the year, and in its ramifications encloses
                    the river Mondego∙ Its highest summits are those of Cantaro Delgado and the
                    Malao dà Serra. Northwards it declines gently towards the Vouga, and stretches
                    in a westerly direction to the gates of Coimbra under the name of the Serra de
                    Alcoba. The southerly branch runs through the province of Estremadura, to the
                    mouth of the Tagus, forming the granite mountains of Cintra, which terminate in
                    the sea at the Cabo de Roca. To the south of the mouth of the Tagus stretches
                    the Serra de Arabida, an inferior range. Between the Tagus and the Guadiana the
                    country is elevat¾ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538589"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8589-0478"/>ed, but, gradually sinking towards the Spanish
                    province of Estremadura, is bounded on the south by a continuation of the Sierra
                    Morena of Spain, which mountain chain is here penetrated by the river Guadiana.
                    The Serra de Caldeirao, which afterwards bears the name of the Serra de
                    Monchique, a ramification of the gigantic Morena, extends in a westerly
                    direction to the sea, where it terminates in Cape St Vincent, and completely
                    encloses Algarve. This serra only yields in height to that of Estrella, and to
                    those of Suazo and Montezinho. Its loftiest peaks are Foya and Picoa.</p>
                <p>Portugal is therefore a mountainous country throughout, but its profusion of
                    hills and mountains embosom innumerable beautiful and highly-cultivated valleys,
                    and form several fine tracts of table-land. There are, however, two plains of
                    some extent; one to the south of the Tagus, of which that of Santarem forms a
                    continuation, and one on the mouth of the Vouga.</p>
                <p>Portugal receives its principal rivers from Spain. The largest are the Tagus, the
                    Guadiana, the Douro, the Lima, and the Minho. The Tagus originates in the Sierra
                    d’Al-baracin, on the borders of Cuença and Aragon, flows at first in a northerly
                    direction, and then turns to the south, but during the most part of its course
                    its general bearing is westerly. After traversing several Spanish provinces, it
                    enters the Portuguese territory near the point where it receives the Sever,
                    separates the provinces of Beira and Alcmtejo, and after dividing Portuguese
                    Estremadura into two unequal parts, falls into the Atlantic. It receives the
                    waters collected between two parallel ranges of mountains, flows through a
                    mountainous country, and its current is much broken by rocks and cataracts. Its
                    waters are turbid, and annually overflow and fertilize the extensive plains in
                    the environs of Santarem and Villa Franca. Lower down it forms many marshes of
                    considerable extent, which yield a large revenue. The length of its course is
                    four hundred and fifty miles. It is affected by the tide a considerable distance
                    above Lisbon, but is only navigable to Abrantes. Its width is so great near its
                    mouth as to make it resemble a vast lake or arm of the sea; and at Lisbon it
                    forms one of the finest and safest harbours in the world. The tributaries which
                    it receives on the north are the Elga, the Pon« sal, and the Zezere; and those
                    from the south are the Sever, the Sorraya, erroneously called Zatas in most
                    maps, and the Canha; but none of these are navigable. The rivers worthy of
                    notice which have their source in Portugal are the Cavado, Ave, Vouga, Mondego,
                    Saado, Odemira, Portimao, and Rio Quarteira. The Cavado rises in the Serra de
                    Gerez, and after traversing the province of Minho, discharges itself near
                    Es-posenda, being only navigable for seven miles. The Vouga has its source in
                    Beira, and after traversing this province, enters the ocean below Aveira. The
                    Mōndego issues in the Estrella, crosses Beira and the plains of Coimbra, and
                    finally joins the ocean near Figueira and Buareos. This is the largest of the
                    rivers belonging exclusively to Portugal, and it is navigable for sixty miles,
                    except in summer, when its waters considerably diminish. Its sands occasionally
                    yield particles of gold. The Saado or Sadao has its source in Alemtejo in the
                    Serra de Monchique, and flows with a north-westerly course towards Estremadura.
                    It becomes navigable from Porto de Rey, and enters the ocean by a large bay to
                    the south of Setubal. The same Serra gives rise to the Odemeira and Portimao,
                    the former being navigable to the town of the same name, and the latter as far
                    up as Silves. The Rio Quarteira has its source in the Serra de Caldeirao, and
                    forms at its mouth the small port which bears its name. These rivers, when
                    swollen by the winter rains, overflow their banks, much to the advantage of the
                    country, for the waters leave a rich deposit behind them. In summer they are
                    very low, and many of the smaller rivers of Portugal are dried up during that
                    season. They are in general much obstructed by rocks and bars of sand at their
                    mouths, by which navigation is greatly impeded.</p>
                <p>Portugal possesses no navigable canals worthy of notice. On the coast, especially
                    in Alemtejo and Beira, there are morasses, lakes, and inferior inland seas, none
                    of them being of great circumference. Several mountain lakes on the Serra de
                    Estrella are tepid, throwing up bubbles, without, however, materially troubling
                    the waters, which are of crystal clearness. Portugal is rich in medicinal
                    springs, some of which are used for baths. They consist of gaseous and saline
                    mineral waters, and of sulphureous and chalybeate springs. The most celebrated
                    sulphur and warm baths are the Caldas de Gerez in Minho, the Rainha and the
                    Oeiras in Estremadura, those of Chaves and Anciaes in Tras-os-Montes, of San
                    Pedro do Sul and Penagarcia in Beira, and of Monchique in Algarve. The best
                    chalybeates are at Torro de Moncorvo in Tras-os-Montes, those of Amaranha and
                    Guimaraens in Minho, and of Villas in Estremadura.</p>
                <p>Granite composes the highest mountains of Portugal. The entire province of Minho,
                    and the northern portion of Tras-os-Montes, are formed of it; and, besides, it
                    is found in many other parts of the kingdom. Schistus rock, lying over the
                    granite, also covers a large portion of the country. It forms the frontier
                    mountains of Algarve, those of moderate height in Alemtejo, those of Beira in
                    the environs of Castello Branco, and the chain which accompanies the course of
                    the Douro. The primitive calcareous formation forms a continuation of the
                    mountains between Lisbon and Coimbra, as the Serra de Lousaa, Porto de Moz, and
                    Monte Junto, with the Serra de Arrabida, and the mountain chain which reaches to
                    Algarve. Coal is met with in this formation near Buareos, mineral coal at Cape
                    Espichel, and sandstone is sometimes found covering it. The rocks near Lisbon
                    and at Cape St Vincent are of the tertiary formation, more or less mingled with
                    trap. When the granitic rocks blend with schistus, it is by layers; and it is
                    connected with the latter by a stratification, resembling micaceous schistus.
                    The calcareous structure is changed in Tras-os-Montes into a true micaceous
                    schistus; and it is only here that mountains of the latter are seen in a pure
                    state.</p>
                <p>Tin mines appear to have been wrought by the Carthaginians in this part of the
                    peninsula; and it is affirmed that mines of tin-stone existed in some granitic
                    mountains of Beira. Mines of gold and silver were wrought in this country by the
                    Romans. During the last century lead ores were worked near Mogadouro, in
                    Tras-os∙ Montes, and in the vicinity of Longroiva, on the banks of the Rio
                    Prisco. In Tras-os-Montes a silver-mine was wrought in the year 1628. Mines of
                    plumbago occur near Mogadouro, and iron-mines in the same country, near Figueira
                    and Torre de Moncorvo. The iron forge of Chapacunha is supplied from them. In
                    Estremadura there are two very old establishments of the same kind, one in the
                    district of Thomar, and the other in that of Figuero dos Vinhos. On the frontier
                    of that province, and of its neighbour Beira, are situated the mines of red
                    oxyde of iron by which they are supplied. Iron indeed is one of the most
                    abundant minerals in the country. The mountains in the neighbourhood of Oporto
                    everywhere give indications of copper and other ores; and at Couna there is a
                    deposit of cinnabar. In Portugal there are also mines of antimony, bismuth, and
                    arsenic. Some of the rivers of this country, as well as those of Spain, arc
                    washed for the gold which they contain; and it is said that in this way large
                    quantities of the precious metal were formerly collected. The river Tagus was
                    anciently celebrated for the particles of gold which were found mingled with its
                    sands; but its greatest riches are now borne on its bosom. Indeed, none of the
                    streams yields a quantity worth much above the labour of collecting it. There is
                    only one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538602" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8602-0479"
                    />gold-mine in Portugal, situated in a place called Adissa, in the district of
                    St Ubes; but its annual produce is a mere trifle, not reaching twenty pounds
                    weight at an average. Two coal-mines exist; one near Figueira, and the other
                    near Oporto. The country abounds with most beautiful marbles, but they are
                    comparatively little wrought, from the expenses required to bring them to
                    market. Precious stones are found in Portugal, and also quarries of limestone,
                    gypsum, slate, freestone, millstone, black agate, together with immense beds of
                    pyrites and marcasites, potters’ and porcelain clay, and pits of common
                    salt.</p>
                <p>Various causes conspire to produce great differences in the climate of Portugal
                    in different situations. The most obvious one is the inequality of the soil; but
                    vicinity to the ocean, and to mountain ranges, which afford shelter from the
                    winds, or expose to the direct influence of the sun, also greatly affect the
                    temperature. The mountain chains in the northern part of the country are very
                    rugged and cold, the limits of perpetual snow being in this latitude under eight
                    thousand feet. This cold region comprises a considerable portion of the
                    provinces of Tras-os-Montes and Beira, and the whole of the northern frontiers
                    of Minho. It is to be observed as a general rule, that the sea-coast of these
                    provinces, as well as that of all the others, is very warm, the heat of summer,
                    however, being tempered by the sea-breezes. The elevated plains and mountains
                    are sterile, and destitute of wood; but the valleys and other low situations
                    have a mild and agreeable climate, and arc for the most part very fruitful. A
                    great part of Minho is especially deserving of notice for its delightful
                    climate. Estremadura, on the other hand, is very hot in summer and very cold in
                    winter; but the high land throughout the whole southern portion of Portugal has
                    an exceedingly agreeable temperature, equally removed from excessive heat in
                    summer and severe cold in winter. Algarve alone has an African climate, but the
                    excessive heat is greatly tempered by the seabreezes. Some striking anomalies
                    occur, such as intense summer heats in elevated situations; but they are to be
                    accounted for from the position and nature of the mountain ranges which environ
                    them, and their distance from the ocean. The warmer parts of Portugal have a
                    short winter and a double spring. The first, which commences in February, is a
                    delightful season. The succeeding months are variable, being in some years hot
                    and dry, and in others cold and rainy. Harvest is gathered in June. Summer
                    commences in the last week of July, and continues till the beginning of
                    September. The heat is then very great, parching up all the vegetation on the
                    plains and sea-coast, so that it is necessary to water plants to preserve them
                    from destruction. But even during this hot season the evenings and nights are
                    fresh and cool, and the table-lands and other elevated parts enjoy a
                    modification of temperature. Rain begins to fall early in October, and the
                    vegetation of spring immediately succeeds to that of autumn. Winter lasts from
                    the end of November till February, but the cold is seldom excessive, except in
                    very elevated situations. In December heavy rains descend, accompanied by
                    violent whirlwinds; it is during this period that the rivers are so liable to
                    overflow their banks. The climate of Portugal, in general, may be pronounced
                    salubrious, particularly along the coasts and on the table-lands. Fevers of
                    various kinds appear to be the diseases most prevalent, but there are disorders
                    peculiar to different localities. Almost all the mountain chains of Portugal
                    show, in extinct and shattered craters, their former volcanic activity; and in
                    many districts, in the country around Lisbon for instance, earthquakes are not
                    unfrequently felt in harvest and winter. The fearful convulsion which destroyed
                    the capital has already been mentioned in the preceding historical sketch.
                    Portugal is rarely visited by violent storms, and thunder is only heard during
                    autumn and</p>
                <p>From the great differences of level which Portugal presents, it abounds in every
                    variety of vegetable productions. Forests of birch, oak, and chestnut are
                    abundant; and fruit is everywhere plentiful. Orchards are met with at the foot
                    of large mountain chains; and lower down may be found the cork-tree, kermes,
                    fir, lemon, and orange. The olive is widely distributed, and the vine is
                    cultivated to a great extent. In the warmest regions we find the aloe of America
                    and the date of Africa. Figs, raisins, almonds, melons, watermelons, plums,
                    cherries, peaches, apples, pears, and chestnuts, are all objects of attention.
                    Of grains, those chiefly raised are maize, barley, wheat, and rye; rice is
                    likewise an object of attention in some parts. Potatoes and other vegetables are
                    partially cultivated, together with hemp, flax, and cotton. The Flora of
                    Portugal, although abundant in some parts, presents little that is remarkable.
                    None of the plants of France or Spain, and only a few of those of Italy and
                    Sicily, are found. In the cold regions a few plants similar to those in the west
                    of England are met with. In the warmer districts poppies thrive well, and the
                    coasts of Beira and Estremadura, with the low sandy plains of Alemtejo, are
                    adorned with the cistus and many varieties of heath. On the northern mountains
                    is a tree peculiar to them, which is called azerino.</p>
                <p>Portugal is behind almost every nation of Europe in agriculture; and the various
                    improvements which are general elsewhere have here been slowly and but recently
                    introduced. The soil is neither manured nor tilled as it ought to be. The plough
                    is composed of three pieces of wood awkwardly fastened together, and imperfectly
                    aided by the clumsy machinery of wheels. The districts best cultivated are the
                    valleys of the Minho, those of the Oporto wine company of Upper Douro, and some
                    portions of Tras-os-Montes and Beira; the remaining teιτitory remains
                    comparatively uncultivated. Where the soil is properly laboured and attended to,
                    abundant crops of wheat, barley, maize, rice, and rye are produced. But enough
                    is not raised to supply home consumption, about one fifteenth of the quantity
                    used being imported. Artificial meadows are almost unknown, except in Minho. The
                    cultivation of potatoes, however, has rapidly extended over the country, and
                    hemp and flax of excellent quality are raised. But the chief attention of the
                    Portuguese husbandman is directed to the production of those articles which find
                    their most ready vent in foreign countries, or which are raised with the least
                    labour. Of the first sort is their wine, which is produced chiefly in the
                    northern provinces. The quantity usually made is about 80,000 pipes of red, and
                    60,000 pipes of white. The productions that require but little labour, such as
                    chestnuts, almonds, oranges, lemons, and citrons, are also profusely raised,
                    and, with the onions and garlic, form no small proportion of the aliment of the
                    inhabitants. Olive-trees are plentiful, and the oil expressed from their fruit
                    forms an important article of sustenance; and, though not of a quality or
                    flavour that is relished for the table in foreign countries, it is a
                    considerable article of export.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, cattle are not abundant in Portugal; for, with the exception
                    of the grazing lands of the Minho, the Estrella, and Monte Junto, ajid a few
                    other places, in which a beautiful and large breed of cattle is reared, the
                    feeding is decidedly bad. Very little cheese or butter is made, these articles
                    being mostly imported from England and Holland. Horses are far from being
                    numerous, and they are of a small size, but very active. Mules, however, are or
                    a first-rate breed, and they, in a great measure, compensate the deficiency.
                    Sheep are reared to some extent, and their wool is inferior to none but that of
                    Spain. There are numerous herds of goats, and abundance of swine of a peculiar
                    species. Poultry are plentiful; and bees are bred to some extent. The rearing of
                    silk-worms was once a considerable branch of industry; but the great injury
                    sustain <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538615" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8615-0480"/>ed by
                    the mulberry plantations during war has subjected it to many fluctuations. Birds
                    are not numerous; but of wolves, wild cats, wild goats, wild boars, stags, and
                    some other species of large game, there are a few in certain localities. Hares
                    are rare, and rabbits are not so numerous as in Spain. Amphibious reptiles are
                    not common, but vipers and venomous serpents abound in the mountains; the other
                    parts of the country, however, appear to be free from them. There are several
                    species of lizards; the insects of Northern Africa occur on the heaths; the
                    butterflies of the south of France on the sides of the Estrella; and the
                    scarabaei of the north are found on the mountains of Northern Portugal. The
                    rivers are amply stocked with fish, and the coasts literally swarm with them.
                    Pilchards are caught in immense quantities. Another very common fish is the
                    pescada, a species of the gadus. Besides these, the kinds in greatest esteem and
                    abundance are the sea and river eel, the sole, rodovalho, savel, ruivo, safio,
                    cavalla, espada, and others.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Portugal are comparatively unimportant; but the country has
                    in general been underrated in this respect. No comparison can be instituted
                    between its products of this sort and those of more industrious states; but if,
                    notwithstanding the advantages England enjoys, the Portuguese have been able to
                    compete with the English in different manufactures, it maybe concluded that
                    industry cannot be at so very low an ebb as is often asserted. However, almost
                    all the finer fabrics are imported. At Alcobaça and Tomar cottons, at Guarda
                    woollens, and at Guimaraens linens, are manufactured. The best goods that are
                    made in the kingdom, as compared with those of other countries, are the
                    cambrics, shirting and tabic linens, and sewing threads. Glass is manufactured
                    at Leiria, and silk, paper, and other articles elsewhere; whilst in Lisbon there
                    are manufactories of arms, cordage, hats, chocolate, earthenware, tin, copper,
                    lace, mats, ribbands, soap, silk, cottons, with distilleries, tanneries, sugar
                    refineries, and founderies. The Portuguese display considerable skill in working
                    in gold and silver plate; and their taste in cabinet-work is said to be now much
                    improved. Generally speaking, they manufacture most articles of recognised
                    necessity with more or less skill. But neither the mines nor the fisheries are
                    at all attended to as they ought to be. If the former were wrought, their
                    produce might form important articles of commerce; and if the latter were
                    prosecuted, as much fish might be caught as would render the importation of this
                    article unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The separation of Brazil from Portugal, together with the loss of her Indian
                    possessions, have reduced the commerce of this country to a mere fragment of
                    what it once was when her ports were the medium through which much of the
                    produce of the east and of the west passed to other countries. Political events
                    have also tended materially to depress the foreign trade of Portugal. Previously
                    to 1820 it was very considerable, but since that memorable epoch in the annals
                    of the country, it has sunk, comparatively speaking, to nothing. The chief
                    articles of exportation are wines, lemons, oranges, figs, almonds, and other
                    dried fruits; salt, oil, sumach, wool, and corkwood. The chief goods imported
                    are wheat and other grains, dried cod, salted meat, butter, cheese, horses,
                    oxen, mules, and other animals, medicinal and drying drugs, linseed-oil, planks,
                    and other kinds of prepared wood, iron, steel, lead, tin, brass, copper,
                    charcoal, tar and pitch, flax, hemp, and silk. Numerous articles of foreign
                    manufacture were wont to be imported, and afterwards re-exported to foreign
                    possessions; but this trade is of course annihilated, or nearly so.</p>
                <p>There is a great deficiency of authentic documents regarding the commerce of
                    Portugal. Those which can be relied on relate to periods too far back to admit
                    of their being taken as evidence of the present state of trade, and those of a
                    more recent date are imperfect. The following is a statement of the quantities
                    of British and Irish produce and manufactures imported into Portugal in the year
                    1835; the declared value is given:—Apparel, slops, and haberdashery, L.13,938;
                    arms and ammunition, L.1293; bacon and hams, L.1479; beef and pork, L.1454; beer
                    and ale, L.2369; printed books, L.935; brass and copper manufactures, L.10,730;
                    butter and cheese, L.94,052; coals, culm, and cinders, L.1561; cordage, L. 165;
                    cotton manufactures, L.796,002; hosiery, lace, and small wares, L.20,998;
                    cotton, twist, and yarn, L.13,338; earthenware of all sorts, L.517l; woollen
                    manufactures, L.350,715; fish, herrings, L.122; glass, L.l 1,753; hardwares and
                    cutlery, L.31,469; hats, L.1990; iron and steel, L.49,484; lead and shot,
                    L.8118; leather, L.6138; saddlery and harness, L.3212; linen manufactures,
                    L.36,184; machinery and mill-work, L.5346; painters’ colours, L.3805; plate,
                    jewellery, and watches, L.l 281; silk manufactures, L.19,485; soap and candles,
                    L.482; stationery, L.9376; refined sugar, L.6840; tin, L.410; tin and pewter
                    wares and tin plates, L.4176; woollen and worsted yarn, L.680; salt, L.150; all
                    other articles, L.39,625. The total declared value of the whole was L.1,554,326.
                    This was rather less than the amount of exports to Portugal during 1834, but
                    more than for any preceding year. The goods imported from France in 1835 were,
                    French and foreign merchandise, raw produce, L.42,284; manufactures, L.236,374;
                    French merchandise, raw produce, L.27,247; manufactures, L.195,546. The total
                    amount was L.501,453, about one third of that of Great Britain. The goods sent
                    to the Portuguese dependencies are included. Portugal exported to Great Britain
                    in 1835, wines of Portugal, 4,163,719 gallons; sheep’s wool, 680,956 lbs.; bees’
                    wax, eighteen cwts.; brandy, 1084 gallons; 2385 goats’ skins; sumach, forty
                    cwts.; raisins, twenty-four cwts.; olive oil, 270 gallons; oranges and lemons,
                    95,656 packages; figs, 828 cwts.; bark for tanning or dyeing, 1015 cwts.; cork,
                    59,910 cwts.; wheat 2157 quarters; and a few other articles. During the same
                    year Portugal sent to France, raw materials and manufactures to the value of
                    L.38,805; articles in a state fit for use or for consumption, L.41,425; total
                    amount. L.80,231. But Portugal carries on trade with many other countries
                    besides Great Britain and France. For her own products she receives from the
                    Netherlands grain, cheese, colours, and dye-stuffs; from the north of Germany
                    grain, linen, iron, tin, brass, and other metallic articles, and toys; from
                    Denmark, grain and timber; from Sweden, grain, iron, steel, copper, and tar;
                    from Russia, grain, hemp, flax, canvass, linen, cordage and tackling, timber,
                    tar, tallow, furs, and the like; from Dantzig, grain, hemp, and timber. There is
                    likewise a considerable intercourse with the United States, the foreign colonies
                    of the kingdom, Brazil, and other places; but we have no data from which to
                    estimate the extent and value of the foreign commerce. The internal trade, at
                    the best unimportant, suffers from the want of good roads. Canals there are
                    none, and the few navigable rivers are not so at all times, so that until proper
                    roads are made or canals formed, the inland commerce of Portugal must continue
                    to be very limited.</p>
                <p>The government of Portugal, once of the most absolute kind, is now a limited
                    monarchy. The succession is hereditary, and extends to both sexes. The
                    constitution of the kingdom, a sketch of which was laid before the cortes on the
                    7th of March 1837, is nearly a verbatim copy of that of 1822, an outline of
                    which has already been given. The exceptions relate to the appointment of the
                    senators, and the separation of the counsellors of state. The mode of election
                    now adopted is the direct instead of the indirect. It is further provided, that
                    no deputy can hold a public situation, and no officer in his district, no bishop
                    in his diocese, nor any priest in his parish, is allowed to be chosen. The king
                    and the royal princes are declared incapable of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538628" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8628-0481"/>holding the chief command of
                    the army or navy. The cortes have the right to choose a new dynasty should the
                    reigning family become extinct. If the assembly of the cortes is dissolved, a
                    new one must be called together within thirty days at the latest. The authority
                    of the cortes is so great that the power of the sovereign is little more than
                    nominal. The management of the affairs of the nation belongs to the counsel of
                    state. There are six ministers, one for each of the departments of foreign
                    affairs, the interior, finance, war and the colonies, marine, and justice. There
                    arc also boards of trade, of navigation, of agriculture, and of
                    manufactures.</p>
                <p>For the administration of justice there are two supreme courts of appeal; one at
                    Lisbon, and the other at Oporto. There is also one for each of the provinces of
                    Estremadura, Alemtejo, Algarve, Minho, Tras-os-Montes, Beira, and one for the
                    comarca of Castello Branco in Beira. A court of cassation has been established
                    in the capital. In criminal cases the proceedings are public; in civil matters
                    the parties have the privilege of appointing an arbitrator, who is chosen from a
                    society belonging to each city. Each of the six districts of the kingdom is
                    divided into comarcas or jurisdictions, which are again subdivided into
                    ciudades, villas, and provincial under-courts of justice, called concelhos,
                    houras, contos, julgados, and behetrias, these being distributed in correiçoes,
                    over which a corregidor presides as head judge, and who has a right to speak in
                    the second instance, or court of judicature. The sub-judges are in individual
                    places <hi rend="italic">juizes de for a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in all
                    civil and criminal cases they speak in the first instance. In large towns the
                    civil and criminal jurisdiction is under two <hi rend="italic">jtii∑es da for
                    a,</hi> one of whom bears the title of <hi rend="italic">juizda cirel,</hi> and
                    the other that of <hi rend="italic">juiz da crime.</hi> There are also in the
                    towns and villages <hi rend="italic">juizes orfiiιιarios,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">juizes dapaz,</hi> a sort of justices of the peace. The number of
                    persons connected with the administration of justice, those who have seats in
                    courts, as judges, advocates, and others, is very great, and the course of law
                    is tedious and expensive. The standard authority in matters of law and justice
                    is the royal ordinances which Alphonso V. collected, and Emanuel I. printed.
                    When this juridical code is not suf-fficient, the Roman law is appealed to; and
                    in ecclesiastical matters the canon law is the recognised authority. The
                    religion of the state is the Roman Catholic; but the exercise of all other forms
                    of religion is permitted to foreigners. The supreme head of the clergy is the
                    patriarch of Lisbon, who is always a cardinal. There are fourteen bishops under
                    the archbishops of Braga and Evora, the former bearing the title of primate of
                    the kingdom. The number of ecclesiastics and religious houses was at one time
                    very great. In 1822 there were 132 nunneries, with 2980 nuns, 912 pupils and
                    novices, and 1971 servant-women; and their revenue amounted to 432,189 mil reis.
                    The number of monasteries was 346, containing 5830 persons, who enjoyed an
                    income of 784,513 milreis. The regular orders of monks have been reduced, and
                    some other alterations relating to the church have taken place since Balbi
                    published his Statistical Essay on Portugal, from which the above facts are
                    taken; but we have no authentic data from which to draw up a correct statement
                    of the present condition of ecclesiastical matters in Portugal. Religion has
                    shared in the political fluctuations of the times.</p>
                <p>The following is a tabular view of the statistics of Portugal for the year 1835.
                    The number of square miles and fire-places in the provinces and districts is
                    given on the authority of official documents. The population has been estimated
                    by multiplying the number of fire-places by four and a half, which is reckoned a
                    fair average number of souls for each hearth.</p>

                <p>In the year 1822 the statistics of education in Portugal stood thus. The
                    university of Coimbra, founded in 1279, with six faculties, a preparatory
                    college, sixteen hundred students; eight hundred and eighty-three elementary
                    schools; three hundred and twenty-two Latin, and twenty-one Greek and rhetorical
                    schools, together with twenty-seven for theoretical and moral philosophy. The
                    total number of scholars, exclusive of students, was 3],280. To these are to be
                    added the following establishments; the marine and royal academy at Oporto,
                    which had three hundred and twenty-five scholars; the academy of Lisbon, with
                    about as many pupils; the trades’ school at Lisbon, with a hundred and fifty
                    scholars; the Lisbon royal school for engineering, ar tillery, and drawing, with
                    eighty scholars; and the military school at Luz, near the capital, with two
                    hundred students. At Lisbon there are also a royal college for the nobility, and
                    royal schools for the Arabic language, drawing, and architecture, and another
                    for statuary; also an institution for instruction in copperplate engraving, an
                    academy for teaching music, and some others. Surgery is taught at the university
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538641" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8641-0482"/>Coimbra,
                    and in several royal schools; in St Joseph’s hospital in Lisbon; and in
                    hospitals at Oporto, Elvas, and Chaves. The military school for mutual
                    instruction, which the children of citizens are permitted to attend, had two
                    thousand five hundred and sixteen scholars. There are other academies for
                    instruction in science, geography, Portuguese history, navigation, marine
                    affairs, artillery, and fortification; an institution for the encouragement of
                    literature and other branches of knowledge at Lisbon; an academy for history and
                    antiquities at Santarem; and an academy for scientific instruction in the small
                    county-town of Tomar in Santarem. Portugal has seven botanic gardens, but some
                    of them are of a very humble description; twelve museums of natural curiosities,
                    open to the public; twelve collections of coins and other antiquities; eight
                    observatories; a royal library at Lisbon, with eighty thousand volumes; and the
                    university library of Coimbra, with sixty thousand volumes. In the fine arts the
                    Portuguese have made but little advancement. There are comparatively few
                    printingpresses in the country; and book-printing establishments on a
                    respectable scale are only to be met with in Lisbon, Oporto, and Coimbra. Works
                    of fiction, and books for edification in the Catholic faith, constitute half the
                    yearly literary produce of the Portuguese. On account of their poverty, it has
                    been customary to print scientific works at the royal expense. It is difficult
                    to say whether the press be free in Portugal, at least according to our ideas of
                    freedom. Liberty of the press was established by a decree in the year 1823; but
                    the cortes annulled it, and appointed a commission of censorship.</p>
                <p>There are seven orders of knighthood in Portugal, viz. the military order of
                    Christ, established in 1319; the order of San Jago, for civil merit, founded in
                    1288; the order of Avis, for military merit, established in 1213; the military
                    order of the tower and sword, founded in 1459, and revived in 1805-1808; the
                    order of Villa Vicoa, or the immaculate conception, founded in 1818; the female
                    order of Santa Isabel, established in 1804; and the order of the faith. In 1749,
                    the king of Portugal received from Benedict XIV. the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >rex</hi><hi rend="italic">fidelissimus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and his
                    Most Faithful Majesty styles himself “king of Portugal and Algarve, of both
                    sides of the sea in Africa, lord of Guinea, and of the navigation, conquests,
                    and commerce of Aethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India.” The heir to the throne is
                    styled Prince Royal; his eldest son, Prince of Beira; the other royal children
                    are called Infants and Infantas of Portugal. The present Braganza line of
                    princes commenced with John IV. who was proclaimed king of 1640. The national
                    escutcheon is a silver shield, with five smaller blue shields lying crossways.
                    On each of these are five silver pennies, placed so as to form a Saint Andrew’s
                    cross. There is a red border containing the armorial bearings of Algrave, which
                    are seven golden castles with blue towers. On the summit of the royal helmet
                    there is a golden dragon; and the shield contains two dragons, each holding a
                    flag, adorned with the emblems of Portugal and Algarve.</p>
                <p>The revenues of the state arise from the extensive crownlands, together with the
                    hereditary estates of the house of Braganza, and the possessions of the first
                    three orders of knights, the greater portion of which belongs to the crown. The
                    other sources from which the government income is derived are, the customs, a
                    property-tax levied from citizen and countryman, the tenth part of the amount of
                    all goods sold, the profits of the “cross-bull,” the impost on several
                    requisites of life, the excise, the “decimas” or tithes of the clergy, stamps,
                    lotteries, the mint, and others. Since the separation of Brazil from Portugal,
                    and the attempt of Dorn Miguel to maintain the sovereignty he had usurped, a
                    great disproportion has taken place between the expenditure and the income; the
                    latter being sometimes not equal to the half of the former. The consequence has
                    been the accumulation of a national debt of enormous magnitude for so poor a
                    country, and which there appears to be no immediate prospect of the government
                    being able to extinguish, or even to lessen. We have no information that can be
                    relied on as to its exact amount at present; but as it was stated to be three
                    hundred and twenty-four millions of francs in the year 1832, we are rather below
                    than above the mark in estimating it now, 1838, at four hundred millions of
                    francs, or sixteen millions sterling. The income, as well as the expenditure,
                    but particularly the former, has been subject to great fluctuations. These,
                    however, are mainly to be attributed to the unsettled state in which the country
                    remained for so long a period. In the year 1827, the income was 46,843,975
                    francs, and the expenditure was 62,162,363, so that there appeared a deficit of
                    15,292,388 francs. In 1829 the revenue was only eighteen millions, whilst the
                    expenses amounted to forty millions of francs. The following is the budget for
                    1837-1838:</p>
                <p>Income 9,294 cantos, = 55,764,000 francs.</p>
                <p>Expenditure 11,214 = 67,284,000 ditto.</p>
                <p>Deficit 1,920 cantos, = 11,520,000 francs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Weimar Almanac for 1838.</p></note></p>
                <p>According to a decree dated on the 4th of January 1837, the organized army
                    consists of, the infantry, thirty battalions, twenty of which are infantry of
                    the line, and ten jagcrs, in all 21,560 men; the cavalry, eight regiments, four
                    being lancers and four jagers, in all 3680 men; and the artillery, four
                    regiments, and three batteries for the neighbouring islands, consisting of 2232
                    men. The combined military force of Portugal, therefore, amounts to 27,472 men;
                    and there is, besides, an army of militia about 27,000 strong.</p>
                <p>According to an official document of the year 1835, the naval force consisted of
                    two ships of the line, four frigates, six brigs, eight schooners and cutters,
                    eight gun-boats, eight transports, eight packet-vessels, and two steam-boats, in
                    all forty-six sail.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Portugal are generally a robust, yet not an industrious
                    people. They are enterprising and persevering, patient in adverse circumstances,
                    excessively attached to their own religion and customs, and, though temporary
                    circumstances may seem to indicate the contrary, they retain a high sense of
                    loyalty to their monarch, and of submission to their spiritual superiors. The
                    Portugese language is derived from the Latin, of which it contains a great
                    proportion of words, though mixed with many others of Arabic origin. In the
                    construction of its sentences it very much resembles theCastillian; but the
                    pronunciation of the syllables differs considerably,being in general less
                    guttural; and there are many words introduced which seem peculiar to itself, and
                    the derivation of which it is difficult to trace, though probably they are to be
                    found amongst some of the tribes on the coast of Barbary. <hi rend="smallcaps"
