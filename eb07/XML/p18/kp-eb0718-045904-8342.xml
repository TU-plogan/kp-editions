                <p><label type="entry">PORTSMOUTH</label>, a town of the county of Southampton or
                    Hampshire, within the hundred of Portsdown, and seventy-four miles from London.
                    It stands on an island divided from the mainland by a small creek or arm of the
                    sea. This island, called Portsea, is about fifteen miles in circumference, and
                    contains nearly 5100 acres of land of great fertility; and, besides the borough
                    of Portsmouth, the town formerly known as Portsmouth common, but now by the name
                    of the island, and also what may be denominated a town called Southsea, besides
                    many other neat houses. The last of these towns has grown up to importance
                    within a few years, because it has become a place of great resort for
                    sea-bathing; and hence the usual accommodations of such places have been
                    constructed and extended.</p>
                <p>The population appears for the four decennial enumerations to have been, in the
                    three divisions, as follows:</p>

                <p>Portsea Guildable is a part of the parish of Portsea, not within the jurisdiction
                    of the borough of Portsmouth. The limits of that borough contain within them the
                    whole of the <hi rend="italic">town</hi> of Portsea; and the right of voting for
                    members of parliament was conferred on the inhabitants, occupiers, by the reform
                    bill. The corporation now consists of fourteen aidermen and forty-two
                    councillors, who elect the mayor. It is divided into seven wards, and has
                    justices of the peace appointed by the Crown.</p>
                <p>The statements of population are exclusive of the corps of royal marines and
                    regular troops, as well as the seamen on board the ships in the harbour, which
                    are estimated to amount to about 4000 persons.</p>
                <p>The soil of the island is marshy, and was formerly found to be unhealthy; and
                    besides, the inhabitants suffered much from the scarcity and dearness of good
                    water. But of late years those evils have been remedied by complete draining of
                    the moist parts, and by the construction of good sewers, which carry into the
                    sea the impurities of the towns. Two efficient Water Companies have completed
                    works for the supply of that necessary of life; and no town in England is now
                    better supplied with it, or at a cheaper rate, than the inhabitants of
                    Portsmouth and its vicinity. The returns of deaths show that forty years ago
                    they were one in thirty annually of the population; whilst in the three years
                    1827, 1828, 1829, they did not exceed one in sixty.</p>
                <p>The favourable situation of Portsmouth for a naval arsenal, led to the
                    constructions that have since distinguished it, at the period when the
                    sovereigns of England first began to form a naval force. Some of the
                    fortifications were erected on the sea-side as early as the reign of King Henry
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538355" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8355-0460"/>Eighth;
                    but the walls surrounding the town were first built of stone in the reign of
                    Elizabeth. In every subsequent reign additions and improvements have been made
                    to it.</p>
                <p>As the town of Portsmouth is surrounded with walls, the streets are for the most
                    part narrow, nor can it as a whole be represented as a well-built place. The
                    High Street is of moderate breadth, and has a few good buildings; but a part of
                    it is disfigured and contracted, by having the market house running through the
                    middle of it. Some of the buildings are of ancient date; one especially in the
                    High Street is worthy of observation, as having been the dwelling in which the
                    Duke of Buckingham was assassinated, in the reign of King Charles I. It may be
                    remarked, that the best buildings in Portsmouth are the inns and hotels, which
                    are numerous, and proportioned to the great number and various descriptions of
                    occasional residents arriving and departing, as passengers to and from all parts
                    of the world. The largest pile of building is the marine barracks, capable of
                    accommodating some thousands of soldiers; but it is absolutely without taste or
                    ornament. The walls that surround the town are shaded with trees, and afford a
                    good promenade to the inhabitants. Another promenade is furnished on the grand
                    parade, where every morning the troops destined to take the guard for the day
                    and night are assembled. From the parade, by a slope, the king’s bastion is
                    reached, where the garrison standard is hoisted every morning at break of day.
                    At the east end of the Grand Parade is the garrison chapel, the remnant of an
                    ancient hospital, called <hi rend="italic">Domus</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi>
                    built in 1238. The building has recently bccn taken down, and the chapel, or
                    rather the chancel part of it, is now the only remains of the ancient
                    erection.</p>
                <p>At the west end of the platform, on an ancient building, which, before the
                    dissolution of the monasteries, had been the government house, a lofty <hi
                    rend="italic">semaphore</hi> has been erected, from which signals are made to
                    the ships in the harbour and at Spithead. It is also connected with a chain of
                    telegraphs, terminating at the Admiralty Office in London, and by which
                    communications are conveyed, so that a message has been sent and an answer
                    received in two minutes. In a niche in the wall of this ancient building is a
                    bust of King Charles I., with an inscription underneath, stating that “after his
                    travels through France and Spain, and having passed very many dangers both by
                    sea and land, he arrived here the 5th October 1623.” This was on his return from
                    the secretjourney he made in search of a bride of the Spanish royal family.</p>
                <p>The parish church is a venerable object, said to have been built originally in
                    1220, and dedicated to the then recently canonized St. Thomas à Becket. The
                    chancel is the only part left of the original building, and affords a contrast,
                    by its numerous pillars, clustered pilasters, and ribbed pointed arches in the
                    Saracenic style, with the architecture of the nave, built in the plain Tuscan
                    style, the pillars of which support circular arches, and carry the roof. Few
                    places of worship in the kingdom are superior to this church in internal beauty,
                    which is chiefly due to the elegance of the chancel, but is increased by a few
                    painted windows over the altar, which has been recently presented to it. At the
                    west end is the tower, added in 1693, which is 120 feet in height. Overthis, in
                    an octagon latticed erection called thelanthorn, is a fine peal of eight bells.
                    Surmounting the whole, as a weather vane, is a gilt model of a ship, six feet
                    long, which has a shifting flag on the mizen mast that moves with the slightest
                    motion of the air, and indicates from what quarter the wind blows, when the
                    breeze is not sufficiently strong to move the hull of the ship.</p>
                <p>The walls of this church are adorned with a great variety of handsome ancient and
                    modern monuments; one of the most remarkable of which is that to the memory of
                    the Duke of Buckingham, whose assassination has already been adverted to. In the
                    parish register is to be seen the regis tration of the marriage of king Charles
                    II. with the Infanta of Portugal, 22d May 1662. This document, in letters of
                    gold on vellum, is highly illuminated in the style of the old missals, and
                    states the marriage to have been performed by Sheldon, bishop of London. Some
                    doubts have since been suggested whether any other ceremony was used, except a
                    private marriage by a Catholic priest.</p>
                <p>Besides this capacious church, there is open to the inhabitants the large
                    garrison chapel for the established worship, and four places of meeting for
                    several sects of dissenters. In the other towns the places of worship are
                    numerous. At Portsea, there are, for the episcopal worship, the parish church
                    ofKingston, the dock-yard chapel, St. George’s church, St. John’s church,
                    besides a Catholic chapel, a Jew’s Synagogue, a Wesleyan, two Independent, and
                    two Baptist meeting houses. In Southsea is St. Paul’s church, with a Methodist
                    and a Baptist chapel. At Landport, or a part better known as the Halfway Houses,
                    is All Saints’ church, besides no less than nine chapels of various sects.
                    Almost all these places ofworship have schools attached to them, some on Sundays
                    and others for week days; and in addition to them is a large school, where
                    reading, writing, and arithmetic are taught on Bell’s system. A philosophical
                    institution has been established, containing a museum of natural history and
                    curiosities, and a choice library, rapidly increasing. At the rooms lectures are
                    delivered on physical and moral philosophy, and on the belles lettres. There is
                    also over the market house a mechanic’s institute, where meetings are held, and
                    weekly lectures delivered. A well endowed grammar school in Penny Street affords
                    classical instruction to fifty boys, sons of the inhabitants of the town. The
                    townhall, gaol, theatre, custom-house, and the other public buildings in
                    Portsmouth, present very little attraction.</p>
                <p>Few markets are better supplied than that of Portsmouth. A large part of the
                    fertile island of Portsea is laid cut in kitchen and fruit gardens, from which
                    spring crops of vegetables are grown much earlier than in other parts of the
                    kingdom. No market produces finer meat; large quantities of poultry, hares,
                    partridges, and eggs, are brought from France, and the extensive water
                    communication gives facility to provide hay, corn, flour, and other articles, at
                    very cheap rates. To this cheapness of provisions, combined with the purity of
                    the air, and the number of comfortable houses recently built, may be attributed
                    the great extension of Southsea which the population tables present.</p>
                <p>The buildings in Portsea, except those belonging to the government, are by no
                    means distinguished. The streets are regularly built, well paved and lighted,
                    and kept generall; in a clean state, but as the greater part of the inhabitants
                    consist of artificers andlabourersof different grades employed in the dock-yard,
                    or otherwise in the public service, the houses are mostly small, conformably to
                    the finances of the occupants. Southsea consists of houses of a more respectable
                    class, forming terraces or rows mostly looking on the sea, and enjoying the
                    prospect of the inner harbour, the fortresses that guard the entrance to it, and
                    the building! and scenery on the opposite shore. It has one distinguish ed pile
                    called the <hi rend="italic">king’s rooms,</hi> consisting of an elegan suite of
                    rooms, eighty feet in front. Within is the pro menade room, forty-five feet
                    long, thirty-five feet wide, ant seventeen feet high, adapted for music or
                    dancing; and be sides, it contains baths, both warm and cold, and gives;
                    cheerful appearance to the spot. Besides the three town here noticed, there arc
                    groups of houses on the island, am single dwellings of various descriptions. The
                    largest o the groups, called the Halfway Houses, from lying midwa; between
                    Portsea and the parish church, has many respect able houses, as well as the new
                    church of All Saints.</p>
                <p>The most important view in which Portsmouth can ♭ looked upon is as the great
                    depot of the British nava power, and in this view the state of the surrounding
                    wate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538368" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8368-0461"/>and of
                    the harbour above the town, become worthy of observation and description. One of
                    the great advantages of this place is that very fine anchorage known by the name
                    of Spithead. It is about half way between the mainland and the Isle of Wight,
                    but nearer to the latter. It is protected by the high land of the island from
                    southerly winds, and from northerly and easterly winds by the mainland. It has
                    an advantageous entrance. For, though at the east there are some dangers on what
                    is called the Princessa shoal, and on the ranges of rocks called Bambridge’s
                    Ledge, and Betty’s Ledge, they, as well as the Nab rock, the Long rock, the
                    Warner, and Romansland, are so well provided with either floating lights or
                    distinguishing buoys, that there is little risk, except in those very thick fogs
                    when the buoys cannot be seen, nor the leading marks observed on the sea-shore.
                    At this entrance it is a great advantage, that at St. Helen’s, at the east end
                    of the island, there is a good anchorage, so that if the wind takes a vessel
                    short, she can safely ride till the breeze is in her favour. The western
                    entrance to Spithead is by Hurst Castle, and the rocks called the Needles. This
                    passage is always safe in fair winds, on account of the definite track which is
                    shewn by the buoys, lights, and landmarks; but it is so hazardous, that few
                    ships attempt in a contrary wind to beat through. The passage out by the Needles
                    is used by more vessels than come into Spithead that way.</p>
                <p>The anchoring ground at Spithead is very good for holding, and very clear, except
                    near the wrecks of the Royal George, the Boyne, and the Edgar, around which the
                    tide has formed considerable banks. There is a regular depth of water in every
                    part, varying from six to twelve fathoms, and the space is sufficient for the
                    whole navy of England to ride at single or double anchor, without danger of
                    falling on board each other when swinging with the changes of the tide.</p>
                <p>Within the smooth water, between the island and the mainland, there are other
                    very good anchorages, besides that of Spithead. The Mother-bank is one of them,
                    which, though there are but two fathoms of water at low tides, has near to the
                    bank from seven to nine fathoms, where in time of war merchant ships have been
                    collected to wait for the convoy of ships of war. Stakes Bay is another
                    anchorage, where there is from four to nine fathoms water, and where merchant
                    ships often anchor.</p>
                <p>The great advantages arising from so secure a rendezvous as Spithead, so near to
                    the great national marine arsenal, are too obvious to need any elaborate
                    remarks. The entrance to the harbour of Portsmouth is very narrow, but with
                    sufficient depth of water for the largest ships. The channels by which vessels
                    approach the mouth of the harbour, are commanded by batteries of such power that
                    an enemy’s fleet, however strong, would be annihilated befo,re it could reach
                    even the entrance. Within the narrow gut at the entrance, on one side of which
                    is Portsmouth, and on the other side Gosport, the water spreads out into a wide
                    basin, in which those ships of war that are under repair, or preparing for sea,
                    are riding, and some of them lying at the wharfs of the dock which borders the
                    harbour on the eastern side. From thence the harbour extends into the land, and
                    contains, in one part called Rotten Row, the ships that are in ordinary, being
                    with no other crew but a few warrant officers, to prevent them from plunder, or
                    from injury by weather. The water here branches off in various directions, and
                    by the help of the tide is navigable to Farnham, and to Porchester Castle, a
                    pile of antiquity that will reward the curiosity of a visitor.</p>
                <p>The dock-yard of Portsmouth is one of those noble objects in which every Briton
                    feels an interest. But this has already been described under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dock. Yards.</hi></p>
                <p>The gun wharf, under the ordnance department, is an immense arsenal, consisting
                    of various ranges of buildings for the reception of military and naval stores
                    and artillery. Some of the storehouses are vast piles, especially two, which,
                    with their dependencies, are fitted to contain all kinds of necessaries for the
                    sudden equipment both of a fleet and an army. On the wharf is the grand depot
                    for guns, carronades, and mortars, with shot and shells of almost every weight
                    and size, all of which are arranged in immense pyramids. Here also in time of
                    peace the guns from the ships in ordinary at the port are lodged, each ship’s
                    guns being kept in a separate tier, whilst the carriages are deposited away in
                    the same regular manner in the proper storehouses, so that the whole may be
                    easily collected again and re-embarked. The small armoury is a spacious
                    building, and the great object of admiration. Within it are upwards of 20,000
                    stand of arms, all placed in the same ornamental style as those of a similar
                    description in the tower of London.* The roof of this building is covered with
                    copper, which being oxydized by exposure to the atmosphere, when viewed on
                    approaching it from the quay gate, conveys to the mind the idea of a green
                    glassy slope, or a still wave of the sea.</p>
                <p>The victualling establishment has recently been removed from Portsmouth to the
                    opposite side of the harbour, and properly belongs to the town of Gosport. The
                    expense of this depository is said to have amounted to half a million of money.
                    The storehouses, of vast dimensions, are used as depositories for bread, beef,
                    pork, and other articles of food, of rum, wine, and clothing, that are kept
                    ready for the supply of the navy. A special object of curiosity at this
                    establishment is the machinery substituted for manual labour in making biscuit,
                    whereby every process, in its minutest detail, is effected, preparatory to its
                    being ready for the oven, including kneading, rolling, forming, and stamping.
                    Another object worthy of attention is a fine new steam corn mill, recently built
                    an an expence of L.76,000.</p>
                <p>Portsmouth is not merely a port for warlike purposes, but enjoys a considerable
                    foreign and coasting trade. The custom-house is a large and convenient building,
                    and in its stores merchandize may be kept under bond free of duty till it is
                    sold for internal consumption, or is exported. The shipping belonging to the
                    port, in which Gosport is included, consists of about 300 sail of vessels,
                    registered at nearly 10,000 tons; some are engaged in the Newfoundland fishery,
                    and since the trade with India has been laid open, a few vessels have landed
                    cargoes here from beyond the Cape of Good Hope. There is a considerable
                    importation of wine, and some of West India articles, but the chief business
                    consists in timber, corn, Irish provisions, Spanish and Portuguese fruits, and
                    the vine of both these countries. The amount of duty annually received on
                    imported articles at the custom-house, is from L.50,000 to L.60,000.</p>
