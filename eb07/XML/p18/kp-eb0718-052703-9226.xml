                <p><label type="entry">PRESCRIPTION</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> denotes
                    a particular mode of establishing a Right or Title.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prescription,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Medicine,</hi>
                    signifies much the same with what in common language is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">receipt,</hi> being a form of direction for the preparation and
                    administration of some compound medicine. These medical receipts are commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> by physicians; and the term <hi
                    rend="italic">prescription</hi> is applied to what is written by a physician on
                    seeing his patient, instructing the apothecary what medicines are to be
                    prepared, how they are to be composed, and how administered to the patient. In
                    this sense, a prescription may contain two or more <hi rend="italic"
                    >formulae.</hi></p>
                <p>These prescriptions are almost always writen in Latin, and are expressed in a
                    peculiar style, which, though well known to physicians and apothecaries, may
                    require the illustration of an example. The following is a specimen of a modern
                    prescription, as it rvould be written by a physician, according to the
                    nomenclature of the pharmacopoeia:</p>
                <p>For Mr. Muddleton.</p>
                <p>R. Pulv. Rad. Rhei palmati gr. xxv. Tartratis Potassae Jij.</p>
                <p>Tincturae Sennae compositae, Syrupi Rosae centifoliae āā gij. Aquae Menthae
                    piperitae giss, M.f. <hi rend="italic">Potio summo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mane</hi><hi rend="italic">sumenda.</hi></p>
                <p>Jan. 31, 1839∙</p>
                <p>From the above example, it will be seen that a prescription, properly so called,
                    contains several circumstances beside <hi rend="italic">the formulae</hi> or
                    receipts, as the name of the patient, for whom the prescription is written; the
                    signature of the physician, as J. B. for John Balfour, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >date of prescribing;</hi> none of which should be omitted, as the prescriptions
                    are carefully preserved by the apothecary, for future reference.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to explain some circumstances respecting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >formula</hi> given in the above prescription. The R with which it commences
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">take</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and is prefixed to all medical receipts. Then follow the
                    several ingredients of which the medicine is to be composed, with the quantities
                    of each. These quantities are usually marked by peculiar characters or symbols,
                    and the numbers employed are usually the Roman numerals. After the ingredients
                    have been enumerated, and their quantities specified, there follows the title of
                    the medicine, as <hi rend="italic">Potio</hi> in the present instance,
                    signifying <hi rend="italic">potion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">purging
                    draught,</hi> with Μ. f. prefixed to it, which stand for <hi rend="italic"
                    >misce</hi><hi rend="italic">fiat,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">miscc ut fiat,</hi>
                    mix to make; and lastly, the direction how the medicine is to be taken or
                    administered, <hi rend="italic">summo</hi><hi rend="italic">mane</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sumenda,</hi> to be taken early in the morning.</p>
                <p>The ingredients of which a formula is composed have been, by u riters on medical
                    prescriptions, arranged under four heads: 1. The <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of
                    the formula, which in the present instance is the rhubarb, constituting the
                    principal ingredient, on whose action, modified where necessary, the chief
                    success of the medicine, in fulfilling the required indication, is to depend. 2.
                    The <hi rend="italic">adjuvant</hi> or auxiliary, added to the basis, for the
                    purpose of increasing its power, expediting its action, or rendering it more
                    easily soluble in the juices of the stomach; in the above formula the <hi
                    rend="italic">tartrate of potash</hi> is the principal adjuvant. 3. The <hi
                    rend="italic">corrector,</hi> added to the basis, when we wish to moderate or
                    delay its action, to correct some unpleasant or injurious property of it, such
                    as its odour, taste, acrimony, &amp;c., or to prevent it from acting on the body
                    in a different manner from that which the indication requires: thus, in the
                    present formula, the warm <hi rend="italic">tincture of senna</hi> is added,
                    rather to correct the griping quality of the rhubarb, than to increase its
                    action, and the <hi rend="italic">syrup of roses</hi> to correct the unpleasant
                    taste of the medicine; and <hi rend="italic">the essential oil</hi> in the
                    peppermint-water contributes to both these purposes: these, therefore, are to be
                    considered as the correctors. 4. The <hi rend="italic">constituent,</hi> or that
                    ingredient which serves to reduce the rest into the form which is considered as
                    most convenient for the exhibition of the medicine; in the present case the <hi
                    rend="italic">peppermint-water</hi> is the constituent, serving to reduce the
                    medicine to the form of a potion or draught.</p>
                <p>Medical <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> are either <hi rend="italic"
                    >officinal,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">extemporaneous</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the former being such as are directed by authority of some public
                    medical college to be kept in the shops of apothecaries, and the preparation of
                    which is described in their <hi rend="italic">pharmacopoeias</hi> or
                    dispensatories; the latter such as are prescribed by the physician or surgeon,
                    as occasion may require.</p>
