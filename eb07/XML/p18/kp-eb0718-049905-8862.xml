                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">POTOSI</label> is the name of a department, a province, and a
                    city of Bolivia, in South America. This part of the republic has been celebrated
                    from the earliest times for its metallic wealth. The Cerro de Potosi, where the
                    argentiferous mines are situated, is a conical hill, 16,037 feet in height, and
                    about three leagues in circumference at the base. It bears marks of a volcanic
                    origin, and its sides are marked with spots of various hues, such as dark green,
                    orange, gray, and red. In this mountain no less than above 5000 mine mouths or
                    levels have been opened, but very few of the mines are now worked. A tradition
                    exists that Diego Hualea, an Indian peasant, accidentally discovered these mines
                    whilst hunting the wild goat. In pursuing his game, he arrived at a steep
                    declivity, and, to prevent himself from falling, he seized bold of a shrub,
                    which, yielding to his weight, was torn from the ground, and disclosed to his
                    eyes a large mass of silver, part of which adhered to the roots of the plant. A
                    slave to whom he intrusted the secret of his good fortune betrayed him, and the
                    mine was opened by the Spaniards on the 21st of April 1545. The surrounding
                    country is also metalliferous. Silver of great fineness abounds in a hill called
                    Guayna-Potosi (Young Potosi), close to the Cerro; but from the number of springs
                    which occur not far from the surface, it has been found impossible to work it.
                    The ore is pulverised in mills, driven by streamlets conducted from lakes or
                    pools in the mountains, from one to ten miles distance from the city of Potosi.
                    In connexion with the mines, General Miller relates the following circumstance.
                    “A singular custom, which probably originated in the indulgence of early
                    mine-owners, still prevails. Between Saturday night and Monday morning, the
                    Cerro literally becomes the property of such persons as choose to work upon
                    their own account. During that time, the boldest master would not venture to
                    visit his own mines. They who thus take possession are called caxchas, and
                    generally sell the produce of Sunday to their own masters. Independently of the
                    ore thus abstracted, the caxehas did considerable mischief, by neglecting the
                    proper precautions as they excavated. If they met with a more than usually rich
                    vein in the course of the week, it was passed over, and cunningly reserved for
                    the following Sunday. Very strong measures were therefore taken to abolish the
                    custom; but every effort proved unsuccessful. The caxehas defended their
                    privilege by force of arms, and by hurling down large stones upon their
                    assailants.” These mines are still considered the richest in South America, but
                    great ignorance of mining operations is displayed in working them. In an
                    agricultural point of view this province is unimportant; its riches consist in
                    its mineral wealth.</p>
                <p>The city of Potosi, the capital of the department, is situated on the south side
                    of the mountain, above 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, in lat∙ 19° 34'
                    south, and long. 67° 22 ’ west from Greenwich. Upon the discovery of the mines,
                    it was named an <hi rend="italic">asiento</hi> or mine-station; but in process
                    of time it was raised to the rank of a town, and made the capital of an
                    intendeneia. In 1611 it contained 150,000 inhabitants, according to a census
                    taken by order of government officials. On this point General Miller judiciously
                    observes, “This number must at that time have consisted principally of <hi
                    rend="italic">mitayos</hi> of every tribe existing between Potosi and Cuzeo, a
                    distance of nearly 300 leagues. Those unhappy beings were generally accompanied
                    in their labours by their wives and families, who came rather to share in the
                    hopeless sufferings of their husbands and fathers, than to settle in the arid
                    hills of Potosi. It is not therefore surprising that its population should have
                    been, by the abolition of the <hi rend="italic">mita,</hi> and by the shocks
                    which wealthy establishments received during the revolution, reduced to only
                    8000 in the year 1825.”</p>
