                <p><label type="entry">POISON</label>, any substance which, acting on living bodies
                    in small quantities, occasions serious disturbance of their functions, and may
                    cause death. The science which treats of poisons is termed toxicoogy.</p>
                <p>Poisons have been known from remote antiquity; but the notions entertained of
                    their effects were generally fanciful and vague, so that it is often impossible
                    now to discover what the poisons of the ancients really were. In modern times a
                    great addition has been made to our knowledge of them, both as regards their
                    number and their action; and it is only within the last thirty years that the
                    nature and the varieties of their action have been studied scientifically and
                    with success.</p>
                <p>The number of poisonous substances now known is very great, and there can be no
                    doubt that very many still remain<pb break="no" facs="nls:193534598"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-4598-0175"/> to be discovered, equally in the mineral, the
                    animal, and the vegetable world, but more especially among vegetables. Numerous,
                    however, as they are, they present many remarkable agreements in their effects
                    or actions, so as to admit of convenient classification.</p>
                <p>Some poisons produce no other effects besides what depend on the local injury
                    they give rise to. Of these, some produce by their chemical properties absolute
                    destruction of the textures to which they are applied; and the result depends
                    less on the nature of the injury, than on the importance of the injured texture,
                    and its sympathetic connection with other parts of the body. The mineral acids,
                    such as sulphuric and nitric acid, and the mineral alkalis, potash or soda, are
                    the best examples of this kind. Others, again, of those which act locally alone,
                    produce inflammation, but not chemical destruction, where they are applied; and
                    all the ordinary effects of inflammation may ensue; of which gamboge and
                    colocynth are good illustrations. The action of the former description of local
                    poisons does not differ essentially from that of mechanical injuries of the same
                    textures; the action of the latter is almost identical with that of the natural
                    causes of inflammation. A third description of local poisons merely produce a
                    peculiar impression on the nerves of the part to which they are applied, without
                    either destroying or inflaming its texture. But there is no pure instance of the
                    kind yet known; all such poisons likewise act otherwise than locally. Opium and
                    prussic acid are examples.</p>
                <p>Other poisons, and these by far the most numerous, act upon remote organs and
                    textures, on parts to which they are not, nay, cannot be, directly applied; and
                    the effects of this kind are often developed without any appreciable signs of a
                    direct local action. There is scarcely an important organ in the body which may
                    not be brought thus under the influence of some poison or another. The brain is
                    very often so affected, as by opium, belladonna, prussic acid, and charcoal
                    fumes. The stomach and intestines are also frequently affected indirectly, as by
                    arsenic. The spine is affected by nux-vomica, the kidneys and bladder by
                    cantharides, the lungs by tartar-emetic, the heart by oxalic acid, the liver by
                    manganese, the salivary organs by mercury, and many of the glands by iodine.
                    Many poisons possess the property of acting on a great number of organs in this
                    remote or indirect way, of which arsenic and mercury are perhaps the most
                    remarkable instances. Arsenic introduced by the skin has been known to act on
                    the stomach, intestines, kidneys, heart, the lining membrane of the eyes, nose,
                    windpipe, and vagina, the nerves of voluntary motion, and the skin at a distance
                    from its place of application. Physiologists are still in doubt through what
                    channel these remote effects are produced,—some believing that the poison is
                    carried in substance with the blood from the organ to which it is applied, into
                    the parts on which it acts; others, that the operations are merely nervous, and
                    consist of the transmission of certain local impressions along the nerves which
                    communicate between one organ and another; and others, that both modes of action
                    may exist, even for the same, and still more for different, poisons. Two facts,
                    however, are clearly established, whatever theoretical deductions may be drawn
                    from them; <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that very many poisons do enter the
                    blood, and may be detected there; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> that
                    these never enter except in very minute proportion, so that, unless very
                    delicate tests arc known for them, they may readily escape detection. It seems
                    not improbable that some poisons are deposited by a species of election in
                    particular organs; but of course their presence in the blood will give them
                    access more or less almost everywhere, since there are few organs not traversed
                    by bloodvessels, and minutely injected with blood.</p>
                <p>The greater number of poisons produce their peculiar effects, through whatever
                    texture they are introduced into the body. The effects of local poisons depend,
                    as was stated already, on the texture to which they are applied; but the far
                    more numerous denomination of poisons which act remotely, exert that action, to
                    whatever part they are applied, provided they fairly enter the body. They enter
                    the sound skin with extreme difficulty, unless in the form of gas or vapour, or
                    with the aid of friction. But they act energetically through the surface of the
                    true skin stripped of its cuticle, through the cellular texture under the skin,
                    through the soft mucous membrane which lines the mouth, nose, ears, stomach,
                    intestines, windpipe, and organs of generation, through the firm serous
                    membranes which line the interior of the belly and chest, and also when
                    introduced directly into the blood-vessels, more especially into the veins. They
                    generally act with greatest energy when injected into the blood directly, or
                    when introduced into the serous cavity of the chest or belly; but if they
                    operate in very minute doses, their effects are scarcely less prompt when simply
                    thrust into a fresh wound, or under the skin; and there is no way in which they
                    exert their action with more swiftness and energy, than when inhaled into the
                    lungs, provided they assume the form of gas or vapour. For the most part their
                    activity is greatest when applied to organs and textures where absorption is
                    most prompt.</p>
                <p>The action of poisons is greatly modified by an infinite variety of collateral
                    circumstances, without a thorough knowledge of which toxicoogy cannot be well
                    understood, either as a branch of physiological science, or in its practical
                    bearings on medical practice, as well as medical jurisprudence. These modifying
                    circumstances cannot Be accurately laid down here, but the most important are
                    the following’: quantity or dose, chemical or mechanical form, the texture
                    directly acted on, habit, and peculiarity of constitution, either natural or
                    induced by disease. By all of these causes the effects of poisons may not merely
                    be altered in degree, but likewise even modified in kind, or entirely
                    neutralized. 1. Most substances which are poisonous in moderate doses, are
                    innocuous in small quantity; but some are amazingly energetic even in very
                    minute quantities,—such as prussic acid or strychnia, the active principle of
                    nux-vomica, either of which may prove fatal to a man in favourable circumstances
                    in the dose of one grain,—or still more the poisonous secretion of venomous
                    snakes, or the secretions of the human body in some diseased states, which will
                    prove fatal in quantities inappreciably small if introduced into a wound. 2. As
                    to mechanical form, poisons must be, or must become, either gaseous or liquid
                    before they act; mixture and dilution weaken their activity, though there are
                    exceptions to this rule; and some, which are rather insoluble, such as arsenic,
                    are rendered nearly inert when mixed with insoluble powders of great tenuity,
                    such as charcoal, magnesia, and the like. 3. Chemical changes materially affect
                    their actions; corrosives becoming innocuous by neutralization, purely local
                    irritants being thereby much enfeebled, and all of them being rendered more
                    feeble, or even inert, if they are converted into substances insoluble in the
                    secretions of the textures to which they are applied. Poisons that act through
                    the blood on remote organs are little influenced by chemical changes, except in
                    so far as their solubility is affected; a very important general principle,
                    which ought never to be overlooked in the search for antidotes. Arsenic,
                    mercury, prussic acid, opium, and numberless other poisons, are almost equally
                    active in all their chemical combinations, provided they continue soluble. 4.
                    The effect of the texture acted on in modifying the influence of poisons has
                    been already adverted to. As examples of this, it may be mentioned that prussic
                    acid has little or no effect through the sound skin, nor snake-poison when
                    swallowed; and that strychnia, the active principle of nux-vomica, has no effect
                    through the skin, while one or two grains might prove fatal if swallowed, and a
                    third of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193534611" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4611-0176"
                    />grain would probably kill a man in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> few minutes if
                    injected in a state of solution into a wound, into the cavity of the chest, or
                    into a vein. 5. Habit weakens the effects of many poisons, as in the familiar
                    instances of opium and ardent spirits, of which ten or twenty times what is
                    sufficient to prove fatal in ordinary circumstances may be taken with impunity
                    by those who have long used them. Mineral poisons are less under the influence
                    of this modifying circumstance than vegetable poisons; and of the latter those
                    are most influenced which act chiefly upon the brain. It is very difficult to
                    account for the varying effect of habit on the energy of vegetable poisons.
                    Strychnia, for example, the active principle of nux-vomica, seems altogether
                    excluded from the modifying effect of habit; while another principle, analogous
                    in elementary composition and in chemical properties, morphia, the active
                    principle of opium, may through habit be taken without injury in a dose fifteen
                    times as great as what might in ordinary cases prove fatal. 6. Peculiarity of
                    constitution commonly operates in rendering the body more than usually sensible
                    to the action of poisons, as in the case of opium, mercury, and cantharides,
                    medicinal doses of which act with poisonous violence on some. In a few instances
                    original peculiarity deadens the activity of certain poisons, and this is
                    observed still more remarkably during the constitutional state of certain
                    diseases, such as hydrophobia, locked jaw, mania, delirium tremens, and
                    excessive loss of blood. In some constitutions substances not injurious to
                    mankind generally produce all the phenomena of poisoning. Thus there is scarcely
                    any article of food or drink, except the great staple commodities, beef, mutton,
                    and the simple kinds of bread, which are not at times observed to act
                    poisonously on some people. But the most remarkable substances of the kind arc
                    red fish, shell-fish, mushrooms, bitter almonds in small quantity, and eggs.</p>
                <p>It has been stated that poisons are exceedingly numerous, but that they possess
                    only a limited number of actions. As these actions consist of derangement of the
                    functions of certain organs and textures of the body, it follows that the
                    outward signs of these derangements must be circumscribed within certain bounds,
                    and that many poisons must agree with one another in producing the same, or
                    nearly the same, outward signs. This general faet constitutes the basis of the
                    most approved classification. Formerly physiologists endeavoured to arrange
                    poisons according to certain theoretical notions of their nature, or according
                    to certain mysterious properties imputed to them; and subsequently most were
                    content with distributing them in three classes, according to the kingdom of
                    nature whence they happen to be derived. Every classification, however, should
                    have some practical bearing; and as the most important objects in the present
                    instance are the decision of the question of poisoning in a general sense, the
                    discovery of the particular poison, and the treatment of its effects, .these
                    points ought to be invariably kept in view. With this understanding, the best
                    classification is obviously that which is founded on the external signs of
                    poisoning, that is, the grouping of the symptoms produced .by each. Such is the
                    basis of all the most esteemed modern arrangements.</p>
                <p>The whole wonderful multiplicity of poisons, when thus viewed, may be considered
                    as either exciting irritation in particular organs, or disordering the functions
                    of the brain and spinal marrow, or as uniting both these properties. The first
                    are called <hi rend="italic">irritants,</hi> the second <hi rend="italic"
                    >narcotics,</hi> the third narcoticoirritants, or more usually <hi rend="italic"
                    >narcoticο-acrids.</hi> The irritants comprise chiefly the free acids and free
                    alkalis, with many of their compound salts, several earths with their salts,
                    many compounds of the metals, acrid vegetables, and acrid animal substances.
                    These all agree in producing, as their principal phenomenon, destruction or
                    inflammation, sometimes of the part to which they are applied, such as the skin,
                    mouth, throat, intestines, and so forth,—and at other times of organs at a
                    distance from their place of application, such as the stomach, intestines,
                    kidneys, bladder, lungs. And the symptoms they produce are those incidental to
                    inflammation generally, grouped, however, in so peculiar a manner, either in
                    order, kind, or complexity, as in many instances to distinguish the cause which
                    occasions them from any natural cause of inflammation. Many substances arranged
                    among irritants produce effects which would also associate them with the class
                    of narcotics; but still inflammation and irritation are their leading
                    consequences. The narcotics comprise principally opium, prussic acid, the
                    volatile oils of bitter almond, cherry-laurel, and other drupaceous plants;
                    henbane, thorn-apple, deadly nightshade, and certain poisonous gases, such as
                    carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, carburetted hydrogen, cyanogen, sulphuretted
                    hydrogen. These agree in acting either upon the brain, or upon the spinal
                    marrow, or upon both these parts of the nervous system at once. The symptoms
                    thus arising are stupor and coma, delirium, convulsions, paralysis, with a great
                    variety of less important yet often very significant phenomena. When coma is the
                    chief result, the brain is considered to be chiefly acted on; when convulsions
                    or paralysis occur without stupor or coma, the spinal marrow must alone suffer;
                    and where both sets of phenomena present themselves, it is probable that the
                    whole nervous system partakes more or less of the injury. The narcoticoacrids
                    comprehend hemlock and other deleterious plants of the family Umbelliferae,
                    black and white hellebore, meadow-saffron, fox-glove, ipecacuan, nux-vomica,
                    eocculus indicus, camphor, poisonous fungi, and all ethereal and alcoholic
                    fluids, besides many others of less note, or not so familiar. It is difficult
                    sometimes to separate the individuals of this class from the narcotics on the
                    one hand and the irritants on the other. But for the most part they produce in
                    different circumstances either narcotism or inflammation alone, or both
                    conjunctiy, and that either simultaneously or in succession.</p>
                <p>It may be well to illustrate these statements by a brief sketch of the effects of
                    a few familiar or interesting species belonging to each class.</p>
                <p>The purest examples of irritant poisons are the <hi rend="italic">strong mineral
                    acids</hi> and <hi rend="italic">alkalis,</hi> namely, sulphuric, nitric, and
                    muriatic acids, and potash and soda. These, when applied to the external parts
                    of the body for a sufficient length of time, cause corrosion and consequent
                    destruction; and life maybe thus brought into imminent danger, either from the
                    extent of the injury and the consequent sympathetic derangement of the vital
                    functions, or from a variety of less direct or incidental disorders. Of such a
                    course of things the public in this country have lately had too many
                    illustrations, resulting from the execrable crime of throwing sulphuric acid
                    over the person. When swallowed, the strong mineral acids and alkalis sometimes
                    act in a great measure on the throat and gullet, more frequently on the stomach
                    and intestines. In the former case there is instant and horrible sense of
                    burning in the mouth, throat, and neck, cructation of acid matter, often bloody,
                    or mixed with dark masses, excessive tenderness of the injured parts,
                    incapability of swallowing, difficult, husky breathing; and the sufferer may
                    either die suffocated, or from the depressing sympathetic impression produced on
                    the heart; or he may survive for a length of time, perishing, however, miserably
                    in the end, from stricture of the gullet and starvation, or he may recover after
                    the discharge of more or less of the lining membrane of the throat, and a
                    tedious and precarious convalescence. Where the stomach and intestines are acted
                    on by the acids or alkalis, there is in general violent vomiting, often of
                    blood, and, especially after swallowing anything burning pain in the pit of the
                    stomach, extending over the belly, with excessive tenderness and eventually
                    swelling, frequently profuse purging and gripes, and extraordinary <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193534624" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4624-0177"/> prostration of
                    the pulse and of the strength; and the issue may be either recovery, more or
                    less prompt, or far more generally death, at times from the sympathetic
                    depression of the heart and general system, more rarely from gradual exhaustion,
                    occasioned partly by constant irritation, partly by inanition, on account of
                    extensive injury of the internal membrane of the stomach,—on which digestion,
                    probably, in a great measure depends for its integrity. These phenomena are
                    purely the results of local corrosion and irritation. No remote phenomena arise
                    except exhaustion of the heart, from sympathy with the local injury; in
                    particular, there is no disturbance of the function of the brain, spine, or
                    nerves, except what arises simply from exhaustion of the circulation. The most
                    remarkable of all the irritants for subtilty and variety of action conjoined is
                    <hi rend="italic">arsenic.</hi> It is not, however, an absolutely pure irritant;
                    for, though irritation of a multifarious nature is its most prominent result, it
                    also disturbs the functions of the nervous system. When applied for some time to
                    the surface of the body, denuded of the scarf-skin, it kills the part to some
                    depth; at least a portion is thrown off by the process of sloughing, showing
                    either that the part had been killed, or that inflammation is produced, of a
                    kind which leads to its death. Both in this manner, and with much greater
                    certainty if it is applied to a fresh wound, or introduced into any of the
                    external openings of the body, or injected in solution into the cavity of the
                    chest or belly, it excites irritation and inflammation, not merely where it
                    touches, but likewise in various distant organs. The stomach and intestines
                    suffer the most invariably, giving rise to violent vomiting, especially of all
                    articles swallowed, burning pain in the bowels, tenderness, griping, purging,
                    and excoriation of the anus. The kidneys, bladder, and organs of generation, are
                    also often affected, causing strangury, suppression of urine, pains in the
                    loins, tenderness in the lower belly, &amp;c. The lining membrane of the
                    air-passages likewise frequently partakes in the injury, as is indicated by
                    hoarseness, cough, difficult breathing, expectoration, and deep-seated pain in
                    the chest. Not unfrequently the investing membrane of the nostrils and .mouth
                    presents signs of derangement, such as redness, aphthae, and constant discharge.
                    These symptoms are also generally attended with extraordinary depression of the
                    action of the heart, which is the most frequent cause of death; and this
                    sometimes forms the only prominent effect, the sufferer dying in a few hours,
                    with scarcely any other symptom but mortal faintness. Recovery may take place
                    even though the complicated effects which have been described may have been
                    developed. But after these primary disorders have disappeared, there are
                    important secondary risks to be encountered, such as dropsy, gradual emaciation
                    from constant disturbance of digestion, and, above all, epilepsy, palsy, and
                    other affections characteristic of an action upon the nervous system. Of the
                    symptoms thus indicating a narcotic action, the most pointed and most remarkable
                    are epileptic convulsions and local partial palsy. To these illustrations of the
                    phenomena of internal poisoning produced by the irritants, it may be well to add
                    a short sketch of the very striking effects produced by many of them as external
                    poisons, when they have been introduced into the substance of the skin or its
                    subjacent cellular tissue, through a wound. Of poisons of the kind now alluded
                    to the most familiar are <hi rend="italic">snake-poison,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">βuids of the dead human body</hi> after certain diseases or in
                    some peculiar unknown state; but similar effects are also produced by many acrid
                    vegetables. The affection produced is diffuse inflammation of the cellular
                    tissue, so called because it diffuses itself rapidly along that texture, without
                    any tendency to become circumscribed, as in ordinary inflammation similarly
                    seated. It is attended with some puffy elevation and tenderness of the skin over
                    the inflamed part, but not always with redness—with pain, not always acute,
                    usually of that kind called burning pain—and with excessive depression of the
                    action of the heart; and death may ensue either in a few hours from the
                    derangement of the function of the heart, or more slowly from extensive injury
                    of the cellular tissue, which terminates in gangrene.</p>
                <p>Of the phenomena produced by the narcotics, the purest and most familiar example
                    is to be found in the. effects of <hi rend="italic">opium.</hi> This drug
                    produces a great variety of interesting nervous phenomena when taken in small
                    medicinal doses. When taken in a poisonous dose, it first occasions languor,
                    giddiness, weakness, and drowsiness, afterwards deep sleep, attended in general
                    with complete repose, soft, slow breathing, and highly contracted pupils, and
                    then profound coma, or insensibility, which cannot be dispelled by any
                    stimulants, and which usually proves fatal if it be permitted to be fully
                    formed. In particular cases these symptoms are varied with delirium in the early
                    stage, and convulsions in the advanced stage; but such deviations from the
                    ordinary rule are rare. <hi rend="italic">Belladonna,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >deadly nightshade,</hi> is another narcotic which produces effects somewhat
                    different. Its berries, which are sometimes eaten by mistake by children and
                    other ignorant people, although they have a mawkish and by no means seductive
                    taste, occasion in the first instance a singular state of very active delirium,
                    in which the individual performs a series of incoherent and extravagant acts
                    with much vivacity, or falls into the condition of somnambulism; and after some
                    hours this is succeeded by a state of deep sopor or coma, as from opium, though
                    more frequently intermingled with convulsions than in the case of that drug.
                    Death is sometimes the result, and would be more frequent were it not that the
                    precursory stage of active delirium often leads to the discovery of the
                    offending cause, and its removal by fit treatment. <hi rend="italic">Prussic
                    acid,</hi> another pure narcotic, which is now almost as familiar as opium among
                    poisons, rivals them all in subtilty and rapidity of action. Small animals, such
                    as rabbits, have been killed with it in the brief space of four seconds. A
                    single drop has killed a cat in half a minute, and one grain, or about four
                    drops, has repeatedly proved fatal to man within three quarters of an hour.
                    These statements apply to the pure acid, which is seldom seen; but the common
                    acid of the shops, which is used in medicine, is equally energetic in larger
                    doses; and so are the distilled waters and essential oils of the bitter almond,
                    peach-kernels, cherry-laurel leaves, rowan-tree root, and apple-seeds, which all
                    owe their poisonous qualities to the same cause. The effects produced by all
                    these poisons are immediate, dreadful alarm, giddiness, and hurried breathing,
                    speedily followed by convulsions, insensibility, one or two fits of deep
                    convulsive respiration, and death. The <hi rend="italic">narcotic gases</hi> act
                    very much in the same manner with opium, as is well exemplified by the fumes of
                    burning charcoal, and other forms of carbonic acid. When in a pure or
                    concentrated state, carbonic acid extinguishes life immediately, in part by
                    suffocation, on account of the exclusion of respirable air, and partly by its
                    narcotic operation. But when breathed in a diluted state, as in an
                    ill-ventilated mine, or in a confined chamber heated by charcoal, it induces
                    giddiness, fulness of the features, ringing in the ears, gradually increasing
                    stupor, and at length profound insensibility, commonly attended with lividity of
                    the face, glistening of the eyes, and occasional convulsions, which often prove
                    fatal, and always if not speedily relieved by fresh air and other suitable
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>The narcoticoacrids may be exemplified by a great variety of well-known and
                    powerful poisons. <hi rend="italic">Hemlock,</hi> which is believed to have been
                    a familiar poison for more than two thousand years, but whose effects are very
                    generally misunderstood, ought scarcely to be arranged in this class, where it
                    is commonly placed. Its irritant properties are very ill defined. But it is a
                    powerful and very remarkable narcotic, and its active principle, named <hi
                    rend="italic">coma,</hi> is scarcely inferior to prussic acid in celerity of
                    operation, or in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193534637"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-4637-0178"/>smallness of its dose. It seems to act by
                    paralyzing the muscles of voluntary motion and of respiration, without affecting
                    the brain; and the symptoms are weakness of the limbs, gradually pervading the
                    rest of the body, and terminating in loss of the power of motion, while at the
                    same time the respiration, at first laborious, gradually becomes more and more
                    circumscribed and slower, till at length it ceases, the heart all the while
                    acting vigorously, and the sensation continuing unaffected. A better instance of
                    a narcoticoacrid poison is <hi rend="italic">nux-vomica,</hi> and its principle
                    <hi rend="italic">strychnia.</hi> These are counterparts in action to hemlock
                    and conia. They powerfully stimulate the spinal marrow, producing violent
                    convulsions, like those which attend locked jaw or tetanus, and without
                    impairing the sensibility. The first symptoms are restlessness, undefinable
                    uneasiness, and alarm, speedily followed by fits of stiffness of the jaw and
                    neck, and then by violent paroxysms of muscular contraction, in which the limbs
                    and arms are extended, the features hideously distorted, and the head, body, and
                    legs bent backward forcibly; and the third or fourth fit commonly proves fatal.
                    Strychnia, the source of these dreadful effects, is on a par with prussic acid
                    and conia in energy; for a third of a grain will kill a wild boar in ten
                    minutes, and one grain properly administered would certainly kill a man in half
                    that time. So far this genus of poisons acts like the narcotics; but, in
                    frequent instances, where the narcotic symptoms pass away, they are succeeded by
                    the signs of inflammation in the stomach and intestines, namely, pain, vomiting,
                    purging, and swelling of the belly, which affection, too, may prove fatal. Such
                    irritant effects, however, are rare, perhaps because in the great majority of
                    cases, death is brought about in the early stage by narcotism. A better example
                    still of a narcoticoacrid is <hi rend="italic">fox-glove.</hi> A most valuable
                    and safe medicine in small doses, this plant nevertheless acts as a very
                    dangerous poison in large doses; and it sometimes produces in the same case both
                    deep coma with convulsions, and likewise profuse diarrhoea, with tormina and
                    tenderness of the abdomen, while at the same time it occasions suppression of
                    urine, and extreme depression of the action of the heart. By far the most
                    characteristic illustrations, however, of the narcoticoacrid poisons are to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">deleterious fungi,</hi> or poisonous mushrooms as
                    they are sometimes called. These differ from most other poisons in their effects
                    being often put off (though to this rule exceptions exist) for several hours,
                    apparently because time must be allowed for the digestion of substances on the
                    whole difficult of digestion. The effects are singularly various; for it has
                    been often observed, that among a number of persons who have partaken of the
                    same poisonous stew, some had only giddiness, confusion, delirium, stupor, coma,
                    and convulsions; while others suffered only from vomiting and purging,
                    distension of the belly, tenderness, and griping; and a third party were seized
                    at first with the former class of symptoms, and on these passing partially off,
                    were attacked severely with the latter.</p>
                <p>Besides the irritant, narcotic, and narcoticoacrid poisons, some writers on the
                    subject admit a fourth class, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Morbid
                    poisons,</hi> comprising those poisonous secretions which are engendered in the
                    body by disease, and possess the property of reproducing by contact or
                    inoculation the same disease to which they owed their own production. The most
                    important of these are hydrophobia, the venereal disease, small-pox, and
                    cow-pox. Authors on toxicoogy, however, whether physiological or practical, have
                    generally agreed of late in discarding these from the toxicoogical system, and
                    in arranging the phenomena of their action where they are more philosophically
                    placed, namely, among natural diseases.</p>
                <p>In a work like the present, it is not easy to decide how much ought to be
                    introduced of a subject so comprehensive as toxicoogy, or the science of
                    poisons. The sketch given above will convey some idea of the objects of which it
                    treats, more especially as a branch of physiology. Farther details on the
                    subject at large seem uncalled for. But there are two departments which may be
                    enlarged on with some advantage, namely, the Evidence of poisoning, and the
                    Treatment of the effects of poisons. Poisoning, both criminal and accidental,
                    has become so common and so notorious in recent times, that there are probably
                    few persons who have not turned their thoughts to these two branches of the
                    subject; and it is desirable for many reasons that correct views should be
                    entertained of them, even by unprofessional persons,—more correct views, at
                    least, than what generally prevail.</p>
                <p>Till a very recent date, most erroneous notions were entertained, alike by the
                    vulgar as by scientific men, of the evidence of poisoning. Proofs of the most
                    unsubstantial kind were considered infallible tests of death by poison; and,
                    under the authority of grievous professional error, we how know that courts of
                    law must have sanctioned many a judicial murder. It is not uninteresting to
                    trace these dogmas of antiquity, abandoned as they now are by the scientific,
                    still obstinately adhered to by the unprofessional world as articles of popular
                    belief, and leading, as of old, to constant blunders, which it is now the
                    business and glory of the toxicoogist to check, whilst it was formerly his fate
                    to foster and give effect to them.</p>
                <p>The evidence of poisoning cannot be thoroughly understood in all its bearings,
                    without a minute knowledge of the multifarious phenomena produced by all
                    ordinary poisons; and, in judicial cases, it is in the end viewed commonly in
                    reference to the supposed administration of a particular substance. It would be
                    out of place to attempt embracing this wide field here. All which can be
                    ventured on is a view of the evidence of poisoning in a general sense, that is,
                    without reference to any special poison,—a topic of great interest in relation
                    to the first suspicions and earliest investigation of supposed cases of
                    poisoning, whether criminal or accidental. The evidence of poisoning in this
                    comprehensive sense is derived from symptoms, from appearances in the dead body,
                    from experiments on animals, from certain moral circumstances, and from chemical
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>I. The <hi rend="italic">symptoms</hi> are naturally the first particulars to
                    attract attention and excite suspicion. They were once thought adequate to
                    decide singly any question of poisoning. Now we know that natural diseases
                    imitate so closely the phenomena of poisoning, that the symptoms will rarely
                    yield more than presumptive, and only in* rare and very peculiar circumstances,
                    absolute evidence. There is nothing in the kind of symptoms taken generally
                    which will distinguish poisoning from certain natural diseases. The natural
                    diseases, indeed, which imitate the effects of one great class of poisons,
                    namely, the irritants, are on the whole rare; yet they are scarcely less a
                    source of fallacy, at least in judicial cases, where certainty, or something
                    like it, must be aimed at. But there are a number of collateral circum^ stances
                    connected with the symptoms, which, if taken together, will often supply a very
                    powerful criterion in supposed cases. Thus, in the instance of by far the
                    greater number of poisons, and of almost all which are used for a homicidal or
                    suicidal purpose, the symptoms begin soon after food, drink, or medicine has
                    been taken, commonly within an hour, often much sooner; and in respect of not a
                    few common poisons, such as the mineral acids, mineral alkalis, hartshorn,
                    prussic acid, oxalic acid, they must commence immediately. In general, too, the
                    symptoms begin suddenly, advance quickly, and prove speedily fatal. For the most
                    part they are steady in their progress, exclusive of the influence of treatment.
                    They are upon the whole uniform in their nature. And they appear in the great
                    majority of cases abruptly during a state of good health. The consideration of
                    these characters will not unfrequently enable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193534650"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-4650-0179"/> the man of experience to pronounce that
                    suspicions which have prevailed of poisoning arc wholly unfounded; but, taken
                    singly, they will never justify, on the other hand, more than a presumption in
                    favour of poisoning. It must at the same time be observed, that when these
                    general characters are all applicable, and concur with a certain complicated
                    grouping of the symptoms in particular cases, the presumption becomes very
                    strong; and when other articles of general evidence are added, the proof may be
                    all but complete, nay, absolutely so. Such is clearly the state of the case in
                    not a few instances of poisoning with the mineral acids and alkalis, with
                    arsenic, corrosive sublimate, nux-vomica, oxalic acid, prussic acid, alcoholic
                    fluids. 2. The same confident reliance was long placed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >appearances of the body after death,</hi> as in the symptoms, and with even
                    less reason. The discovery of certain morbid appearances may prove poisoning to
                    have been impossible; and yet even here an opinion should not be formed without
                    reserve, because the discovery of the effects of natural disease in the body,
                    even in an advanced stage, is no absolute proof of death from that disease.
                    Poison, as in many authentic cases, may have been nevertheless administered, and
                    have proved the real occasion of death. But there is never anything in the
                    appearances after death which will bear out a general charge of poisoning, as
                    was once universally thought. It should be particularly known, that the vulgar
                    prejudice, which discovers poison wherever the skin becomes unusually livid
                    after death, or wherever the body undergoes prompt decomposition, is utterly
                    without support from scientific experience. Nay, in regard to the latter
                    character, evidence has been proved in recent times to be deducible from the
                    very opposite condition, or the unusual preservation of the body from decay,
                    which is now well known to occur in many cases of poisoning with arsenic. There
                    are certain morbid appearances in the dead body, especially upon the skin, and
                    in the throat, gullet, and stomach, which will furnish the strongest
                    presumption, nay, according to good authorities, almost absolute proof, of
                    poisoning with certain substances, for example the mineral acids; but the
                    details cannot be entered upon here, because a full enumeration, and much
                    professional skill, are required for appreciating precisely their import. 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Experiments on domestic animals,</hi> made with suspected
                    articles, were once supposed to furnish the best of all evidence; and this was
                    probably the best evidence to be had in the days when chemistry and chemical
                    analysis were all but unknown. Now, however, such experiments are not admitted,
                    either by medical or legal authorities, to be of any weight, except under
                    particular circumstances. They are admissible, and indeed clearly indispensable,
                    for deciding questions in toxicoogical physiology which may arise during trials.
                    They ought also to be allowed some weight when they have been observed
                    accidentally, as, for example, when the remains of suspected articles have been
                    devoured incidentally by domestic animals, especially by a number of them, and
                    above all by the dog or cat, with the effect of producing in them symptoms and
                    appearances after death similar to what were witnessed in the suspected case in
                    the human subject. The objection drawn against such evidence, that the effects
                    of many poisons on the brute creation are different from their effects on man,
                    though fundamentally sound, has been allowed to operate far too sweepingly in
                    modern times. The differences in respect to many common poisons are by no means
                    so great as was thought not very long ago; and Upon two animals, the dog and the
                    cat, the effects of. most poisons are almost identical with those observed in
                    man, due attention being paid to differences in dose, and to the singular
                    facility with which these animals discharge poisons by powerful early vomiting.
                    But the objection here stated may be allowed sufficient force to put an end to
                    experiments made expressly on animals with suspected articles.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a more urgent objection to such experiments,—that they involve
                    the consumption for doubtful evidence of the materials from which decisive
                    evidence may be obtained by other means; for if there is poison enough left to
                    affect sensibly the lower animals, there is amply sufficient for detection by
                    chemical analysis. Accordingly, express experiments with remains of suspected
                    food, drink, or medicine, are now abandoned by all good authorities in
                    toxicoogy. 4. There are certain <hi rend="italic">moral circumstances</hi> which
                    may also be often taken into account in the evidence of poisoning in a general
                    sense, when viewed as a scientific question, because they cannot be correctly
                    appreciated except by a scientific man, and consequently they belong in some
                    measure to the scientific or toxicoogical proof. The chief particulars are as
                    follows. It may be proved that poison has been purchased, of a kind which may
                    produce the symptoms observed. A suspicious article may be proved to have been
                    administered, either from its taste, or from its having been recommended for
                    properties either absurd in nature, or such as the pretended article is not
                    thought even by unprofessional people to possess, or from a comparative analysis
                    of the materials for making the suspected article, showing that something
                    injurious must have been added at a particular time, and by a particular person.
                    It may be proved that exacerbations of the symptoms have repeatedly occurred
                    soon after articles were given in a suspicious manner. It may be proved that the
                    person poisoned, or a second party under suspicion, exhibited by words or deeds
                    an intention to administer poison, as by assigning impossible properties to what
                    is administered, or by manifestly changing medicine which has been prescribed. A
                    highly important circumstance is the simultaneous and similar illness of several
                    individuals who have partaken of the same meal, coupled perhaps with the degree
                    of their illnesses concurring with their respective shares, and probably also
                    united with the escape of others of the same company who did not partake of the
                    meal, or of particular dishes or liquors. Many other moral circumstances might
                    be here alluded to, by which the question of poisoning in a general sense may be
                    often materially cleared; but as they do not belong to the scientific view of
                    the question, either directly or indirectly, they may be passed over. 5. The <hi
                    rend="italic">chemical evidence</hi> is justly considered the best of all the
                    departments of proof; for it not only establishes poisoning in a general sense,
                    but likewise points out the particular poison. There is no department of
                    toxicoogy which has made such amazing progress in recent times as that of
                    toxicoogical analysis. A century ago, the search for the remains of poison in
                    suspected dishes, or in the dead body, was scarcely ever attempted, and, owing
                    to the ignorance of the chemical properties of poisons, could not have been
                    successful. Even no more than five-and-twenty years ago, the method of analysis
                    was in all cases crude and unsatisfactory, and for many poisons good processes
                    continued unknown; so that it was no uncommon thing for charges of poisoning to
                    break down, solely on account of the dubious quality of the chemical evidence.
                    But at present, , the proof of poisoning is scarcely ever defective in the
                    chemical branch; the evidence of death by poison is usually complete; and how
                    can it fail to be so in competent hands, when the chemist can, detect in the
                    most complex mixtures the minute quantity of a twentieth or fiftieth of a grain
                    of the common poisons, and when many years of interment frequently cannot
                    withdraw the crime of the poisoner from. the keenness of his search? It has been
                    proved by careful experiments, that the mineral acids, arsenic, corrosive
                    sublimate, blue vitriol, opium and its principle morphia, strychnia the
                    principle of nux-vomica, cantharides, and other le ss familiar substances, may
                    be discovered in the body of animals poisoned with them, though buried for nine
                    months; and instances have occurred of the detection of arsenic in man <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193534663" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4663-0180"/> after interment
                    for two, four, and even seven years. It does not absolutely follow that death
                    has been occasioned by poison because poison is found within the body after
                    death; for it may have been feloniously introduced afterwards, for the purpose
                    of falsely imputing poison; or, though poison has been swallowed, death may
                    nevertheless have arisen either from natural disease, or some other kind of
                    violence. Instances of such extraordinary occurrences are absolutely not
                    uncommon, sufficiently so at least to require being kept always in view. The
                    determination of them involves too refined an inquiry to be considered here. On
                    the other hand, the non-discovery of poison after death is still farther from
                    being evidence that death was not occasioned by poison. For many poisons are
                    still undiscoverable by any method of analysis; others are soon decomposed
                    within the body after death, such as prussic acid; others are quickly absorbed
                    from the stomach during life, so as to prove fatal without leaving any remains
                    behind, as in many instances of poisoning with opium; others may be expelled by
                    vomiting, and nevertheless have, in the first instance, occasioned injury enough
                    to prove fatal, as sometimes happens in the case of arsenic, and very commonly
                    in poisoning with mineral acids. It has, however, been made a subject of
                    question, whether the evidence of poisoning can ever be considered as complete,
                    so as to involve a conviction in a criminal case, unless poison be found either
                    in the body or in the remains of a suspected article which has been swallowed.
                    It appears absurd, however, to insist on the absolute necessity of such
                    evidence. For were the poisoner to choose his means skilfully, and avoid
                    over-doses, he would, on such principles, almost constantly escape. And the best
                    scientific authorities, in the most recent times, seem inclined to allow that
                    the general evidence, from the various sources detailed above, may be often so
                    strong as to leave scarcely any scientific doubt of the occurrence of poisoning;
                    and the conjunction of the circumstances of ordinary evidence may, in a legal
                    sense, entirely remove what little doubt may have existed of a scientific
                    nature. Accordingly there have been instances of condemnation lately in this and
                    other countries, where poison could not be discovered. It may be right to add,
                    that it is most singular how effectually and how quickly poisons are sometimes
                    removed beyond the reach of analysis by incidental causes, even those poisons
                    which may be detected in other circumstances in extremely minute quantities, and
                    where the methods of analysis are well understood. Prussic acid is seldom to be
                    detected if life be prolonged for half an hour, while in the ordinary cases of
                    death in a few minutes it may be discovered with ease. Arsenic, which in the
                    great majority of cases adheres obstinately to the stomach, and may in
                    consequence be detected there though life has been prolonged under frequent
                    vomiting for two days and upwards, has been known to be removed beyond the reach
                    of analysis in the short space of five hours.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">treatment of</hi> poisoning, like all other branches of
                    toxicoogy, has, within a few years, been prodigiously improved. It may be said,
                    indeed, to have been understood only within the last quarter of a century. In
                    ancient times the notions entertained of the treatment were not less crude than
                    those formed of the nature and action of poisons. Among other errors, it was
                    strangely supposed that certain counter-poisons existed, which not only
                    possessed the property of curing the effects of all poisons indifferently, but
                    which likewise, when taken for a length of time, had the faculty of impregnating
                    the constitution, and rendering it proof against the influence of any poison.
                    Princes and others often lived thus for years under the care of their
                    physicians, or protected against their treachery, by being charged with
                    conservative antidotes. After these notions were exploded, other erroneous
                    practices came into vogue; and, in particular, it was believed to be established
                    on the basis of observation, that certain antidotes, such as vinegar, milk,
                    oils, and the like, which are really not amiss in some forms of poisoning, were
                    equally efficacious in all. These illusions have been dispelled, even among
                    professional people, only within a very few years; and among the unprofessional
                    they still have currency. The clearing away of the mists of error has been
                    attended with the discovery of many real and most valuable remedies. The
                    improvement which has taken place has been owing partly to the improvements made
                    in chemistry; but in this way nothing could have been ultimately effected
                    without the aid of physiological experiment, and more especially of experiments
                    on animals, a method of inquiry, nevertheless, which it has been too much the
                    practice of an ignorant or spurious humanity to decry.</p>
                <p>The treatment of poisoning is directed to three objects, the removal of the
                    poison, the administration of an antidote, and the cure of the disorders which
                    have been produced.</p>
                <p>1. The first object, in every instance, is the prompt removal of what may remain
                    of the poison. If it had been applied outwardly to a sore or wound, it must be
                    carefully wiped or washed away. When introduced deep into or under the skin by a
                    puncture, it is to be withdrawn by suction with the mouth, and, still better,
                    with a cupping-glass, the efficacy of which is insured, as in the case of
                    snakepoison, by a bandage being applied above the wound, so as to obstruct the
                    return of blood from the veins to the heart, but without compressing the
                    arteries. Another plan, which has been found effectual in the like
                    circumstances, is simply to apply the bandage above the wound, and then to open
                    a vein between the wound and bandage, so that the poison is drawn from the wound
                    with the blood, and discharged outwardly from the orifice in the vein. Sometimes
                    it is useful to make deep scarifications before applying the cupping-glass; yet
                    in this way the bottom of the wound may be missed; and, on the whole, if
                    incisions are to be made at all, it seems better to calculate the probable depth
                    of the wound, and to remove a portion of the texture with the knife all around
                    it. The bleeding which follows commonly effects the discharge of the remaining
                    poison; but some afterwards add the use of an incandescent iron for cauterizing
                    the whole adjacent parts. The removal of the poison, when taken internally, may
                    be variously managed. But, first, care must be taken not to attempt its removal
                    when nature may have already looked after this step in the treatment, as in the
                    case of profuse, and frequent, and full vomiting. All that is necessary in such
                    circumstances, is to give occasional draughts of lukewarm water, or milk and
                    water, to render vomiting easy, and to aid in washing out the stomach. When
                    vomiting does not occur, or is not free, an emetic ought to be promptly given.
                    Whatever is nearest should be first tried, mustard, for example; but the most
                    effectual is white vitriol, in the quantity of a scruple or half a drachm,
                    dissolved in a large wine-glass-full of water, to be repeated in fifteen minutes
                    if necessary. Where the symptoms indicate narcotic poisoning,—for instance, with
                    opium,—it is essential to keep the person roused after giving the emetic,'
                    otherwise it will hardly act. Emetics, when they do operate, are greatly
                    preferable to the stomach-pump, which has been of late currently substituted for
                    them. The stomach-pump, however, is one of the most important additions which
                    have been made to the healing art in modern times. In very many instances of
                    narcotic poisoning no' emetics will operate; and all such cases, till of late,
                    inevitably perished where the quantity of poison was considerable. The
                    stomach-pump insures the prompt removal of almost all poisons; so that when used
                    in time recovery is next to certain, where formerly a large majority of cases
                    proved fatal. 2. By all such means, however, the poison <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193534676" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4676-0181"/>is often but partially
                    removed. Some of it pervades the system; more of it impregnates the tissues with
                    which it was in contact, and is ready for absorption; much of it often passes
                    down into the intestines; occasionally it adheres with obstinacy to the inner
                    membrane of the stomach, and cannot be dislodged either by emetics or by washing
                    through means of the stomach-pump. The second object, then, is to administer an
                    antidote. Antidotes have usually been conceived to be of two kinds. Some, by
                    changing the chemical form of poisons, render them inert, and are called
                    chemical antidotes. Others are thought to subdue the morbid action of poisons by
                    exciting a counter-action, and are termed constitutional antidotes. In ancient
                    times, and likewise until the recent improvements in toxicoogy, scarcely any
                    other antidotes were known, except what belonged to the constitutional class.
                    But it is now thought that in correct language scarcely any such antidote
                    exists. European physiologists are not acquainted with any decided
                    constitutional antidote for any of the numberless multitude and variety of
                    poisons now familiar to the scientific. It is very generally believed, however,
                    that savages in all quarters of the world are in possession of remedies of this
                    nature, more especially for the effects of snake-poison. Apparently authentic
                    accounts have been published, of a considerable variety of antidotes known to
                    the natives in different parts of North and South America for the bite of
                    venomous snakes. But none of these supposed antidotes have been found to stand
                    the test of scientific investigation; natives who put trust in them have been
                    seen to perish in the usual way; there is no difficulty in accounting for their
                    apparent occasional success; and those who give faith to the marvels of
                    travellers on the subject ought to consider how very extraordinary it would be,
                    if, in every part of the globe where there are savages, discoveries of this kind
                    should be made in regard to their poisons, while, with all the advantages of
                    science to aid them in the search, no civilized people have yet contrived to
                    stumble on a similar discovery in relation to any of the innumerable poisons
                    with which they have long been familiar. If constitutional antidotes are still
                    much wanted, there is no want of excellent antidotes of the chemical class. Some
                    of these act by neutralizing the chemical qualities on which the properties of
                    the poison depend, others by simply rendering the poison insoluble. Thus
                    sulphuric acid is rendered inert by magnesia, because it becomes thereby a
                    neutral salt, soluble, indeed, but no longer capable of corroding the animal
                    textures, or of exciting violent irritation. In like manner potash is rendered
                    inert, or nearly so, by lemon-juice or vinegar, or, though less easily, by oil,
                    because it is converted into neutral salts, which are feebly irritant and not at
                    all corrosive. On the other hand, oxalic acid is rendered inert by magnesia,
                    partly because its corrosive qualities are neutralized by chemical
                    neutralization, but chiefly because these, in common with its not less
                    formidable effects on the nervous system through absorption, are prevented by a
                    substance resulting which is insoluble. So, too, arsenic becomes inert when
                    brought thoroughly in contact with the hydrated peroxide of iron, because an
                    insoluble compound is formed, the arseniate of iron. In using and searching for
                    antidotes of the chemical kind, several important general rules should be
                    attended to. For, first, where a poison is a pure local irritant, destitute of
                    action through the blood or remote organs, it is usually sufficient that it be
                    neutralized; because the resulting compound is commonly but a feeble irritant,
                    although soluble. One condition, however, must be observed, namely, that the
                    antidote shall be itself innocuous, otherwise harm may be done by the antidote
                    before it comes in contact with the poison, or because it is given in excess.
                    Thus the mineral acids are unfit antidotes for neutralizing the mineral alkalis,
                    and the latter for neutralizing the former. But, secondly, when die poison is of
                    a kind which acts on remote organs through the medium of absorption, it is not
                    enough that it be chemically neutralized. For all such poisons act as such
                    throughout their soluble compounds; their compounds act on the whole in
                    proportion to their solubility; and those only are inert which are insoluble,
                    and insoluble not merely in water, but likewise in the animal fluids of the
                    stomach. Hence oxalic acid and arsenious acid (common arsenic) are not
                    neutralized in their physiological actions by being neutralized with potash;
                    prussic acid similarly treated remains as energetic as ever; and the powerful
                    vegetable alkaloids, morphia, strychnia, conia, and the like, instead of
                    becoming inert by neutralization with acids, are rendered positively more
                    active, because they are made more soluble. In the case of every poison, then,
                    it is advantageous and in very many it is indispensable, that the chemical
                    change effected shall be such as to impart to the compound insolubility; and
                    care should be taken that this insolubility shall exist in regard to the natural
                    juices of the stomach, which are commonly acidulous. But, thirdly, the antidotal
                    tendency of such chemical remedies, even when of undoubted virtue, is often
                    counteracted where the poison is a fine rather insoluble powder; for it adheres
                    forcibly to the inner coat of the stomach, irritates it to throw out tough
                    mucus, which covers the powder, and defends it against the approach of the
                    neutralizing agent. Frequent instances of such a course of things occur in the
                    case of poisoning with arsenic. 3. The last object of the treatment of poisoning
                    is the cure of the disorders which the poison has produced. These disorders,
                    since they are substantially natural diseases, must be treated as such. But
                    there are certain circumstances which render them in some measure peculiar, and
                    consequently modify the treatment. These are chiefly as follows. Treatment will
                    obviously be of little use for such disorders, until what remains of the poison
                    be removed or rendered inert; and as this object is often unattainable, ultimate
                    success is frequently beyond reach. Evacuation of the poison is in this point of
                    view of primary importance, as well as for its own sake. In the case of
                    poisoning with the irritants, the treatment is often exceedingly embarrassing,
                    because it must be simultaneously directed towards two opposite ends, the
                    suppression of inflammation by evacuating, and consequently debilitating
                    measures, and the removal of depression of the heart and general system by
                    stimulating remedies. These two contrary and incompatible objects are often the
                    cause why the best treatment proves inefficacious. The treatment of narcotic
                    poisoning is somewhat differently circumstanced. The remains of the poison being
                    removed, there is only the induced disorder to combat. These disorders are in
                    the great majority of cases functional only; that is, no structural injury has
                    been occasioned. Hence, the offending' cause having been withdrawn, there may be
                    expected to prevail in the constitution a natural tendency to throw off the
                    functional disorder,—a tendency towards recovery. Experience shows that such is
                    actually the fact. If in narcotic poisoning the remains of the poison can be
                    removed, and life can be preserved for a moderate length of time, success is
                    highly probable in a great majority of cases. Thus very few die of poisoning
                    with opium, and perhaps still fewer ought to die in skilful hands, who survive
                    for eighteen hours. In narcotic poisoning, then, the treatment for subduing the
                    disorders induced consists mainly in employing, in some instances, sedatives for
                    subduing irritation of the nervous system, but much more commonly stimulants,
                    for the purpose of keeping the person roused, and in applying various means for
                    supporting artificial respiration where the natural breathing fails. Excellent
                    methods for accomplishing the first object are now in familiar use, such as loud
                    talking, agitation of the body, injecting water into the ears, tickling the
                    nostrils, dashing cold water over the head and shoulders, applying sinapisms to
                    the calves, blistering the head with boiling water, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193534689" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4689-0182"/>internally ammonia, ether,
                    and spirits. But the best method of supporting artificial respiration has not
                    yet been discovered; there arc practical objections to all the methods yet
                    devised; and it is only when these shall be perfected, that the treatment of
                    narcotic poisoning will be rendered substantially superior to what it is at
                    present. It is not unlikely that galvanism will be found a material part of the
                    most efficacious method,—applied, however, not continuously, as is often
                    practised, but interruptedly, so as not to disturb the alternate contractions
                    and relaxations of the respiratory muscles.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations on the effects and treatment of poisoning, poisons
                    have been regarded solely in their operation on the animal body. But they were
                    defined at the outset as acting on living bodies generally; and upon vegetables
                    their action is not less remarkable than upon animals. This branch of the
                    subject has been hitherto little studied; but what is already known of it seems
                    full of interest both in a physiological and in a practical point of view. It
                    appears that in a general sense there is a close analogy between the actions
                    exerted by poisons on both divisions of the living world. As there are two
                    leading effects produced in animals, so are there two great classes of phenomena
                    developed in vegetables, those of irritation and those of narcotism, or at least
                    of an action closely analogous. The apparent phenomena of both kinds are indeed
                    much simpler in vegetable than in animal beings, partly because the organs and
                    functions of the former are more simple than those of the latter, partly because
                    physiologists have not yet ascertained with precision the special changes that
                    are induced. Still, however, it is easy to trace in vegetables the leading
                    effects produced by irritants and by narcotics respectively, upon animals. The
                    former occasion partial or general disorganization or death of the organs of
                    plants to which they are directly applied, and the plant may eventually either
                    recover or perish, according to the extent of the injury or the importance of
                    the organ injured. The latter seem to act upon the vitality of the plant,
                    without in general producing any marked change of a local nature, or such as may
                    be referred to a direct impression, at least until the first signs of vital
                    depression appear; and it is commonly observed, that so soon as such signs of
                    depression do make their appearance, however slight they may be, they quickly
                    pervade the whole plant, which in consequence perishes irrevocably. The
                    irritants appear to act topically, and from without inwards; the narcotics act
                    more generally, and from within outwards, being probably first absorbed.</p>
                <p>Poisons act upon vegetables, through whatever channel they are introduced, and to
                    whatever organ they are applied, provided the texture be such as to admit of
                    their passage to those parts which are more or less directly connected with
                    life. The organs through which they act with greatest energy are the leaves and
                    the roots. Liquid poisons act with most energy through the roots; gaseous
                    poisons are probably most energetic when applied to the leaves. Partial action
                    is sometimes produced by the topical application of a general or narcotic
                    poison; thus arsenic introduced into the axilla of a leaf of the <hi
                    rend="italic">dipsacus</hi><hi rend="italic">fullonum</hi> kills the whole
                    superior part of the plant on the side corresponding with the leaf. Vegetable
                    poisons are not less energetic than mineral poisons. Nay, however extraordinary
                    it may appear, there seems no question that plants may be promptly killed by
                    their own poisons,—that the poison produced by a particular species may kill
                    that species as readily as it will others, if applied to the root so as to be
                    absorbed into the nutritive juices. This singular phenomenon may depend on the
                    poison being secreted and confined in particular receptacles in the ordinary
                    state of the plant. But another and more intelligible explanation in regard to
                    certain poisons may be drawn from the well-ascertained fact, that some vegetable
                    poisons, and probably more of them than the physiologist may at present be
                    inclined to admit, do not exist ready formed in the plants whence they are
                    obtained, but are produced only when certain principles, existing naturally
                    apart in distinct receptacles, are brought in contact by mechanical force or
                    chemical manipulations. A remarkable instance in point is the essential oil of
                    the bitter-almond kernel, or cherrylaurel leaf, which does not exist ready
                    formed, otherwise it would be betrayed, like other essential oils, by its
                    powerful odour, but is formed only when certain principles, named <hi
                    rend="italic">amygdalin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">emulsin,</hi> are brought in
                    contact with each other and with water.</p>
                <p>No poisons are better fitted for illustrating the phenomena of poisoning in
                    vegetables, or better deserve the attention of physiologists and practical men,
                    than those which are gaseous in their nature. Most of them seem to act in
                    excessively minute quantities and proportions. A tenth part of a cubic inch of
                    muriatic acid gas, which is equivalent to the twenty-fifth part of a grain by
                    weight, will in no long time destroy a small plant, although the gas be diluted
                    with twenty thousand times its volume of air; and the devastating effects
                    produced on surrounding vegetation by all manufactories where this acid is
                    thrown abundantly into the atmosphere, as in the manufacture of black-ash and
                    soda from sea-salt, abundantly show that far less proportions will prove equally
                    deleterious when applied continuously. Sulphurous acid gas acts with nearly as
                    great intensity. The effect of either of these poisons is simply to shrivel and
                    wither the leaves and buds, like the action of frost in spring; and the plant
                    will eventually recover if removed in time from the influence of the noxious
                    agent, but with the loss of its foliage. Other gases, such as sulphuretted
                    hydrogen and cyanogen, produce no visible change until the leaves begin to bend
                    and droop; after which the drooping quickly extends, till at length the whole
                    plant becomes flaccid, so as to present exactly the same appearance as when
                    deprived of moisture; and it perishes inevitably.</p>
                <p>Some substances which are poisonous to animals are not poisonous to vegetables.
                    The experiments which have been made on this subject are neither sufficiently
                    extensive nor sufficiently exact to warrant any general deductions. A very
                    remarkable instance is carbonic acid gas, a small proportion of which in the
                    atmosphere will speedily extinguish animal life, but which is innocuous to
                    vegetables in almost any proportion, nay, on the contrary, is commonly thought
                    to supply them with aliment.</p>
                <p>Poisons arc by no means without their uses in the economy of nature. It is in the
                    first place not improbable that vegetable poisons serve some purpose in the
                    economy of the plants which produce them. On this point we are still much in the
                    dark, in consequence of the little advancement which has been hitherto made in
                    vegetable physiology. But one purpose of the kind seems to be the perpetuation
                    and extension of such plants, by rendering them unfit for the food of
                    herbivorous animals and frugivorous birds, which by instinct commonly avoid
                    them. In the case of certain poisons of the animal kingdom, their purpose is
                    obviously to preserve the animals which are endowed with them, by enabling them
                    to destroy their prey and their enemies. Another important use to which poisons
                    from every kingdom may be applied, is for the treatment of diseases. A very
                    close connection subsists between medicinal and poisonous action. This is
                    sufficiently shown perhaps by the undoubted fact, that, with very few
                    exceptions, our best medicines are active poisons; and, conversely, that there
                    are few active poisons which have not been turned to account as useful
                    medicines. Besides, in the greater number of instances, the two properties,
                    medicinal virtue and poisonous influence, are plainly nothing <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193534702" xml:id="kp-eb0718-4702-0183"/>else than manifestations of
                    the same action, differing merely somewhat in degree, which is well exemplified
                    by most purgatives and emetics, by opium, henbane, prussic acid, and other
                    anodynes, and by counter-irritants, or substances employed for irritating the
                    skin. In other instances, again, where the poisonous and medicinal actions are
                    to appearance different and unconnected, the existence of some relationship
                    between them seems to be pointed out by the activity of the substances as drugs
                    being proportioned to their energy as poisons. Another purpose to which some
                    poisons are applied is for the destruction of the lower animals for the use of
                    man. In most parts of the world, where the primitive habits of mankind have not
                    been materially modified by civilization, poisons of great energy are familiarly
                    employed for the destruction of game, and in some countries also for killing
                    beasts and birds of prey. In civilized countries they have hitherto been used
                    chiefly for the more ignoble purpose of getting rid of vermin. But they arc
                    susceptible of far more important applications of the same nature; which,
                    however, have been as yet entirely overlooked. (x. x. x. x.)</p>

                    >Bohun Upas,</hi> is a tree which has often been described by naturalists; but
                    its existence has been very generally doubted, and the descriptions given of it,
                    containing much of the marvellous, have been treated as idle fictions. Μ.
                    Foersch, however, in an account of it, written in Dutch, asserts that it does
                    exist, that he made the most particular inquiries, and that he found it was
                    situated in the island of Java, about twenty-seven leagues from Batavia. The
                    poison procured from the Upas .is said to be a gum, issuing from between the
                    bark and the tree, and brought by malefactors who have been condemned to
                    death.</p>
                <p>But a variety of circumstances conspire to prove that Foersch’s account of the
                    tree is extremely suspicious. Although he had letters of introduction, he went
                    to no con siderable house, and afterwards withdrew amongst the English. The
                    distances given to mark the situation of the tree are not accurate. The
                    execution of criminals is different from what he represents. There were no such
                    disturbances in 1775 as those stated by Foersch, the tract to which he alludes
                    having submitted to the Dutch East India Company as early as 1756. And, lastly,
                    the assertions and pretended facts of Foersch are supported by no collateral
                    evidence. Sir George Staunton, during his stay at Batavia, made the most
                    particular inquiries concerning the Upas, but found that the existence of such a
                    tree had never been known there.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    with the Pattch (native chief), he told me that there was a valley only three
                    miles from Balor, that no person could approach without forfeiting their lives,
                    and that the skeletons of human beings, and all sorts of beasts and birds,
                    covered the bottom of the valley. I mentioned this to the commandant, Mr Van
                    Spree wenberg, and proposed that we should go to see it. Mr Daendels, the
                    assistant-resident, agreed to go with us. At this time I did not believe all
                    that the Javanese chief told me. I knew there was a lake close to this, and that
                    it was dangerous to approach too near, but I had never heard of the Valley of
                    Death.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Balor, 4th July..</hi>
                    —Early this morning we made an excursion to the extraordinary valley called by
                    the natives <hi rend="italic">Guteo Upat, or</hi> Poisoned Valley; it is three
                    miles from Balor, on the road to the Djienz. Mr Daendels had ordered a footpath
                    to be made from the main road to the valley. We took with us two dogs and some
                    fowls, to try experiments in this poisonous hollow. On arriving at the foot of
                    the mountain, we dismounted and scrambled up the side, about a quarter of a
                    mile, holding on by the branches of trees ∙, and we were a good deal fatigued
                    before we got up the path, being very steep and slippery from the fall of rain
                    during the night. When within a few yards of the valley, we experienced a
                    strong, nauseous, suffocating smell; but on coming close to its edge, this
                    disagreeable smell left us. We were now all lost in astonishment at the awful
                    scene before us. The valley appeared to be about half a mile in circumference,
                    oval, and the depth from thirty to thirty-fh <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e
                    feet; the bottom quite flat; <hi rend="italic">no</hi> vegetation; some very
                    large (in appearance) river-stones; and the whole covered with the skeletons of
                    human beings, tigers, pigs, deer, peacocks, and all sorts of birds. We could not
                    perceive any vapour or any opening in the ground, which last appeared to us to
                    be of a hard sandy substance. It was now proposed by one of the party to enter
                    the valley; but at the spot where we were this was difficult, at least for me,
                    as one false step would have brought us to eternity, seeing no assistance could
                    be given. We lighted our cigars, and with the assistance of a bamboo, we went
                    down within eighteen feet of the bottom. Here we did not experience any
                    difficulty in breathing, but an offensive, nauseous smell annoyed us. We now
                    fastened a dog to the end of a bamboo, eighteen feet long, and sent him in; we
                    had our watches in our hands, and in fourteen seconds he fell on his back, did
                    not move his limbs or look round, but continued to breathe eighteen minutes. We
                    then sent in another, or rather he got loose from the bamboo, and walked in to
                    where the other dog was lying; he then stood quite still, and in ten seconds he
                    fell on his face, and never afterwards moved his limbs; he continued to breathe
                    for seven minutes. We now tried a fowl, which died in a minute and a half. We
                    threw in another, which died before touching the ground. During these
                    experiments we experienced a heavy shower of rain; but we were so interested by
                    the awful scene before us, that we did not care for getting wet. On the opposite
                    side, near a large stone, was the skeleton of a human being, who must have
                    perished on his back, with the right arm under his head. From being exposed to
                    the weather, the bones were bleached as white as ivory. I was anxious to procure
                    this skeleton, but any attempt to get at it would have been madness. After
                    remaining two hours in this Valley of Death we returned, but found some
                    difficulty in getting out The human skeletons arc supposed to be those of rebels
                    who had been pursued from the main road, and taken refuge in the different
                    valleys; as a wanderer cannot know his danger till he is in the valley, and,
                    when once there, he has not the power or⅝hc presence of mind to
                    return.”</p><p>Mr Loudon conceives that there is a great difference between this
                    valley and the Grotto del Cane, near Naples. In the Grotto the air is confined
                    to a small aperture, whilst in the valley the circumference is fully half a
                    mile, and not the least smell of sulphur, nor any appearance of an eruption
                    having taken place near it, although the whole chain of mountains is volcanic,
                    and there are two craters which constantly emit smoke, at no great distance from
                    the side of the road at the foot of the Djienz. It thus appears that the story
                    told by Foersch is an entire fabrication, and that the notion of a poison-tree
                    is a pure romance; but, like most fictions, it has a thread of truth interwoven
                    in its texture, some of the circumstances agreeing with those above stated, but
                    at the same time proving that Foersch had never visited the Valley of
                    Death,</p></note></p>
