                <p><label type="entry">PLEASURE</label> is a word so universally understood that it
                    needs no explanation. Lexicoraphers, however, who must attempt to explain every
                    word, call it “the gratification of the mind or senses.” It is directly opposed
                    to <hi rend="italic">pain,</hi> and constitutes the whole of positive happiness,
                    as that does of misery.</p>
                <p>The Author of Nature has furnished us with many pleasures, as well as made us
                    liable to many pains; and we are susceptible of both in some degree as soon as
                    we have life and are endowed with the faculty of sensation. A French writer, in
                    a work<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> articles <hi rend="italic">Logique, Métaphysique,
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">Morale,</hi> tom. iv.</p></note> which once raised high
                    expectations, contends that a child in the womb of its mother feels neither
                    pleasure nor pain. “These sensations,” says he, “are not innate; they have their
                    origin from without; and it is at the moment of our birth that the soul receives
                    the first impressions; impressions slight and superficial at the beginning, but
                    which by time and repeated acts leave deeper traces in the sensorium, and become
                    more extensive and more lasting. It is when the child sends forth its first
                    cries that sensibility or the faculty of sensation is produced, which in a short
                    time gathers strength and stability by the impression of exterior objects.
                    Pleasure and pain not being innate, and being only acquired in the same manner
                    as the qualities which we derive from instruction, education, and society, it
                    follows that we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other science.”</p>
                <p>This is strange reasoning and strange language. That sensations are not innate is
                    universally acknowledged; but it does not therefore follow that the soul
                    receives its first impressions and first sensations at the moment of birth. The
                    child has life, the power of locomotion, and the sense of touch, long before it
                    is born; and every mother will tell this philosopher that an infant unborn
                    exhibits symptoms both of pain and of pleasure. That many of our organs of sense
                    are improved by use is incontrovertible; but it is so far from being true that
                    our sensible pleasures become more exquisite by being often repeated, that the
                    contrary is experienced in far the greater part of them; and though external
                    objects, by making repeated impressions on the senses, certainly leave deeper
                    traces on the memory than an object once perceived can do, it by no means
                    follows that these impressions become the more delightful the more familiar that
                    they are to us. That we learn to suffer and enjoy as we learn any other science,
                    is a most extravagant paradox; for it is self-evident that we cannot live
                    without being capable in some degree both of suffering and enjoyment, though a
                    man may certainly live to old age in profound ignorance of all the sciences.</p>
                <p>The same writer assures us, indeed, that sensation is not necessary to human
                    life. “Philosophers,” says he, “make mention of a man who had lost every kind of
                    feeling in every member of his body; he was pinched or pricked to no purpose.
                    Meanwhile this man made use of all his members; he walked without pain, he
                    drank, ate, and slept, without perceiving that he did so. Sensible neither to
                    pleasure nor pain, he was a true natural machine.”</p>
                <p>To the tale of these anonymous philosophers the author before us gives implicit
                    credit, whilst at the same instant he favours us with the following
                    argumentation, which completely proves its falsehood. “It is true that sensation
                    is a relative quality, susceptible of increase and diminution; that it is not
                    necessary to existence, and that one might live without it; but in this case he
                    would live as an automaton, without feeling pleasure or pain; and he would
                    possess neither idea, nor reflection, nor desire, nor passion, nor will, nor
                    sentiment; his existence would be merely passive, he would live without knowing
                    it, and die without apprehension.”</p>
                <p>But if this man of the philosophers, whom our author calls an automaton, and a
                    true natural machine, had neither idea, nor desire, nor passion, nor will, nor
                    sentiment (and without sensation he certainly could have none of them), what
                    induced him to walk, eat, or drink, or to cease from any of these operations
                    after they were accidentally begun? The instances of the automata which played
                    on the flute and at chess are not to the purpose for which they are produced;
                    for there is no parallel between them and this natural machine, unless the
                    philosophers wound up their man to eat, drink, walk, or sit, as Vacanson and
                    Kempeler wound up their automata to play or cease from playing on the German
                    flute and at chess.</p>
                <p>The author having for a while sported with these harmless paradoxes, proceeds to
                    put the credulity of his reader to the test in regard to others of a very
                    contrary tendency. He institutes an inquiry concerning the superiority, in
                    number and degree, of the pleasures enjoyed by the different orders of men in
                    society; and labours, not indeed by argument, but by loose declamation, to
                    propagate the belief that happiness is very unequally distributed. The pleasures
                    of the rich, he says, must be more numerous and exquisite than those of the
                    poor; the nobleman must have more enjoyments than the plebeian of equal wealth;
                    and the king, according to him, must be the happiest of all men. He owns,
                    indeed, that although birth, rank, honours, and dignity add to happiness, a man
                    is not to be considered as miserable because he is born in the lower conditions
                    of life. A man may be happy as a mechanic, a merchant, or a labourer, provided
                    he enters into the spirit of his profes- - sion, and has not imbibed, by a
                    misplaced education, those sentiments which make his condition insupportable.
                    Happiness is of easy acquisition in the middling stations of lifo; and though
                    perhaps we are unable to know or to estimate exactly the pleasure which arises
                    from contentment and mediocrity, yet happiness being a kind of aggregate of
                    delights, of riches, and of advantages more or less great, every person must
                    have a share of it; the division is not exactly made, but, all other things
                    being equal, there will be more in the elevated than in the inferior conditions
                    of society; the enjoyment will be more felt, the means of enjoying more
                    multiplied, and the pleasures more varied. Birth, rank, fortune, talents, wit,
                    genius, and virtue, are then die great sources of happiness; those advantages
                    are so considerable, that we see men contented with any one of them; but their
                    union forms supreme felicity. &lt;</p>
                <p>“There is so vast a difference, says Voltaire, between a man who has made his
                    fortune and one who has to make it, that they are scarcely to be considered as
                    creatures of the same kind. The same thing may be said of birth, the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193533012" xml:id="kp-eb0718-3012-0053"/> greatest of all
                    advantages in a large society; of rank, of honours, and of great abilities. How
                    great a difference is made between a person of high birth and a tradesman;
                    between a Newton or Descartes and a simple mathematician! Ten thousand soldiers
                    are killed on the field of battle, and it is scarcely mentioned; but if the
                    general fall, and especially if he be a man of courage and abilities, the court
                    and city are filled with the news of his death, and the mourning is
                    universal.</p>
                <p>“Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, felt in a more lively manner than perhaps
                    any other man the value of great talents. I would willingly renounce, said he to
                    Voltaire, every thing which is an object of desire and ambition to man; but I am
                    certain if I were not a prince I •should be nothing. Your merit alone would gain
                    you the esteem, and envy, and admiration of the world; but to secure respect for
                    me, titles, and armies, and revenues, are absolutely necessary.”</p>
                <p>For what purpose this account of human happiness was published, it is not for us
                    to say. Its obvious tendency, however, is to make the lower orders of society
                    discontented with their state, and envious of their superiors; and it is not
                    unreasonable to suppose, that it contributed in some degree to excite the
                    ignorant part of the author’s countrymen to the commission of those atrocities
                    of which they have since been guilty. That such was his intention, the following
                    extract will not permit us to believe; for though in it the author attempts to
                    support the same false theory of human happiness, he mentions virtuous kings
                    with the respect becoming a loyal subject of the unfortunate Louis, whose
                    character he seems to have intentionally drawn, and whose death by the authority
                    of a savage faction he has in effect foretold.</p>
                <p>“Happiness, in a state of society, takes the most variable forms; it is a Proteus
                    susceptible of every kind of metamorphosis; it is different in different men, in
                    different ages, and in different conditions. The pleasures of youth are very
                    different from those of old age; what affords enjoyment to a mechanic, would be
                    supreme misery to a nobleman; and the amusements of the country would appear
                    insipid in the capital. Is there, then, nothing fixed with regard to happiness?
                    Is it of all things the most variable and the most arbitrary? Or, in judging of
                    it, is it impossible to find a standard by which we can determine the limits of
                    the greatest good to which man can arrive in the present state? It is evident
                    that men form the same ideas of the beautiful and sublime in nature, and of
                    right and wrong in morality, provided they have arrived at that degree of
                    improvement and civilization of which human nature is susceptible; and that
                    different opinions on these subjects depend on different degrees of culture, of
                    education, and of improvement. The same thing may be advanced with regard to
                    happiness: all men, if equal with respect to their organs, would form the very
                    same ideas on this subject if they reached the degree of improvement of which we
                    are presently speaking; and, in fact, do we not see in the great circles at
                    Rome, at Vienna, at London, and at Paris, that those who are called people of
                    fashion, who have received the same education, have nearly the same taste, the
                    same desires, and the same spirit for enjoyment? There is doubtless <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> certain degree of happiness to be enjoyed in every
                    condition of life; but as there are some conditions preferable to others, so are
                    there degrees of happiness greater and less; and if we were to form an idea of
                    the greatest possible in the present state, it perhaps would be that of a
                    sovereign, master of a great empire, enjoying good health and a moderate spirit;
                    endowed with piety and virtue; whose whole life was employed in acts of justice
                    and mercÿ, and who governed by fixed and immoveable laws. Such a king is the
                    image of the Divinity on earth, and he must ba the idol of a wise people. His
                    whole life should present a picture of the most august felicity. Although such
                    sovereigns are rare, yet we are not without examples of them. ∙ Ancient history
                    affords us Titus and Marcus Aurelius, and the present age can boast of piety and
                    munificence in the character of some of its kings. This state of the greatest
                    happiness to which man can reach not being ideal, it will serve as a standard of
                    comparison by which happiness and misery can be estimated in all civilized
                    countries. <hi rend="italic">He is as hoppy</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    αs</hi><hi rend="italic">a king,</hi> is a proverbial expression, because we
                    believe with justice that royalty is the extreme limit of the greatest
                    enjoyments; and, in fact, happiness being the work of man, that condition which
                    comprehends all the degrees of power and of glory, which is the source of honour
                    and of dignity, and which supposes in the person invested with it all means of
                    enjoyment either for himself or others, leaves nothing on this earth to which
                    any reasonable man would give the preference.</p>
                <p>“We can find also in this high rank the extreme of the greatest evils to which
                    the condition of nature is exposed. A king condemned to death and perishing on a
                    scaffold, by the authority of a faction, while at the same time he had
                    endeavoured, by every means in his power, to promote the general happiness of
                    his subjects, is the most terrible and striking example of human misery; for if
                    it be true that a crown is the greatest of all blessings, then the loss of it,
                    and at the same time the loss of life by an ignominious and unjust sentence, are
                    of all calamities the most dreadful.</p>
                <p>“It is also in the courts of kings that we find the most amiable and perfect
                    characters; and it is there where true grandeur, true politeness, the best tone
                    of manners, the most amiable graces, and the most eminent virtues, are
                    completely established. It is in courts that men seem to have acquired their
                    greatest improvement. Whosoever has seen a court, says La Bruyère, has seen the
                    world in the most beautiful, the most enchanting, and attractive colours. The
                    prejudices of mankind in behalf of the great are so excessive, that if they
                    inclined to be good they would be almost the objects of adoration.”</p>
                <p>In this passage there are doubtless many just observations. But there is at least
                    an equal number of others both false and dangerous. That a crown is the greatest
                    of all earthly blessings, and that it is in the courts of kings that we meet
                    with the most amiable and perfect characters, are positions which a true
                    philosopher will not admit, except with great limitations. The falsehood of the
                    author’s -general theory respecting the unequal distribution of happiness in
                    society, we need not waste time in exposing. It is sufficiently refuted in other
                    articles of this work. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy.)</hi> He
                    enters upon other speculations respecting the pleasures and pains of savages,
                    which are ingenious, and worthy of attention; but before we proceed to notice
                    them, it will be proper to consider the connection which subsists between
                    pleasure and pain.</p>
                <p>“That the cessation of pain is accompanied by pleasure, is a fact, “says Dr
                    Sayers,” which has been repeatedly observed, but perhaps not sufficiently
                    accounted for. Let us suppose a person in a state of indifference as to heat.
                    Upon coming near a fire, he will experience at first an agreeable warmth, that
                    is, pleasure. If the heat be increased, this state of pleasure will, after a
                    time, be converted into one of pain, from the increased action upon the nerves
                    and brain, the undoubted organs of all bodily sensations. Let the heat now be
                    gradually withdrawn; the nervous system must acquire again, during this removal,
                    the state of agreeable warmth or pleasure; and after passing through that state
                    it will arrive at indifference. From this fact then we may conclude that a state
                    of pleasure may be pushed on till it is converted into one of pain; and, on the
                    other hand, that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193533025"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-3025-0054"/>an action which produces pain will, if it go off
                    gradually, induce at a certain period of its decrease a state of pleasure. The
                    same reasoning which has thus been applied to the body may be extended also to
                    the mind. Total languor of mind is not so pleasant as a certain degree of action
                    or emotion; and emotions pleasant at one period may be increased till they
                    become painful at another; whilst painful emotions, as they gradually expire,
                    will, at a certain period of their decrease, induce a state of pleasure. Hence
                    then we are able to explain why pleasure should arise in all cases from the
                    gradual cessation of any action or emotion which produces pain.”</p>
                <p>The same author maintains, that from the mere removal of pain, whether by degrees
                    or instantaneously, we always experience pleasure; and if the pain removed was
                    exquisite, what he maintains is certainly true. To account for this phenomenon
                    he lays down the following law of nature, which experience abundantly confirms,
                    viz. “that the temporary withdrawing of any action from the body or mind
                    invariably renders them more Susceptible of that action when again produced.”
                    Thus, after long fasting, the body is more susceptible of the effects of food
                    than if the stomach had been lately satisfied; the action of strong liquors is
                    found to be greater on those who use them seldom than on such as are in the
                    habit of drinking them. Thus, too, with respect to the mind; if a person be
                    deprived for a time of his friend’s society, or of a favourite amusement, the
                    next visit of his friend, or the next renewal of his amusement, is attended with
                    much more pleasure than if they had never been withheld from him.</p>
                <p>“To apply this law to the case of a person suddenly relieved from acute pain.
                    While he labours with such pain, his mind is so totally occupied by it, that he
                    is unable to attend to his customary pursuits or amusements. He becomes
                    therefore so much more susceptible of their action, that when they are again
                    presented to him, he is raised above his usual indifference to positive
                    pleasure. But all pains do not proceed from an excess of action. Many of them
                    arise from reducing the body or the mind to a state below indifference. Thus, if
                    a person have just sufficient warmth in his body to keep him barely at ease or
                    in a state of indifference, by withdrawing this heat, a state of uneasiness or
                    pain is produced; and if in a calm state of mind one be made acquainted with a
                    melancholy event, his quiet is interrupted, and he sinks below indifference,
                    into a painful state of mind. If, now, without communicating any new source of
                    pleasure, we remove in the former case the cold, and in the latter the grief,
                    the persons from whom they are removed will experience real pleasure. Thus,
                    then, whether pain arises from excess or deficiency of action, the gradual or
                    the sudden removal of it must be in all cases attended with pleasure.”<note

                    and Literary.</p></note> It is equally true that the gradual or sudden removal
                    of pleasure is attended with pain.</p>
                <p>We are now prepared to examine the French author’s account of the pleasures and
                    pains of savages. “Every age,” says he, “has its different pleasures; but if we
                    were to imagine that those of childhood are equal to those of confirmed age, we
                    should be much mistaken in our estimation of happiness. The pleasures of
                    philosophy, either natural or moral, are not unfolded to the infant; the most
                    perfect music is a vain noise; the most exquisite perfumes and dishes highly
                    seasoned offend his young organs instead of affording delight; his touch is
                    imperfect; forty days elapse before the child gives any sign of laughter or of
                    weeping; his cries and groans before that period are not accompanied with tears;
                    his countenance expresses no passion; the parts of his face bear no relation to
                    the sentiments of the soul, and are moreover without consistency. Children are
                    but little affected with cold; whether it be that they feel less, or that the
                    interior heat is greater than in adults. In them all the impressions of pleasure
                    and pain are transitory; their memory has scarcely begun to unfold its powers;
                    they enjoy nothing but the present moment; they weep, laugh, and give tones of
                    satisfaction without consciousness, or at least without reflection; their joy is
                    confined to the indulgence of their little whims, and constraint is the greatest
                    of their misfortunes; few things amuse, and nothing satisfies them. In this
                    happy condition of early infancy nature is at the whole expense of happiness;
                    and the only point is not to contradict her. What desires have children? Give
                    them liberty in all their movements, and they have a plenitude of existence, an
                    abundance of that kind of happiness which is confined in some sort to all the
                    objects which surround them; but if all beings were happy on the same
                    conditions, society would be at no expense in procuring the happiness of the
                    different individuals who compose it. Sensation is the foundation of reflection;
                    it is the principal attribute of the soul; it is by this that man is elevated to
                    sublime speculations, and secures his dominion over nature and himself. This
                    quality is not stationary, but susceptible, like all other relative qualities,
                    of increase and decay, of different degrees of strength and intenseness: it is
                    different in different men; and in the same man it increases from infancy to
                    youth, from youth to confirmed manhood: at this period it stops, and gradually
                    declines as we proceed to old age and to second childishness. Considered
                    physically, it varies according to age, constitution, climate, and food;
                    considered in a moral point of view, it takes its different appearances from
                    individual education, and from the habits of society; for man in a state of
                    nature and society, with regard to sensation and the unfolding of his powers,
                    may be considered as two distinct beings; and if one were to make a calculation
                    of pleasure in the course of human life, a man of fortune and capacity enjoys
                    more than ten thousand savages.</p>
                <p>“Pleasure and pain being relative qualities, they may be almost annihilated in
                    the moment of vehement passion. In the heat of battle, for example, ardent and
                    animated spirits have not felt the pain of their wounds; and minds strongly
                    penetrated with sentiments of religion, enthusiasm, and humanity, have supported
                    the most cruel torments with courage and fortitude. The sensibility of some
                    persons is so exquisitely alive, that one can scarcely approach them without
                    throwing them into convulsions. Many diseases show the effect of sensibility
                    pushed to an extreme; such as hysteric affections, certain kinds of madness, and
                    some of those which proceed from poison, and from the bite or sting of certain
                    animals, as the viper and the tarantula. Excessive joy or grief, fear and
                    terror, have been known to destroy all sensation, and occasion death.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are instances of
                    persons who have died in consequence of the noise of thunder, without being
                    touched. A man frightened by the fell of a gallery in which he happened to be,
                    was immediately seized with the black jaundice. Μ. le Cat mentions a young
                    person on whom the insolence of another made such an impression, that his
                    countenance became at first yellow, and then changed into black, in such a
                    manner that in less than eight days he appeared to wear a mask of black velvet;
                    and he continued in this state for four months, without any other symptom of bad
                    health, or any pain. A sailor was so terrified in a storm, that his face sweated
                    blood, which, like ordinary sweat, returned as it was wiped off. Stahl, whose
                    testimony cannot be called in question, cites a similar case of a girl who had
                    been frightened by soldiers. The excess of fear, according to many physicians,
                    produces madness and epilepsy.</p></note></p>
                <p>Having made these preliminary observations on pleasure and pain in infancy, and
                    as they are increased Or diminished by education, and the different conditions
                    of body and mind, the same author proceeds to consider the capability of savages
                    to feel pleasure and pain. “By savages he understands all the tribes of men who
                    live by hunting and fishing, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193533038"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-3038-0055"/>and on those things which the earth yields without
                    cultivation. Those tribes who possess herds of cattle, and who derive their
                    subsistence from such possessions, are not to be considered as savages, as they
                    have some idea of property. Some savages are naturally compassionate and humane,
                    others are cruel and sanguinary. Although the physical constitution of man be
                    everywhere the same, yet the varieties of climate, the abundance or scarcity of
                    natural productions, have a powerful influence to determine the inclinations;
                    even the fierceness of the tiger is softened under a mild sky. Now nature forms
                    the manners of savages just as society and civil institutions form the manners
                    of civilized life. In the one case climate and food produce almost the whole
                    effect; in the other they have scarcely any influence. The habits of society
                    every moment contend with nature, and they are almost always victorious. The
                    savage devotes himself to the dominion of his passions; the civilized man is
                    employed in restraining, in directing, and in modifying them: so much influence
                    have government, laws, society, and the fear of censure and punishment, over his
                    soul.</p>
                <p>“It is not to he doubted that savages are susceptible both of pleasure and pain;
                    but arc the impressions made on their organs as sensible, or do they feel pain
                    in the same degree with the inhabitants of a civilized country?</p>
                <p>“Their enjoyments are so limited, that if we confine ourselves to truth, a few
                    lines will be sufficient to describe them: our attention must therefore be
                    confined to pain, because the manner in which they support misfortune, and even
                    torture, presents us with a view of character unequalled in the history of
                    civilized nations. It is not uncommon in civilized countries to see men braving
                    death, meeting it with cheerfulness, and even not uttering complaints under the
                    torture; but they do not insult the executioners of public vengeance, and defy
                    pain in order to augment their torments; and those who are condemned by the laws
                    suffer the punishment with different degrees of fortitude. On those mournful
                    occasions, the common ranks of mankind in general die with less firmness: those,
                    on the other hand, who have received education, and who by a train of
                    unfortunate events are brought to the scaffold, whether it be the fear of being
                    reproached with cowardice, or the consideration that the stroke is inevitable,
                    such men discover the expiring sighs of self-love even in their last moments;
                    and those, especially of high rank, from their manners and sentiments, are
                    expected to meet death with magnanimity: but an American savage in the moment of
                    punishment appears to be more than human; he is a hero of the first order, who
                    braves his tormentors, who provokes them to employ all their art, and who
                    considers it his chief glory to bear the greatest degree of pain without
                    shrinking. The recital of their tortures would appear exaggerated, if it were
                    not attested by the best authority, and if the savage nations among whom those
                    customs are established were not sufficiently known; but the excess of the
                    cruelty is not so astonishing as the courage of the victim. The European exposed
                    to sufferings of the same dreadful nature would rend heaven and earth with his
                    piercing cries and horrible groans; the reward of martyrdom, the prospect of
                    eternal life, could alone give him fortitude to endure such torments; but the
                    savage is not animated with this exalted hope. What supports him, then, in
                    scenes of so exquisite suffering? The feeling of shame, the fear of bringing
                    reproach on his tribe, and giving a stain to his fellows never to be wiped away,
                    are the only sentiments which influence the mind of a savage, and which, always
                    present to his imagination, animate him, support him, and lend him spirit and
                    resolution. At the same time, however powerful those motives may be, they would
                    not be alone sufficient, if the savage felt pain in the same degree with the
                    European. Sensibility, as we have already observed, is increased by education;
                    it is influenced by society, manners, laws,' and government; climate and food
                    work it into a hundred different shapes; and all the physical and moral causes
                    contribute to increase and diminish it. The habitual existence of a savage would
                    be a state of suffering to an inhabitant of Europe. You must cut the flesh of
                    the one, and tear it away with your nails, before you can make him feel in an
                    equal degree to a scratch or prick of a needle in the other. The savage,
                    doubtless, suffers under torture, but he suffers much less than an European in
                    the same circumstances: the reason is obvious; the air which the savages breathe
                    is loaded with fog and moist vapours; their rivers not being confined by high
                    banks, are by the winds as well as in floods spread over the level fields, and
                    deposit on them a putrid and pernicious slime; the trees, squeezed one upon
                    another in that rude and uncultivated country, serve rather as a covering to the
                    earth than an ornament. Instead of those fresh and delicious shades, those
                    openings in the woods, and walks crossing each other in all directions, which
                    delight the traveller in the fine forests of France and Germany; those in
                    America serve only to intercept the rays of the sun, and to prevent the benign
                    influence of his beams. The savage participates of this cold humidity; his blood
                    has little heat, his humours are gross, and his constitution phlegmatic. To the
                    powerful influence of climate it is necessary to join the habit of his life.
                    Obliged to traverse vast deserts for subsistence, his body is accustomed to
                    fatigue; food not nourishing, and at the same time in no great plenty, blunts
                    his feelings; and all the hardships of the savage state give a rigidity to his
                    members which makes him almost incapable of suffering. The savage in this state
                    of nature may be compared to our water-women and streetporters, who, though they
                    possess neither great vigour nor strength, are capable of performing daily, and
                    without complaint, that kind of labour which to a man in a different condition
                    of life would be a painful and grievous burden. Feeling, in less perfection with
                    the savage, by the effects of climate and food, and the habits of his life, is
                    still farther restrained by moral considerations. The European is less a man of
                    nature than of society: moral restraints are powerful with him, whilst over the
                    American they have scarcely any influence. This latter, then, is in a double
                    condition of imperfection with regard to us; his senses are blunted, and his
                    moral powers are not disclosed. Now, pleasure and pain depending on the
                    perfection of the senses and the unfolding of the intellectual faculties, it
                    cannot be doubted, that in enjoyments of any kind savages experience less
                    pleasure, and in their suffering less pain, than Europeans in the same
                    circumstances. And, in fact, the savages of America possess a very feeble
                    constitution. They are agile without being strong; and this agility depends more
                    on their habits than on the perfection of their members: they owe it to the
                    necessity of hunting; and they are moreover so weak, that they were unable to
                    bear the toil which their first oppressors imposed on them. Hence a race of men
                    in all respects so imperfect could not endure torment under which the most
                    robust European would sink, if the pain which they feel were really as great as
                    it appears to be. Feeling is, then, and must necessarily be, less in the savage
                    condition; for this faculty disclosing itself by the exercise of all the
                    physical and moral qualities, must be less as they are less exercised.
                    Everything shows the imperfection of this precious quality, this source of all
                    our affections, in the American savages.</p>
                <p>“All the improvements in Europe have had a tendency to unfod sensibility; the air
                    is purified that we may breathe more freely; the morasses are drained, the
                    rivers are regulated in their courses, the food is nourishing, and the houses
                    commodiou⅞. With the savages, on the contrary, everything tends to curb it; they
                    take pleasure even in hardening the organs of the body, in accustoming
                    themselves to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193533051" xml:id="kp-eb0718-3051-0056"
                    />bear by degrees the most acute pain without complaining. Boys and girls among
                    the savages amuse themselves with tying their naked arms together, and laying a
                    kindled coal between them, to try which of them can longest suffer the heat; and
                    the warriors who aspire to the honour of being chief, undergo a course of
                    suffering which exceeds the idea of torture inflicted on the greatest criminals
                    in Europe.”</p>
                <p>These observations on the pleasures and pains of savages appear to be well
                    founded, and, as the attentive reader will perceive, are perfectly agreeable to
                    the theory of Dr Sayers. If, indeed, that theory be just, as we believe it to
                    be, it will follow, that the few pleasures of sense which the American enjoys,
                    he ought to enjoy more completely than any European, because to him they recur
                    but seldom. This may very possibly be the case, and certainly would be so, were
                    not his fibres, by climate and the habits of his life, rendered more rigid than
                    those of the civilized part of the inhabitants of Europe. But if we agree with

                    he says of the pains and pleasures of savages, we cannot admit, without many
                    exceptions, his theory of the enjoyments of children. It is so far from being
                    true that few things amuse, and that nothing satisfies them, that the direct
                    contrary must have been observed by every man attentive to the operations of the
                    infant mind, which is amused with everything new, and often completely satisfied
                    with the merest trifle. The pleasures of philosophy are not indeed unfolded to
                    the infant; but it by no means follows that he does not enjoy his rattle and his
                    drum as much as the philosopher enjoys his telescope and his air-pump; and if
                    there be any truth in the science of physiognomy, the happiness of the former is
                    much more pure and exquisite than that of the latter. That the most perfect
                    music is vain noise to an infant, is far from being self-evident, unless the
                    author confines the state of infancy to a very few months; and we are not
                    disposed to believe, without better evidence than we have yet received, that the
                    relish of exquisite perfumes and highly-seasoned dishes adds much to the sum of
                    human felicity.</p>
                <p>But however much we disapprove of many of these reflections, the following we
                    cordially approve and adopt. “If we compare,” says our author, .“the pleasures
                    of sense with those which are purely intellectual, we shall find that the latter
                    are infinitely superior to the former, as they may be enjoyed at all times and
                    in every situation of life. What are the pleasures of the table, says Cicero, of
                    gaming, and of women, compared with the delight of study? This taste increases
                    with age, and no happiness is equal to it. Without knowledge and study, says
                    Cato, life is almost the image of death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Savages, barbarians, and peasants, enjoy little happiness
                    except that of sensation. The happiness of a civilized and well-informed man
                    consists of sensations, of ideas, and of a great nunff&gt;er of affinities,
                    altogether unknown to them. He not only enjoys the present, but the past and the
                    future. He recalls the agreeable idea of pleasures which he has tasted. It is
                    great happiness, says an ancient, to have the recollection of good actions, of
                    an upright intention, and of promises which we have kept.”</p></note> The
                    pleasures of the soul are such, that it is frequent enough to see men preserve
                    their gaiety during their whole life, notwithstanding a weak, diseased, and
                    debilitated body. Scaron, who lived in the last century, was an example of this.
                    Balzac, speaking of him, says that Prometheus, Hercules, and Philoctetes, in
                    profane, and Job in sacred history, said many great things while they were
                    afflicted with violent pain; but Scaron alone said pleasant things. I have seen,
                    continues he, in many places of ancient history, constancy, and modesty, and
                    wisdom, and eloquence, accompanying affliction; but he is the only instance
                    wherein I have seen pleasantry.</p>
                <p>“There are men whose understandings are constantly on the stretch, and by this
                    very means they are improved; but if the body were as constantly employed in the
                    pursuit of sensual gratification, the constitution would soon be de-stroyéd. The
                    more we employ the mind we are capable of the greater exertion; but the more we
                    employ the body we require the greater repose. There are, besides, but some
                    parts of the body capable of enjoying pleasure; every part of it can experience
                    pain. A toothach occasions more suffering than the most considerable of our
                    pleasures can procure of enjoyment. Great pain may continue for any length of
                    time; excessive pleasures are almost momentary. Pleasure carried to an extreme
                    becomes painful; but pain, either by augmenting or diminishing it, never becomes
                    agreeable. For the moment, the pleasures of the senses are perhaps more
                    satisfactory; but in point of duration, those of the heart and mind are
                    infinitely preferable. All the sentiments of tenderness, of friendship, of
                    gratitude, and of generosity, are sources of enjoyment for man in a state of
                    civilization. The damned are exceedingly unhappy, said St Catherine de Sienna,
                    if they are incapable of loving or being beloved.</p>
                <p>“Pleasure, continued for a great length of time, produces languor and fatigue,
                    and excites sleep; the continuation of pain is productive of none of these
                    effects. Many suffer pain for eight days, and even a month, without
                    interruption; an equal duration of excessive pleasure would occasion death.</p>
                <p>“Time is a mere relative idea with regard to pleasure and pain; it appears long
                    when we suffer, and short when we enjoy. If there existed no regular and uniform
                    movement in nature, we would not be able from our sensations alone to measure
                    time with any degree of exactness, for pain lengthens and pleasure abridges it.
                    From the languor of unoccupied time has arisen the proverb expressive of our
                    desire to kill it. It is a melancholy reflection, and at the same time true,
                    that there is no enjoyment which can effectually secure us from pain for the
                    remainder of our lives; while there are examples of evils which hold men in
                    constant sorrow and pain during their whole existence. Such, then, is the
                    imperfection of the one and the power of the other.</p>
                <p>“Pleasure and pain are the sources of morality; an action is just or unjust, good
                    or otherwise, only as its natural tendency is to produce suffering or enjoyment
                    to mankind. No crime could be committed against a being altogether insensible,
                    nor could any good be bestowed on it. Unless he were endowed with the desire of
                    pleasure and the apprehension of pain, man, like an automaton, would act from
                    necessity, without choice and without determination.</p>
                <p>“All our passions are the development of sensibility. If we were not possessed of
                    feeling, we should be destitute of passions; and as sensibility is augmented by
                    civilization, the passions are multiplied; more active and vigorous in an
                    extensive and civilized empire than in a small state; more in the latter than
                    among barbarous nations; and more in these last than among savages. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Passion.)</hi> There are more passions in France and England
                    than in all the nations of Europe; because everything which serves to excite and
                    foster them is always in those countries in the greatest state of fermentation.
                    The mind is active; the ideas great, extensive, and multiplied. And is it not
                    the soul, the mind, and heart, which are the focus of all the passions ?”</p>
                <p>But wherever the passions are multiplied, the sources of pleasure and pain are
                    multiplied along with them. This being the case, it is impossible to prescribe a
                    fixed and general rule of happiness suited to every individual. There are
                    objects of pleasure with regard to which all men of a certain education are
                    agreed; but there are perhaps many <pb break="no" facs="nls:193533064"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-3064-0057"/>more, owing to the variety of tempers and
                    education, about which they differ. Every man forms ideas of enjoyment relative
                    to his character; and what pleases one may be utterly detested by another. In
                    proportion as a nation is civilized and extensive, those differences are
                    remarkable. Savages, who are not acquainted with all the variety of European
                    pleasures, amuse themselves with very few objects. Owing to the want of
                    civilization, they have scarcely any choice in the objects of taste. They have
                    few passions; we have many. But even in the nations of Europe, pleasure is
                    infinitely varied in its modification and forms. Those differences arise from
                    manners, from governments, from political and religions customs, and chiefly
                    from education. Meanwhile, however different and variable the ideas of pleasure
                    may be amongst nations and individuals, it still remains a fact, that a certain
                    number of persons in all civilized states, whether distinguished by birth, or
                    rank, or fortune, or talents, as they have nearly the same education, so they
                    form nearly the same ideas of happiness; but, to possess it, a man must give his
                    chief application to the state of his mind; and, notwithstanding all his
                    efforts, it is of uncertain duration. Happiness is the sunshine of life; we
                    enjoy it frequently at great intervals, and it is therefore necessary to know
                    how to use it. All the productions of art perish; the largest fortunes are
                    dissipated; rank, honour, and dignity, pass away like a shadow; the memory is
                    impaired; all the faculties of the soul are extinguished; the body sinks under
                    the infirmities of old age; and scarcely has one reached the boundaries of
                    happiness marked out by his imagination, when he must give place to another, and
                    renounce all his pleasures, all his hopes, all his illusions, the fugitive
                    images of which had given happiness to the mind.</p>
                <p>There are pleasures, however, on which the mind may securely rest, and which
                    elevate man above himself, dignify his nature, fix his attention on spiritual
                    things, and render him worthy of the care of Providence. These are to be found
                    in true religion, which procures for those who practise its duties,
                    inexpressible happiness in a better country, and is in this world the support of
                    the weak and the consolation of the unfortunate.</p>
