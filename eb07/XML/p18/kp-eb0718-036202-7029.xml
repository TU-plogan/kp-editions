                <p><label type="entry">PONZA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Pontia</hi></label>, is the
                    name of a small island of the Tuscan Sea, well known as·the place to which many
                    illustrious Romans were banished. It is situated on the coast of Italy, near
                    Tcrracina, and in the neighbourhood of other small islands or rocks. All these
                    islands were visited by Sir William Hamilton in the year 1785; and an account of
                    his journey is given in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, which appeared in the
                    Philosophical Transactions (vol. lxxvi. p. 365). Sir William arrived at Ponza on
                    the 20th of August; and, according to his account, it is situated about thirty
                    miles from Ventotienne. On the 21 st he went round it in a boat. Its length is
                    about five miles, but its breadth is nowhere above half a mile, and in some
                    places not more than five hundred feet. It is surrounded by a multitude of
                    detached rocks, some of them very high, and most of them composed of a compact
                    lava. There are many irregularly-formed basalts, but none in large columns. In
                    some places they have a reddish tinge, from iron ochre, are very small, and
                    irregularly laid over one another. Some stand perpendi cularly, others
                    obliquely, and some lie horizontally. The rocks themselves in which these masses
                    are found are lava of the same nature with the basalts. At first sight they
                    appear like the ruins of ancient Roman brick or tile buildings. One rock is
                    composed of large spherical basalts, and in other places our author found the
                    lava inclined to take the like spherical form, though on a much smaller scale,
                    some of the former basalts being nearly two feet in diameter. All these rocks,
                    in our author’s opinion, have been detached by the sea from this island, which
                    is entirely composed of volcanic matter, lavas, and tufas of various qualities
                    and colours, as green, yellow, black, and white. Some of these matters are more
                    compact in their texture than others; and in some parts great tracts seem .to
                    have undergone similar operations, which still subsist at a spot called the
                    Pisciarelli, on the outside of the Solfatara, near Puzzoli, and where a hot
                    sulphureous vitriolic acid vapour converts all which it penetrates, whether
                    lavas, tufas, volcanic ashes, or pumice-stones, into a pure clay, mostly white,
                    or with a tint of red, blue, green, or yellow.</p>
                <p>In one part of this island there is a sort of tufa remarkably good for the
                    purpose of building. It is as hard as Bath-stone, and nearly of the same colour,
                    without any mixture of lava or pumice-stone, which usually abounds in the tufas
                    of Naples, Baiae, and Puzzoli.</p>
                <p>The island of Palmarole, which is about four miles from Ponza, is not much more
                    than a mile in circumference. It is composed of the same volcanic matter, and
                    probably was once a part of Ponza; but, in our author’s opinion, it looks as if
                    the island of Zannone, which lies about the same distance from Ponza, was once
                    likewise a part of the same; for many rocks of lava rise above water in a line
                    between the two last-mentioned islands, and the water there is much more shallow
                    than in the Gulf of Terracina.</p>
                <p>Zannone is much larger and higher than Palmarole, and the half of it next the
                    continent is composed of a limestone similar to that of the Apennines near it,
                    whilst the other half is composed of lavas and tufas, resembling in every other
                    respect the soil of the islands just described. Neither Palmarole nor Zannone
                    arc inhabited; but the latter furnishes abundance of brushwood for the use of
                    the inhabitants of Ponza, whose number, including the garrison, amounts to near
                    1700. The uninhabited island of St Stefano in like manner furnishes wood for the
                    people of Ventotienne. It is probable that all these islands and rocks may in
                    time be levelled by the action of the sea. Ponza, in its present state, is the
                    mere skeleton of a volcanic island; little more than its hard or vitrified parts
                    remaining, and these seem to be slowly and gradually mouldering away. The
                    governor of the castle of Ponza, who had resided there fifty-three years,
                    informed our author that the island was still subject to earthquakes; that there
                    had been one violent shock there about four years before, and that the ιpost
                    violent one he ever felt was on the very day and at the very hour when Lisbon
                    was destroyed. Two houses out of three which were then on the island were thrown
                    down. “This,” says our author, “seems to prove that the volcanic matter which
                    gave birth to these islands is not exhausted.”</p>
