                <p><label type="entry">PLAYHOUSE</label>. The most ancient English playhouses were
                    the Curtain in Shoreditch, and the Theatre. In the time of Shakspeare, who
                    commenced dramatic writer in 1592, there were no less than ten theatres open.
                    Four of these were private houses, namely, that in Blackfriars, the Cockpit or
                    Phoenix in Drury-Lane, a theatre in Whitefriars, and one in Salisbury Court. The
                    other six were called public theatres, namely, the Globe, the Swan, the Rose,
                    and the Hope, on the Bank-side; the Red Bull, at the upper end of St John’s
                    Street; and the Fortune in White-Cross Street. The two last were chiefly
                    frequented by citizens. Mr Malone gives a pretty copious account of these
                    playhouses, in a supplement to his last edition of Shakspeare, which account we
                    shall here insert.</p>
                <p>“Most, if not all,” says he, “of Shakspeare’s plays were. performed either at the
                    Globe, or at the Theatre in Blackfriars. It appears that they both belonged to
                    the same company of comedians, viz. his majesty’s servants, which title they
                    assumed, after a license had been granted to them by King James in 1603, having
                    before that time been called the servants of the lord chamberlain.</p>
                <p>“The theatre in Blackfriars was a private house; but the peculiar and
                    distinguishing marks of a private playhouse it is not easy to ascertain. It was
                    very small, and plays were there usually represented by candle-light. The Globe,
                    situated on the southern side of the river Thames, was a hexagonal building,
                    partly open to the weather, partly covered with reeds. It was a public theatre,
                    and of considerable size, and there they always acted by daylight. On the roof
                    of the Globe, and the other public theatres, a pole was erected, to which a flag
                    was affixed. These flags were probably displayed only during the hours of
                    exhibition; and it should seem, from a passage in one of the old comedies, that
                    they were taken down during Lent, in which season no plays were presented. The
                    Globe, though hexagonal at the outside, was probably a rotunda within, and
                    perhaps had its name from its circular form. It might, however, have been
                    denominated only from its sign, which was a figure of Hercules supporting the
                    Globe. This theatre was burnt down in 1613, but it was rebuilt in the following
                    year, and decorated with more ornament than had been originally bestowed upon
                    it. The exhibitions at the Globe seem to have been calculated chiefly for the
                    lower class of people; those at Blackfriars for a more select and judicious
                    audience.</p>
                <p>“A writer informs us, that one of these theatres was a winter and the other a
                    summer house. As the Globe was partly exposed to the weather, and they acted
                    there usually by daylight, it was probably the summer theatre. The exhibitions
                    here seem to have been more frequent than at Blackfriars, at least till the year
                    1604 or 1605, when the Bank-side appears to have become less fashionable and
                    less frequented than it formerly had been. Many of our ancient dramatic pieces
                    were performed in the yards of carriers’ inns; in which, in the beginning of
                    Queen Elizabeth’s reign, the comedians, who then first united themselves in
                    companies, erected an occasional stage. The form of these temporary playhouses
                    seems to be preserved in our modem theatre. The galleries arc in both ranged
                    over each other on three sides of the building. The small rooms under the lowest
                    of these galleries answer to our present boxes; and it is observable that these,
                    even in theatres which were built in a subsequent period expressly for dramatic
                    exhibitions, still retained their old name, and are frequently called rooms by
                    our ancient writers. The yard bears a sufficient resemblance to the pit as at
                    present in use. we may suppose the stage to have been raised in this area, on
                    the fourth side, with its back to the gate-way of the inn, at which the money
                    for admission was taken. Hence, in the middle of the Globe, and I suppose of the
                    other public theatres, in the time of Shakspeare, there was an open yard or
                    area, where the common people stood to see the exhibition; from which
                    circumstance they are called by our author groundlings, and by Ben Johnson ‘ the
                    understanding gentlemen of the ground.’</p>
                <p>“In the ancient playhouses there appears to have been a private box, of which it
                    is not easy to ascertain the situation. It seems to have been placed at the side
                    of the stage, towards the rear, and to have been at a lower price; in this some
                    people sat, either from economy or singularity. The galleries, or scaffolds as
                    they are sometimes called, and that part of the house which in private theatres
                    was named the pit, seem to have been at the same price; and probably in houses
                    of reputation, such as the Globe, and that in Blackfriars, the price of
                    admission into those parts of the theatres was sixpence, while in some meaner
                    playhouses it was only one penny, in others only twopence. The price of
                    admission into the best rooms or boxes was, I believe, in our author’s time, one
                    shilling; though afterwards it appears to have risen to two shillings and
                    half-a-crown.</p>
                <p>“From several passages in our old plays, we learn, that spectators were admitted
                    on the stage, and that the critics and wits of the time usually sat there. Some
                    were placed on the ground; others sat on stools, of which the price was either
                    sixpence or one shilling, according, I suppose, to the commodiousness of the
                    situation; and they were attended by pages, who furnished them with pipes and
                    tobacco, which was smoked here as well as in other parts of the house; yet it
                    should seem that persons were suffered to sit on the stage <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532973" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2973-0050"/>only in the private
                    playhouses, such as Blackfriars, &amp;c. where the audience was more select, and
                    of a higher class; and that in the Globe and other public theatres no such
                    license was permitted.</p>
                <p>“The stage was strewed with rushes, which, as we learn from Hentzncr and Caius de
                    Ephemera, was, in the time of Shakspeare, the usual covering of floors in
                    England. The curtain which hangs in the front of the present stage, drawn up by
                    lines and pulleys, though not a modern invention, for it was used by Inigo Jones
                    in the masks at court, was yet an apparatus to which the simple mechanism of our
                    ancient theatres had not arrived, for in them the curtains opened in the middle,
                    and were drawn backwards and forwards on an iron rod. In some playhouses they
                    were woollen, in others made of silk. Towards the rear of the stage there
                    appears to have been a balcony, the platform of which was probably eight or ten
                    feet from the ground. I suppose it to have been supported by pillars. From
                    hence, in many of our old plays, part of the dialogue was spoken; and in the
                    front of this balcony curtains likewise were hung.</p>
                <p>“A doubt has been entertained whether, in our ancient theatres, there were side
                    and other scenes. The question is involved in so much obscurity, that it is very
                    difficult to form any decided opinion upon it. It is certain, that in the year
                    1695 Inigo Jones exhibited an entertainment at Oxford, in which moveable scenes
                    were used; but he appears to have introduced several pieces of machinery in the
                    masks at court, with which undoubtedly the public theatres were unacquainted. A
                    passage which has been produced from one of the old comedies proves, it must be
                    owned, that even these were furnished with some pieces of machinery, which were
                    used when it was requisite to exhibit the descent of some god or saint; but,
                    from all the contemporary accounts, I am inclined to believe that the mechanism
                    of our ancient stage seldom went beyond a painted chair or a trap-door, and that
                    few, if any of them, had any moveable scenes. When King Henry VIII. is to be
                    discovered by the Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, reading in his study, the
                    scenical direction in the first folio, 1623, which was printed apparently from
                    playhouse copies, is ‘the king draws the curtain <hi rend="italic">(i. e.</hi>
                    draws it open), and sits reading pensively ;’ for, besides the principal
                    curtains that hung in the front of the stage, they used others as substitutes
                    for scenes. If a bedchamber is to be exhibited, no change of scene is mentioned;
                    but the property-man is simply ordered to thrust forth a bed. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> When the fable requires the Roman capitol to be
                    exhibited, we find two officers enter, ‘ to lay cushions, as it were, in the
                    capitol,’ &amp;c. On the whole, it appears, that onr ancient theatres in general
                    were only furnished with curtains, and a single scene composed of tapestry,
                    which were sometimes, perhaps, ornamented with pictures; and some passages in
                    our old dramas incline one to think, that when tragedies were performed the
                    stage was hung with black.</p>
                <p>“In the early part, at least, of our author’s (Shakspeare’s) acquaintance with
                    the theatre, the want of scenery seems to have been supplied by the simple
                    expedient of writing the names of the different places where the scene was laid
                    in the progress of the play, which were disposed in such a manner as to be
                    visible to the audience. The invention of trap-doors, however, appears not to be
                    modern; for in an old Morality, entitled All for Money, we find a marginal
                    direction which implies that they were very early in use. The covering or
                    internal roof of the stage was anciently termed the heavens. It was probably
                    painted of a sky-blue colour, or perhaps pieces of drapery tinged with blue were
                    suspended across the stage to represent the heavens.</p>
                <p>“It is probable that the stage was formerly lighted by two large branches, of a
                    form similar to those now hung in churches. They gave place in a subsequent
                    period to small circular wooden frames, furnished with candles, eight of which
                    were hung on the stage, four at either side; and these within a few years were
                    wholly removed by Mr Garrick, who, on his return from France, first introduced
                    the present commodious method of illuminating the stage by lights not visible to
                    the audience. Many of the companies of players were formerly so thin, that one
                    person played two or three parts; and a battle on which the fate of an empire
                    was supposed to depend was decided by half a dozen combatants. It appears to
                    have been a common practice in their mock engagements to discharge small pieces
                    of ordnance on the stage. Before the exhibition began, three flourishes or
                    pieces of music were played, or, in the ancient language, there were three
                    soundings. Music was likewise played between the acts. The instruments chiefly
                    used were trumpets, cornets, and hautboys. The band, which did not consist of
                    more than five or six performers, sat in an upper balcony, over what is now
                    called the stagebox.</p>
                <p>“The person who spoke the prologue was ushered in by trumpets, and usually wore a
                    long black velvet cloak, which, I suppose, was considered as best suited to a
                    supplicatory address. Of this custom, whatever might have been its origin, some
                    traces remained till very lately, a black coat having been, if I mistake not,
                    within these few years the constant stage habiliment of our modern prologue
                    speakers. The dress of the ancient prologue speaker is still retained in the
                    play that is exhibited in Hamlet before the king and court of Denmark. The
                    performers of male characters generally wore periwigs, which in the age of
                    Shakspeare were not in common use. It appears from a passage in Puttenham’s Art
                    of English Poesy, 1589, that vizards were on some occasions used by the actors
                    of those days; and it may be inferred, from a scene in one of our author’s
                    comedies, that they were sometimes worn in his time by those who performed
                    female characters; but this I imagine was very rare. Some of the female part of
                    the audience likewise appeared in masks. The stage-dresses, it is reasonable to
                    suppose, were much more costly at some theatres than at others; yet the wardrobe
                    of even the king’s servants at the Globe and Blackfriars was, we find, but
                    scantily furnished; and our author’s dramas derived very little aid from the
                    splendour of exhibition.</p>
                <p>“It is well known, that in the time of Shakspeare, and for many years afterwards,
                    female characters were represented by boys or young men. Sir William d’A venant,
                    in imitation of the foreign theatres, first introduced females in the scene, and
                    Mrs Betterton is said to have been the first woman that appeared on the English
                    stage. Andrew Pen-nycuike played the part of Matilda in a tragedy of
                    Davenport’s, in 1655; and Mr Kynaston acted several female parts after the
                    Restoration. Downes, a contemporary of his, assures us, ‘ that being then very
                    young, he made a complete stage beauty, performing his parts so well,
                    particularly Arthiope and Aglaura, that it has since been disputable among the
                    judicious whether any woman that succeeded him touched the audience so sensibly
                    as he.’</p>
                <p>“Both the prompter, or book-holder as he was sometimes called, and the
                    property-man, appear to have been regular appendages of our ancient theatres. No
                    writer that I have met with intimates, that in the time of Shakspeare it was
                    customary to exhibit more than a single dramatic piece in one day. The Yorkshire
                    tragedy, or All’s One, indeed, appears to have been one of four pieces that were
                    represented on the same day; and Fletcher has also a piece called Four Plays in
                    One; but probably these were either exhibited on some particular occasion, or
                    were ineffectual efforts to introduce a new species of amusement; for we do not
                    find any other instances of the same kind. Had any shorter pieces been exhibited
                    after the principal performance, some of them probably would have been printed;
                    but there are none extant of an earlier date than the time of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532986" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2986-0051"/>the Restoration. The
                    practice, therefore, of exhibiting two dramas successively in the same evening,
                    we may be assured was not established before that period. But though the
                    audiences in the time of our author were not gratified by the representation of
                    more than one drama in the same day, the entertainment was diversified, and the
                    populace diverted, by vaulting, tumbling, slight of hand, and morrisdancing, a
                    mixture not much more heterogeneous than that with which we are daily presented,
                    a tragedy and a farce.</p>
                <p>“The amusements of our ancestors, before the commencement of the play, were of
                    various kinds, such as reading, playing cards, drinking ale, or smoking tobacco.
                    It was a common practice to carry table-books to the theatre, and, either from
                    curiosity or enmity to the author, or some other motive, to write down passages
                    of the play that was represented; and there is reason to believe that the
                    imperfect and mutilated copies of some of Shakspeare’s dramas, which are yet
                    extant, were taken down in short-hand during the exhibition. At the end of the
                    piece, the actors, in noblemen’s houses and in taverns, where plays were
                    frequently performed, prayed for the health and prosperity of their patrons; and
                    in the public theatres for the king and queen. This prayer sometimes made part
                    of the epilogue. Hence, probably, as Mr Steevens has observed, the addition of

                    play-bills.</p>
                <p>“Plays, in the time of our author, began at one o’clock in the afternoon; and the
                    exhibition was usually finished in two hours. Even in 1667 they commenced at
                    three. When Gosson wrote his School of Abuse, in 1579, it seems the dramatic
                    entertainments were usually exhibited on Sundays. Afterwards they were performed
                    on that and other days indiscriminately. It appears from a contemporary writer,
                    that exhibiting plays on Sunday had not been abolished in the third year of King
                    Charles I.</p>
                <p>“The modes of conveyance to the theatre, anciently as at present, seem to have
                    been various; some going in coaches, others on horseback, and many by water. To
                    the Globe playhouse the company probably were conveyed by water; to that in
                    Blackfriars the gentry went either in coaches or on horseback, and the common
                    people on foot. In an epigram to Sir John Davis, the practice of riding to the
                    theatre is ridiculed as a piece of affectation or vanity, and therefore we may
                    presume it was not very general.</p>
                <p>“The long and whimsical titles that are prefixed to the quarto copies of our
                    author’s plays, I suppose to have been transcribed from the play-bills of the
                    time. A contemporary writer has preserved something like a play-bill of those
                    days, which seems to corroborate this observation; for if it were divested of
                    rhime, it would bear no very distant resemblance to the title-pages that stand
                    before some of our author’s dramas:</p>
                <p>Prithee, what’s the play?</p>
                <p>(The first I visited this twelvemonth day) They say, “A new invented play of
                    Purle, That jeoparded his neck to steal a girl of twelve; and lying fast
                    impounded for’t, Has hither sent his beard to act his part; Against all those in
                    open malice bent, That would not freely to the theft consent: Feigns all to’s
                    wish, and in the epilogue Goes out applauded for a famous rogue” — Now hang me
                    if I did not look at first For some such stuff, by the fond people’s thrust.</p>
                <p>“It is uncertain at what time the usage of giving authors a benefit on the third
                    day of the exhibition of their pieces commenced. Mr Oldys, in one of his
                    manuscripts, intimates that dramatic poets had anciently their benefit on the
                    first day that â new play was represented; a regulation which would have been
                    very favourable to some of the ephemeral productions of modern times. But for
                    this there is not, I believe, any sufficient authority. From D’A venant, indeed,
                    we learn, that in the latter part of the reign of Qμeen Elizabeth the poet had
                    his benefit on the second day. As it was a general practice in the time of
                    Shakspeare to sell the copy of the play to the theatre, I imagine in such cases
                    an author derived no other advantage from his piece than what arose from the
                    sale of it. Sometimes, however, he found it more beneficial to retain the
                    copyright in his own hands; and when he did so. I suppose he had a benefit. It
                    is certain that the giving authors the profit of the third exhibition of their
                    play, which seems to have been the usual mode during almost the whole of the
                    last century, was an established custom in the year 1612; for Decker, in the
                    prologue to one of his comedies printed in that year, speaks of the poet’s third
                    day. The unfortunate Otway had no more than one benefit on the production of a
                    new play; and this, too, it seems, he was sometimes forced to mortgage before
                    the piece was acted. Southerne was the first dramatic writer who obtained the
                    emoluments arising from two representations; and to Farquhar, in the year 1700,
                    the benefit of a third was granted. When an author sold his piece to the sharers
                    or proprietors of a theatre, it remained for several years unpublished; but when
                    that was not the case, he printed it for sale, to which many seem to have been
                    induced, from an apprehension that an imperfect copy might be issued from the
                    press without their consent. The customary price of the copy of a play in the
                    time of Shakspeare appears to have been twenty nobles, or six pounds thirteen
                    shillings and fourpence. The play when printed was sold for sixpence; and the
                    usual present from a patron in return for a dedication was forty shillings. On
                    the first day of exhibiting a new play, the prices of admission appear to have
                    been raised; and this seems to have been occasionally practised on the
                    benefit-nights of authors to the end of the last century. The custom of passing
                    a final censure on plays at their first exhibition is as ancient as the time of
                    our author, for no less than three plays of his rival Ben Jonson appear to have
                    been damned; and Fletcher’s Faithful Shepherdess, and the Knights of the Burning
                    Pestle, written by him and Beaumont, underwent the same fate.</p>
                <p>“It is not easy to ascertain what were the emoluments of a successful actor in
                    the time of Shakspeare. They had not then annual benefits, as at present. The
                    performers at each theatre seem to have shared the profits arising either from
                    each day’s exhibition, or from the whole season, among them. From Ben Jonson’s
                    Poetaster we learn, that one of either die performers or proprietors had seven
                    shares and a half; but of what integral sum is not mentioned. From the prices of
                    admission into our ancient theatres, which have been already mentioned, I
                    imagine the utmost that the shares of the Globe playhouse could have received on
                    any one day was about L 35. So lately as the year 1685, Shadwell received by his
                    third day, on the representation of the Squire of Alsatia, L.130; which, Downes
                    the prompter says, was the greatest receipt that had been ever taken at
                    Drury-Lane playhouse at single prices. It appears from the manuscripts of Lord
                    Stanhope, treasurer of the chambers to King James I. that the customary sum paid
                    to John Heminge and his company for the performance of a play at court was
                    twenty nobles, or six pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence. And Edward Alleyn
                    mentions in his Diary, that he once had so slender an audience in his theatre
                    called the Fortune, that the whole receipts of the house amounted to no more
                    than three pounds and some odd shillings.</p>
                <p>“Thus scanty and meagre were the apparatus and accommodations of our ancient
                    theatres, on which those dramas were first exhibited that have since engaged the
                    attention of so many learned men, and delighted so many* thousand spectators.
                    Yet even then, we are told by a writer of that age, ‘ that dramatic poesy was so
                    lively expressed and represented on the public stages and theatres of this city,
                    as Rome in the age of her pomp and glory never saw <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532999" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2999-0052"/>it better performed; in
                    respect of the action and art, not of the cost and sumptuousness.’”</p>
