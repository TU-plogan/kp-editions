                <p><label type="entry">POCOCKE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Edward</hi></label>, a
                    learned English divine, and the first oriental scholar of his time, was the
                    eldest son of Edward Pococke; and born in November 1604, at Oxford, where he was
                    also educated. In 1628 he was admitted probationer-fellow of his college, and
                    about the same time he had prepared an edition of the second Epistle of St
                    Peter, the second and third of St John, and the Epistle of St Jude, in Syriac
                    and Greek, with a Latin translation and notes. In 1629 he was ordained priest,
                    and appointed chaplain to the English merchants at Aleppo, where he arrived in
                    October 1630, and continued for five or six years, during which he distinguished
                    himself by his zeal and fortitude, particularly whilst the plague raged there in
                    1634. At length returning to England, he was in 1636 appointed reader of the
                    Arabic Lectures, founded by Archbishop Laud. Three years afterwards he went to
                    Constantinople, where he prosecuted his studies of the eastern tongues, and
                    procured many valuable manuscripts. After a residence of nearly four years in
                    that city, he embarked in 1640; and taking Paris in his way, visited Gabriel
                    Sionita the famous Maronite, and also Hugo Grotius. In 1643 he was presented to
                    the rectory of Childrey, in Berkshire; and about three years afterwards married
                    the daughter of Mr Thomas Burdett. About the middle of 1647 he obtained the
                    restitution of the salary of his Arabic Lecture, which had been detained from
                    him about three years. In 1648, Charles I., being then prisoner in the Isle of
                    Wight, nominated Mr Pococke to the professorship of Hebrew, and the canonry of
                    Christ-Church annexed to it; but in 1650 he was ejected from his canonry for
                    refusing to take the engagement, and soon afterwards a vote passed for depriving
                    him of his Hebrew and Arabic professorships. But several governors of houses,
                    and others, having presented a petition in his favour, he was suffered to enjoy
                    both these places. He had some years before published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimen Historiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabum,</hi> a very learned work, and
                    now appeared his <hi rend="italic">Porta</hi><hi rend="italic">Mosis;</hi> an'd
                    soon afterwards the English Polyglot edition of the Bible, to which he had
                    largely contributed, and also Eutychius’s Annals, with a Latin version, gave
                    evidence of his industry and learning. At the Restoration he was reinstated in
                    the canonry of Christ-Church, and also received the degree of doctor of
                    divinity. He then published his Arabic version of Grotius’s Treatise of the
                    Truth of the Christian Religion; and an Arabic poem entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamiato l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ajam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Carmen
                    Abu-Ismaelis Tograi,</hi> with a Latin translation and notes. Soon afterwards he
                    published Gregory Abulfaragius’s <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dynastiarum;</hi> but this work did not meet with much
                    encouragement from the public, a circumstance which his biographer accounts for
                    in a manner not very creditable to the reign, of Charles II. as compared with
                    the protectorate, when solid learning was appreciated and rewarded. The fact
                    seems to be, that the love of Arabic learning was now growing cold; and Pococke
                    himself, in his correspondence with Mr Thomas Greaves, appears to be not only
                    sensible that such was the case, but very much hurt by the decline of sound
                    literary taste. The same circumstance also may in some measure account for this
                    distinguished scholar not having obtained higher preferment at the period of the
                    Restoration, when such numbers of vacant dignities were conferred on far
                    inferior men. Perhaps he was almost the only instance of a clergyman, then at
                    the highest pitch of eminence for learning, and every other merit proper to his
                    profession, who lived throughout the reign of Charles II. without the least
                    regard from the court, except the favour sometimes done him of being called-upon
                    to translate Arabic letters from the princes of the Levant, or the credentials
                    of ambassadors coming from thence; a service for which we do not find that he
                    obtained any recompense, besides fair words and hollow compliments. But his
                    modesty equalled his merit; and after presenting Abulfaragius to the king, he
                    ceased to obtrude his claims on the attention of royalty. In 1674 he published
                    an Arabic version of the principal parts of the Liturgy of the Church of
                    England; and a few years afterwards appeared his Commentary on the Prophecies of
                    Micah, Malachi, Hosea, and Joel. This truly great man died in 1691, after having
                    been fol* many years confessedly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193534117"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-4117-0138"/>the first orientalist in Europe; and he was no
                    less worthy of admiration for his uncommon modesty and humility, and all the
                    virtues which can adorn a Christian. His theological works were republished at
                    London in 1740, in two volumes folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pococke,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pickard,</hi> distantly
                    related to the preceding, was the son of Mr Richard Pococke, head master of the
                    free-school at Southampton, where he was born in the year 1704. He received his
                    school-learning under his father, and his academical education at Corpus Christi
                    College, Oxford, where he took his various degrees. He commenced his travels in
                    the East in 1737, and returned in 1742. In 1743, be published his Observations
                    on Egypt, under the general title of a Description of the East and some other
                    Countries. In 1744, he was made precentor of Waterford; and in 1745, he printed
                    the second volume of his Travels, under the title of Observations on Palestine
                    or the Holy Land, Syria, Mesopotamia, Cyprus, and Candia, which he dedicated to
                    the Earl of Chesterfield, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, whom he attended in
                    the capacity of domestic chaplain. In 1756, Dr Pococke was promoted to the
                    bishopric of Ossory, vacant by the death of Dr Edward Maurice; in July 1765, he
                    was translated to the see of Meath, which had been originally intended for the
                    Bishop of Elphin, who, however, declined taking out his patent; and he died
                    suddenly in September following, having been carried off by apoplexy, whilst
                    engaged in visiting his diocese. As a traveller Dr Pococke was equally
                    distinguished for research, learning, and accuracy, to which ample justice has
                    indeed been done by Jablonski, in the preface to part third of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Pantheon Aegyptiorum.</hi> He penetrated no farther up the Nile
                    than the island of Philae, called by the Arabs the Temple Island; whereas
                    Norden, in 1737, proceeded as far as Derré, between the first and second
                    cataract. The two travellers are supposed to have met on the Nile, in the
                    neighbourhood of Esnch, in January 1738; but, according to another account, they
                    passed in the night without recognition.</p>
                <p>Bishop Pococke visited other parts besides the East, and described some
                    remarkable objects both in Scotland and Ireland. According to Cumberland, he was
                    a man of mild but peculiar manners, and of primitive simplicity. “Having given
                    the world,” says this writer, “a full detail of his researches in Egypt, he
                    seemed to hold himself excused from saying anything more about them, and
                    observed, in general, an obdurate taciturnity. In his carriage and deportment he
                    appeared to have contracted something of the Arab character; yet there was no
                    austerity in his silence, and though his air was solemn, his temper was serene.”
                    Cumberland adds: “When we were on our road to Ireland, I saw from the windows of
                    the inn at Daventry a cavalcade of horsemen approaching on a gentle trot, headed
                    by an elderly chief in clerical attire, who was followed by five servants at
                    distances geometrically measured and most precisely maintained, and who, upon
                    entering the inn, proved to be this distinguished prelate conducting his horde
                    with the phlegmatic patience of a scheik.” Cumberland’s delineation, however,
                    must be received with some caution, particularly in the latter part, which bears
                    evident marks of exaggeration.</p>
