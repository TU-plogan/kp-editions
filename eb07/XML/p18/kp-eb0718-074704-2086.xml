                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="italic">1 measure.</hi> The same name is also given to such instruments as
                    are employed for the converse purpose of inferring from some of the various
                    effects of heat, temperatures higher than those to which ordinary thermometers
                    are applicable. Both classes of these instruments have been constructed in a
                    variety of forms; but, unless where the temperature^was to be high, the most of
                    them formerly acted on the principle of rendering the minute expansions sensible
                    or appreciable by means of machinery. Accordingly, such an instrument generally
                    consisted of an apparatus for producing the requisite change of temperature,
                    coupled with machinery so contrived, that when to one part of it an
                    imperceptibly small motion is given by the expansion of the substance under
                    trial, a very sensible motion is thereby produced in another part. However, in
                    almost no case can the machinery for increasing the sensibility be with safety
                    or propriety exposed to any high temperature; and frequently the heat of a
                    furnace is now inferred from or denoted by the fusing point of the particular
                    metal, alloy, or other substance which it is just able to melt, such fusing
                    points being supposed to be previously known. But the methods as yet employed to
                    determine high temperatures, however useful some of them maybe for recording
                    particular intensities of heat, and showing when the intensity in one case is
                    equal to that in another, are insufficient to indicate their absolute values, or
                    in what ratio unequal intensities differ among themselves. Nay, even their
                    values in terms of the common scales of temperature are as yet but very
                    imperfectly known in the higher part of the range.</p>
                <p>In most of the earlier pyrometers the substance under trial was heated by the
                    immediate contact of the flames of lamps; a method which not only produced an
                    entirely unknown temperature, but probably gave to different bodies, or even to
                    different parts of the same body, very different temperatures. This was greatly
                    improved upon by applying the lamps to a metallic trough or boiler, containing
                    some liquid, in which the bar under trial and a thermometer were immersed.
                    Sometimes an inner case or trough has been used to keep the specimen dry; and
                    when only a very moderate heat is required, steam has also been used to heat the
                    specimen. This, though generally supposed to be a recent application of steam,
                    had, according to Mr Nicholson <hi rend="italic">(Journal</hi> for February
                    1805), been used by J. II. de Magellan in 1784.</p>
                <p>To obtain an appreciable indication of the expansions of bodies, Muschenbroeck,
                    to whom we owe the first instrument of this sort, as well as the name <hi
                    rend="italic">pyrometer,</hi> made the expansion of a rod of the substance under
                    trial move a toothed rack, turning a pinion fixed on the axis of a wheel, which
                    again turned a second pinion on the axis of the index, and the latter revolved
                    over a graduated dial. Some have added more wheels and pinions, or have used a
                    system of levers, or one consisting partly of levers and partly of wheels and
                    pinions; and did the accuracy keep pace with the sensibility, such instruments
                    might be correct enough. Other contrivances for increasing the sensibility are
                    very numerous, but they are generally so readily referrible to similar
                    principles as to render particular descriptions of them unnecessary, more
                    especially since none of them is free from the objections about to be stated.
                    Smeaton employed one lever, and observed how many turns and parts of a turn of a
                    fine screw, whose end was just in contact with a piece touching the lever, would
                    make it be again barely in contact with that piece, after the bar under trial,
                    and acting near the fulcrum of the lever, had undergone the requisite heating.
                    Lavoisier and Laplace made the expansion of the bar under trial act upon one
                    lever, which again acted on a telescope hung as a second lever. This telèscope
                    being directed to a large graduated scale placed at a known distance, the
                    slightest deflection which the expansion of the bar under trial occasioned in
                    the direction of the telescope was thus rendered very conspicuous. Had the
                    accuracy of this mode of operating, therefore, been as great as the sensibility
                    thereof, it would certainly have given the expansions to a great degree of
                    exactness.</p>
                <p>But the preceding kinds of pyrometers, however useful for exhibiting in a general
                    way the expansions of bodies, or for illustrating the subject in a public
                    lecture, are by no means entitled to much confidence; for, in using wheels and
                    pinions, as well as levers, or any of these coupled with other machinery, there
                    is always considerable uncertainty in the result, owing to the loose connection
                    of the several parts, and their sometimes bending under the strain, as also to
                    the friction and obliquity of action. Nay, an error of some consequence may even
                    arise from the bar itself under trial being compressed by its giving motion to
                    the machinery, more especially at the time when it is softened by heat; and
                    those parts of the mechanism which touch the ends of the heated bar, and that in
                    particular which is moved by its contact, will be apt to partake in its
                    temperature, to an uncertain extent, and to occasion a corresponding uncertainty
                    in the result.</p>
                <p>The celebrated artist Mr Ramsden invented a method of measuring <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> the expansions, as seen greatly magnified through
                    microscopes, which is not only free from the uncertainties of the instruments
                    just noticed, but is much <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2099-0748"/>more manageable than they are. A particu!ar
                    description of the pyrometer which Mr Ramsden constructed on this principle, for
                    ascertaining the expansions of the rods employed in measuring a base on Hounslow
                    Heath for the trigonometrical survey, is given by General Roy, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1785; though, owing to the
                    scarcity of letters of reference, the engraving must be nearly unintelligible to
                    those who are not versed in such subjects. This apparatus appears to be
                    susceptible of acting with great accuracy under moderate heats; but neither it,
                    nor indeed any other instrument of the sort, seems directly applicable under
                    very high temperatures, though we shall afterwards see how the microscopes may
                    be rendered equally available for appreciating or measuring the expansions
                    marked by register pyrometers, or those which, even after they have again become
                    cold, preserve an indication of the extent of the expansion which has occurred
                    during their previous exposure to a great heat.</p>
                <p>We can only give here a very general description of Mr Ramsden’s pyrometer, which
                    consists of a strong deal frame, five feet in length, nearly twenty-eight inches
                    in breadth, and about forty-two inches in height. The bar of the material whose
                    expansion is to be measured, and which may be even two feet long, is placed with
                    water in a copper trough or boiler fully five feet in length. Beneath this
                    trough are set twelve spirit-lamps, whose flames may heat the water in the
                    trough, and the bar placed therein for trial, to the boiling point, if required.
                    But it is evident, that by filling the trough with a liquid having a higher
                    boiling point, a still higher temperature might be attained. On each side of the
                    copper trough, and’parallel to it, at a little distance, is placed a wooden
                    trough filled with water, and each of these contains a cast-iron prismatic bar.
                    For greater simplicity, we shall suppose that there are also two cross, pieces,
                    which can be fixed anywhere on the cast-iron bars, and at right angles to them,
                    and that each cross piece carries a microscope to look directly down upon each
                    end of the bar under trial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In Ramsden’s machine, the microscopes look horizontally; but their
                    connection with the other parts is so complex that we could scarcely pretend to
                    make them intelligible, without diagrams and a very long detail.</p></note> The
                    one microscope has only a simple mark or point in its field of view; but the
                    other is furnished with such a wire-micrometer as is described under the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer.</hi></p>
                <p>Whilst operating with this apparatus, it is of consequence that the temperature
                    of the two cast-iron prisms in the wooden troughs should continue as steady as
                    possible, which can be easily tested by placing thermometers beside them in the
                    water; or a steady temperature may be insured by keeping the troughs filled with
                    melting ice, as was done by General Roy. Suppose, now, the cross piece carrying
                    the microscope which has the point in its field of view, to be so set over one
                    end of the bar under trial, that this point or mark may appear directly
                    coincident with the extremity of the bar to be examined, or with a point or mark
                    near its extremity. In like manner, let the other microscope be fixed over the
                    other extremity of the bar under trial, so that its moveable wire may be
                    accurately coincident with the other extremity of the bar, or with a point or
                    mark near it. These adjustments being made, suppose the temperature of the water
                    and of the bar in the boiler to be exactly 32° Fahrenheit. By means of the
                    spirit-lamps under the boiler gradually heat it to 140°, or any other required
                    temperature, and look through the second microscope. As soon as the change of
                    temperature begins to affect the length of the bar, the mark at its extremity
                    will be seen to deviate from its previous coincidence with the wire of the
                    micrometer, and to extend beyond it. On the bar, therefore, attaining any other
                    temperature, we can measure the corresponding expansion which has occurred, by
                    observing how many turns and parts of a turn of the micrometer-screw are
                    necessary to bring the micrometer-wire into coincidence with the slowly shifting
                    mark on the expanding bar; and as the value in parts of an inch of each turn of
                    the micrometer-screw is accurately known, a direct measure of the expansion of
                    the bar is thus obtained, free from the errors of a system of levers, or of a
                    train of wheels and pinions.</p>
                <p>A different form of microscopic pyrometer has been employed by Mr Alexander J.
                    Adie;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Transactions of
                    the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xiii. p. 354, where it is described at
                    great length, with an account of experiments, which, however, were made chiefly
                    on building materials, from the temperature of 50° Fahrenheit, up to 207°. Some
                    of the results are also given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat.</hi>
                    It is neither said, nor is it at all likely, that the expansion of any of the
                    stones which had a laminar texture was ever tried in the direction perpendicular
                    to the scales or plates composing them. For the specimens being long slender
                    slips or rods, their parts could scarcely have stuck together had their
                    component plates run across. At any rate, the expansion was only tried in one
                    direction, namely, in that which happened to lie in the length of the rod. But
                    there is reason to think that, with the exception of brick, perhaps, and a few
                    other amorphous bodies, almost every building material is likely to expand at
                    different rates in its different linear dimensions. Such is known to be the case
                    with certain bodies, particularly calcareous spar, which is said to expand in
                    one dimension whilst it contracts in another. Now, since some of the marbles
                    winch had been heated in these experiments were found to have thereby acquired a
                    permanent increase of length, we have been led to conjecture whether the caverns
                    which abound in calcareous rocks may not be,'in a great measure, owing to their
                    having expanded permanently, but at different rates in their different
                    dimensions.</p></note> in which, instead of the horizontal iron prisms of
                    Ramsden, the microscopes are merely attached to an upright oaken post, which
                    supports and holds nearly all the other parts, and which was made from such an
                    old and thoroughly seasoned piece of timber, that it scarcely expands at all by
                    heat. The bar or rod of the substance under trial is enclosed in a vertical
                    tube, which again is surrounded by steam flowing in a continued current through
                    an outer tube incasing the other. Both tubes are provided with small glass
                    windows, for the purpose of viewing the ends of the included bar through the
                    microscopes, and likewise for excluding the steam from the inner tube. By this
                    means, the tendency which an accession of moisture has to increase the
                    expansions of certain bodies is obviated. But although the inner tube may thus
                    effectually protect the specimen under trial from the humifying influence of the
                    steam, it by no means obviates the uncertainty of the effects of such humidity
                    as that body may already contain. For it appears from Mr Adie’s experiments,
                    that as the temperature increases, the moisture, as might be expected, gradually
                    evaporates from the bar under trial into the air which is enclosed with it in
                    the tube. On this account, if the humidity remaining in the bar were constant,
                    it might add to the expansion, but the gradual drying or evaporation of it tends
                    to a contraction. Indeed, with respect to bodies which have their dimensions
                    affected by a change of humidity, it seems very doubtful if the experiments with
                    slender rods, the humidity of which is so easily altered, can be regarded as
                    determining the expansion by heat of such blocks of the same substance as are
                    massy, and have the humidity comparatively constant.</p>
                <p>It is further to be observed, that in heating with steam, it only occasions an
                    unnecessary expenditure of heat to allow a continued current, or indeed any
                    quantity, of the steam to run waste or escape from the pyrometer, except as much
                    as is sufficient at first merely to expel, through proper apertures, the air
                    from the apparatus; after which the closer everything can be kept so much the
                    better. It seems to have been owing to the employment of a continually escaping
                    current, that Mr Adie found it difficult to maintain a temperature higher than
                    207° Fahrenheit; whereas, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542112"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2112-0749"/>if sufficient care be taken to regulate the heat
                    of the boiler, a single pipe connecting the boiler with a proper air-tight
                    vessel in the pyrometer is all that is required, provided that pipe be
                    sufficiently wide, and so inclined as readily to restore to the boiler all the
                    water formed by the condensation of the steam. A regulating stop-cock may also
                    be useful in the connecting pipe.</p>
                <p>In order to ascertain the relative expansions of different ^ materials for the
                    construction of compensating pendulums, or what length of one material would by
                    its expansion accurately compensate a certain length of another, Deluc suspended
                    the one bar from an arm projecting horizontally from an upright deal plank; and
                    the other bar he supported by resting its lower end upon a small cock or stage
                    projecting from the lower end of the former bar. Whilst the first or hanging
                    bar, therefore, expanded downward þy heat, the second or standing bar expanded
                    upward. A microscope was attached to the plank in such a manner that, while it
                    was constantly supported by an horizontal arm, and directed horizontally to the
                    standing bar, it could be shifted up or down the deal plank. When, therefore,
                    heat was applied to the bars, and, by repeatedly shifting the microscope up or
                    down the plank, a point was found in the standing bar which was neither raised
                    nor depressed by the changes of temperature, the compensation was exact, or the
                    respective lengths of the two bars (reckoning that of the standing bar from its
                    base up to the immoveable'point) were inversely as the rates of their
                    expansions. The plank would remain nearly at the same temperature during the
                    experiments, or it might be kept so by such means as are pointed out by the
                    ingenious author, in his account of these and other experiments, described in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1777. This method,
                    however, Deluc owed to a hint which had been previously given him by Ramsden. A
                    similar process has frequently been employed for testing and adjusting the
                    compensation of the gridiron and other pendulums, after the parts are put
                    together; namely, by finding when the position of a point in the pendulum,
                    situated as near as can be found to the centre of oscillation, is not affected
                    by a change of temperature.</p>
                <p>In the grand operation of measuring a base for determining the great meridian arc
                    in France, Borda combined metallic measuring rods in such a manner, that they
                    indicated directly of themselves, and with more certainty than could be done
                    with thermometers, their own variations both of temperature and of length. A
                    rule of platina twelve feet long was attached, by one of its extremities, to a
                    rule of brass somewhat shorter, which rested freely on its surface, when placed
                    horizontally. Towards the loose end of the brass rule there were traced on the
                    platina rule very exact linear divisions, the parts of which were millionths of
                    the total length of this rule. This end of the brass rule carried a vernier,
                    whose coincidences with the platina graduations were observed with a microscope.
                    Now the dilatations of the platina being much smaller than those of the brass
                    for the same changes of temperature, the vernier of the brass rule behoved to be
                    incessantly changing its coincidence from one division to another, according as
                    the temperature varied. Borda availed himself of these changes to know at every
                    instant the common temperature of these two bars, and also the ratio of the
                    absolute expansions of the two metals. The values of the vernier divisions, in
                    degrees of the thermometer, had∙been previously ascertained from noting the
                    change which took place between first surrounding the compound bar with melting
                    ice, and afterwards placing it in boiling water. It was therefore sufficient to
                    read the indications of this metallic thermometer, in order to learn both the
                    actual temperature of the bars in the atmosphere, and also what compensation was
                    to be made in the measuring rods or chains, to reduce their lengths to what they
                    should be at the standard temperature. But, after all, we suspect that if the
                    upper of these rules was at any time more exposed than the lower to the aspect
                    of the sky, it might be somewhat more cooled by radiation; and the sun, again,
                    would have just the opposite effect of heating the upper more than the
                    lower.</p>
                <p>By means of a simple and ingenious process, Dulong and Petit compared the
                    expansions of the volumes of several solid bodies with those of air and mercury.
                    Having ascertained the absolute dilatation of mercury by heat in respect of the
                    indications of an air-thermometer, from observing the unequal heights at which
                    the mercury stood when at different temperatures in the two legs of an inverted
                    glass syphon, they next measured the apparent dilatation of mercury in a glass
                    tube. The difference gave them the absolute dilatation of the glass. Every kind
                    of glass which they tried was found to dilate at the same rate; a result in
                    which some are not disposed to acquiesce. The dilatation of iron, copper, and
                    platina was determined by placing a rod of each metal of a known volume and
                    weight in the axis of a glass tube shut at one end, and having only a capillary
                    opening left at the other. The remaining space in the tube being then filled up
                    with mercury, the tube was heated to different temperatures, and the quantity of
                    the mercury noted which was in each case expelled from the tube. It is obvious
                    that the volume of the mercury thus driven out is equal to the expansions of the
                    mercury and of the solid metal, minus the expansion of the glass. With the
                    exception of the groundless objections of Mr Crichton, which are noticed farther
                    on, this method of Dulong and Petit is, so far as we know, universally
                    acquiesced in; but since it merely gives the expansion of the volume, there is
                    no reason to think that it can afford accurate data for estimating the linear
                    dilatation of bodies; because it assumes that they expand at precisely the same
                    rate in every direction, or in all their linear dimensions. Indeed, the greater
                    part of the direct experiments on linear expansions which have been put on
                    record, lose much of their value from involving this assumption; for it has been
                    ascertained of certain bodies, that they expand very differently in their
                    different dimensions; and probably something of the sort holds of most bodies.
                    Nay, some are said to contract in one dimension, whilst they expand in another.
                    Besides, every article which has been more or Jess compressed by having, whilst
                    comparatively cold, undergone such operations as hammering, rolling, or
                    wiredrawing, may, on after exposure to heat, be expected to acquire some
                    permanent enlargement, and one too which, on account of the unequal compression,
                    is likely to be very different in the different dimensions. Many fine
                    astronomical and optical instruments we suspect to be liable to derangement from
                    this source. Various cases of permanent expansions will be found noticed in the
                    course of this article.</p>
                <p>Amongst the earlier attempts at ascertaining high temperatures, Μ. Achard
                    constructed a pyrometer which is quite in the form of a common thermometer. The
                    ball and tube are of semi-transparent porcelain, highly baked. They contain a
                    very fusible alloy, consisting of two parts of bismuth, one of lead, and one of
                    tin, which, though solid at low temperatures, becomes liquid about 212°
                    Fahrenheit; and then, as the heat increases from that upward, it expands in the
                    liquid state similarly to mercury, and is seen through the semi-transparent
                    tube, which is graduated. There seems scarcely any limit to the temperature to
                    which this kind of instrument could be extended, provided only a material could
                    be got for forming a ball and tube which would both bear the heat and also admit
                    of the liquid metal being seen through it. There would be no difficulty of
                    finding a less fusible alloy; and were there no risk of its oxidation or
                    evaporation, it might be put <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542125"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2125-0750"/>into an open though perfectly opaque tube, in
                    which a float might indicate the extent of the expansion by its top rising above
                    the open-end. But it would still be desirable to ascertain, if possible, the
                    value of the degrees of this and every other pyrometer, in terms of the common
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p>It is long since the expansion of air had been proposed by Μ. Schmidt as a
                    measure of high temperatures. This was afterwards suggested by Dr Ure, and still
                    later by Mr Mill, who proposed to employ for that purpose a differential
                    thermometer having one ball and half the tube of platina, and the other ball and
                    half tube of glass. The platina ball being put into the furnace, it is supposed
                    that the instrument would indicate the excess of the heat within over that of
                    the external air. Such might at first sight appear to be a very convenient
                    pyrometer, but it stands greatly in need of improvement; because, unless for
                    small differences'of temperature, a differential thermometer cannot continue to
                    give the difference of two thermometers indicating the temperatures of the
                    respective balls. Neither can this method afford data for computing the
                    temperature of the platina ball, unless the temperatures of the other parts were
                    first accurately known, which is far from being the case. For although, to
                    ascertain the temperature of the glass ball with tolerable accuracy, it would
                    only require to be immersed in a bath along with a thermometer, which however
                    could not be so easily done if the whole tube were straight, as proposed by Mr
                    Mill; yet since a large proportion of the included air would necessarily be
                    contained in the tube, it would be next to impossible to allow for its
                    temperature, because that would vary through all the degrees intermediate
                    between the temperatures of the two balls. Perhaps the most correct apparatus
                    yet employed on this principle, and in which precautions are used to avoid the
                    errors now mentioned, is that of Mr Prinsep, described farther on, for
                    ascertaining the melting points of his pyrometric alloys, in terms of the scale
                    of the common air-thermometer. But Schmidt’s scheme, as described in Nicholson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (vol. xi. p. 141), comes nearer the mark than any
                    of the other two. Schmidt and Mill seem to have taken it for granted that a bulb
                    of platina could be as easily formed as one of'glass; but of this Dr Ure
                    probably had some doubt; for he suggests that the platina might be formed into a
                    hollow cylinder having the tube screwed inr, like that of a tobacco-pipe.
                    Perhaps the ends, too, might be screwed in. Mr Prinsep’s bulb being of gold,
                    could only be used at temperatures below the melting point of that metal.</p>
                <p>The determination of the temperature of furnaces is an important question; but
                    until nearly twenty years ago, when Professor Daniell took up the subject, the
                    only instrument in repute for this purpose was Mr Wedgwood’s pyrometer; “the
                    indications of which,” says Mr Prinsep, “are assumed in every chemical work as
                    authority for some doctrines relative to the scale of temperature which savour
                    of the marvellous, and for others which a slight practical acquaintance with
                    metals and crucibles must at all times have proved to be fallacious.” The
                    principle on which this pyrometer depends is vague and uncertain in the extreme,
                    namely, the permanent contraction of certain aluminous clays, when exposed to an
                    intense heat. For it has been found, that the amount of the contraction, even of
                    the same clay, so far from being in exact proportion to the intensity of the
                    heat, as assumed by Mr Wedgwood, depends very much on the duration of the
                    process, so that long-continued exposure to an inferior temperature produces as
                    great a contraction as if the clay had been sub mitted for a shorter time to a
                    more intense heat. This instrument has of course served its day, and gone into
                    disuse.</p>
                <p>'There are many igneous operations, such as enamelling, assaying, those of the
                    foundery, &amp;c. which furnish tests, of themselves, on which the workman can
                    generally place considerable confidence, though some of these require to be used
                    with great caution. Thus, the colour which heat produces on the surfaces of
                    metals furnishes a somewhat deceptive criterion of the temperature or temper;
                    because the particular colour depends very much on the duration of the exposure
                    to the heat. For example, a piece of hardened steel may become quite blue, if
                    long enough exposed to a heat which is too low to produce the supposed
                    corresponding effect in tempering or reducing the hardness.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of Science</hi> (vol. xi. p. 309),
                    Professor Daniell has described an ingenious instrument, of his own invention,
                    with which he has ascertained the fusing points of various metals, and which has
                    served to overturn the catalogues of high temperatures deduced by means of
                    Wedgwood’s pyrometer, and so long occupying a place, with standard authority, in
                    every chemical work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Some of these extravagantly high numbers had been previously questioned by

                    for 1808 and 1811.</p></note> But from the journal just cited it has now become
                    unnecessary to draw any further account of Mr Daniell’s pyrometer, because he
                    has since made great improvements u])on it, as described by him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1830 and 1831, and in his
                    revised version of the same in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi>
                    for 1831 and 1832.</p>
                <p>This instrument we regard as a very important one, but still labouring under
                    several imperfections, and susceptible of great improvements, some of which will
                    be particularly noticed, after giving a general description. It consists of two
                    distinct parts: The register, which alone is to be exposed to the heat, and is
                    also to preserve an indication of the expansion of the material under trial; and
                    the scale, which is not so exposed to the heat, but only measures the expansion
                    upon the register after, the latter has cooled. The former of these, represented
                    in fig. 1, Plate CCCCXIX. consists of a bar of blacklead earthenware A A, eight
                    inches long, seven tenths broad, and of the same thickness, cut out of a common
                    blacklead crucible. In this is drilled a hole B B, three tenths of an inch in
                    width, and seven and a half inches deep; and about six tenths of an inch in
                    length of the substance of this bar is cut away from its side next the open end
                    at C C, by a plane running along the axis of the bore. When this blacklead
                    register is held upright, and a rod of any material 6 ’ 5 inches long is dropped
                    into the bore, it rests against the solid end; and then upon the top of this rod
                    is set a cylindrical piece of porcelain D D, about 1∙5 inch long, which Mr
                    Daniell calls the index, and which, projecting into and beyond the open part, is
                    firmly held to its place by a ring or hoop of platina, E E, which, passing round
                    the blacklead bar, and over the piece of porcelain, is made to press upon the
                    latter with any required degree of tension, by means of a small wedge of
                    porcelain, F F, inserted between the bar and the platina ring. When the
                    apparatus, so arranged, is exposed to a high temperature, the expansion of the
                    rod under trial will obviously force the index D forward through a very small
                    space, equal to the excess of its own expansion over that of the blacklead; and
                    after the register has again cooled, the index will be left nearly at the point
                    of greatest elongation. According to Mr Daniell, the exact indication of this
                    amount is not in the least affected by any permanent contraction which the
                    blacklead may undergo <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542138"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2138-0751"/>at a high temperature, because he assumes any such
                    contraction to occur-at the moment of the greatest expansion of the metal, and
                    the index, in consequence, still to mark its point of farthest extension upon
                    this contracted basis. We are not, however, so clear on this point; but
                    admitting it at present, the problem would now consist in the accurate
                    measurement of the distance through which the index has been shifted from its
                    original position. For this purpose, the scale, fig. 2, is constructed of two
                    rules of brass G G and H H, joined together at a right angle by their edges, and
                    fitting square upon two sides of the blacklead bar A A, and of about half its
                    length. From the end of this double rule a small bracket, I, of brass, projects
                    at a right angle, and which, when the two sides of the rules are applied to the
                    two sides of the register, is brought close to the shoulder formed by the notch
                    cut away at its open end, and the whole may thus be steadily adjusted to the
                    blacklead bar by three planes of contact. Upon the outside of this frame,
                    another and much larger brass rule K K, is firmly attached to it by the screws L
                    L. This rule, projecting beyond the frame, and being turned up at the end Μ,
                    about half an inch, so as to bring that end opposite the cavity in the blacklead
                    bar when applied to it, supports a moveable arm, N, exactly 5∙5 inches long,
                    turning, at its fixed extremity, upon a centre near M, and at its other end
                    carrying an arc of a circle 0 0, accurately divided into degrees and thirds of a
                    degree, whose radius is exactly five inches. At P, the centre of this arc, upon
                    the arm N, and, of course, at the distance of half an inch from the other centre
                    Μ, turns another lighter arm Q, whose length being five inches, equals the
                    radius of the circular arc 0 0, and one end of which carries with it a vernier
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which moves upon the face of the arc, and thereby
                    subdivides the former graduation into minutes. The other end projects half an
                    inch beyond the centre, P; and at the exact distance of one tenth of the radius
                    <hi rend="italic">Pa,</hi> and which equals the interval between the two centres
                    of motion, it carries an obtuse steel point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> turned
                    inwards at a right angle. This part of the apparatus may be regarded as a pair
                    of proportional compasses attached to the end of the brass rule and frame, and
                    whose longer legs N and Q, carrying the arc and vernier, are to the shorter,
                    carrying the point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> as ten to one; and the opening of
                    the shorter being regarded as a chord of a small circle, is enlarged in the same
                    proportion by the longer, and measured upon a scale. A small steel spring <hi
                    rend="italic">m m,</hi> let into the larger arm N, is made to press upon a
                    little pin <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> in the smaller arm Q, so as to adjust the
                    vernier <hi rend="italic">α</hi> to the commencement of the graduation; and when
                    forced back, it tends to restore it to its original position. A small lens <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> is represented as folded down, but may, by means <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the joints <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >I,</hi> be raised to be directly over the vernier, to facilitate the reading of
                    the divisions which coincide.</p>
                <p>In fig. 3, A is an iron tube about two inches in diameter, and closed at the
                    bottom. B is a blacklead tube, closed at the top, and fitted into the mouth of
                    the former one by grinding. C is a smaller blacklead tube projecting from the
                    side of the latter, and likewise fitted in by grinding. The whole forms a kind
                    of alembic, in which mercury may be easily boiled, without either loss, or
                    annoyance to the operator, by the escape of the vapour. When the register
                    containing a rod of some substance under trial was put within the iron tube, and
                    the remaining space filled with mercury, the boiling of the latter served the
                    purpose of a thermometer, showing when the temperature reached about 662°
                    Fahrenheit.</p>
                <p>When the expansion of any substance is to be ascertained, a rod of it is to be
                    provided, of such dimensions as will suit the cavity of the blacklead register;
                    and being placed therein, the porcelain index D is to be pressed down upon it,
                    and secured in its place by the platina’ring E and porcelain wedge F. The scale
                    part is then to be applied by carefully adjusting the brass rules GG, HH, to the
                    sides of the blacklead, and pressing the cross piece I upon the shoulder.
                    Holding the whole together steadily in the left hand, the moveable arm Q should
                    be so placed that the steel point <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the short arm may
                    rest upon the end of the porcelain index D, against which it will be pressed
                    with some force by the spring <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    then, moving the arm gently forward with the right hand, the point <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> will slide upon the end of the index till it drops into a
                    small cavity formed for its reception, and which is in a line with the axis of
                    the rod under trial in the register and the centre Μ on the brass rule. The
                    minute of the degree must then be noted, which the vernier <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> indicates upon the graduated arc. A similar measurement must be made
                    after the register has been exposed to an increased temperature and has cooled
                    again; and the number of degrees or minutes which the vernier may then mark,
                    will, by a simple calculation from the known length of the radii and angle, give
                    the length of the chord comprised between the original position of the point <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> and the point to which it has been shifted, namely, the
                    distance over which the index has been moved by the expansion.</p>
                <p>But the preceding description, which contains the substance of Mr Daniell’s view
                    of the matter, is by no means even theoretically correct in the mode of
                    computing the extent of the expansion. For Mr Daniell assumes that the
                    above-mentioned chord of the small arc intercepted between the two positions of
                    the point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> is always accurately in the same direction
                    with the axis of the bore in the blacklead; whereas nothing can be more evident
                    than that it must be owing to mere chance if it is ever so at all. Nor do we
                    know any direct method of insuring that the chord shall have that direction. The
                    problem obviously requires that chord to be reduced to the direction of the
                    bore; and its length so reduced may, in every case, be obtained from considering
                    that it is equal to the sum or difference of the sines of the two arcs which
                    measure the angular deviations of the short arm (or rather of the straight line
                    joining the centre of motion and the point <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> from being
                    perpendicular to the direction of the bore. But it is obviously by mere chance
                    if the two arcs happen to be equal, so as to have the sum of their sines the
                    same with the chord of their sum, as they are always assumed to be by Mr
                    Daniell. If the graduated arc had its zero placed so as to correspond to the
                    perpendicular position of the shorter arm, the two required arcs could then be
                    more conveniently read off. When these lie on opposite sides of the zero, it is
                    the sum of their sines that is to be used; but should they happen to be both on
                    one side, the difference of their sines is to be taken. But in place of using
                    either sines or chords, it would be preferable greatly to increase the lengths
                    of both arms; and then if sufficient care were taken to have the shorter arm as
                    nearly perpendicular as possible to the direction of the bore, the arc itself
                    comprised between the two positions of the point ó, from its now subtending a
                    much smaller angle, might generally be taken as the measure of the
                    expansion.</p>
                <p>Mr Daniell, as we have seen, though he admits that during an experiment a
                    permanent change may occur in the length of the blacklead, yet alleges that his
                    results are not affected thereby. But since it is in respect of the shoulder at
                    the mouth of the bore as bearing against the bracket I that his measures of
                    expansions are taken, it is evident that the position of the bottom of the bore
                    in respect of that bracket, and consequently the position of the index D in
                    respect of the steel point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> must be affected by the
                    full amount of any permanent change in the length of the bore of the register.
                    However, it is equally clear that, were the rules G and H made of sufficient
                    length to admit <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542151" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2151-0752"
                    />of the bracket I being placed at their other end, and so as to hold against
                    the closed extremity of the blacklead bar, any permanent change which may have
                    occurred in the length of the latter at the highest temperature, except in the
                    mere thickness of its bottom, would not affect the result. The effect of any
                    change of temperature on the brass rules could easily be allowed for, were it at
                    all worth appreciating.</p>
                <p>It will now be sufficiently manifest, without farther explanation, that instead
                    of using Mr Daniell’s scale-part, the amount of the expansion, as marked on the
                    register by the index, might be equally well ascertained by the turns of a fine
                    screw, as in Smeaton’s pyrometer; or, still more accurately, by means of the
                    microscopes and micrometer, as used with Ramsden’s pyrometer, and others of that
                    sort. The expansion might also be approximately measured by putting the register
                    and index transversely between two graduated rules about 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 inches apart, and very slightly converging; which
                    is similar to the mode in which Wedgwood measured his clay pieces.</p>
                <p>But we suspect that the porcelain index itself must be a source of very
                    considerable error or uncertainty, if its rate of expansion be different from,
                    as it most probably exceeds, that of the blacklead. For, although it is likely
                    that some points of the porcelain and blacklead which were in contact at the
                    highest temperature to which they have been exposed, will continue in contact
                    during and after the cooling, yet we are left quite in the dark as to the
                    situation of these points; and consequently, we have no means of appreciating
                    the length of that part of the index whose expansion is concerned. Nay,] a
                    similar uncertainty must, in consequence, attach to the effective length of the
                    blacklead register. By shortening the length of the index, these uncertainties
                    might be expected to be lessened; but it is by no means clear how they could be
                    entirely obviated, except, perhaps, by using an index and wedge which should
                    expand at precisely the same rate as the register does. Could the platina ring
                    be got slightly to hold upon the register without the aid of a wedge, but still
                    in such a manner that all the parts of the ring would slide equally along the
                    register by the pressure of the bar under trial, the ring itself might serve as
                    the index. In that case, instead of cutting away any portion from the side of
                    the register, it would be better merely to cut a longitudinal slit in it,
                    running quite through the axis of the bore, for the purpose of receiving and
                    making room for the motion of a rib to be fixed diametrically in the ring, and
                    upon which the expanding bar under trial could act, so as to move all the parts
                    of the ring equally along the register.</p>
                <p>By keeping a rod of platina in the register, exposing it to heats of various
                    intensities, and ascertaining in each case the excess of the expansion of the
                    platina over that of the blacklead, Mr Daniell determined a variety of
                    temperatures in terms of such excess, which, unfortunately, is always a very
                    small quantity, that between 32° and 212° Fahrenheit being counted 180 degrees.
                    These results, though incomparably nearer the truth than those obtained by
                    Wedgwood’s pyrometer, must still be more or less tainted with some of the
                    various errors to which we have either already alluded, or which are about to be
                    noticed. But as our limits will by no means admit of fully discussing all the
                    calculations, and attempting to correct them, we beg to refer the reader to the
                    originals; and shall only attempt such an account of the principal sources of
                    error as will sufficiently show the truth and importance of our allegations,
                    which are, besides, applicable to most English books treating on this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In deducing the numerical results from the experiments made with his pyrometer,
                    particularly in computing the expansion of blacklead, Mr Daniell avails himself
                    of the expansions which Dulonğ and Petit had obtained by the method already
                    noticed, and these he finds to correspond surprisingly with his own. But
                    independently of the doubts already hinted regarding their linear expansions,
                    this agreement, as we shall presently see, argues nothing in favour of either
                    determination; because the comparison has been made through the medium of a
                    serious mistake, as we shall now endeavour to explain. The results of Dulong and
                    Petit just referred to are those of the expansion of mercury and of several
                    solids, given in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie</hi> for 1818 (tome
                    vii.), and regarding which they inform us, that the degrees inserted in the
                    first columns of the tables are the upper limits of intervals of temperature,
                    which are each of them reckoned from the freezing point, or 0° cent. Thus,
                    regarding their Table IV., which bears more immediately on the present question,
                    and has 100° and 300° occupying the first column, we are told that it “contains
                    the mean dilatation of iron, copper, and platina, taken at first between 0°
                    cent, and 100°, and then between 0° and 300°.” That is to say, the first line of
                    these dilatations contains the 100th part of the whole expansion for the
                    interval between 0° and 100° cent., and the second line the 300th part of the
                    entire expansion for the interval between 0° and 300°. Indeed, it is either
                    expressly mentioned or obviously implied in the course of the Memoir, that every
                    one of their intervals which relate to the expansions in question, is reckoned
                    from the freezing point, and none of them from any higher temperature.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Dulong and Petit had published this account of their valuable
                    researches on heat, a translation of it appeared in the Annals of Philosophy
                    (first series, vol. xiii.); and prefixed to the same volume is a Historical
                    Sketch of the Sciences for 1818, which, amongst other things, professes to give
                    an abstract of the principal points treated by Dulong and Petit in the Memoir
                    referred to. But most unfortunately, in this Sketch, which seems to have been
                    hastily got up, the results of these learned foreigners have been sadly
                    misconstrued as far as regards expansion. For the numbers they have given as the
                    upper limits of those intervals of temperature, which are each of them reckoned
                    from the freezing point, are in the Sketch (page xii.) taken as so many points
                    of temperature, at each of which respectively the expansions of the several
                    bodies for one degree, as recorded in the other columns of the tables, take
                    place; a mistake so egregious, that it quite unhinges the thing altogether,
                    because the expansion, instead of being, as in the original, the mean for the
                    whole interval, is thus made to belong to its highest degree alone. Now it would
                    seem to have been somehow or other from this Sketch that Mr Daniell had taken up
                    his leading ideas of the question; at least he has adopted a very similar
                    misconstruction; for, in his Table II., which he gives as equivalent to Dulong
                    and Petit’s Table IV. above mentioned, he has, in place of 300° cent, or 540°
                    Fahrenheit, made the second interval to be only equal to the first, which is
                    100° cent, or 18θ° Fahrenheit, a sense in which similar temperatures are also
                    erroneously used in the Sketch (p. xii.). The effect of this unfortunate
                    oversight is to make the expansions of iron, copper, and platina, especially
                    that of iron, much smaller in the higher temperatures than Dulong and Petit
                    found them to bc; although, for want of data, we can only compute the effect of
                    the error with certainty on the whole interval of 540°, without separating that
                    of the higher temperature from the lower. Thus, Mr Daniell, by means of his very
                    laborious but erroneous mode of computing from the numbers of Dulong and Petit,
                    makes the linear expansion of 6*5 inches of iron, from 32° to 572° Fahrenheit,
                    to be only ∙025841887 inch. But the expansion of iron in the unit of volume, as
                    given by Dulong and Petit for that interval, or from 0° to 300° cent., is</p>
                <p>Now, one third of this taken as the linear expansion, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193542164" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2164-0753"/>multiplied by 6∙5, becomes
                    ∙028634361 inch. The error or deficiency of the former value is therefore
                    ∙002792474, and this would require to be added to ∙00878 (Mr Daniell’s expansion
                    of 6∙5 inches of blacklead), which will increase it to ∙01157. But even this
                    last number, if otherwise correct, is still too small, because the expansion
                    above 572° up to the boiling point of mercury, to which he carried that of the
                    blacklead, ought to have been computed at some higher rate, but for which we
                    have no data. Such are specimens of the very erroneous conclusions which the
                    above unfortunate oversight has led Professor Daniell to draw from the
                    experiments of Dulong and Petit.</p>
                <p>It seems to be from the same source, the Historical Sketch, that at least nine
                    tenths of all the excerpts or abstracts that have been written in English, of
                    the experiments of Dulong and Petit, are scarcely one whit more correct than the
                    preceding, as far as regards expansion; although we have met with no such
                    misconstruction of them in any foreign work. That such errors were very
                    prevalent in this country, had been briefly noticed by Mr Mciklc in the
                    Philosophical Magazine for September 1830; which, if not quite in time to have
                    saved the paper which Mr Daniell inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of
                    that year from the errors in question, must have been sufficiently so for the
                    one of next year, and for his revised version of both afterwards given, with
                    those errors entire, in the Philosophical Magazine. It is no doubt also from the
                    Sketch (page xvii.), that in English books, the specific heat of platina,
                    professedly from Dulong and Petit, is usually made ∙0355 at all temperatures,
                    and therefore often regarded as a remarkable exception to the general law;
                    whereas, between 0° and 100°, the mean value should only be O335; the larger
                    number ∙0355 being the mean for the whole interval between 0° and 300°. But the
                    Sketch contains various other inaccuracies; and some, like the one last noticed,
                    occur also in the English translation of the Memoir.</p>
                <p>In noticing the labours of Dulong and Petit, Professor Daniell regrets that those
                    able experimenters had not corrected their final results as to what he considers
                    an important error of calculation, supposed to have been pointed out by Mr
                    Crichton, regarding the expansion of mercury, particularly as employed by Dulong
                    and Petit in determining the expansions of glass and of several metals, in the
                    manner which we have briefly described above. It is, perhaps, rather unusual for
                    writers of eminence to adopt any correction of errors, however important or
                    clearly pointed out; because the public are generally expected to imbibe
                    whatever may emanate from such authorities, and to listen to no insinuations of
                    their being incorrect. But the following considerations will, in a great
                    measure, account for Mr Crichton’s corrections not having been adopted :—Isí,
                    Though it does not seem to be generally known in this country, Μ. Petit, who had
                    taken the most active part in these valuable researches, particularly in the
                    mathematical investigations and calculations, had died nearly four years before
                    Mr Crichton’s paper appeared in the Annals of Philosophy for April 1824; so that
                    Μ. Petit, who was a young man of great promise, has long been outlived by his
                    senior and distinguished colleague, Μ. Dulong, whose recent decease science has
                    now to deplore. 2d, We have nothing like satisfactory evidence that Dulong and
                    Petit have, after all, employed the erroneous modes of calculation imputed to
                    them; and we shall soon see that, in at least one of these, it is Mr Crichton
                    himself who is in the error. To determine the expansion of mercury in glass,
                    Dulong and Petit filled with that fluid a glass tube which had its open end
                    drawn into a capillary tube; and on heating this from zero up to different
                    temperatures, they weighed the corresponding portions of mercury which were
                    expelled. But they have nowhere said, nor is it so much as even implied in their
                    Memoir, that they held the increase of volume to be in the exact ratio of the
                    weight of mercury expelled, which would be to neglect the expansion of the
                    expelled portion itself. This, however, Mr Crichton assumes that they did; and
                    he thence concludes that they have made the expansion of mercury in glass, when
                    heated up from zero to 100° cent., to be too small in the ratio of 63∙8 to 64*8.
                    We have no data for determining how far this supposed error would affect the
                    expansions of the solid bodies operated on by Dulong and Petit; though it would
                    no doubt be to a much smaller extent than that resulting from the above errors,
                    into which Mr Daniell has himself fallen, in the temperatures. However, we find
                    that it would but very slightly derange the indications of a mercurial
                    thermome-tèr up to 300° cent., or 572° Fahrenheit. For example, if Dulong and
                    Petit have been right, the series of centigrade temperatures on the common
                    mercurial thermometer would stand thus: 0°, 100°, 203° ∙20, 307° ∙69; and if
                    they have been wrong, 0°, 100°, 203° ∙25, 307° ∙82; we mean in respect of those
                    on their air-thermometer taken as uniform.</p>
                <p>The preceding is by no means the only error with which Mr Crichton charges Dulong
                    and Petit. Besides other things of which we have no means of judging, he blames
                    them for holding the volume of mercury expelled by heat from the glass tube, to
                    be equal to the absolute expansion of mercury diminished by the expansion of the
                    glass; which, however, is a thing so palpably true, that scarcely any reasoning
                    can make it clearer than it is. But the extreme palpability of this does not
                    prevent Mr Crichton from going on with a process of reasoning <hi rend="italic"
                    >sui generis,</hi> from which he concludes, that the expansion of the glass is
                    much smaller than the difference between the absolute expansion of mercury and
                    its expansion in glass. Since in this Mr Crichton has, without doubt, deceived
                    not only himself, but many of his readers, it may be useful briefly to show how
                    it has been done. In the first place, he has sadly obscured his formulae, by
                    representing by unity each of two things of very different values, more
                    especially since both enter into the same expression. The one of these is the,
                    expansion of mercury in glass, and the other the expansion of the glass alone.
                    The like may be said of his using the term <hi rend="italic">co-efficient</hi>
                    to mean what other people would call a <hi rend="italic">denominator,</hi> or,
                    in some cases, a <hi rend="italic">reciprocal.</hi> But his principal error is,
                    that in order to correct the capacity or contents of the vessel for the
                    expansion of the glass, he makes a deduction, not from its contents as expanded
                    at 100° cent., but from its contents at the freezing point, or at least from
                    63∙8 times what he now uses as the expansion of mercury in glass; and in the
                    preceding part of his paper he had made the contents of the vessel at zero to be
                    just equal to 63∙8 times the expansion which mercury seems to undergo in a glass
                    vessel, by being heated from zero to 100° cent. In this case, therefore, the
                    error lies with Mr Crichton himself.</p>
                <p>The principle of the method employed by Mr Prinsep<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions for 1828, p.
                    82.</p></note> for ascertaining high temperatures, particularly those of
                    furnaces, by means of the least fusible substance each can melt, has already
                    been briefly alluded to, and differs very materially from that of Mr Daniell.
                    The former, which we shall now describe more in detail, was, after trying
                    various plans, fixed upon by Mr Prinsep, as possessing considerable claims to
                    accuracy, and having the great advantage of being identifiable, as he styles it,
                    at any time and in any part of the world. In other words, it can show <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193542177" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2177-0754"/> when the
                    temperatures or intensities in different eases are equal, though it cannot
                    determine in what ratio ι⅛nequal intensities differ among themselves. The fusing
                    points of pure metals are determinate and constant; they also comprehend a very
                    extensive range of temperature; and the unoxidable or noble metals, gold,
                    silver, and platina, alone embrace a range from the comparatively low melting
                    point of silver up to the high ignition of platina. There are, it is true, only
                    three fixed points in this scale; but between these as many more as are
                    requisite may be interpolated, by alloying those three metals, or rather any two
                    of them together ata time, in different proportions, though the like by no means
                    holds with every kind of alloys. When such a series as that now proposed has
                    been once prepared, the heat of any furnace may be expressed by the alloy of
                    least fiisibility which it is just capable of melting. Besides the unity of
                    determinations which such a pyrometer affords, several other advantages might be
                    mentioned: 1st, The smallness of the apparatus, nothing more being neeéssary
                    than a little cupel, containing, in separate cells, eight or ten pyrometric
                    alloys, each of the size of a pin’s head; <hi rend="italic">"2d,</hi> the
                    durability of these alloys, since the specimens melted in one experiment would
                    need only to be flattened by the hammer to be again ready for action, because
                    without some such change of figure it would be uncertain whether they had again
                    been melted or not; and, <hi rend="italic">2&gt;d,</hi> the facility of
                    notation, since two letters with the decimal of the alloy would express the
                    maximum heat. Thus, S∙3G might be used for an alloy of seven tenths of silver
                    with three tenths of gold; and G∙23P would express gold containing twenty-three
                    per cent. of platina. As gold melts at a heat not very much above that required
                    by silver, Mr Prinsep as* Sumed only ten degrees between them, distinguishing
                    each degree by a successive addition in the alloy of ten per cent, of gold to
                    the pure silver; the tenth degree being of course denoted by pure gold. These
                    alloys are easily made, and require no comment; but to suit more accurate
                    researches they may be farther subdivided, preserving still, for convenience,
                    the decimal notation. From the fusing point of pure gold up to that of pure
                    platina, Mr Prinsep assumed 100 degrees, adding one per cent. of the latter
                    metal to the alloy for each successive degree. Now, although the melting points
                    of the alloys used by Mr Prinsep apparently bear some relation to the
                    proportions of the pure metals employed; yet, since the melting point of every
                    alloy does not so much as lie between those of its component pure metals, but in
                    many cases is lower than either of them, it must be merely an accidental
                    coincidence, should any of Mr Prinsep’s degrees correspond to equal increments
                    of heat. They will, however, as was before observed, always indicate the same
                    intensity; and their absolute values, or even those in terms of the thermometer,
                    being a matter rather of speculation than of practical interest, are to be
                    sought for by other expedients, such as comparing the expansions of a bar of
                    platina with the fusing points of the alloys.</p>
                <p>The following are a few trials which Mr Prinsep made with his pyrometrie alloys
                    in different furnaces and in different parts of the same furnace. The disparity
                    of heat is greater than might have been supposed; and where, as in assaying the
                    precious metals, so much depends upon the exact temperature at which that
                    operation is performed, it would be useful to know every difference in this
                    respect obtaining in various countries, and its effect upon the quality or
                    standard of bullion. The temperatures are denoted by the least fusible alloys
                    melted in the several cases. Muffle of an assay furnace, front S∙0G</p>

                <p>Mr Prinsep says he lays little stress on the melting points of copper or iron,
                    owing to their being tried on such a small scale. The alloys of gold and silver
                    lose in weight by exposure to heat; but they are easily replaced, as the gold
                    may always be again purified. The platina alloys are very durable, but they
                    sometimes gain in weight. Mr Prinsep enters at considerable length into an
                    examination of the changes which the composition of the alloys underwent by
                    repeated fusion; but whether, or to what extent, their melting points may be
                    altered thereby, is a question never once mentioned, though of incomparably more
                    importance to the present subject.</p>
                <p>Having explained the means which Mr Prinsep had provided for ascertaining the
                    relative heat of a furnace, we turn to the more interesting portion of his
                    experiments on pyrometrie subjects, namely, the determination of the melting
                    points of pure silver, and of its alloys with gold, in degrees of an
                    air-thermometer. But we shall begin with the description of the apparatus
                    employed, which at last satisfied his expectations, and furnished the results
                    presently to be enumerated. In fig. 4, Plate CCCCXIX,, it is shown in full
                    operation. A represents a retort or bulb of pure gold, weighing about 6500
                    grains, and containing nearly ten cubic inches of air. B is a tube also of pure
                    gold, which at its outer end is firmly joined by a small gold collar to a
                    similar tube C, of pure silver; the bore of the latter tube is larger than that
                    of the gold; but to prevent any undue influence from the unequal heating of the
                    air contained in them both, and to confine the operation as much as possible to
                    the gold bulb, the two tubes are nearly filled up by putting in wires of the
                    same metals, so as to leave only a very minute crevice for the air to pass. The
                    outer part of the tube C is kept cool with a wet towel, to protect the stopeocks
                    and flexible tube D. This tube D completes the communication of the air bulb
                    with the glass reservoir E, which is intended as a substitute for an
                    inconvenient length of graduated tube. This reservoir is at first nearly filled
                    with olive oil, and is furnished with a safety tube and bulb F, into which the
                    oil rises when the air of the retort A begins to flow, and has a stopeock below,
                    for the purpose of restoring the equilibrium of pressure, by drawing out a
                    portion of the oil. In the collar of the reservoir E, however, there i⅛ another
                    stopcock aperture leading into a graduated glass tube G, in which a small bubble
                    of *oil is made to traverse. As this tube was very accurately divided into
                    200ths of a cubie inch, and may be read off to a tenth of that quantity, the
                    equilibrium of the pressure is capable of very delicate adjustment. The
                    furnance, as the figure exhibits, was situated behind a wall in an adjoining
                    apartment, so as to screen the exterior apparatus entirely from the heat. A
                    small thermometer in the bulb F, however, serves to note any minute change of
                    temperature in the reservoir E. The furnace and muffle need no description,
                    being of the ordinary assay construction. The little pyrometric cupels <hi
                    rend="italic">p, p, p,</hi> contain alloys of silver and gold, as already
                    described. Fig. 5 represents one of these cupels on a larger scale, with the lid
                    raised, showing three of the alloys melted, and the rest retaining their
                    previous form.</p>
                <p>Out of the numerous experiments which Mr Prinsep made with this apparatus, we
                    have selected the few following<pb break="no" facs="nls:193542190"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2190-0755"/> results; but for the full details of these and
                    many more, we beg to refer to the original description, where they are given at
                    great length.</p>

                <p>The second column is the volume, in cubic inches, of the air expelled from the
                    gold bulb, after all corrections. The third gives the contents of the heated
                    gold bulb. The fourth contains the expansion converted into degrees, at the rate
                    of three eighths-for 180 degrees. The fifth column shows the temperature of the
                    air. The sixth is the heat of the furnace, being the sum of the fourth and
                    fifth. The seventh shows the heat of the furnace by the pyrometric cupels. The
                    heat, in No. 1, exhibited an orange colour; in No. 2, bright orange; No. 3,
                    bright red; No. 4, bright orange; No. 5, silver wire melted; No. 9, full red
                    heat; No. 10, fresh air was put into the gold bulb; and in No. 11, the cupel at
                    the back of the bulb was S. 3G.</p>
                <p>From the construction of the apparatus, it must be evident that the temperature
                    is to be deduced from the measured volume of air expelled from the heated gold
                    bulb; which volume, again, is to be found by the weight of the oil drawn from
                    the reservoir, together with the adjustment of the bubble of oil in the
                    graduated glass tube. The necessary calculation, however, embraces several
                    corrections, some of them of minor effect, and of known and certain influence,
                    as the formulae for barometrical and thermometrical change, specific gravity of
                    the oil, &amp;c.; others which may affect materially the results, and are by no
                    means so certain in their power, such as the expansion of gold at high
                    temperatures, and the absolute law of gaseous expansion. This last has been
                    treated at considerable length under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hygrometry</hi> (vol. xii. page 114). At high temperatures a very small
                    difference in the quantity of air ejected produces a considerable change in the
                    corresponding temperature; in other words, this air-thermometer has the
                    disadvantage of becoming less sensible, in respect of the scale of the common
                    thermometer, with every increase of heat; for the portion of air which is
                    expelled from the hot bulb must necessarily be cooled to a known point before it
                    can he measured.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“That
                    the air-thermometer,” says Mr Prinsep, “cannot be expected to give indications
                    perfectly accordant, those who have kept registers of the sympiesometer will be
                    ready to grant.” But the case of the sympicsometer furnishes no authority on the
                    subject; because one very good reason for its own incongruities is to be found
                    in the faulty mode of correcting it for temperature, which is such that its
                    indications can .never keep pace with those of a good barometer, even were it
                    liable to no other objection.</p></note> But this objection, which was started
                    by Mr Prinsep himself, does not apply to bis apparatus in respect of a scale of
                    temperature graduated on the idea that air expands in geometrical progression
                    for equal increments of heat, as it has been shown to do in the article just
                    cited. The substitution of a reservoir of oil or mercury in place of a mere
                    graduated tube, is essential where the instrument is to be suddenly thrust into
                    the fire, as the rapid motion of a bubble of liquid in a tube would either, if
                    of oil, leave it as a film lining the tube, or, if of mercury, allow a passage
                    for the air past the side of it. The capacity of the reservoir employed by Mr
                    Prinsep was equal to that of a tube 50 feet long, and of the same bore as the
                    adjusting tube G. But it is evident that a bulb of gold can only be used at
                    temperatures lower than its own melting point, so that the temperatures for the
                    less fusible alloys are left undetermined.</p>
                <p>In the course of his pyrometric researches, Mr Prinsep repeatedly found that, on
                    heating a cast-iron retort from 80° up to 1800° Fahrenheit, it had, even after
                    having again become cold, acquired each time a permanent enlargement, which, by
                    three successive heatings, amounted to fully a ninth part of its original
                    capacity. Each successive increase, however, was so much less than the
                    preceding, that the first heating did nearly as much in that way as both the
                    other two. It does not appear to have occurred to Mr Prinscp that there is any
                    connection between such an augmentation of volume and the expansion which occurs
                    in the solidification of iron at the casting of it; but we shall now endeavour
                    to show, that they are just parts of one and the same process. It is curious,
                    that in almost every book in which the expansion of iron in congealing is
                    mentioned, it is, without giving so much as the shadow of reason or evidence,
                    said to be momentary or instantaneous. But in many of the innumerable forms of
                    the castings of iron, we have often observed cases occurring which cannot be
                    reconciled with its momentarily expanding in the act of solidification, unless
                    it also continue to expand considerably as long as it is kept very hot; and more
                    especially unless the parts which were first congealed continue to expand whilst
                    they remain in contact with any of the liquid metal. This impossibility of
                    reconciling the phenomena with a momentary expansion is particularly remarkable,
                    when in the structure of the article cast there occurs a massy nucleus of metal
                    with arms or leaves of more slender dimensions proceeding from it. In that case,
                    the interior of the nucleus is generally the last in congealing, and if so, it
                    is almost never quite sound, there being always a deficiency of metal to
                    complete such part of the casting as is last in congealing, which occasions it
                    to be of a spongy texture, and, perhaps, to have cavities in it of a very
                    different sort from those which are really owing to mere airbubbles. Sometimes a
                    cavity is open through the surface, which may be owing to its occurring so near
                    the outside that the thin crust is depressed or broken quite through by the
                    atmospheric pressure. When a hole is cast through the middle of a massy part of
                    the iron, by means of a previously dried core, the metal next the hole is
                    generally amongst the last in congealing, because such a core has almost no
                    tendency to cool it; and, therefore, owing to the foresaid deficiency of metal,
                    the hole where it passes through the interior is usually wider than the core,
                    and, perhaps, has one or more cavities branching off from it.</p>
                <p>Such cases as have now been instanced are of very common occurrence; but to some
                    people they have appeared so very paradoxical as to lead them to deny that any
                    expansion whatever can occur during the casting. At first sight, the sponginess
                    and cavities might, no doubt, be easily accounted for, as some have pretended to
                    do, by supposing iron to <hi rend="italic">contract,</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">expanding,</hi> at the time of congealing. But that an expansion
                    really occurs on that occasion, is so well attested<note anchored="true"

                    placed beyond any doubt; and, therefore, such expansion, taken in connection
                    with the preceding facts, and the important one noticed by Mr Prinsep, leaves us
                    no alternative but to conclude, that the final deficiency of metal is owing to
                    the exterior crust having, after its own formation, continued to expand, and
                    thereby <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542203" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2203-0756"/>to

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Prinsep not only never hints at there
                    being any connection between the expansion which occurs in casting, and that
                    which he observed; but the following quotation from the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1828, page 87, besides being curious, and the only remark he
                    has made on the subject, sufficiently shows that he had no idea of the nature of
                    the latter increase. “The augmentation,” says he, “which is more remarkable,
                    exceeds the dilatation due to the temperature to which it was exposed; for as
                    iron expands O105 in 180 degrees, the increase of bulk upon 10 cuþic inches
                    should be ∙105 X 3 = ’ 315 at 1800 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> Fahrenheit, or
                    near the melting point of silver; whence it may be concluded that the dilatation
                    of iron is not equable, as has been also proved by Messrs Dulong and Petit.” We
                    shall only add, that the experiments of these distinguished foreigners having
                    been made on wrought iron, it is very doubtful if they bear on the question of
                    permanent expansion.</p></note> The sponginess and cavities which so often occur
                    in the texture of the iron in the interior parts of an unbored cannon, and in
                    those of shot, seem readily referrible to the same source.</p>
                <p>Water and iron are usually supposed to follow similar laws of congelation, but
                    their phenomena are certainly very different; for water, in place of continuing
                    to expand, as iron may do, for an indefinite time, seems to cease to expand as
                    soon as it assumes the solid form. We have often observed, that on exposing
                    water in a thin vessel during intense frost, the exterior parts congeal first
                    all around, next the vessel as well as on the top, so as to incase completely
                    the remaining liquid with a crust of ice, which at length bursts, perhaps the
                    vessel too, and part of the water escapes through the fissures. This no doubt is
                    owing partly to the atmospheric pressure having prevented such crust from ever
                    being larger than just to contain the water, and partly’to the interior parts
                    expanding subsequently to the crust having ceased to expand; so that, in place
                    of a deficiency, there is here an excess of material within. On the contrary,
                    nothing like bursting ever occurs in the case of iron; though frequently it
                    happens that its more slender parts, in cooling, crack or break spontaneously,
                    from their not having been able to preserve a temperature sufficiently high to
                    continue the permanent part of the expansion so long after congelation as the
                    rest has done, and also from their contracting sooner than the rest by the more
                    sudden cooling. That the temporary part of the whole expansion which obtains in
                    cast iron at a high temperature, is so great as to exceed the permanent part,
                    appears from the subsequent contraction which occurs in cooling, as displayed by
                    the well-known fact, that any lengthy casting is always sensibly shorter than
                    its pattern; notwithstanding that the walls or inner surfaces of the mould,
                    especially when formed of soft materials, have, by yielding to the weight of the
                    liquid iron, and to the just-mentioned permanent part of the expansion, made
                    room for some addition to all the dimensions of the pattern; so that the
                    breadth, thickness, or such other of these dimensions as are small, generally
                    exceed the corresponding ones of the pattern. From Mr Prinsep’s experiments,
                    however, we may learn the very important caution, that after trying to what
                    extent any substance has been expanded whilst hot, it should also be ascertained
                    whether any of its dimensions have thereby undergone any permanent change. Some
                    of the stories so often repeated regarding remarkable exceptions to the general
                    laws of expansion, are very likely referrible to this kind of source. Thus,
                    glass vessels have sometimes been observed to acquire a permanent enlargement by
                    lotìg exposure to heat; and, in many researches, such a change in the vessel is
                    apt to be mistaken for one of the opposite sort in any fluid it may contain. The
                    case noticed by Mr Prinsep being that of a little iron retort, the mass would be
                    small and the metal thin; and, therefore, at the time it had been cast, it must
                    have cooled so soon that it could then have had almost no opportunity of
                    continuing to expand permanently after its solidification. Hence, on being
                    afterwards heated by Mr Prinsep, it would likely be in a state to expand so much
                    the more. For, supposing the volume to undergo no change from oxidation or other
                    chemical action, it is probable that long-continued annealing at a high
                    temperature would give to cast iron a volume which it would not afterwards
                    exceed, unless exposed to a still greater heat. On this principle, it might be
                    supposed that a sufficient annealing might expand all the parts in the same
                    ratio, and thereby ultimately fill up all the vacancies of the interior; but the
                    rigidity of the iron puts this out of the question; and at any rate, granting
                    that the annealing did bring the parts quite close together, they would not
                    likely be united by cohesion at a heat so far below that required for
                    welding.</p>
                <p>Thç preceding view of the subject, we presume, will be found to tracé to a common
                    source, and thereby to reconcile in a satisfactory manner, the various phenomena
                    above mentioned, which depend upon the permanent expansion of cast iron, and
                    have so often been regarded as paradoxical. The continued enlargement of the
                    crust is most probably owing to some change of texture or arrangement, such as
                    crystallization occurring not only, as is usually supposed, at the instant of
                    congelation, and perhaps, too, before it, but continuing to go on in the solid
                    part of the iron for a long while after, if it be kept sufficiently hot; and the
                    nature of the mould very likely modifies this result, as it certainly does
                    several others. Thus, a piece of iron cast in a metallic mould, being more
                    suddenly cooled than if cast in sand, is much harder, and has, besides, a very
                    different texture. But whilst it is not improbable that the contact of the
                    metallic mould may be equally or more favourable to a particular arrangement of
                    the particles, such process will be so much the sooner stifled by the more
                    sudden cooling. As to wrought iron, its fracture sometimes exhibits a
                    crystalline texture, which is a particularly bad symptom of its strength, but
                    one, perhaps, which may have some connection with a permanent expansion. Bismuth
                    and antimony are known to expand at the time of congealing; but how closely in
                    this respect they may resemble cast iron, has not, as far as we know, been
                    ascertained. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. e. e.)</hi></p>
