                    History,</hi> is regarded by Roman Catholics as a term of reproach, but having
                    been generally received amongst Protestants, now comprehends the religious
                    doctrines and practices adopted and maintained by the church of Rome. The
                    following summary, extracted chicfly from the decrees of the council of Trent,
                    continued under Paul III., Julius IIL, and Pius IV., by successive sessions,
                    from the year 1545 to 1563, and the creed of Pope Pius IV. subjoined to it, and
                    bearing date November 1564, may not be unacceptable to the reader. One of the
                    fundamental tenets strenuously maintained by Catholic writers, is the
                    infallibility of the church of Rome; and though they are not agreed λvhether
                    this privilege belongs to the pope or a general council, or to both united, yet
                    they pretend that an infallible living judge is absolutely necessary to
                    determine controversies, and to secure peace, in the Christian church.
                    Protestants, however, allege that the claim of infallibility in any church is
                    not justified by the authority of Scripture, much less does it appertain to the
                    church of Rome; that it is inconsistent with the nature of religion, and the
                    personal obligations of its professors; and that it has proved ineffectual to
                    the end for which it is supposed to have been granted, since popes and councils
                    have disagreed in matters of importance, and, with the advantage of this
                    pretended infallibility, have been incapable of maintaining union and peace.
                    Another essential article of the Catholic creed is the supremacy of the pope, or
                    his sovereign power over the universal church.</p>
                <p>Further, the doctrine of the seven sacraments is a peculiar and distinguishing
                    doctrine of the church of Rome. These are baptism, confirmation, the eucharist,
                    penance, ex treme unction, holy orders, and matrimony. The council of Trent
                    (sess. vii. can. 1) pronounces an anathema upon those who say that the
                    sacraments are more or fewer than seven, or that any one of the above number is
                    not truly and properly a sacrament. And yet it does not appear that they
                    amounted to this number before the twelfth century, when Hugo de St Victoire and
                    Peter Lombard, about the year 1144, taught that there were seven sacraments. The
                    council of Florence, held in the year 1438, was the first council which
                    determined this number. These sacraments confer grace, according to the decree
                    of the council of Trent (sess. vii. can. 8) <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">opere operato,</hi> that is, by the mere administration of them;
                    three of them, viz. baptism, confirmation, and holy orders, are said (can. 9) to
                    impress an indelible character, so that they cannot be repeated without
                    sacrilege; and the efficacy of every sacrament depends upon the intention of the
                    priest by whom it is administered (can. 11). Pope Pius expressly enjoins that
                    all these sacraments should be administered according to the received and
                    approved rites of the Catholic church. With regard to the eucharist in
                    particular, we may here observe, that the church of Rome holds the doctrine of
                    transubstantiation; the necessity of paying divine worship to Christ under the
                    form of the consecrated bread, or host; and the propitiatory sacrifice of the
                    mass, according to the Catholic ideas of which Christ is truly and properly
                    offered as a sacrifice of propitiation as often as the priest says mass. It
                    likewise practises solitary mass, in which the priest alone consecrates,
                    communicates, and allows communion only in one kind, namely, the bread, to the
                    laity. (Sess. 14.)</p>
                <p>The doctrine of merits is another distinguishing tenet of Popery, with regard to
                    which the council of Trent has expressly decreed (sess. vi. can. 32) that the
                    good works of justified persons are truly meritorious, deserving not only an
                    increase of grace, but eternal life, and an increase of glory; and it has
                    anathematized all who deny this doctrine. Of the same kind is the doctrine of
                    satisfaction, which supposes that penitents may truly satisfy, by the
                    afflictions they endure under the dispensations of Providence, or by voluntary
                    penances to which they submit, for the temporary penalties of sin, to which they
                    arc subject even after the remission of their eternal punishment. (Sess. vi.
                    can. 30; and sess. xiv. can. 8 and 9.) In this connection we may mention the
                    distinction of venial and mortal sins. The greatest evils arising from the
                    former are the temporary pains of purgatory; but no man, it is said, can obtain
                    the pardon of the latter without confessing to a priest, and performing the
                    penances which he imposes.</p>
                <p>The council of Trent (sess. xiv. can. 1) has expressly decreed, that every one is
                    accursed who shall affirm that penance is not truly and properly a sacrament,
                    instituted by Christ in the universal church, for reconciling those Christians
                    to the divine majesty, who have fallen into sin after baptism. And this
                    sacrament, it is declared, consists of two parts, the matter and the form; the
                    matter being the act of the penitent, including contrition, confession, and
                    satisfaction; the form, the act of absolution on the part of the priest.
                    Accordingly it is enjoined, that it is the duty of every man who has fallen
                    after baptism, to confess his sins, once a year at least, to a priest; that this
                    confession is to be secret, for public confession is neither commanded nor
                    expedient; and that it must be exact and particular, including every kind and
                    act of sin, with all the circumstances attending it. When the penitent has so
                    done, the priest pronounces an absolution, which is not conditional or
                    declarative only, but absolute and judicial. This secret or auricular confession
                    was first decreed and established in the fourth council of Lateran, under Pope
                    Innocent III. in 1215 (cap. 21); and the decree of this council was afteι wards
                    confirmed and enlarged in the council of Florence and in that of Trent, which
                    ordains, that confession was instituted by Christ, that by the law of God it is
                    necessary to salvation, and that it has always been practised in the Christian
                    church. As for the penances imposed on the penitent by way of satisfaction, they
                    have been commonly the repetition of certain forms of devotion, as paternosters
                    or ave-marias, the payment of stipιdated sums, pilgrimages, fasts, or various
                    species of corporal discipline. But the most formidable penance, in the
                    estimation of those who belong to the communion of the church of Rome, is the
                    temporary pains of purgatory. Yet under all the penalties which are inflicted or
                    threatened in that church, it has provided relief by its indulgences, and by its
                    prayers or masses for the dead, performed professedly for relieving and rescuing
                    the souls that are detained in purgatory.</p>
                <p>Another article which has long been authoritatively enjoined and observed in the
                    church of Rome, is the celibacy of her clergy. This was first enjoined at Rome
                    by Gregory VII. about the year 1074, and established in England by Anselm
                    archbishop of Canterbury about the year 1175; though his predecessor Lanfranc
                    had imposed it upon the prebendaries and clergy who lived in towns. And though
                    the council of 4 rent was repeatedly petitioned by several princes and states to
                    abolish this restraint, vet the obligation of celibacy was rather established
                    than relaxed by this council; for they decreed, that marriage contracted after a
                    vow of continence is neither lawful nor valid, and thus deprived the church of
                    the possibility of ever restoring marriage to the clergy. If marriage, after a
                    vow, be in itself unlawful, the greatest authority upon earth cannot dispense
                    with it, nor permit marriage to the clergy, who have already vowed
                    continence.</p>
                <p>To the doctrines and practices above recited may further be added the worship of
                    images, of which Protestants accuse<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537601?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7601-0406"/> the Papists.
                    But to this accusation the Papist replies, that he keeps images by him to
                    preserve in his mind the memory of the persons represented by them, as people
                    are wont to preserve the memory of their deceased friends by keeping their
                    pictures. He is taught, he says, to use them so as to cast his eyes upon the
                    pictures or images, and thence to raise his heart to the things represented, and
                    there to employ it in meditation, love, thanksgiving, and desire of imitation,
                    as the object requires. These pictures or images have this advantage, that they
                    inform the mind by one glance, of what in reading might require a tvhole
                    chapter; there being no other difference between them, than that reading
                    represents leisurely and by degrees, whilst a picture does so at once. Hencc he
                    finds a convenience in saying his prayers with some devout pictures before him,
                    the sight of which recalls his wandering thoughts to the right object, and as
                    certainly brings something good into his mind, as an immodest picture disturbs
                    his heart with unclean thoughts. And because he is sensible that these holy
                    pictures and images represent and bring to his mind such objects as in his heart
                    he loves, honours, and venerates, he cannot but on that account love, honour,
                    and respect, the images themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See G other’s Papist Misrepresented and
                    Represented.</p></note></p>
                <p>The council of Trent likewise decreed, that all bishops and pastors who have the
                    cure of souls, do diligently instruct thcir flocks that it is good and
                    profitable to desire the intercession of saints reigning with Christ in heaven.
                    And this decree the Papists endeavour to defend by many arguments. They confess
                    that we have but one Mediator of redemption, but affirm that it is acceptable to
                    God that we should have many mediators of intercession. Moses, say they, was
                    such a mediator for the Israelites; Job for his three friends; Stephen for his
                    persecutors. The Romans were thus desired by St Paul to be his mediators; so
                    were the Corinthians and the Ephesians, so almost every sick man desires the
                    congregation to be his mediators, by remembering him in their prayers. And so,
                    too, the Papist desires the blessed in heaven to be his mediators, that is, that
                    they would pray to God for him. But between these living and dead mediators
                    there is no similarity. The living mediator is present, and certainly hears the
                    request of those who desire him to intercede for them; the dead mediator is as
                    certainly absent, and cannot possibly hear the requests of all those who at the
                    same instant may be begging him to intercede for them, unless he be possessed of
                    the divine attribute of omnipresence; and he who ascribes that attribute to any
                    creature is unquestionably guilty of idolatry. Besides, as this decree is
                    contrary to one of the first principles of natural religion, so it receives no
                    countenance from Scripture, or any Christian writer of the first three
                    centuries. Other practices peculiar to the Papists are the religious honour and
                    respect that they pay to sacred relics, by which they understand not only the
                    bodies and parts of the bodies of the saints, but any of those things that
                    appertained to them, and which they had touched; and the celebration of divine
                    service in an unknown tongue, in regard to which the council of Trent has
                    denounced an anathema on any one who shall say that mass ought to be celebrated
                    only in the vulgar tongue (session xxv. and session xxii.can.9). Though the
                    council of Lateran under Innocent III. in 1215, had (can. 9) expressly decreed,
                    that as in several parts within the same city and diocese there are many people
                    of different manners and rites mixed together, but of one faith, so the bishops
                    of such cities or dioceses should provide fit men for celebrating divine
                    offices, according to the diversity of tongues and rites, and for administering
                    the sacraments.</p>
                <p>We shall only add further, that the church of Rome maintains that unwritten
                    traditions ought to be added to the holy Scriptures, in order to supply their
                    defect, and should be regarded as of equal authority; that the books of the
                    Apocrypha are canonical Scripture; that the vulgate edition of the Bible is to
                    be deemed authentic; and that the Scriptures arc to be received and interpreted
                    according to that sense which the holy mother church, to whom it belongs to
                    judge of the true sense, has held, and does hold, and according to the unanimous
                    consent of the Fathers.</p>
                <p>Such are the principal and distinguishing doctrines of Catholicism or Popery,
                    most of which have received the sanction of the council of Trent, and that of
                    the creed of Pope Pius IV. which is received, professed, and sworn to by every
                    one who enters into holy orders in the church of Rome, as well as by all
                    proselytes or converts: And at the close of this creed, we are told that the
                    faith contained in it is so absolutely and indispensably necessary, that no man
                    can be saved without it.</p>
