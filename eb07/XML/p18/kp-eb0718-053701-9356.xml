                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Printing</hi> is the art of taking one or more impressions
                    from the same surface, whereby characters and signs, east, engraven, drawn, or
                    otherwise represented thereon, are caused to present their reverse images upon
                    paper, vellum, parchment, linen, and other substances, in pigments of various
                    hues, or by means of chemical combinations, of which the components are
                    contained on or within the surface from which the impression is taken, or in the
                    fabric of the thing impressed, or in both.</p>
                <p>The most important branch of printing is what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >letter-press</hi> printing, or the method of taking impressions from letters
                    and other characters <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> in relief upon separate pieces
                    of metal, and therefore capable of indefinite combination. The impressions are
                    taken either by superficial or surface pressure, as in the common printing
                    press, or by lineal or cylindrical pressure, as in the printing machine and
                    roller-press. The pigments or inks, of whatever colour, are always upon the
                    surface of the types; and the substances which may be impressed are various.
                    Wood-cuts and other engravings <hi rend="italic">in relief</hi> are also printed
                    in this manner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copperplate</hi> printing is the reverse of the above, the
                    characters being <hi rend="italic">engraven</hi> in intaglio, and the pigments
                    or inks contained within the lines of the engravings, and not upon the surface
                    of the plate. The impressions are always taken by lineal or cylindrical
                    pressure; the substances to be impressed, however, are more limited. All
                    engravings in intaglio, on whatever material, are printed by this method.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lithographic</hi> printing is from the surface of certain
                    porous stones, upon which characters are <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi> with
                    peculiar pencils. The surface of the stone being wetted, the chemical colouring
                    compound adheres to the drawing, and refuses the stone. The impression is taken
                    by a scraper, that rubs violently upon the back of the substances impressed,
                    which are fewer still in number. Drawings upon zinc and other materials are
                    printed by this process. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lithography.)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cotton and calico</hi> printing is "from surfaces engraven either
                    in relief or in intaglio. The chemical compounds are either on or within the
                    characters, as pigments or chemical colours, or in the fAbric to be printed, but
                    mostly in both; the combination of chemical substances producing colour when the
                    fabric and the engraving are brought into contact. The impression is either
                    superficial or lineal, but mostly lineal. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>LETTER-PRESS PRINTING.</p>
                <p>The origin and history of an art which has exercised such an influence on
                    civilization, and contributed in so essential a manner to the cultivation of the
                    human intellect, have naturally become a matter of inquiry amongst the learned,
                    and have almost as naturally been the source of earnest controversy; for there
                    are few effects of human invention or industry that have been originated and
                    brought to perfection at a particular epoch, without any previous train of
                    thought or circumstance, so that the precise day or year could be noted in which
                    the perfect Minerva started forth in full maturity. On the contrary, it is
                    difficult to say at what period of time the germ of the art of printing did not
                    exist. So obvious is the reproduction of similar appearances from an impression
                    of the same surface, that the most early of mankind must have noted it; and even
                    the impression of a foot or a hand must have suggested a simple and intelligible
                    mode of conveying an idea, before the invention of any kind of writing.
                    Accordingly, these and similar signs are found to compose the chief characters
                    of the earliest writing, which is the symbolic.</p>
                <p>Observing this general law of the gradual perfectibility of human arts, we must
                    look back to the most remote ages for the first steps of that of printing. We
                    shall accordingly find certain evidence, that, more than two thousand years
                    before our era, a method of multiplying impressions, rude and imperfect in the
                    extreme, was certainly practised; but although the general fact is universally
                    allowed, it is extremely difficult to give satisfactory examples. Turning,
                    however, to Egypt, we shall find such traces as sufficiently prove the truth of
                    the general statement.</p>
                <p>The ingenuity of mankind had for a long period confined itself principally to the
                    more easy and beautiful art of colouring surfaces with pigments, in the
                    imitation of surrounding objects; and had their desires been limited to the
                    production of a single essay, they would have made no deviation from an art so
                    beautiful, and so susceptible of taste and variety. But when the wants and
                    conveniences of an advanced state of society required effects of a more lasting
                    character, less costly, and of more general application, a method of producing
                    the same, or nearly the same effect, with considerable rapidity, very soon
                    presented itself; and the sacred inscriptions at first painted or engraved upon
                    the figures of the deities, and possibly upon articles of domestic use, were
                    impressed upon plastic models with equal ease and certainty.</p>
                <p>Babylon presents us with some remarkable specimens of the progress of this art,
                    which may be received as the earliest instances of <hi rend="italic"
                    >imprinting,</hi> the epoch of which can be in any degree approximated. These
                    are found on the bricks many of which have been discovered on the site of the
                    departed city. That the Assyrians should have thought it worth while to print
                    inscriptions upon materials destined to be built into their dwellings (and every
                    <hi rend="italic">kiln-burned</hi> brick amongst these vast ruins is stamped
                    with an inscription), argues that the process was not only not an uncommon one,
                    but also that there probably existed at the same time a more advanced and more
                    elegant usage of imprinting in their domestic and ornamental arts. Specimens of
                    these bricks may be seen in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, in the
                    British Museum, in the library of the East India Company, and in several private
                    collections. Those at Cambridge are parallelopipeds of thirteen inches in length
                    by three in thickness, and are made of clay mixed with reeds, and burned in the
                    kiln. On one of the large surfaces is an indentation, produced by the forcible
                    impression of a stamp, from the face of which a large portion has been cut away,
                    leaving a series of figures in relief. The depression produced by this stamp is
                    six inches and one eighth by three and five eighths in extent, and about three
                    eighths of an inch in depth. It is exceedingly rude in execution, bearing a
                    strong resemblance to the impressions of the names of the makers to be found
                    upon the backs of inferior earthen-ware; and is produced by exactly the same
                    means, the process of baking entirely destroying whatever sharpness the soft
                    mass may have had. The inscription is clearly stamped in after the clay has been
                    turned out of the mould, and is not produced by any part of it; for in all known
                    specimens it is placed in different positions, and never stands parallel to the
                    edges of the brick, being in fact put on more or less awry, according to the
                    care and manual skill of the workman. The surface of the brick around the
                    depression is forced up considerably, which is exactly the effect of pressing
                    the hand or any substance into a plastic material; and the edges both of the
                    parent depression and of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539369"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9369-0538"/>figures present the effect of the stamp having
                    been drawn up whilst the clay was still damp and adherent to it. The inscription
                    consists of six vertical columns, containing thirty-eight figures; the columns
                    arc divided by bold straight lines. The characters arc those usually called the
                    Perscpolitan or arrow-headed, but better described by the French as nailheaded.
                    They are found very widely spread over Asia, but most plentifully at Persepolis.
                    No one has hithςrto made any considerable progress in deciphering them, nor have
                    the learned been able to determine whether they are alphabetic, syllabic,
                    hieroglyphic, or signs representing one or more words, as in the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Curious as are these specimens of Assyrian art, Babylon presents us with others
                    still more choice. These are a kind of cylinder, shaped like a barrel, but
                    rather longer in proportion to the width. The one described is seven inches in
                    height, and three inches in diameter at the cuds; it is made of fine clay, and
                    baked. The inscriptions are in the same character as those found upon the
                    bricks, arranged in vertical lines, commencing, or ending, according to the way
                    of reading, near the middle of the cylinder, where it is of the greatest
                    diameter, and running down to the foot. There are consequently two inscriptions,
                    one on either half; and there is an interval running <hi rend="italic"
                    >round</hi> the cylinder between the two, without any impression. Counting upon
                    a drawing, there are thirty-two vertical lines in either inscription, and
                    consequently they are less than a quarter of an inch in width. There are thirty
                    figures in one of the columns; and each figure would therefore occupy a space of
                    less than one eighth of an inch. The figures are perfectly sharp and distinct,
                    and the whole cylinder is a beautiful specimen of art. The one to which we
                    allude is in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge; but many very excellent
                    specimens have lately been deposited in the British Museum, an actual inspection
                    of which, and of other cognate relics, will enable the curious to form a much
                    better idea of their excellence than any description, however diffuse. They are
                    of all sizes, from a foot in height to the size of a signet, to which purpose
                    probably they were sometimes applied, since some specimens are perforated as if
                    intended for the insertion of a wire or cord; indeed there are specimens of
                    somewhat similar cylinders with the wire inserted for thumb-rings. Perhaps those
                    a little larger were hung round the neck as charms and amulets.</p>
                <p>That a similar art was known to the inhabitants of the old world generally, may
                    safely be assumed. It is therefore not a little remarkable that people so
                    original and ingenious as the Greeks, and so imitative as the Romans, should
                    have left almost no vestige of their having practised any such mean as this to
                    multiply their beautiful creations of fancy, or to embellish the tasteful
                    appliances of domestic life; especially when we consider the easy adaptation of
                    the art to pottery, and the beauty, taste, and ingenuity which they exhibited in
                    that manufacture. For, excepting a few paltry designs <hi rend="italic">en
                    creux</hi> on some of the coarser specimens, and a few marks upon the Roman
                    military vessels, evidently stamped, there is no appearance of either people
                    having had any idea of this kind; the sister art of taking impressions in seals
                    not being fairly to be classed under this head. There are, however, in the
                    British Museum some instruments presenting a singular instance of how very
                    nearly one may approach to an important discovery, and yet pass on unheeding.
                    These stamps are of brass, and amongst others the signet of C. Caecilius Hermia.
                    The face of this is two inches by four fifths of an inch, and the inscription,
                    with a border, is in relief, the surrounding parts being cut away to a
                    considerable depth. It should be especially noticed, that the surface of the
                    field is very rough; and there is a ring at the back by which it could be
                    handled or suspended.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Antiquarian Society of Newcastle possesses a similar stamp with a Greek
                    inscription.</p></note> These circumstances render the use of it very clear. It
                    would be very much easier to incise the required inscription, and to let the
                    field stand (indeed the art of engraving <hi rend="italic">en creux</hi> was
                    well known and used), than to cut away the field and leave the letters in
                    relief; and it would produce a much more beautiful effect if it were used to
                    impress any soft substance; whereas, cut as it is, the impression sunk into the
                    wax or clay would not only be ugly, but illegible, and the rough surface of the
                    field would present the most ungainly appearance upon the prominent parts of the
                    wax, being the parts most presented to the eye. Its use therefore is evident.
                    The relieved inscription, and no other part, being covered with ink or pigment,
                    was impressed upon an even surface (papyrus, linen, parchment), and consequently
                    left a perfect but reversed imprint of itself. This is the precise effect of
                    printing with types. Now, from the circumstance of Caecilius being a person of
                    no known eminence, it is a fair conclusion that such an instrument was not
                    uncommon amongst those who either were not able to write, or were engaged in
                    public employments requiring a great number of signatures, or who were
                    accustomed to commit the signing of documents to subordinates on their behalf.
                    From the Greek agnomen, Caecilius probably lived under the emperors, when
                    literature had become one of the pursuits of the great, and when the
                    difficulties and expense of procuring books by the slow process of copying were
                    bitterly felt. It is singular, therefore, that they should have overlooked so
                    obvious an improvement upon their own signets as the engraving whole sentences
                    and compositions upon blocks, and thence transferring them to paper, even if
                    they had gone no farther than this.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Chinese printing is not unlike this, and must by no
                    means be supposed to have much similarity to the modern art. They assert that it
                    was used by them several centuries before it was known in Europe; in fact, fifty
                    years before the Christian era. They certainly may have used their method
                    centuries before our art, for it differs in nothing but extent from that of the
                    old Roman. The following is a description of their method at the present day,
                    and it is probably the same in every respect as that in practice two thousand
                    years ago in an empire where nothing is changed. As their written language
                    consists of from eighty to one hundred thousand characters, it would be utterly
                    impracticable to use moveable types, and the use of block-printing would be the
                    most easy and rapid. The sentences, therefore, desired to be multiplied, being
                    drawn upon their thin paper, this is made to adhere with the face downward to a
                    block of soft wood, so that the characters appear through <hi rend="italic"
                    >reversed.</hi> The plain wood is then cut away with most wonderful rapidity,
                    and the drawing left in relief. Both sides of the block are similarly operated
                    upon. The engraved wood is then properly arranged upon a fran e, and the artist,
                    with a large brush, covers the whole surface, the field as well as the relief,
                    with a very thin ink; he then lays very lightly over it a sheet of paper, and
                    passes a large soft brush over it, so slightly, yet so surely, that the paper is
                    pressed upon the raised figures, and upon no other part. The rapidity with which
                    this is performed is extraordinary; for Du Hakle asserts that one man can print
                    ten thousand sheets in one day, a number which would anpear incredible, did not
                    very good testimony exist at the present time that one man can print seven
                    hundred sheets per hour. The method of putting the thin sheets together when
                    printed, is as different from ours as their printing and mode of reading. The
                    sheets are printed on one side only; but instead of the blanks being pasted
                    together to form one leaf, the sheet is so folded that no single edge of paper
                    is presented to the reader, but only the double-folded edge; the loose edges
                    being all at the back of the book.</p></note></p>

                <p>From this time a vast period elapses before any circumstance can safely be
                    instanced as showing that the practice of transferring characters was known to
                    any, even comparatively civilized people. From the rough and imperfect attempts
                    above indicated, the first and most obvious advance was engraving pictures upon
                    wooden blocks. The first practice of this is involved in obscurity, but most
                    writers on the fine arts agree that the art was invented towards the end of the
                    thirteenth century, by a brother and sister of the illustrious family of Cunio,
                    lords of Imola, in Italy. By some the whole narrative is considered as
                    apocryphal, but it is nevertheless generally admitted. The engravings were
                    discovered by a Frenchman of the name of Papillon, in the possession of a Swiss
                    gentleman, Μ. de Groeder, who deciphered for him the manuscript annotations
                    found upon the leaves of the book in which they were bound. These purported that
                    the book had been given to Jan. Jacq. Torino, a native of Berne, by the Count of
                    Cunio, with whose family he, Turine, appears to have been intimately acquainted.
                    Then follows a romantic history of the twins, and the cause of their invention.
                    The book is entitled “The Heroic Actions, represented in figures, of the great
                    and magnanimous Macedonian king, the bold and valiant Alexander; dedicated,
                    presented, and humbly offered to the most Holy Father Pope Honorius IV., the
                    glory and support of the church, and to our illustrious and generous fattier and
                    mother, by us Alessandro AlbericoCunio, cavalière, and Isabella Cnnio, twin
                    brother and sister; first reduced, imagined, and attempted to be executed in
                    relief, with a small knife, on blocks of wood, made even and polished by this
                    learned and dear sister; continued and finished by us together, at Ravenna, from
                    the eight pictures of our invention painted six times larger than here
                    represented; engraved, explained by verses, and thus marked upon the paper, to
                    perpetuate the number of them, and to enable us to present them to our relations
                    and friends, in testimony of gratitude, friendship, and affection. All this was
                    done and finished by us when only sixteen years of age.” This title is here
                    given at full length, because, if genuine, it presents us at once with the
                    origin, execution, and design of these first attempts at block-printing. The
                    book consists of nine engravings inclnding the title; the figures are tolerably
                    well designed, and the draperies graceful, with here and there attempts at
                    cross-hatching; under the principal personages are their names; above, are
                    inscriptions indicating the subject, and below, four lines of poetical Latin
                    explanatory of it; and in some part of each print is an inscription indicating
                    the share the twins respectively had in the execution. The colour of the pigment
                    is gray.</p>

                    the choice of their subject by the identity of the name of the great conqueror
                    with that of the brother; at least such coincidences are not without parallel in
                    the history of literature.</p></note></p>
                <p>From the dedication of this book to Pope Honorius IV., it is deduced that these
                    engravings must have been exe cuted between 1284 and 1285, inasmuch as this pope
                    only enjoyed the pontificate two years; and it is suggested that a copy of it
                    might be found in the library of the Vatican. The narrative appears to be
                    confirmed by many incidental circumstances, which bear every evidence of not
                    being the invention either of Papillon or his informer. The name of Alberico
                    seems to have been a favourite with the family of Cunio, and a count of that
                    name actually figures in history in the very year of the presumed invention; a
                    relative of the twins, of course, not the male artist himself.</p>
                <p>The interval between the time of the twin Cunio and the next mention of any
                    similar usage is very perplexing; but upon examination it will appear that that
                    long period was not altogether a blank in the art. The next earliest evidence is
                    a document of the government of Venice, discovered amongst the archives of the
                    Company of Printers in that city. It bears the date of 1441, and as it throws
                    some degree of light upon the controversy relative to the invention of printing,
                    it is here given from Ottley’s History of Engraving.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">μ</hi> cccc XLi. October the 1
                    lth. Whereastheart and mystery of making cards and printed figures, which is
                    used at Venice, has fallen into total decay; and this in consequence of the
                    great quantity of playing cards, and coloured figures printed, which are made
                    out of Venice; to which evil it is necessary to apply some remedy; in order that
                    the said artists, who are a great many in family, may find encouragement rather
                    than foreigners. Let it be ordered and established, according to that which the
                    said masters have supplicated, that from this time in future, no work of the
                    said art that is printed or painted on cloth or on paper, that is to say,
                    altar-pieces (or images), and playing-cards, and whatever other work of the said
                    art is done with a brush or printed, shall be allowed to be brought or imported
                    into this city, under pain of forfeiting the Works so imported, and XXX livres
                    and xii soldi, of which fine one third shall go to the state, one third to the
                    Signori Giustizieri Vecchi, to whom the affair is committed, and one third to
                    the accuser. With this condition, however, that the artists who make the said
                    works in this city may not expose the said works to sale in any other place but
                    their own shops, under the pain aforesaid, except on the day of Wednesday at St
                    Paolo, and on Saturday at St Marco, under the pain aforesaid.”</p>
                <p>From this it seems manifest that the art of printing from wood-blocks was not
                    lost, but, on the contrary, had been so long practised as to become an extensive
                    and profitable business in Venice, and to spread over the Continent to such a
                    degree as in turn to destroy the trade of the Venetian artists. The
                    establishment of an important manufacture, and its decay, necessarily infer a
                    long period. From the constant conjunction of the two arts of painting and
                    printing in this document, we may infer (what the existence of prints and cards
                    of later date prove) the method in which these figures and cards were
                    manufactured, namely, that the outline was first printed, and that the colours
                    and shading were filled in by the printer and illuminator. The history of
                    playing-cards now becomes of some importance to the narrative. When cards first
                    came into use is uncertain; but mention is made of them in the year 1254, when
                    they were interdicted by St Louis on his return from the Crusade: they were also
                    forbidden by the council of Cologne in 1281. In 1299 they are expressly
                    mentioned under the name <hi rend="italic">carte</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and in “Das Gülden Spiegel,” printed by Gunther Zainer in the year 1472, it is
                    said that cards first came into Germany in 1300. An old French poet, who wrote
                    “En fan mil iij cent xxviij,” has the line, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539395"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9395-0540"/>“Jouent aux dex, aux cartes, aux tables.” There is
                    no evidence earlier than the Venetian decree to connect the art of printing from
                    wood-blocks with the art of making cards; but as it is evident from that
                    document that such connection did exist, it is a fair presumption that it
                    originated not very long after the introduction of the game; and as the sum paid
                    by Charles VI. for “trois jeux de cartes” was so small as fifty-six Parisian
                    sols, it has been conjectured that they must have been illuminated prints. 'The
                    Venetian decree against the importation of painted and printed figures from
                    abroad now brings us to the country from which the chief export was made. It
                    appears, therefore, that in the Low Countries the manufacture was carried on to
                    a great extent; and we shall also find that in Holland and Germany, and probably
                    over most of Europe, religion had called this art to her aid; that whilst the
                    noble and wealthy recreated the mind and delighted the eye with the exquisite
                    productions of the scribe and illuminator, the more humble were equally
                    gratified with rude and simple illustrations of interesting portions of
                    Scripture, or pictures of favourite saints. It is probable that the poorer
                    classes hung up these drawings in their dwellings, where they excited as true
                    and heartfelt devotion as the masterpieces of Raffaelle or Correggio in the
                    oratories of the great. It cannot be ascertained how early this practice
                    commenced, nor whether it preceded and suggested the printing of saints and
                    sacred subjects, or was itself a consequence. Certain it is, that at the end of
                    the fourteenth and the commencement of the fifteenth century the practice was
                    very common. The impressions were taken by means of a burnisher, the gloss
                    caused by the friction being distinctly visible on the backs both of cards and
                    prints preserved to this time. As facility in practice increased, a distich or
                    quotation illustrative of the print became a natural improvement; and to this
                    was frequently added <hi rend="italic">a</hi> coat of arms, the name of the
                    saint, or the title of the subject, all in the field, or over the head of the
                    figure; and, lastly, sometimes a çlate. The earliest print of which the date can
                    be accurately ascertained, is a wood-cut of St Christopher carrying the infant
                    Jesus across the sea. It is of folio size, and coloured in the manner of our
                    playing-cards. At the bottom is the inscription, f^rtetoforí facícm tie
                    quacunque tueris t⅛)tHefimo cccc°</p>

                <p>It was found in the monastery of Buxheim, near Meiningen, and is now in the
                    possession of Earl Spencer.</p>
                <p>The next advance was obvious. Instead of a single block, a series of blocks were
                    employed, with additional literary illustrations; and thus were the first
                    printed books formed. The most important of these is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Veteris et</hi><hi rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Testamenti seu</hi><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pauperum,</hi> truly the Poor Man’s Bible. It consists of forty leaves printed
                    upon one side of the paper only, by friction, from as many blocks; the colour is
                    brown; the pages are placed opposite to each other, and the blank backs being
                    pasted together, form one strong leaf. The cuts are about ten inches in height
                    and seven and a half in width. Each print contains three sacred subjects in
                    compartments, and four half-length figures of prophets in smaller divisions, two
                    above and two beneath the principal subjects. Latin inscriptions are on either
                    side of the upper figures; rhythmical verses on either side of the lower, and
                    additional inscriptions are on labels at the bottom of the whole. The central
                    subjects are from the New Testament, the others from the Old, and in some manner
                    allusive to the former. There are many copies of this work, evidently from
                    different blocks, and of different dates. Indeed it appears to have been a most
                    popular book, and was printed repeatedly long after the introduction of
                    legitimate printing; there are several editions in which the inscriptions are
                    actually printed with moveable types. The exact date of these curious works is
                    not ascertained, but Dr Horne possessed a copy contained in one volume with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ars Moriendi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Apocalypse,</hi>
                    all works of the same style, the binding of which bore the date of 142( ). The
                    original composition and design of this work is attributed, and not without some
                    show of reason, to Ans-garius, who was bishop of Hamburg and Bremen in the ninth
                    century. (See Plate CCCCXIIL)</p>
                <p>A similar book is the <hi rend="italic">Canticles,</hi> a small folio volume of
                    thirty-two subjects, two being printed on each leaf, and on only one side of the
                    paper, and the leaves also pasted back to back. It differs from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Pauperum</hi> in that the
                    inscriptions are engraven on scrolls fantastically dispersed amongst the
                    figures. This is generally allowed to be of somewhat later date than the
                    preceding, and to hold an intermediate space between it and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum Humanae</hi><hi rend="italic">Salvationis,</hi> to which
                    a larger space must be devoted, on account of its importance in the controversy
                    relative to the invention of printing.</p>
                <p>This is not, strictly speaking, a block-book; for whilst the form of the design
                    and the portion of Scripture represented are engraven on wood, the inscription
                    is in some cases engraven on wood also, but in others printed in <hi
                    rend="italic">moveable type.</hi> The Latin edition, <hi rend="italic"
                    >perliaps</hi> the first, consists of sixty-three leaves, divided into five
                    unequal gatherings. The subjects are chiefly from the Old and New Testament; but
                    sometimes such stories have been selected from ancient history as might seem in
                    some way appropriate to the events recorded in sacred writ. Each subject has a
                    short Latin inscription underneath it, and the text occupies the remainder of
                    the page. Its size is folio; the impressions are taken with a burnisher, on one
                    side of the paper; the colour of the ink is brown, and the backs are pasted
                    together, as in the books previously described. The work is certainly of nearly
                    the same date, though a little later, than the <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pauperum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it may even have been in
                    part executed by the same artist, for in the earlier portions there is so much
                    general resemblance, both in design and execution, as to make it probable that
                    the same graver was employed in both. The latter part, however/ is the work of
                    another artist; the lines are not so bold, and there is an attempt at fineness
                    of execution, of shading, and of distance, which the earlier master did not
                    attempt. The design, though in better drawing, is not so spirited; the drapery
                    is more correct, though not so graceful; and in fact the engraver was a better
                    workman, but not so great an artist. It must be understood, that there are
                    numerous editions of this work, many differing in essential particulars, but
                    some so nearly similar as to require a microscopic eye to detect the variations;
                    of four of these, two are in Latin, two in Dutch, and between these four lies
                    the contest for antiquity. Mr Ottley (whose beautiful work on Engraving contains
                    a well-drawn-up account of his inquiry, illustrated by most convincing examples)
                    has, from a minute and laborious examination, decided that the two Latin and two
                    Dutch are printed from the self-same blocks, and by comparing them, and finding
                    evidences of fractures in the one which do not exist in the other, he has very
                    satisfactorily awarded the palm of antiquity. First, although the Latin
                    inscriptions in the earlier part of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Latin
                    edition (so called by commentators) are engraven on blocks of wood, these blocks
                    are not of the same piece as the figures, the work having been divided between
                    two artists, the one more skilled in engraving figures, and the other in
                    engraving letters. Secondly, parts of the engraving broken in the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> Dutch are perfect in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    Latin; parts imperfect in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Latin are unbroken in
                    the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Dutch, whilst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> Latin is the most perfect of all; from which the conclusion is
                    drawn that the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Latin is the most ancient, then the
                    <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Dutch, next the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    Latin, and lastly the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Dutch. The printing of this
                    work is claimed for Laurence Koster.</p>
                <p>We have now come fairly to the practice of printing in the real sense of the
                    word; and we have also arrived at the long-pending, long-controverted question,
                    of who invented <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539408" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9408-0541"
                    />it, and where? The honour is disputed by as many cities as contended for the
                    birth of Homer. Only three of these can show the slightest argument for their
                    pretensions; Harlem, Strasbourg, and Mentz. Harlem claims it for her citizen
                    Laurence Koster, or Laurent Janszoon Koster (or Custos). The claim rests
                    principally upon the narrative in the <hi rend="italic">Batavia</hi> of
                    Hadrianus Junius, a native of West Friesland, who dwelt at Harlem. The work was
                    written in 1575, but not published until 1588. The following is a close
                    translation of the narrative :—</p>

                    insertion of after narrators. The word custos has been Dutchified into Coster or

                    grove (as was the fashion of citizens in easy means to do after dinner in those
                    days), began first to fashion beech-bark into letters, which being impressed
                    upon paper, reversed in the manner of a seal, produced one verse, then another,
                    as his fancy pleased, to be for copies to the children of his son-in-law; which
                    when he had happily accomplished, he began (for he was of great and acute
                    genius) to agitate higher things in his mind, and first of all devised with his
                    son-in-law, Thomas Peter, who left four children, all of whom attained the
                    consular dignity (a thing which I mention that all may understand the art arose

                    is to be observed among the first beginnings of the art (for never any is found
                    and perfected at once), that the reverse pages being smeared with glue,"were
                    stuck together, lest they, being blank, should present a deformity. Afterwards
                    he changed beech-blocks for lead; afterwards he made them of tin, because it was
                    a material more solid and less flexible, and more durable: from the relics which
                    remained of which types, very ancient wine-flasks being made, they are to this
                    day to be seen in those houses of Laurentius which I have mentioned looking upon
                    the forum, inhabited afterwards by his grandson Gerard Thomas, whom I name for
                    honour’s sake, a noble citizen, who departed this life a few years ago. The
                    studies of men favouring, as it happened, the new art, since a new merchandise,
                    never before seen, brought buyers from every side with most eager quest, at once
                    the love of the art increased, the establishment <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ministerium)</hi> increased, workmen in the art being added to the family, the
                    first touch of evil; among whom was a certain Joannes, either (as the suspicion

                    hurried from the house, went in the beginning to Amsterdam, thence to Cologne,
                    until he arrived at Mayence, as to the altar of an asylum, where he might live
                    safe beyond the reach of arrows (as the saying is), and having opened an office,
                    enjoyed the rich fruit of his robberies. Indeed, from it, in the space of the
                    (or a) turning year, in the year 1442 from the birth of Christ, with the same
                    types which Laurentius had used at Harlem, it is certain that he produced to
                    light the <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale</hi> of Alexander Gallus, which grammar
                    was then in most famous use, with the <hi rend="italic">Tractates</hi> of Peter
                    Hispanus, his first productions. Those are, for the most part, things which I
                    have formerly heard from aged men worthy of belief, who have received them as
                    things delivered from hand to hand, as a torch in a race, and have found others
                    relating and attesting the same things. I remember that Nichoíaus Galius, the
                    instructor of my youth, a man with iron memory, and venerable for his long
                    years, related to me, that when a boy he had heard, not once only, a certain
                    Cornelius, a bookbinder, and rendered serious by age, nor less than eighty years
                    old (who had lived as an under workman in that office), relating with much
                    mental anger, and with fervour, the course of the proceeding, the manner of the
                    invention (as he had received it from his master), the improvement and increase
                    of the art, and other things of the kind; and that the tears would burst from
                    him against his will at the shame of the affair, as often as he talked of the
                    robbery. Which things do not differ from the words of Quirinus Talesius Con.,
                    who confessed to me that he had formerly the same from the mouth of the same
                    bookbinder.”</p>
                <p>Beyond this narrative of Hadrian Junius there is little, or rather no, testimony
                    to the truth of Koster’s claim, all subsequent argument being either drawn from
                    or referred to this statement. Many very learned bibliographers have given full
                    credence to Hadrian, whilst others not less acute absolutely deny Koster any
                    pretence whatever, Santander calling in question his very existence; and there
                    is a third party who, being unable to decide between the opposing arguments, and
                    willing to take refuge in a middle course, allow to Koster the credit of having
                    invented printing from blocks, but assign to his rivals that of printing from
                    move - able types.</p>
                <p>The whole argument may, however, be reduced into a reasonable compass. The
                    probability of Hadrian’s narrative will naturally be the subject of inquiry. <hi
                    rend="italic">First,</hi> the roundabout way in which this hearsay evidence
                    reached Hadrian, is in itself a very suspicious circumstance. Little belief can
                    be accorded to an uncertain bookbinder, even had any circumstances been adduced
                    besides the name Cornelius, by which this bookbinder could be identified. <hi
                    rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> Ta-lesius was many years secretary to Erasmus, who,
                    although a Dutchman, and resident in Holland, repeatedly and unhesitatingly<pb

                    heard of this story, or given the slightest credence to it if he had, he would
                    have omitted some mention of a circumstance so gratifying to his national
                    vanity; or that he should have remained in ignorance of a story well known to
                    his secretary, and commonly bruited about, and therefore known to some of the
                    learned men amongst whom Erasmus lived. <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> the
                    story of the engraving on beech-bark accidentally, when it is quite certain that
                    the art of taking impressions from wood-blocks for saints and cards was at the
                    time known and extensively practised in Holland and Germany, and also in Italy,
                    is absurd. <hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> every author who has written upon
                    the matter has given up all claim on Koster’s behalf for the invention of cast
                    type, the evidence in favour of others being too strong to be got over. <hi
                    rend="italic">Fifthly,</hi> the tale of the conversion of these types into
                    drinking-cups, when Hadrian afterwards states that Fust carried them off with
                    him, is incredible; for Koster’s death is variously stated as having occurred in
                    1440 or 1442, and Hadrian says that Fust published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctrinale</hi> in 1442, within a year of his unlicensed departure; and
                    therefore Koster could not have had time to construct the types afterwards
                    converted into cups. <hi rend="italic">Sixtldy,</hi> the story of John Fust
                    having stolen all his printing materials on the eve of Christmas, and decamped,
                    first to Amsterdam, then to Cologne, and lastly to Mentz, and his publishing
                    there within the same year, is self-contradictory; for type is not a very
                    portable commodity; nor would he easily have escaped pursuit at Amsterdam, a
                    town under the same government. Again, John Fust was originally no printer, but
                    a wealthy goldsmith of Mentz, and certainly never worked as any body’s
                    journeyman. Indeed this is such a palpable misstatement, that commentators upon
                    Hadrian have boldly supposed that the thief was John Gutenberg, not he of Mentz,
                    but a brother, also named John. Unfortunately Gutenberg’s brother was not named
                    John, but Frielc, and in no future document is there any mention of him or his
                    father having practised the art even when known to John; nor is it at all likely
                    that members of a noble family, and wealthy men, should have worked in the
                    service of any man. If it should be asserted that it was <hi rend="italic"
                    >the</hi> John Gutenberg, his time is so well accounted for that it is
                    impossible, since he was then resident at Strasbourg, and never was at Amsterdam
                    or Cologne. Thus, then, the narrative of Hadrian Junius appears, upon
                    examination, to be utterly incredible, being at once at variance with itself and
                    with all probability.</p>
                <p>There are, moreover, other arguments not precisely resting upon this narrative;
                    for although these circumstances are not to be believed, the main facts <hi
                    rend="italic">may,</hi> nevertheless, be correct. Koster <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> have printed the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> and other block-books
                    attributed to him. Ottley says that they were certainly printed in Holland, for
                    that the types are not those used in Germany, but closely resembled such as were
                    afterwards cut or cast in Holland; and that they are of greater antiquity than
                    any books printed by those who afterwards used the art in the Low Countries.
                    Healso attempts to show, by the water-marks in the paper, that the works in
                    question were produced in these parts. Water-marks, however, and some bearing a
                    general resemblance to these, were common in the papers used by printers of
                    Cologne, Louvain, and elsewhere; and the argument is worth little or nothing,
                    for no evidence can be given of the positive dates of these works, and much less
                    of the printer. The <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi> was printed again and again
                    after the invention of letter-press printing; nor is there the slightest
                    evidence, supposing these asser tions to be correct, to connect them with the
                    name of Koster. It is a conclusive argument <hi rend="italic">against</hi> him,
                    that those other works ascribed to him and his descendants are executed with the
                    self-same types used at Utrecht in 1473 by Kete-laer and De Leempt. Van Mander,
                    who lived at Harlem in 1580, in his History of the Lives of Dutch Painters and
                    Engravers, treats the claim of Harlem with contempt; for, speaking of printing,
                    he describes it as an art “of which Harlem, with much presumption, arrogates to
                    herself the honour of the invention ;” nor does he make the slightest mention of
                    his famous fellow-citizen.</p>
                <p>There is not the least evidence that his <hi rend="italic">three</hi> grandsons
                    (not <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> as Hadrian says) ever carried on his business;
                    for where are their works? and in their time printers had become so proud of
                    their art, as not only to put their names to every work, but even to add a long
                    history of their undertaking and progress. Where are the books ascribed to them?
                    what mention is made of them by their contemporaries? In a subsequent part of
                    this article it will be seen that Caxton, the first English printer, is said to
                    have been sent to Harlem to learn the art, and if possible to carry off one of
                    the workmen. These things being also matter of controversy, cannot fairly be
                    used in argument; nevertheless it is of some value that Caxton, who, supposing
                    it to be true, would be an excellent witness in favour of Harlem, upon all
                    occasions refers the invention to Gutenberg, and makes .no mention whatever of
                    Harlem or Koster.</p>
                <p>Santander labours to disprove the very existence of any such person. But there is
                    no necessity to go so far as Santander; we may allow Koster’s identity; we may
                    even allow that he practised the art of taking impressions from woodblocks; but
                    this is very different from acknowledging any claim to the invention of the art
                    of printing. The most strenuous champion of Koster is Meerman, an eminent French
                    bibliographer of the last century, who, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origines</hi><hi rend="italic">Ty-pographicae,</hi> published at the Hague in
                    1765, strongly maintains this narrative of Hadrian; which is not a little
                    singular, seeing that the Newcastle Typographical Society published a letter
                    from him to Wagenaar, of eight years prior date, in which he expresses a
                    precisely contrary opinion. He calls Seitz’s (Hadrian’s) story a mere
                    supposition, and the chronology a romantic invention; gives to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculum</hi> the date of 1470 as the earliest possible;
                    attributes the honour to Gutenberg, and incidentally mentions his intention of
                    publishing a pamphlet on the subject. Notwithstanding this, in his work, without
                    any new fact whatever, he accredits Hadrian’s story, finds consistency in the
                    dates, believes the <hi rend="italic">Speculum,</hi> and denies John Gutenberg;
                    completelyreversing his previous opinion, though, by changing the predicates,
                    his narrative may still stand. The <hi rend="italic">Divudechronyk,</hi> in
                    1517, places printing amongst foreign discoveries.</p>
                <p>All evidence, and the general consent of the learned, in failure of Koster,
                    unhesitatingly ascribe this invention to <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Gutenberg,</hi> surnamed Genzfleisch, Gensfleisch, or Gensefleisch, von
                    Solgenloch, or Sorgenloch. He was a native of Mentz, and of a noble family,
                    possessed of considerable property in various places in the neighbourhood.
                    Fortunately the life of Gutenberg does not rest merely upon hearsay evidence, or
                    the doubtful guesses of bibliographers from dateless wood-cuts; legal documents
                    supply most important information. It appears that, for some reasons unknown, he
                    resided for many years at Strasbourg, and had even acquired rights of
                    citizenship. The first document presents him in no amiable light. It is a
                    lawsuit instituted to compel him to perform his marriage-contract with Anne von
                    Isernen Thür; and it would appear that he was compelled to make good his
                    promise, the name of Anne Gutenberg <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539434"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9434-0543"/>being found in the same register of the nobility
                    liable to the wine-duty in the city of Strasbourg, in which Gutenberg’s name
                    also appears. The next document is so curious that an ample abstract of it
                    cannot but be interesting.</p>
                <p>It appears that he had contracted an engagement with Andrew Dritzehen, John
                    Riffe, and Andrew Heilmann, to instruct them in the secrets of certain arts, and
                    had entered into partnership with them for their better advantage. Andrew
                    Dritzchen and Andrew Heilrnann having called upon him one day, perceived that he
                    was engaged in a wonderful and unknown art, the secret of which he was desirous
                    of keeping to himself; that, moved by their importunities, he consented to enter
                    into partnership with them for the term of five years, on two conditions, first,
                    that they should pay him the sum of 250 florins, 100 immediately, and the
                    remainder at a certain fixed period; second, that if any one of the partners
                    should die during the term of the copartnership, the survivors should pay to his
                    heirs the sum of 100 florins, in consideration of which the effects should
                    become the property of the surviving partners. Andrew Dritzchen died before the
                    expiration of the period agreed on, being still indebted to Gutenberg in the sum
                    of eighty-five florins. George and Nicholas, brothers of the deceased, demanded
                    to be admitted to the partnership, and on refusal brought an action against
                    Gutenberg as principal partner. The magistrates gave judgment on the 12th of
                    December 1439, relieving Gutenberg from the demand upon payment of the sum of
                    fifteen florins, being the difference of the sum of 100 florins stipulated to be
                    paid to the heirs of a deceasing partner, and the sum of eighty-five florins due
                    to Gutenberg by Andrew on the original contract. The following evidence was
                    produced on the trial :—</p>
                <p>“Anna, the wife of John Schultheiss, an engraver on wood, deposed, that on one
                    occasion Nicholas Beildeck came to her house to Nicholas Dreizchen, her
                    relation, and said to him, ‘ My Nicholas Dreizchen, Andrew Dreizchen, of happy
                    memory, has placed four pages <hi rend="italic">{stucke)</hi> in a press, which
                    Gutenberg has desired that you will take away and separate, that no man may know
                    what they are, for he is unwilling that any one should see them.’</p>
                <p>“Also John Sehultheiss says, that Laurence Beildeck sometime came to his house to
                    Nicholas Dreizchen, when Andrew Dreizchen his brother was dead, and that the
                    said Laurence Beildeck thus spoke to said Nicholas Dreizchen: ‘ Andrew
                    Dreizchen, of happy memory, has placed four pages on a press, which John
                    Gutenberg desires you to take therefrom, and place them on the press and break
                    them from one another, so that no man may see what they are.’</p>
                <p>“Also Conrad Sahspach deposed, that sometime Andrew Heilman came to him upon the
                    Street of Merchants and said, ‘ My Conrad, as Andrew Dreizchen is dead, and you
                    made that press, and know all about the matter, go hence and take the pieces
                    from that press and lay them separate from one another, so that no man may know
                    what it is.’</p>
                <p>“Laurence Beildeck says that he was sent by John Gutenberg to Nicholas Dreizchen,
                    after the death of Andrew his brother, to say to him that he should show to no
                    one the press that he had, and that he should see to it. He added, that
                    Gutenberg had moreover commanded him that he should go suddenly to the presses,
                    and open that press which was furnished with two <hi rend="italic">screws</hi>
                    or spindles <hi rend="italic">(cochleis),</hi> that the pages should fall into
                    pieces, and place those pieces within or upon the press, so that no one should
                    see the matter, or understand what it was.</p>
                <p>“The same witness also said that he knew well that Gutenberg, a little before the
                    feast of the Nativity, had sent his servant to both Andrews to take away all
                    forms, which were broken up in his sight, that none of them might be found
                    perfect. Moreover, after the death of Andrew, this witness was not ignorant that
                    many were desirous of seeing the presses, and that Gutenberg had commanded that
                    some one should be sent who might hinder any one from seeing the presses, and
                    that his servant was sent to break them up.</p>
                <p>“Also John Dunne, goldsmith, said, that three years or thereabouts previous he
                    had received from Gutenberg about 300 florins for materials relating to
                    printing.”</p>
                <p>From this curious document maybe learnt, that separate types were used; for if
                    they were blocks arranged so as to print four pages, how could they be so pulled
                    to pieces that no one should know what they were, or how could the abstraction
                    of two screws cause them to fall to pieces? It appears that some sort of presses
                    were used, and the transfers no longer taken by a burnisher or roller; and,
                    lastly, that the art was still a great seeret at the time when Koster was at the
                    point of death. Hence it is manifest, that the ingenuity of Gutenberg had made a
                    vast advance from the rude methods of the time, and had in fact invented a new
                    and hitherto unknown art.</p>
                <p>These documents would be decisive in favour of Strasbourg as the place in which
                    printing was invented, had it appeared that any effects were produced by this
                    establishment. This, however, does not seem to have been the case, as Gutenberg
                    and his successors make no mention of the fact, but, on the contrary, claim for
                    themselves the production of the first book at Mentz. Indeed the partnership
                    appears to have expired without any attempt at entering into fresh engagements;
                    for, about the year 1450, Gutenberg returned to his native city with all his
                    materials, without any opposition from his partner. In this place he entered
                    into partnership with John Fust, a wealthy goldsmith and citizen, who engaged,
                    upon being taught the secrets of the art, and being admitted into a
                    participation of the profits, to advance the necessary funds; and he did
                    accordingly advance the considerable sum of 2020 florins, a faet that completely
                    overthrows the fable of his having been one of Koster’s workmen, and of his
                    having stolen his types. The new partnership immediately commenced operations,
                    and hired a house called Zum Jungen, and took into their employ Peter Sehoeffer
                    and others. Their subsequent operations we again find curiously chronicled in
                    the records of another lawsuit,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wolfii <hi rend="italic">Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Typographica.</hi> Fournier, <hi rend="italic">Origine de
                    l’imprimerie.</hi></p></note> in which Gutenberg was soon engaged with his new
                    ally; for Fust, dissatisfied with their proceedings, sought to recover from
                    Gutenberg money advanced, with interest, including 800 florins of the sum
                    advanced in virtue of the deed of partnership. Gutenberg in defence alleged,
                    that the 800 florins had not been paid at once, as stipulated; and that they had
                    been expended in preparation for the work (apparently meaning thereby, that this
                    sum of money should have been paid down for his own use, in consideration of his
                    communicating the secrets of his art, and that instead of so applying it to his
                    private purposes, he had expended it for the joint benefit); whilst, as to the
                    other sums, he offered to give an account of their appropriation, but denied
                    that he was liable for the interest. The judges awarded that Gutenberg should
                    pay the interest, as well as the part which his accounts showed he had applied
                    to his individual use. This decision took place on the 6th of November 1455.
                    Upon this Fust obtained from the public notary the following document:</p>
                <p>“To the Glory of God, Amen. Be it known unto all those who shall see or hear read
                    this instrument, that in the year of Our Lord 1455, third indiction, on Thursday
                    the sixth day of November, the first year of the Pontificate of our very Holy
                    Father the Pope, Calixtus III., appeared here at Mayence, in the great parlour
                    of the Bare-footed Friars, between eleven o’clock and mid-day, before me, the
                    Notary, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539447" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9447-0544"/>and
                    the undersigned witnesses, the honourable and discrete person, James Fust,
                    citizen of Mayence, who, in the name of his brother, John Fust, also present,
                    has said and declared clearly, that on this same day, and at the present hour,
                    and in this same parlour of the Bare-footed Friars, John Gutenberg should see
                    and hear taken by John Fust an oath, conformable to the sentence pronounced
                    between them. And this sentence read in the presence of the honourable Henry
                    Gunter, Curé of St Christopher of Mayence, of Henry Keffer, and Dc Bechtoft' de
                    Hanaw, servant and valet of the said Gutenberg; John Fust, placing his hand upon
                    the Holy Evangelists, has sworn between the hands of me, the Notary Public,
                    conformable to the sentence pronounced, and to a letter ∖√hich he has sent to
                    me, and has taken the following oath, word for word: I, John Fust, have borrowed
                    1550 florins, which I have transmitted to John Gutenberg, which have been
                    employed for our common labour, and of which I have payed the rent and annual
                    interest, of which I still owe a part. Reckoning, therefore, for each hundred
                    florins borrowed, as above is recited, six florins per annum, I demand of him
                    the repayment and the interest, conformably to the sentence pronounced; which I
                    will prove in equity to be legal, in consequence of my claim upon the said John
                    Gutenberg. In presence of the honourable Henry Gunter, of Henry Keffer, and of
                    Bechtoff de Hanaw aforesaid, John Fust has demanded of me an authentic
                    instrument, to serve him as much and as often as he hath need, in the faith of
                    which I have signed this instrument, and have set thereto my seal.”</p>
                <p>From this it would appear (indeed the mortgage of his printing materials to Fust,
                    mentioned in this document, proves) that Gutenberg had expended the whole of his
                    considerable private fortune in his experiments, and had fallen into the power
                    of his more wealthy associate; for in consequence of this judgment, and owing
                    probably to his being unable to repay the sums demanded, the whole of his
                    materials, constructed with so much perseverance, fell into Fust’s.hands; for
                    the initial letters used by Gutenberg and his partners, in works known and
                    supposed to have been executed between 1450 and 1455, are likewise used by Fust
                    and Schoeffer in the Psalter of 1457 and 1459. After such a mortifying result of
                    so many years’ labour, it would have been no matter for wonder had Gutenberg
                    abandoned the unprofitable pursuit. On the contrary, he appears to have
                    immediately started anew with fresh vigour, and this time with success. Another
                    legal document gives curious information.</p>
                <p>“We, Henne (John) Genszfleisch de Sulgeloch, named Gudinburg, and Friele

                    whatever kind it may be, either wholly nor in part, and that we will never
                    demand it again, either through an ecclesiastical or civil court, or without the
                    aid of the law; and that neither we nor our heirs will ever molest the said
                    convent, either by words or deeds, either secretly or publicly, in any manner.
                    And as to the books, which I, the said Henne, have given to the library of the
                    convent, they are to remain there always and for ever; and I, the said Henne,
                    propose also to give in future, without disguise, to the library of the said
                    convent, for the use of the present and future nuns, for their religious
                    worship, either for reading or chaunting, or in whatever manner they may wish to
                    make use of them according to the rules of their order, <hi rend="italic">all
                    the books which I, the said</hi><hi rend="italic">Henne,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >have printed up to this hour, or which I shall hereafter print, in such
                    quantities as they may wish to make use of;</hi> and for this the said abbess,
                    the successors and nuns of the said eon vent of St Claire, have declared and
                    promised to acquit me and my heirs of the claim which my sister Hebele had to
                    the sixty florins, which I and my said brother Friele had promised to pay and
                    deliver to the said Hebele, as her portion and share arising from the house
                    which Henne, our father, assigned to him for his share, in virtue of the
                    writings which were drawn up thereupon, without fraud or deceit. And in order
                    that this may be observed by us and by our heirs, steadfastly and to its full
                    extent, we have given the said nuns and their convent and order these present
                    writings, sealed with our seals. Signed and delivered the year of the birth of
                    J. C. 1459, on the day of St. Margaret.”</p>
                <p>From this it will appear, that his new establishment had actually produced the
                    long wished-for effect. He appears to have carried on the business ten years;
                    for in 1465 he entered into the service of Elector Adolphus of Nassau, as one of
                    his band of gentlemen pensioners, with a handsome salary, as appears from the
                    letters patent, dated the 17th January 1465, and finally abandoned the pursuit
                    of an art which, though it caused him infinite trouble and vexation, has been
                    more effectual in preserving his name and the memory of his acts, than all the
                    warlike deeds and great achievements of his renowned master and all his house.
                    Gutenberg died on the 24th of February 1468. His printing-office and materials
                    had passed into the hands of Conrad Humery, syndic of Mentz, who had probably
                    assisted him with money, and who appears to have been in some degree his
                    partner. He afterwards sold them to Nicholas Bechtermunze of Elfield, whose
                    works are greatly sought after by the curious, as they afford much proof, by
                    collation, of the genuineness of the works attributed to his great
                    predecessor.</p>
                <p>There does not appear to be any record of the early life of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >John Fust</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter Schoeffer</hi> before their
                    partnership with Gutenberg, save that the former was a wealthy goldsmith and an
                    ingenious man, and that Schoeffer, surnamed de Gernsheim, was a scribe. It is
                    very likely that the combination of character and qualifications of these three
                    men may afford a good clue to the wonderful taste and beauty which distinguish
                    the works issued from their press, and consequently to the great general
                    improvement of the art during their life. The ingenuity of Gutenberg would
                    readily suggest a new and expeditious method of manufacturing types; the
                    practical skill of Fust as a worker in metals (and the working in gold and
                    silver had at that time attained a most extraordinary nicety and beauty), and
                    his large pecuniary resources, would readily supply the necessary appliances,
                    while the taste of Schoeffer would give all possible grace and beauty to the new
                    forms. For Schoeffer, it must be recollected, was a scribe, one of the ancient
                    and honourable craft whose occupation was destined to fall before the new art; a
                    transcriber, perhaps an illuminator, of the manuscript works in use before
                    printed books; and those who have had the happiness of viewing those exquisite
                    specimens of skill which beguiled our ancestors into study and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539460" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9460-0545"/>devotion (when will modern
                    typography produce such feasts for mind, and eye, and imagination ?) will
                    readily conceive that Schoeffer’s eye was already schooled for the conception,
                    and his hand for the execution, of all the beauty the trammels of a new art and
                    limited skill would allow. Aided by his own taste and his partners’ invention
                    and wealth, Schoeffer proceeded to a new enterprise, namely, the <hi
                    rend="italic">casting</hi> of type. The entire conception and execution of this
                    invention has been generally attributed and allowed to Schoeffer. It seems most
                    probable, however, that where three ingenious men are bound together by art and
                    interest, no one of them can lay exclusive claim to any invention or undertaking
                    executed in the workshops and for the mutual benefit of all. Allowing,
                    therefore, to Schoeffer the honour of having suggested some such plan, the other
                    two may fairly put in a claim for their portion of the credit on the score of
                    their suggestion and assistance, especially since Fust, as a worker in metals,
                    would have been the party to engage workmen to elaborate the conceptions of his
                    partners’ brain. Accordingly the only evidence upon the subject appears to show
                    that the firm had for some time practised a method of taking casts of type in
                    moulds of plaster; for it must be remembered that the types of Gutenberg’s
                    earlier efforts, both at Strasbourg and at Mentz, were cut out of single pieces
                    of wood or metal with infinite labour and imperfection. The method of casting,
                    however, although a great improvement, was at best but a slow and tedious
                    process. Every new letter required a new mould; no skill or care could enable
                    the workman to impress so small a thing as a type is at the face, yet so
                    elongated in the shank, fully, freely, and steadily, into a soft material; and
                    it would be necessary afterwards, under the most favourable circumstances, that
                    the squareness and sharpness so indispensable in type should be given by another
                    slow process, so that at best this advance was but an imperfect and tedious
                    operation. Schoeffer has therefore an undoubted claim to be considered as one of
                    the three inventors of printing; for he it was who first suggested the cutting
                    of punches, whereby not only might the most beautiful form of type the taste and
                    skill of the artist could suggest be fairly stamped upon the matrix, but a
                    degree of sharpness and finish quite unattainable in type cut in metal or wood
                    could be given to the face; whilst to the shank, by the very same process by
                    which the face was cast, the mould would give perfect sharpness and precision of
                    angle. Add to this, that the punch being once approved of, could be kept ready
                    to stamp a new matrix in precisely the same condition and form as the first,
                    should that be worn out or mislaid, or make a duplicate should the demands of
                    business require it. It is nevertheless rather singular, that the mould
                    represented on the right side of the press of Ascensius, shortly after the time
                    of Schoeffer, should be precisely the same in form and manner of use as that of
                    the present day. This was evidently an immense stride towards perfection; let
                    Schoer-der therefore take a place on the right hand of the inventor.</p>
                <p>Within eighteen months of their separation from Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer
                    produced the celebrated Psalter. This was printed with large cut type. As it was
                    impossible to prepare a new fount and print this splendid work in that short
                    space, it must be evident that the partners did great injustice to Gutenberg in
                    suppressing his name from the colophon. This book was produced in the month of
                    August 1457, and is the first book which bears the name of the place where it
                    was printed, those of its printers, and the date of the year in which it was
                    printed. The .first book, however, bearing date, was issued by Fust and
                    Schoeffer in 1455, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Titerae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Indulgentiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">Nicholai V.</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    it is on a single piece of parchment. This Psalter was reprinted in 1459, 1490,
                    and 1502, and always in the same type, which, it is remarkable, was never used
                    for any other work, probably because its great size made it unfit for any other
                    works than those not intended for popular reading, but to lay on desks like our
                    church Bibles. On the 16th of October 1459, Fust and Schoeffer published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Durandi</hi><hi rend="italic">Fationale</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Divinorum Officiorum,</hi><hi rend="italic">with</hi> an entirely new fount of
                    type; in 1460 the <hi rend="italic">Constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Clementis V.ς</hi> and in 1462 the celebrated Latin Bible. Fust enjoyed this
                    successful and glorious practice of his art but ten short years; yet in this
                    period what an immense advance from the misshapen and irregular lumps of their
                    first efforts, ugly in themselves, and more ugly in their utter want of relative
                    proportion and allignement, to the well-proportioned, evenly standing type of
                    the Bible! The plague carried him off in Paris about the year 1466, full of
                    years, and perchance full of honours. Schoeffer survived many years, and, in
                    conjunction with Conrad Henlif, produced a great number of works. His name is
                    found in the colophon of the fourth edition of the Bible of 1502, about which
                    time he is supposed to have deceased.</p>
                <p>Were we to take tradition for our guide as regards the character of Fust, we
                    should regard him as a conjurer and an adept in the black art. The popular story
                    (and many “grave and discrete old men” have given credit to the tale) runs, that
                    having kept these proceedings profoundly secret, as soon as their Bible was
                    finished, Fust transferred himself to Paris with many copies of the new work,
                    and palmed them upon the learned as manuscripts, to which, as they were printed
                    on vellum, in a type bearing much resemblance to the written books of the
                    period, and the vignettes and initial letters were splendidly illuminated, they
                    were not very dissimilar; that some eager scholar or devotee became the
                    possessor of the first copy, supposing it to be a rare chance, at the moderate
                    price of four or five hundred crowns; that as he brought the work into the
                    market, the price fell rapidly to sixty, and then to thirty crowns, by which
                    time the extraordinary glut produced suspicion, and Fust was accused of
                    multiplying Holy Writ by the aid of the devil, and was accordingly persecuted by
                    the priesthood, whilst the laity, looking to their temporal interests,
                    prosecuted him for his inroad into their pockets; and that from these things
                    Fust was obliged to quit Paris precipitately. The whole story is an impossible
                    fabrication.</p>
                <p>Having thus given a sketch of the origin and history of the art of printing, a
                    brief account of the works issued by the illustrious triumvirate will not only
                    be proper here, but will give the general reader a better idea of the
                    astonishing perfection to which the art rose under the taste and genius of its
                    inventors. There is not a single work of Gutenberg which bears his name; yet, as
                    before remarked, there are several which bear such internal evidences, that the
                    literati of all parties and opinions are unanimous in attributing them to his
                    press.</p>
                <p>Of these works, Dr Dibdin, the well-known bibliographer, gives the following
                    account:</p>
                <p>“First, as to the <hi rend="italic">character of the type</hi> used by the early
                    Mentz printers. This appears to have been uniformly what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Cothic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if we except the varieties
                    of the larger type (from three eighths to two eighths or to a quarter of an
                    inch), which appear in the Psalters of 1457, 1459, and 1490 (the type common to
                    most works executed about the same period), we shall observe three distinct sets
                    or forms of letters used in the printing-office of Faust and Schoiffher. Of
                    these three typographical characters, two only (if we except the one with which
                    the Bible of 1455 was executed) are visible in the publications which appear to
                    have been printed in the lifetime of Faust; that is to say, the larger Gothic
                    used in the Bible of 1462, and the smaller Gothic in the Offices of Cicero, of
                    the dates of 1465 and 1466. These appeared united, the former, for the first
                    time, in the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions of Pope Clement</hi> F., <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f the date of 1460. Schoiffher introduced a type of an
                    intermediate size, which may be seen, among other works, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fudι-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193539473"

                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Decretals of Pope Gregory the Ninth,</hi> of the
                    date of 1479. This intermediate type is of a narroaver form, and prints very
                    closely. Of the three types here mentioned, the largest is undoubtedly of the
                    handsomest dimensions; but they all partake of the <hi rend="italic">Secretary
                    Gothic,</hi> and may be said to be the model of that peculiar character which
                    was adopted by the early Leipsic printers, Thanner and Boëttiger, and was more
                    especially used by John Schoiffher and the other German printers for nearly the
                    whole of the sixteenth century. Shew me Lisardo, one book, nay, one leaf only,
                    printed in the <hi rend="italic">Homan type,</hi> in the colophon of which the
                    name of Faust or of Peter Schoiffher appears, and you shall immediately have the
                    amount of the balance in my favour, at my banker’s, be it great or small, be it
                    L.200 or L.20, for such a precious and unheard-of curiosity.</p>
                <p>“W e shall now, in the second place, say a few words as to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >character of the printing,</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic">mechanical
                    skill,</hi> of the early Mentz press. There can be but one opinion upon this
                    point. Everything is perfect of the kind, the paper, the ink, and the register,
                    or regularity of setting up the page. The Bible of the supposed date of 1455 is
                    quite a miracle in this way;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is even sober praise, The mechanism of the press-work,
                    and appearance of the ink, beautiful, regular, and glossy as the whole appears,

                    “Charta,” says Tungendres, “ejusdem est crassitudinis, qualem illo tempore
                    libris imprimendis consumere mos fuit.” And again, “Charta ob ejus densitatem
                    atque spissitudinem haud ingratam ubique se maxime commendat.” <hi rend="italic"

                    due to the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions of Pope Clement V.,</hi> of the date
                    of 1460, and the <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> of 1462; while the <hi
                    rend="italic">Durandus,</hi> of the earlier date of 1459, exhibiting the first
                    specimen of the smallest letter, strikes one as among the most marvellous
                    monuments extant of the perfection of early typography. Almost all the known
                    works before the year 1462 are printed <hi rend="italic">upon vellum,</hi>
                    doubtless because they ventured upon limited impressions; and even of the Bible
                    of 1462 more copies have been described upon vellum than upon paper. Upon the
                    whole, the vellum used by Faust and Schoiffher, although inferior to the
                    Venetian, is exceedingly good, being generally both white and substantial.</p>
                <p>“In the third place, let us notice the nature or character of the works which
                    have issued from the press of Faust and Schoiffher. Whatever may be our
                    partiality towards that establishment from which the public were first gratified
                    with the sight of a printed book, candour obliges us to confess that the fathers
                    of printing were not fortunate, upon the whole, in the choice of books which
                    issued from their press.</p>
                <p>“In the fourth place (for I told you I should be somewhat tautologous), consider
                    what is the typographical appearance of those books which Gutenberg is really
                    supposed to have executed. It is quite unique. A little barbarous, and certainly
                    wholly dissimilar from any thing we observe in other contemporaneous productions
                    of the Mentz press. You will please to understand that I think very doubtfully
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Do-ηαtuses,</hi> which are considered to have been
                    printed by him; as well as of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sacerdotum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Celebratio Missarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> concluding the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon</hi> of 1460,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Vocabularies</hi> of 1467 and 1469, to be the more
                    genuine productions of his press, or of the types used by him. Is it not
                    surprising, I ask, that these works are executed in types quite different from
                    anything we observe in the Mentz productions? and this from a man who is
                    considered as the parent of printing in that city. No wonder, if they <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> the actual productions of Gutenberg, that Faust and
                    Schoiffher thought so meanly of his talents, and that on a dissolution of
                    partnership they adopted a different and a very superior character.”</p>
                <p>In confirmation of these remarks of the learned bibliographer, we shall here
                    insert a specimen of Gutenberg’s <hi rend="italic">Balbus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Janua,</hi> which will also be a curious illustration of an cient art.
                    Notwithstanding the appearance of these types, the reader is assured that the
                    original is really printed from separate pieces of metal.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The initial A is illuminated in a very

                <p>Dr Horne, in the appendix to his Introduction to Bibliography, says of the
                    Psalter, “This precious work, as Santander justly calls it, is one of the most
                    known among early printed books, from the various and correct descriptions of it
                    which have been given by different bibliographers. Until the discovery of Pope
                    Nicholas’ <hi rend="italic">Literae</hi><hi rend="italic">Indulgentiarum,</hi>
                    this was supposed to be the very first article ever printed with a date affixed;
                    the book is executed on vellum, and of such extreme rarity that not more than
                    six or seven copies are known to be in existence; all of which, however, differ
                    from each other in some respect or other. The most perfect copy known is that in
                    the imperial library at Vienna; it comprises 175 leaves, of which the Psalter
                    occupies the 135 first and the recto of the 136th. The remainder is appropriated
                    to the litany, prayers, responses, vigils, &amp;c. The psalms are executed in
                    larger characters than the hymns, similar to those used for missals prior to the
                    invention of printing; but all are distinguished for their uncommon blackness.
                    The capital letters, 288 in number, are cut on wood with a degree of delicacy
                    and boldness which are truly surprising; the largest of these, the initial
                    letters of the psalms, which are black, red, and blue, must (as Lichtenberger
                    has remarked) have passed <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> through the press.
                    Copies are now in the Queen’s library at Windsor, and in that of Earl Spencer at
                    Spencer House.” A facsimile of the initial B, and a portion of the first verse
                    of this beautiful book, and of the colophon at the end, will be found in Plate
                    CCCCXIV.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary praise awarded by these eminent bibliomaniacs to the first
                    productions of the Mentz press may perchance excite in the minds of the more
                    sober public a suspicion that these writers have been led away by their
                    enthusiasm beyond the limits of matter-of-fact truth, and have seen merit in
                    defects, beaùty in deformity, and lustre in antiquity. Assuredly, nevertheless,
                    such is by no means the case; and the happy individual who gains access to the
                    <hi rend="italic">chef-d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">mwres</hi> of Fust and
                    Schoeffer will return from the inspection a wiser man; for the beauty of these
                    works is inconceivable. England fortunately possesses several of these treasures
                    of art, there being copies of the Bible of the supposed date of 1450-55 in the
                    Royal Library, in the Bodleian, and in those of Earl Spencer and Sir Μ. Sykes;
                    whilst of the six known copies of the Psalter of 1457, two are in England,
                    namely, one at Windsor, and one in the possession of Lord Spencer. Of the Latin
                    Bible of Fust and Schoeffer, 1462 (the first bearing date), there are copies <hi
                    rend="italic">on vellum</hi> at Blenheim, in the libraries of Lord Spencer, the
                    Earl of Jersey, and Sir Μ. Sykes, in the British Museum, and imperfect in the
                    Bodleian. Copies <hi rend="italic">on paper</hi> are rarer still, there being
                    but three in this country, viz. those in the Royal Library and the British
                    Museum, and one lately in the possession of Mr Willett.</p>
                <p>Apparently, in retaliation of the injustice done to Gutenberg by his partners in
                    depriving him of any share of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539486"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9486-0547"/>the honour of producing the Psalter of 1457,
                    which, as before stated, must be the joint production of all three, although .
                    it was not finished until after the secession of Gutenberg, bibliographers have
                    generally agreed in attributing the printing of the Bible of 1450-55 to
                    Gutenberg alone, when it is equally manifest that Fust and Schoeffer had as much
                    claim to the honour as their coadjutor. It is an exceedingly beautiful book, in
                    two very large folio volumes, in two columns, containing from forty-one to
                    forty-three lines each, in very large well-cut types. It consists of six hundred
                    and forty-one leaves; it has no title, paging, signatures, or catch-words; the
                    initial letters are not printed, but painted in by illuminators, and the initial
                    letters of each verse of the psalms are painted alternately red and black, by
                    way of guide to the priests in their alternate reading. From the lustre and
                    blackness of the ink, its evenness of colour, and beautiful execution, it is a
                    very superb book; but it is nevertheless surpassed by the Fust and Schoeffcr
                    edition of 1462, when they had attained greater experience in the practice of
                    the art. By far the choicest, however, of these <hi rend="italic">editiones
                    principes</hi> is the Montz Psalter or <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Psalmorum</hi> before mentioned, the initial B and first few lines
                    of which form part of Plate CCCCXIV. Dr Horne says that the six known copies of
                    this edition differ from each other in some respects, and proceeds to give some
                    particulars in which variations are found; but, upon a comparison of the royal
                    copy with Earl Spencer’s, it will be found, that although they bear the same
                    date, they are in fact two distinct editions. It would have excited no great
                    surprise had it been found that the printed ornaments differed, as nothing would
                    be more easy than to change the colours with which the different blocks were
                    worked; but the text varies in such a manner that there can be no doubt of their
                    perfect distinctness. By comparing the following terminations of the lines of
                    the Windsor copy with the specimen, this will be clear. The first line of the
                    Windsor copy ends with abtit; the second with the contracted et; the third with
                    £tetít; the fourth with non; the fifth with ¢ní; the sixth with Icgε. This will
                    be found to arise from a difference in the contractions of the following
                    words:</p>

                <p>These differences arise apparently from the desire of so apportioning the words
                    that each line shall be completely justified out in the Windsor copy, which (as
                    may be seen in the plate) is not the case in Lord Spencer’s copy; from which
                    circumstance it is probable that the latter is the earliest. The book<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The copy described is that at
                    Windsor: the illuminations, no doubt, vary in every copy.</p></note> is a very
                    large folio, on vellum, consisting of about a hundred and thirty leaves, printed
                    on both sides. There are generally twenty-three lines in a page, in Gothic type.
                    Every psalm begins with a splendid initial letter, about two thirds of the size
                    of the B, <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> in two colours in almost every case.
                    Occasionally, however, this appears to have been neglected, and then the letter
                    is painted in by the illuminator, but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in imitation of
                    the printed letters. The initials consist (like the B) of a bold character, of
                    Gothic cut, surrounded by a scroll, which is sometimes of great length, that of
                    the B extending from the top to the bottom of the page. The same wooden block is
                    used as often as the letter occurs, but it is not always of the same colour;
                    moreover, every <hi rend="italic">verse</hi> commences with a smaller initial
                    printed in a red colour, in the same manner as the <hi rend="italic">S</hi> in
                    the specimen. Nor is this work destitute of the embellishments of the
                    illuminator; for at the commencement of every psalm is a rubric, painted in a
                    most brilliant red, in a smaller letter, of precisely the same character as the
                    text, and also the music of the chant, with the words underneath it painted in
                    black. The initial letters of both are splendidly illuminated in various
                    colours. The paint is used in such profusion that the letters are absolutely in
                    relief, often to the extent of one sixteenth of an inch; and besides these, the
                    letter following the grand initial has a broad bar painted down it, and very
                    frequently the first letter after the pauses indicated in our authorized version
                    by a colon is illuminated in a similar manner. One page is particularly
                    splendid; it consists of short verses, in which the first words are constantly
                    repeated. It commences with a grand initial, and there are twenty-two smaller
                    initials to the verses; the second letter of the first verse, and the first
                    letter after every pause (twenty-three in number), having the broad illuminated
                    bar. Wherever the psalm commences too near the bottom to allow of the full
                    exuberance of the scroll, a piece of paper appears to have been laid over a
                    portion of the cut, to prevent the impression from appearing; and in one psalm
                    where the chant is of unusual length, the lower part of the initial 0, and a
                    corresponding portion of the scroll, are thus suppressed; the music being
                    illuminated in its place, and the scroll continued bclow it. Sometimes the
                    illuminator has omitted to add his initial letter; and in this copy the double
                    device is omitted. The accuracy with which the coloured blocks arc printed
                    within the text and within each other is perfectly astonishing. From this
                    description it may be conceived how very superb is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> book ever printed, the date, and place, and artist, of which can be
                    accurately ascertained. Dr Dibdin in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Spenceria7ια,</hi> Mr Savage in his work on <hi rend="italic">Decorative
                    Printing,</hi> Dr Horne, whose wood-block is not coloured, and several other
                    writers, have given fac-similés of the same copy (Lord Spencer’s), which,
                    however, all differ from one another. The lines given in the specimen in Plate
                    CCCCXIV. are copied from Dibdin, whose initial B does not accord with that of
                    the Windsor copy; the B here given is very accurate, and the colours are as
                    similar as possible to the latter copy, but the colour of the scroll in the
                    original seems somewhat faded.</p>
                <p>The capture of the city of Mentz by Count Adolphus of Nassau in the year 1462 had
                    the effect of interrupting the la-boursofFust and Schoeffer; and moreover the
                    distracted state of the city enabled, perhaps compelled, the workmen initiated
                    in the mysteries of the art to flee into the neighbouring states, and thus
                    spread its practice over the whole civilized globe. Such, indeed, was the fame
                    it had already acquired, and such the idea entertained of its importance, that
                    every community with the slightest pretensions to literature appears to have
                    sought a knowledge of it with the greatest avidity. Thus, within six years of
                    the publication of the Psalter, it had spread to several cities having some
                    connection with Mcntz, and within fifteen years to almost every town of
                    consideration in Christian Europe. A chronological list of the cities which
                    first seized upon the invention would be greatly too long for this article; it
                    may be interesting, however, to extract a few of the principal, with a notice of
                    such printers as are remarkable either for the beauty or the scarcity of their
                    works. The reader is not to suppose that all, or indeed any great number of
                    these, learned the practice of the art under the tuition of the first masters. A
                    few are known to have been pupils of the inventors, and it is probable that many
                    others of them were so; but the majority, in all likelihood, were men of
                    learning, enterprise, or capital, who derived their typographical knowledge from
                    such facts as had transpired, or from inferior <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Strasbourg.</hi> Mentelin. Some writers have claimed for
                    Mentelin the invention of printing, representing that Gutenberg was his servant,
                    without, however, showing the slightest ground for their assertions; but others,
                    more reasonable, say that he was acquainted with Gutenberg, and instructed by
                    him, and that on the latter’s quitting Strasbourg he established a
                    printing-office, and carried on the business successfully. Mentelin most
                    probably printed about the year 1458. His type is rude and inelegant. The only
                    book bearing his name is Beauvais’ <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Historiale,</hi> of date 1473. Sehaepflin says, that he, as well
                    as Fust and Schoeffer at Mentz, printed 300 sheets per day.</p>
                <p>In 1461. <hi rend="italic">Bamberg.</hi> Albert Pfister. He printed a collection
                    of <hi rend="italic">Fables,</hi> of date 1461. This book is excessively rare;
                    it is printed with cast metal type, and is illustrated with 101 wood-cuts, in
                    much the same style as the old <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pauperum.</hi> All his other works are printed in the same type.</p>
                <p>1465. <hi rend="italic">Subiaco</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rome.</hi> Schweynheym
                    and Pannartz. Their known works are, a <hi rend="italic">Donatus,</hi> without
                    date; Lactantius, 1465; St Augustin on <hi rend="italic">the City of God,</hi>
                    1467; Cicero <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Oratore,</hi> without
                    date; and the <hi rend="italic">Commentary of De Lyra on the Bible,</hi> 1471,
                    all in folio. These works were printed in a new letter, very closely resembling
                    the type now in use called <hi rend="italic">Roman,</hi> and of which they were
                    the introducers. In <hi rend="italic">De Lyra</hi> are the earliest specimens of
                    Greek types worthy of the name; some few letters appear in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicero de</hi><hi rend="italic">Officiis</hi> printed at Mentz, but so
                    wretchedly imperfect that they are unworthy of mention. It is curious that the
                    Greek fount of Schweynheym and Pannartz at Subiaco was evidently very small; but
                    upon their removal to Rome they cast a much larger fount. The cut and appearance
                    of this Greek is more than respectable. There is a very curious petition from
                    them to the pope, praying for assistance on the ground that they had entirely
                    ruined themselves by printing <hi rend="italic">De Lyra,</hi> for which there
                    was no sale, and representing that they had on their hands no less than eleven
                    hundred folio volumes of that work. Subiaco is the first place in Italy in which
                    printing was practised. At Rome Ulric Han and Lignamine were contemporaries.
                    Their works, particularly those of Han, are excessively rare.</p>

                    purchased from Conrad Humery the types and materials of Gutenberg. Their works
                    are not at all remarkable for beauty, but are very rare, and much sought for as
                    affording evidence of Gutenberg’s works.</p>
                <p>1467. <hi rend="italic">Cologne.</hi> Ulric Zell. His type is Gothic, and of no
                    beauty; but his works are rare.</p>

                    Germany with Roman type.</p>
                <p>1469. <hi rend="italic">Venice.</hi> John de Spira, whose works are of the utmost
                    beauty. His edition of Pliny is splendid, and enormous sums have been given for
                    those printed in vellum. He did not use Greek characters; but Greek passages are
                    composed in Roman types. In the Same city, at the same time, printed Nicholas
                    Jenson, whose works are equal, if not superior, to those of Spira; they are not
                    so rare, but are almost equally sought after. A copy of his folio Latin Bible of
                    1479, printed in Gothic type, was sold at Mr Edwards’ sale for L.115. 10s.
                    Venice was also the residence of Christopher Valdarfar, whose works gave rise to
                    a most extraordinary event connected with bibliography, viz. the sale of the
                    first edition of <hi rend="italic">ll Decamerone di Boccaccio,</hi> printed by
                    him in 1471. For many years it had been known that a single copy of this work
                    was in existence, and the most devoted bibliomaniacs had used their utmost
                    endeavours to discover it, but in vain. At length, about 1740, an ancestor of
                    the Duke of Roxburghe obtained possession of it for the sum of one hundred
                    guineas. In lapse of time it be came the property of John duke of Roxburghe, the
                    accomplished, indefatigable, and undaunted bibliomaniac, after whose death the
                    gorgeous library was dispersed by the auctioneer in the year 1811. The interest
                    excited amongst the learned by this sale was intense. It was known that the
                    collection contained the most superb specimens of every kind of ancient lore;
                    that the illuminated manuscripts were the most brilliant, the ballads the most
                    obscure, the <hi rend="italic">editiones principes</hi> the most complete that
                    the world could produce; that the rarest Caxtons, the finest Pynsons, and
                    grandest specimens of the foreign printers, were here to be found; above all, it
                    was rumoured that a mysterious edition of Boccaccio’s Decameron would become a
                    bone of contention amongst the noblest of the literati. The public, learned and
                    unlearned, were infected with the mania, and the daily papers teemed with
                    notices of the sale. At length the important day arrived, the !7thof June 1811.
                    St James’ Square was the place. Air Evans presided. The room was crowded; Earl
                    Spencer, the Marquis of Blandford, the Duke of Devonshire, and an agent of
                    Napoleon, were amongst the most prominent. The book was a small folio, in faded
                    yellow morocco binding, hlack-letter. “Silence followed his (Mr Evans’)
                    address,” says Dibdin. “On his right hand, standing against the wall, stood Earl
                    Spencer: a little lower down, and standing at right angles with his lordship,
                    appeared the Marquis of Blandford. The duke, 1 believe, was not then present;
                    but my Lord Althorpe stood a little backward, to the right of his father Earl
                    Spencer. Such was ‘ the ground taken up’ by the adverse hosts. The honour of
                    firing the first shot was due to a gentleman of Shropshire, unused to this
                    species of warfare, and who seemed to recoil from the reverberation of the
                    report himself had made. ‘ One hundred guineas,’ he exclaimed. Again a pause
                    ensued; but anon the biddings rose rapidly to five hundred guineas. Hitherto,
                    however, it was manifest that the firing was but masked and desultory. At length
                    all random shots ceased, and the champions before named stood gallantly up to
                    each other, resolving not to flinch from a trial of their respective strengths.
                    ‘ A thousand guineas’ were bid by Earl Spencer; to which the marquis added ‘
                    ten.’ You might have heard a pin drop. All eyes were turned; all breathing well
                    nigh stopped. Every sword was put home within its scabbard, and not a piece of
                    steel was seen to move or to glitter save that which each of these champions
                    brandished in his valorous hand. See, see; they parry, they lunge, they hit; yet
                    their strength is undiminished, and no thought of yielding is entertained by
                    either. ‘ Two thousand pounds’ are offered by the marquis. Then it was that Earl
                    Spencer, as a prudent general, began to think of an useless effusion of blood
                    and expenditure of ammunition, seeing that his adversary was as resolute and
                    fresh as at the onset. For a quarter of a minute he paused, when my Lord
                    Althorpe advanced one step forward, as if to supply his father with an· other
                    spear for the purpose of renewing the contest. His countenance was marked with a
                    fixed determination to gain the prize, if prudence in its most commanding form,
                    and with a frown of unusual intensity of expression, had not bade him desist.
                    The father and son for a few seconds converse apart; and the biddings arc
                    resumed. ‘ Two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds,’ said Lord Spencer. The
                    spectators are now absolutely electrified. The mar-αuis quietly adds his usual ‘
                    ten,’ and there is an end of the contest. Mr Evans, ere his hammer fell, made a
                    due pause, and, indeed, as if by something preternatural, the ebony instrument
                    seemed itself to be charmed or suspended ‘ in mid air.’ However, at length down
                    dropped the hammer, and, as Lisardo has not merely poetically expressed himself,
                    ‘ the echo’ of the sound of that fallen hammer ‘ was heard in the libraries of
                    Rome, of Milan, and Saint Mark.’ Not the least surprising incident of this
                    extraordinary sale is, that the marquis already possessed a copy of the work,
                    which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539512" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9512-0549"/>wanted a
                    few leaves at the end; he therefore paid this enormous sum for the honour of
                    possessing a few pages. The prize of this contest is now in the possession of
                    Earl Spencer.”</p>

                <p>It was the custom of the early printers to distinguish their books by the most
                    fantastic devices; and by these their works may be readily recognised. Many of
                    them were of excccding beauty, and all the skill and appliances of their art
                    were employed to render them striking; they are really an ornament to their
                    works. The invention of these has been ascribed to Aldus; but the very first
                    printers, Fust and Schoeffer, used each for himself, yet conjoined, devices of
                    rare excellence. Their celebrated Bible is adorned with one which is well worthy
                    of being adopted as the arms of the art and mystery of printing. This is given
                    in the plate of illustrations with those of Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Pierre
                    Rcgnault, who, with his brother, printed the first English Testament at
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>Our chronological arrangement has precluded us from mentioning some of the most
                    skilful typographers. Their works, however, are so numerous, and their efforts
                    so well known, as to render it unnecessary to do more than mention their names.
                    Such men as the Aldi, Frobenius, Plantinus, Operinus, the Stephani, the
                    Elzeviri, the Gryphii, the Giunti, the Moreti, and hosts of peers, have
                    universal fame. The printing-office of Plantinus, in the Place Vendredi, at
                    Antwerp, exists in its full integrity, and in the possession and use of his
                    descendants the Morcti; the same presses, the same types, with the addition of
                    every improvement modern skill has effected, are still in use, and an inspection
                    of these singular relics of olden art will well repay the investigation of the
                    curious.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The First Presses,</hi></p>
                <p>Of the mechanical means by which these beautiful impressions of the old printers
                    were produced there is little or no record; but it is quite evident that they
                    must have been effected by some more skilful process than mere manipulation,
                    that is, than the appliance of a burnisher, as is evident in the first
                    wood-cuts, or of a roller, or superficial pressure applied immediately by hand.
                    It is very probable that one of the difficulties which Gutenberg found
                    insuperable at Strasbourg, was the construction of a machine of sufficient power
                    to take impressions of the types or blocks then employed; nor is it at all
                    wonderful that the many years he resided at that city were insufficient to
                    produce the requisite means; for, with cutting type, forming his screws,
                    inventing and making ink, and the means of applying lus ink when made, his time
                    must have been amply occupied. Moreover, the construction of a press would
                    require a versatile genius, and excellent mechanical skill, not to be looked for
                    in one man. But upon his junction with Fust and Schoeffer, the gold of the
                    former, and the invention of all the three, would soon supply the defect; and,
                    for aught that appears to the contrary, the press used in their office differed
                    in no essential point from those in use until the improvements of Blaew in
                    1600-20. Fortunately, amongst the queer devices with which it pleased the
                    earlier printers to distinguish their works, Badius Ascensius of Lyons
                    (1495-1535) chose the press; and there are cuts of various sizes on the
                    title-pages of his works. It appears from these, that, like that of Gutenberg,
                    they could print only four pages at a time, and that at two pulls; and when it
                    is stated that the table and tympan ran in, and that the platten was brought
                    down by a powerful screw, by means of a lever inserted into the spindle, the
                    professional reader will easily recognise the wooden presses laid up in ordinary
                    in many old London houses.</p>
                <p>The colour which the earliest typographers used was probably made according to
                    the style of work in hand. The earliest copies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Pauperum</hi>
                    were printed in a brown colour, of which raw umber is the principal ingredient.
                    It appears to have been well ground and thin. It was, most likely, of the same
                    tint as the old drawings of the same subjects, and would be better adapted for
                    the filling up in various colours, as appears to have been the practice, than a
                    black and harsh outline of ink. Fust and Schoeffer, however, introduced, and
                    their followers adopted, black ink, and were so skilful in compounding it that
                    their works present a depth and richness of colour which excites the envy of the
                    moderns; nor has it turned brown, or rendered the surrounding paper in the
                    slightest degree dingy. From the above-mentioned colophons we have also the
                    method of applying it to the types. This was by means of balls of skin stuffed
                    with wool, in every respect the same as those used thirty years ago. The ink was
                    laid in some thickness on a corner of a stone slab, and taken thence in small
                    quantities and ground by a muller, and thence again taken by the balls and
                    app!ied to the types. The types appear to have been disposed in cases very much
                    the same as ours. The composing-stick differs somewhat, but cannot now be very
                    clearly made out. The different operations of casting the type, composing,
                    reading, and working, are mostly represented in the same apartment; but, it is
                    probable, more for the sake of pictorial unity, than because such <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539525" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9525-0550"/>was really the custom. There
                    must have been many workmen engaged in most of the old establishments; and they
                    well knew the value of cleanliness, which is unattainable where all the
                    operations are carried on together.</p>
                <p>As the invention of printing has itself become matter of serious controversy
                    amongst the learned of all countries, its introduction into England has not been
                    suffered to pass without an attempt of the novelty-seekers to overturn the
                    received opinion on the subject, and to give to another the laurel of a public
                    benefactor, torn from him to whom the general voice had for two centuries
                    allotted it. Fortunately, the quarrel is divested of one of the great
                    difficulties of the continental, inasmuch as there does not appear to be any
                    vestige of an art in any degree similar (such as blockprinting) having been
                    practised prior to the introduction of type-printing; the art, when it was
                    brought over, being in a state somewhat approaching maturity. This controversy
                    concerns the claims of William Caxton and Frederic Corsellis to the introduction
                    of the knowledge of the art, and the printing of the first book, in this
                    country.</p>
                <p>The general and original belief is that Caxton, who for thirty years resided in
                    the Low Countries, under the reign of Charles the Bold, and who had taken every
                    opportunity of learning the new art, and had availed himself of the capture of
                    Mentz to secure one of the fugitive workmen of Fust and Schoeffer, established a
                    printing-office at Cologne, where he printed the French original and his own
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that whilst at Cologne he became acquainted with Wynkyn de
                    Worde, Theoderick Rood, both foreigners, and Thomas Hunte his countryman, who
                    all subsequently became printers in England; that he afterwards transferred his
                    materials to England; that Wynkyn de Worde came over with him, and probably was
                    the superintendent of his printing establishment; that his first press was
                    established at Westminster, perhaps in one of the chapels attached to the abbey,
                    and certainly under the protection of the abbot; and that he there produced the
                    first book printed in England, the <hi rend="italic">Game of Chess,</hi> which
                    was completed on the last day of March 1474.</p>
                <p>The correctness of these facts is not matter of dispute, all writers agreeing
                    that Caxton did so set up his press at Westminster, and print his <hi
                    rend="italic">Game of Chess</hi> in 1474; but it has been asserted that Caxton
                    was not the first printer, nor his book the first book printed, in this country.
                    Neither does the controversy rest upon the contradictory statements of many
                    writers, for all authors of the same and succeeding period agree in ascribing
                    the honour to Caxton; and when, in 1642, a dispute arose between the Stationers’
                    Company and certain persons who printed by virtue of a patent from the crown,
                    concerning the validity of this patent, a committee was appointed, who heard
                    evidence for and against the petitioners, and throughout the proceedings Caxton
                    was acknowledged as incontestibly the first printer in England. Thus Caxton
                    seemed to be established as the first English typographer, when, soon after the
                    Restoration, a quarto volume of forty-one leaves was discovered in the library
                    at Cambridge, bearing the title of <hi rend="italic">Exposicio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sancti</hi><hi rend="italic">Jeronymi in Simbolum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Papam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Laurentium,</hi> and at the end, “Explicit Exposicio Sancti Jeronymi in Simbolo
                    Apostolorum ad papam Laurentium, Oxonie Et finita, Anno Domini <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">m cccc.lxviii.</hi><hi rend="italic">xvii.</hi> die decembris.”
                    Upon the production of this book the claim for priority of printing was set up
                    for Oxford. In the year 1644 Richard Atkyns, who then enjoyed a patent from the
                    crown, and whose claims consequently brought him into collision with the
                    Stationers’ Company, and who was desirous of establishing the prerogative of the
                    sovereign, published a thin quarto work, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Original
                    and Growth of Printing, collected out of the History and the Records of the.
                    Kingdome</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">wherein is also
                    demonstrated that Printing</hi><hi rend="italic">appertaineth to the Prerogative

                    of the Crown of England.</hi> The book was published <hi rend="italic">“by order
                    and appointment of the Right Hon. Mr Secretary Morrice''</hi> In support of this
                    proposition Atkyns asserted that he had received from an anonymous friend a copy
                    of a manuscript discovered at Lambeth Palace, amongst the archiepiscopal
                    archives. The following is an abstract of this document. “Thomas Bouchier,
                    archbishop of Canterbury, earnestly moved the king, Henry VI. to use all
                    possible means to procure a <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> mold, to which the
                    king willingly assented, and appropriated to the undertaking the sum of 1500
                    merks, of which sum Bouchier contributed 300. Mr Tumour, the king’s master of
                    the robes, was the person selected to manage the business; and he, taking with
                    him Mr William Caxton, proceeded to Harlem in Holland, where John Guthenberg had
                    recently invented the art, and was himself personally at work; their design
                    being to give a considerable sum to any person who should draw away one of
                    Guthenberg’s workmen. With some difficulty they succeeded in purloining one of
                    the under workmen, Frederic Corsellis; and it not being prudent to set him to
                    work in London, he was sent under a guard to Oxford, and there closely watched
                    until he had made good his promise of teaching the secrets of the art. Printing
                    was therefore practised in England before France, Italy, or Germany, which
                    claims priority of Harlem itself, though it is known to be otherwise, that city
                    gaining the art from the brother of one of the workmen, W'ho had learned it at
                    home of his brother, and afterwards set up for himself at Mentz.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">Exposicio</hi> is asserted by inference to be the work of
                    Corsellis. That this document is a forgery may be safely assumed; because of the
                    more than unsatisfactory manner in which it is said to have been obtained;
                    because no one ever saw this copy; because no one, except the unknown, ever saw
                    the original, for it is not amongst the archives nor in the library of Lambeth
                    Palace, nor was it when the Earl of Pembroke made diligent search for it in 17(
                    ), nor was it found when the manuscripts, books, and muniments were moved into a
                    new building; because Caxton himself, who took so important a share in the
                    alleged abduction of the workman, states that twelve years afterwards he was
                    diligently engaged in learning the art at Strasbourg, and repeatedly ascribes
                    the invention to Gutenberg, “at Mogunce in Almayne ;” because, when three years
                    afterwards the Stationers’ Company instituted legal proceedings against the
                    University of Cambridge, to restrain them from printing, this document was
                    rejected, as resting only on Atkyns’ authority; because Archbishop Parker, in
                    his account of Bourchicr, mentions the invention of printing at Mentz, but makes
                    no claim for his having introduced it into England, and Godwin, <hi
                    rend="italic">de Praesulibus Angliae,</hi> says that Bourchier, during his
                    primacy of thirty-two years, did nothing remarkable, save giving L.Ĭ20 for poor
                    scholars, and some books to the university, and that he minutely examined two
                    registers of his proceedings during this term, without making any mention of his
                    having found therein any record of so remarkable a transaction; because, since
                    these transactions must have taken place before 1459, Henry VI. was at that time
                    struggling fearfully for his throne and life, Edward IV. being crowned in that
                    year; from internal evidence of the document itself, for, not to mention the
                    weak evidence for the city of Harlem, it is quite certain that Gutenberg never
                    printed there, and by Junius the theft is ascribed to John Fust, who certainly
                    was a rich goldsmith of Mentz; whereupon Meerman, finding these statements at
                    variance with possibility, boldly invents another theory, making the sufferers
                    Koster’s grandsons, who never printed, as far as is known, and the robber
                    Corsellis himself; and, lastly, because six years elapsed between this asserted
                    introduction and the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Exposicio,</hi> and
                    eleven years between this and any other publication from any Oxford press <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193539538" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9538-0551"/> Although these
                    facts entirely confute the pretensions of Corsellis, there nevertheless remains
                    the book itself, and unless some evidence can be produced, Oxford will still
                    maintain the proud pre-eminence. Some of the most learned bibliographers
                    entirely refuse their assent to the genuineness of the book. Middleton asserts
                    that there must be an error of an x in the imprint, and produces many remarkable
                    instances of similar typographical errors. This, however, is mere assertion; and
                    as, in the Lambeth record, the best evidence is to be sought in the production
                    itself, accordingly the work is printed with <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> metal
                    types, which are not proved to have been used by Koster at all, that art being
                    invented by Gutenberg, Fust, and Schoeffer at Mayence. The letter is of very
                    elegant cut, the pages regular, and the whole work has the appearance of having
                    been executed at a considerably advanced era of the art. Another and a good
                    argument is, that the work has signatures, or marks for the binder at the foot
                    of the page, such not having been used on the continent before 1472, by John
                    Koethof at Cologne; and it is no refutation of this argument to say, as has been
                    attempted by some, that many works executed by printers who did use signatures
                    are without signatures; for the proof of a negative in one case is the poorest
                    of all possible arguments of a positive in another. Let Caxton, therefore, be
                    replaced in his old niche, the introducer of the art of printing into
                    England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">William Caxton</hi> was born about the year 1412, in the
                    Weald of Kent. His father was a wealthy merchant, trading in wool. He was
                    brought up to the business of a mercer, and conducted himself so much to his
                    master’s satisfaction, that on his death he bequeathed him the then considerable
                    sum of twenty marks. Caxton then proceeded, probably as the agent of the
                    Mercers’ Company, into the Low Countries. He must have been a man of some wealth
                    and consideration, for in 1664 he and Richard Wethenhall were appointed by
                    Edward IV. “ambassadors and special deputies” to continue and confirm a treaty
                    of commerce between him and Philip duke of Burgundy; and, upon the marriage of
                    Edward’s sister Margaret with Charles duke of Burgundy, he was appointed to the
                    household retinue of the princess, by whom he appears to have been treated with
                    much familiarity and confidence; for at her instigation he first commenced his
                    literary labours, and he mentions her as repeatedly commanding him to amend his
                    English. His first work was a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Recuyell of
                    the Histories of Troye,</hi> which he afterwards printed at Strasbourg, when his
                    leisure had allowed him to turn his attention to the study of printing. The
                    first production of his press is allowed to be the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recuyell</hi> above mentioned, his second the <hi rend="italic">Oracion of John
                    Russell on Charles Duke of Burgundy being created a Knight of the Garter,</hi>
                    which took place in 1469. Of his transactions between 1471 and 1474 there is no
                    record; probably he was engaged in the diligent pursuit of the art, and
                    preparing to transfer his materials to England, which he accomplished some time
                    before 1477, when we find him printing in or near the Abbey of Westminster, of
                    which Thomas Milling, bishop of Hereford, was at that time abbot. The first
                    production of his English press was the <hi rend="italic">Game of Chess,</hi>
                    bearing date 1474, which work, however, some assert to have been printed by him
                    at Cologne. The following is a specimen of this famous book, the initial letter
                    being printed in red:</p>
                <p>His next production was the <hi rend="italic">Poke of the hoole lyf of
                    Jason·,</hi> but his first book bearing date and place in the colophon is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dictes</hi><hi rend="italic">and Sayings of Philosophres,</hi>
                    a translation from the French by the gallant Earl Rivers, “at Westmestre, the
                    yere of our lord <hi rend="smallcaps">μ. cccc.</hi> lxxvij.” From this time he
                    continued both to print and translate with great spirit. His “capital work” was
                    a <hi rend="italic">Book of the noble Histories of Kyng Arthur,</hi> in 1485,
                    the most beautiful production of his press.</p>
                <p>There is but one copy of any of Caxton’s works printed upon vellum; it is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Doctrinal of Sapyence.</hi> “Translated out of Frensshe in to
                    Englysshe by wyllyam Caxton at Westmestre. Fynyshed the vi; day of May the yere
                    of our lord M.cccc.lxxix. Caxton me fieri fecit.” This unique copy is in the
                    library at Windsor, and it is in beautiful preservation. It is moreover doubly
                    unique, for it contains an additional chapter, to be found in no other copy
                    whatever, and which is entitled “Of the negligencies happening in the Masse and
                    of the Remedies. Cap. lxiiij.” It is a curious treatise of minute omissions and
                    commissions likely to occur in the service of mass, with directions how to
                    remedy such evils. Of their importance here are two specimens, “If by any
                    negligence fyl (falD any of the blood of the Sacrament on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >corporas,</hi> or upon any of the vestments, then ought to cut off the piece on
                    which it is fallen, and ought well to be washen, and that piece to be kept with
                    the other relics.” “And if the body of Jesu Christ, or any piece, fall upon the
                    pale of the altar, or upon any of the vestments that ben blessed, the piece
                    ought not to be cut off on which it is fallen, but it ought right well to be
                    washen, and the washing to be given to the ministers for to drink, or else drink
                    it himself.” This singular treatise finishes with this grave confession, “This
                    chapitre to fore I durst not sett in the booke, by cause it is not convenient ne
                    appertaining that every lay man should know it et cetera.” At the usual
                    termination of this work is that colophon of Caxton which is given amongst the
                    illustrations of this article in Plate CCCCXIV.; it is, however, considerably
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>The Royal Library possesses another work of Caxton, which, as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect</hi> copy, is also unique. This is the “Sub-tyl Historyes and Fables of
                    Esope. Translated out of Frenshe in to Englyshe by Wyllyam Caxton at
                    West-mynstre In the yere of our lord <hi rend="smallcaps">μ cccc</hi> lxxxiij

                    Rycharde the thyrde.” It consists of 142 leaves. Each fable is illustrated by a
                    rude wood-cut, all of which are said to have been executed abroad, where similar
                    editions of Aesop were frequently printed. They are, however, most probably
                    copied; for there is nothing either in their design or execution that a most
                    moderate artist might not perform; and this will equally apply to other
                    wood-cuts interspersed in Caxton’s works.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the works of Caxton have been eagerly sought for by English
                    bibliomaniacs. The most remarkable instances of this are the enormous prices
                    given for some of them at the sale of the Duke of Roxburghe’s library before
                    mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Chastysing of God’s Children</hi> was knocked
                    down to Earl Spencer for L.146. The <hi rend="italic">Sessions Papers</hi> were
                    bought for the Society of Lincoln’s Inn for L.378. The Duke of Devonshire gave
                    L.351. 15s. for <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour of the World,</hi> and L.180 for

                    Troye</hi> gave rise to a startling contest. It was the identical copy presented
                    by Caxton to Elizabeth Grey, queen of Edward IV. and sister of his patroness.
                    “Sir Mark Sykes vigorously pushed on his courser till five hundred guineas were
                    bidden; he then reined in the animal, and turned him gently on one side ‘ toward
                    the green sward.’ More hundreds are offered for the beautiful Elizabeth Grey’s
                    own copy. The hammer vibrates at nine hundred guineas. The sword of the marquess
                    is in motion, and he makes another thrust—‘ One thousand pounds.’ ‘ Let them be
                    guineas,’ said Mr Ridgway, and guineas they were. The marquess now recedes. He
                    is determined upon a retreat; another such victory as the one he has just gained
                    (the Valdarfar Boccaccio) must be destruction; and Mr Ridgway bears aloft the
                    beauteous prize in question.” (Dibdin.) At Mr Willett’s sale <hi rend="italic"

                    enlarged by an extensive knowledge of books and the world. Of his industry and
                    devotedness some idea may be formed, when Wynkyn de Worde, his successor,
                    states, in his colophon to the <hi rend="italic">Vitae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Patrum,</hi> that Caxton finished his translation of that work from French into
                    English <hi rend="italic">on the last day of his life.</hi> He died in 1494,
                    being above fourscore years of age. His epitaph has been thus written by some
                    friend unknown: “Of your charité pray for the soul of Mayster Will yam Caxton,
                    that in hys tyme was a man of moche ornate and moche rcnommed wysdome and
                    connynge, and decesed full crystenly the yere of our Lord <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The type used by Caxton is in design very inferior to that used upon the
                    Continent even earlier than his period; but in the latter part of his life he
                    very materially improved his founts, and some of his later productions are very
                    elegantly cut. The design is peculiar to him, and is said to be in imitation of
                    his own hand-writing; it bears, however, some resemblance to the types of Ulric
                    Zell, from whom Caxton derived most of his instruction, and is something between
                    <hi rend="italic">Secretary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gothic.</hi> He appears
                    to have had two founts of <hi rend="italic">English,</hi> three founts of <hi

                    very few ornamented initial letters, and those he did employ are very inferior
                    in elegance to those of foreign printers. He preferred inserting a small capital
                    letter within a large space, and leaving the interval to be filled up according
                    to the taste of the illuminator, owing to which many excellent performances are
                    destitute of these beautiful ornaments. Caxton’s ink was not remarkable for
                    depth of colour or richness; his paper was excellent; and he probably used
                    presses of the same construction as the continental printers. His works are not
                    very rare, but are highly prized by English collectors. Copies of one or more of
                    his works are to be found in most collections of any pretension, and are well
                    worthy of inspection. The number of his productions is sixty-two. Although
                    Caxton was the first English printer, he was not the only one of his day, Wynkyn
                    de Worde, Lettou and Machlinia, Hunte, Pynson, the Oxford printer whoever he may
                    have been, and he of St Alban’s, being his contemporaries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wynkyn de Worde</hi> came, as we have already seen, from
                    Germany with Caxton, and remained with him in the superintendence of his office
                    until the day of his death, when he succeeded to the business. He was a native
                    of Lorraine, and evidently a man of considerable information and taste, and of
                    great spirit in the conduct of his affairs. After his succession to Caxton’s
                    business, he carried it on in the same premises for about six years, when he
                    removed to the “Sygn of the Sonne in flete strete, against the con-dyth.” De
                    Worde appears to have immediately commenced a complete renovation of the art,
                    cutting many new founts of all sizes, with vast improvement of the design and
                    proportion; he moreover provided his contemporaries, then becoming very
                    numerous, with type; and it is even said that some of the letter used by English
                    printers less than a century ago are from his matrices, nay, that the punches
                    are still in existence. He was the first (or Pynson) to introduce Roman letters
                    into England, which he made use of amongst his Gothic to distinguish any thing
                    remarkable, in the same manner as Italic is used in the present day. His works
                    amount to the extraordinary number of four hundred and eight. “His books are, in
                    general, distinguished by neatness and elegance, and are always free from
                    professed immorality. The printer has liberally availed himself of such aid as
                    could be procured from the sister art of engraving; although it must be
                    confessed that by far the greater, if not the whole, number of wood engravings
                    at this period are of foreign execution; nor is it without a smile that the
                    typographical antiquary discovers the same cut introduced into works of a
                    directly opposite nature.”</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Instruction for Pilgrims to the Holy Land,</hi> printed
                    in 1523, the text of which is in Roman, and the marginal notes in Italics, he
                    makes the first use in England of Greek, which is in moveable type; of Arabic
                    and Hebrew, which are cut in wood; and the author complains that he is obliged
                    to omit a third part, because the printer had no Hebrew types. Appended to the
                    work are three Latin epistles, in which he makes use of Arabic.</p>
                <p>His works are, of course, not so rare as those of his predecessor, but are
                    nevertheless much sought after; and, when sold by the side of the Caxtons at the
                    Duke of Roxburghe’s sale, produced large prices. <hi rend="italic">Bartholomaeus

                <p>De Wordedied about the year 1534. In his will, still in the Prerogative Office,
                    dated 5th June 1534, he bequeaths many legacies of books to his friends and
                    servants, with minute directions for payment of small creditors and forgiveness
                    of debtors, betokening a conscientious and kindly disposition. His device is
                    generally that of Caxton, with his own name added to the bottom; but he also
                    used a much more complicated one, consisting of fleurs-de-lis, lions passant,
                    portcullis, harts, roses, and other emblazonments of the later Plantagenets and
                    the Tudors. A fac-similé of the former will be found in Plate CCCCXIV.</p>

                    in every respect; their type being most especially barbarous. Their works are
                    not very numerous, and are principally upon legal subjects; they printed the
                    first edition of Lyttleton’s Tenures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richard Pynson</hi> was a Norman by birth, and studied the
                    art of printing under his “worshipful master William Caxton.” It would seem that
                    he was an earlier printer than Wynkyn de Worde, having established an office
                    before the death of Caxton. His first work is of date 1493, and was printed “<hi
                    rend="italic">at the Temple-bar of London.”</hi> He enjoyed high patronage, and
                    was appointed by Henry VII. to be his printer before 1503. He is perhaps
                    inferior to Dc Worde as a typographer, his first types being extremely rude. He
                    afterwards used a fount of De Worde’s, and another peculiar to himself in this
                    country, probably imported from France. Some of his larger works, Fabian’s
                    Chronicle, Lord Berner’s translation of Froissart (which are the first editions
                    of these important additions to English literature), and some of his law-works,
                    are very fine specimens of the art. His device was a curious compound of R and
                    P, on a shield which is sometimes supported by two naked figures.</p>
                <p>Of Julian Notary, William Faques, Henry Pepwell, and others, it is unnecessary
                    even to mention their names, inasmuch as they add little that is interesting to
                    the history of English typography.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richard Grafton,</hi> however, claims especial notice. He
                    was by trade a grocer, although of good family. Of his education nothing
                    appears; but he was one of the most voluminous authors of his time, having, by
                    his own account, written a considerable portion of Hall’s Chronicles, an
                    Abridgment of the Chronicles of England, and a Manual of the same, a Chronicle
                    at Large, and other books of historical character, under what circumstances is
                    not known. In 1537 Grafton published Thomas Mathew’s translation of t!ιe Bible,
                    which was printed abroad, but where is not satisfactorily ascertained; and in
                    1538 the Testament translated by Miles Coverdale, which was printed at Paris by
                    Francis Régnault. At this time it would not appear that English printers were in
                    high estimation; for Lord Cromwell, desirous of having the Bible in the English
                    language, thought it necessary to procure from Henry VIII. letters to the king
                    of France for license to print it at Paris, and urged Bonner to tender his
                    earnest assistance. Bonner entered upon the undertaking with such zeal, that in
                    recompense he was soon afterwards appointed to the bishopric of Hereford. Miles
                    Coverdale had charge of the correctness (see his letter, Gent.’s Mag. 1791), and
                    Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >proprietors</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but under what arrangement does
                    notappear. When the work was on the point of completion, the Inquisitors· of the
                    Faith interfered, seized the sheets, and Grafton, Whitchurch, and Coverdale,
                    were compelled to make precipitate flight. The avarice of the
                    lieutenant-criminal induced him to sell the sheets for waste paper instead of
                    destroying them, and they were in part re purchased. The Testament was intrusted
                    to Francis Régnault, whose brother used the tasteful colophon which will be
                    found in Plate CCCCXIV. Under the protection of Cromwell they next, after many
                    difficulties, obtained their types and other materials from Paris, and the Bible
                    was completed at London in 1539. <hi rend="superscript"> tς</hi> Thus they
                    became printers themselves, which before this affair they never intended.” The
                    edition consisted of 2500 copies. Cromwell next procured for them a privilege
                    (not an exclusive one, however) for printing the Scriptures for five years. Very
                    shortly after the death of Lord Cromwell, Grafton was imprisoned for printing
                    Mathew’s Bible and the Great Bible, his former friend Bonner much exaggerating
                    the case against him. The prosecution, however, was not followed up; but in a
                    short time he was, with Whitchurch, appointed printer to Prince Edward, with
                    special patents for printing all church-service books and primers. The document
                    is curious. It recites that such “bookes had been prynted by strangiers in other
                    and strange countreys, partely to the great losse and hynderance of our
                    subjects, who both have the sufficient arte, feate and treade of prynting, and

                <p>One Richard Grafton, supposed to be the above, was member of parliament for the
                    city of London in 1553-54, and also in 1556-57, and in 1562 was member for
                    Coventry. He is supposed to have died about 1572, and not in very affluent
                    circumstances. He used a punning, or, as the heralds would call it, a canting
                    device, of a young tree or <hi rend="italic">graft</hi> growing out of a <hi

                    in folio, in 1623. Of his single plays, the earliest is “The first part of the

                    printed by “<hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Creed</hi> for Thomas Millington, and

                    names of George Eld, Valentine Simmes, R. Young, John Robson, and others who
                    only give their initials.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Milton’s Paradise Lost was printed in quarto by <hi

                    1671.</p>
                <p>During the troublesome times that preceded the great rebellion, the Puritans,
                    jealously watched and persecuted, introduced the anomaly of ambulatory presses,
                    which were constantly removed from town to town to escape the vigilance of the
                    Star-Chamber. At these presses many of Milton’s controversial pamphlets were
                    printed; and it is even said that the identical press at which the Areopagitica
                    was printed is still in existence, and was lately in the possession of Mr Valpy,
                    the well-known printer of the Variorum Classics.</p>
                <p>It is a very pleasing reflection, that the earlier practitioners of the art did,
                    by their uniform good character and religious turn, tend much to render their
                    profession productive of a highly moral class of literature, and to raise it in
                    the estimation of all men. Had they been less respectable, had they turned their
                    attention to the many ribald and tasteless writings of those times, the effect
                    of the new art would have been to degrade literature and lower morals, to delay
                    the spread of knowledge, and to give a depression to the character of the art
                    and its practitioners, from which possibly they might never have recovered.
                    These excellent and learned men appear to have received their temporal reward,
                    in public estimation, sufficient wealth, and a length of years beyond the
                    ordinary term of mortality.</p>
                <p>Setting aside the claim of Corsellis, printing was first practised at <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Oxford</hi> by Theoderic Rood and Thomas Hunte from 1480 to
                    1485. In Rymer, vol. xv. is a grant by Queen Elizabeth to Thomas Cooper, clerk
                    of Oxford, for the exclusive printing of his Latin Dictionary. In 1585 a
                    printing press was established at the expense of the Earl of Leicester,
                    chancellor of the university. Joseph Barnes was appointed printer to the
                    university in 1585.</p>
                <p>At <hi rend="smallcaps">Cambridge</hi> John Siberch printed in 1521, when Erasmus
                    resided there, and probably executed some of his books. Thomas Thomas, Μ. A. was
                    the first printer to the university in 1584.</p>
                <p>At <hi rend="smallcaps">St Alban’s</hi> printing was very early practised,
                    certainly in the year 1480. It would appear that the printer was a schoolmaster.
                    It has been asserted, but without shadow of argument, that printing was
                    introduced here many years before Caxton.</p>
                <p>Printing was not introduced into Scotland till thirty years after Caxton had set
                    up his press at Westminster. Under the patronage of James IV., who was a zealous
                    encourager of learning and the useful arts, <hi rend="smallcaps">Walter
                    Chepman</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Andro</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Myllar</hi>
                    established the first printing press at Edinburgh, as appears by a royal

                <p>It is difficult to account for the discontinuance of printing in Scotland for
                    about twenty years after this time: probably the disastrous events at the close
                    of the rcign of James IV. may have contributed to render it an unprofitable
                    trade; but in its revival by <hi rend="smallcaps">Davidson</hi> there was no
                    deterioration, either in the magnitude and importance of the works attempted, or
                    in the mode in which the mechanical part was executed. It was probably about the
                    year 1536 that he printed, in a black-letter folio, “The History and Croniklis
                    of Scotland, compilit and newly corrcckit be the Reuerend and Noble Clerke
                    Maister Hector Boece. Translatit laitly be Maister Johne Bellenden. Imprentit in
                    Edinburgh be Thomas Davidson, dwelling foment the FrereWynd;” and in 1540 he
                    printed the whole works of Sir David Lindsay.</p>
                <p>Davidson was succeeded by Lekprevik, Vautrollier, and others; but none were
                    distinguished as printers till the time of Ruddiman.</p>
                <p>A mere catalogue of printers would afford little amusement, and less instruction;
                    especially since the productions of the English press, save in the works of the
                    printers above named, not only exhibited no advance, but even much
                    deterioration, in most requisites of good printing. Indeed, to so low a point
                    had the art fallen, and so little spirit was exhibited by English typographers,
                    that the regeneration was left to an alien, whose perception of the inferiority
                    and capacity of improvement at once raised the art to the level of the finest
                    productions of Bodoni and Barbou.</p>
                <p>This was <hi rend="smallcaps">John Baskerville,</hi> a japanner of Birmingham,
                    who, having realized a considerable fortune, turned his attention to cutting
                    punches for type, and succeeded in producing a series of founts of remarkable
                    beauty, so excellently proportioned, and standing so well, that the best of <pb

                    type-founders (and this seems the Augustan age of type-founding) have done no
                    more than vary the proportions and refine the more delicate lines and strokes.
                    Added to this, his press-work is of most excellent quality; his paper the
                    choicest that could be procured; and his ink has a richness of tone, the mode of
                    producing which has died with him. The works of Baskerville are amongst the
                    choicest that can adorn a library. He died in 1775. His types and punches were
                    purchased to print the splendid edition of Voltaire’s works at Paris. He was
                    worthily succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Bulmer,</hi> whose magnificent
                    Shakspeare and <hi rend="smallcaps">Milton</hi> are amongst the most superb
                    books ever issued from the press, and, with Macklin’s Bible and Ritchie’s,
                    Bensly’s Hume, and other works, may be fearlessly produced to win for this
                    country the palm of fine printing; whilst in Scotland <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Thomas Ruddiman,</hi> and the two <hi rend="smallcaps">Foulis,</hi> may
                    challenge the prize of classical typography from Aldus and the Stcphani. Indeed
                    the larger Greek types of the Foulis are without parallel for grandeur; their
                    press-work is beautiful, and their correctness beyond all praise.</p>
                <p>Modern printers,.with all their faults, are not degenerate successors of these
                    worthies. The works from present offices that make pretensions to fine printing

                    average of the printing of the present day is infinitely superior to that of the
                    last century. But in what relates to practical skill, correctness, taste, and
                    diligence, we cannot hope to excel, though we may perhaps equal, these departed

                    is appropriated, and consequently the one he requires. As there is no external
                    mark or guide attached to the different boxes to denote the letters they
                    contain, a stranger is not a little surprised and mystified at the eccentric
                    movements of the workman’s hand. Accordingly, it will be observed, upon looking

                    d, m, n, h, u, t, i, s, o, a, r, twice the size of b, 1, V, k, f, g, y, p, or w,
                    and four times the size of z, x, j, q, or the [] crotchets, full points, &amp;c.
                    These boxes are not arranged in alphabetical or any other order, but as
                    experience has shown how the case may be most conveniently divided into the
                    requisite proportions. There arc also other pairs of cases similarly arranged
                    for the <hi rend="italic">italic</hi> letters. The fount is therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">laid</hi> or distributed in these boxes, when the following are
                    found to be some of the proportions of the letters in a fount of pica of 800
                    lbs. weight:</p>
                <p>Capitals, of each from 400 to 600, Small capitals, from 150 to 300, a 8,500, b
                    1,600,; 400, z 200, e 12,000, c 3,000, k 800, &amp; 200, i 8,000, d 4,000, m
                    3,000, , 4,500, o 8,000, f 2,500, n 8,000, . 2,000, u 3,400, h 6,400, q 500,
                    &amp; 200, the whole fount comprehending the number of 150,000 letters, spaces,
                    and figures.</p>
                <p>The compositor having placed his copy upon a little-used part of the upper case,
                    and having received the necessary directions, takes up an instrument called a
                    <hi rend="italic">composing-stick</hi> (which, as well as the way of holding it
                    and its use, will be better understood by reference to the drawing than by
                    description, see Plate CCCCXV.), and sliding that inner moveable portion
                    fastened by a screw, wider or closer according to the desired width of the page,
                    cuts to the exact size a piece of brass rule, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >setting-rule,</hi> which enables the letters to slip down without any
                    obstruction from the screw-holcs of the stick, or the nicks by which one fount
                    is distinguished from another. He then reads the first few words of his copy,
                    takes first a capital letter from the upper case, the succeeding letters from
                    the lower case, and at the conclusion of the word a <hi rend="italic"
                    >space,</hi> which is merely the shank of a letter without any face, and not so
                    high as a letter by about one-fourth part. This therefore separates each word by
                    a space, which cannot appear upon the paper, because the ink cannot be
                    distributed upon it except by mismanagement, in which case it is a fearful
                    blotch upon a fair page, and must have been observed by most readers. He then
                    proceeds with his next word, which will probably consist of lower-case letters
                    only, and so proceeds until he has arrived at the end of his line. It is most
                    likely, however, that the words he has occasion to compose, with the necessary
                    spaces, will not fill up the exact width of the line, and that there will be
                    sometimes too much, sometimes too little, room for getting in the next or part
                    of the next word. In this case he has to consider whether it will be better to
                    crowd the line and get in the next syllable, or make the line more open and take
                    it over to the next line; his care being that his matter, when composed, shall
                    not look too white or too dark. Having decided, he takes out the spaces he has
                    inserted, and puts in their stead others of greater or less width, as the case
                    may require, in such a manner that on the face of the line being touched it
                    shall not feel loose, or that it shall not require any particular pressure to
                    force down the last letter into its proper place. This being accomplished in an
                    artist-like manner, he takes out his setting-rule, and places it in front of his
                    line, and with a gentle pressure of the thumb forces both back into the
                    composing-stick; he then proceeds in a similar manner with other lines, until
                    his stick is very nearly full, when, placing it upon <hi rend="italic">the
                    frame</hi> on which the cases are, his settingrule being in front, he lifts his
                    lines out of the stick in order to place them upon a proper instrument, called a
                    <hi rend="italic">galley.</hi> If, however, the matter is to be <hi
                    rend="italic">leaded,</hi> that is, if the lines of types are to be more apart
                    than usual, the process is a little different. The compositor then has before
                    him a quantity of pieces of metal called <hi rend="italic">leads,</hi> of the
                    exact width of the page, only one fourth, one sixth, or one eighth as wide as
                    the type, and not higher than spaces. After composing a line, before moving his
                    setting-rule, he takes one or more of these and places it before the line, then
                    places the setting-rule, and so proceeds. Having thus gone on until a
                    considerable quantity of matter is composed, the compositor next proceeds to
                    make it up into pages, and then into sheets. First, taking by portions as many
                    lines of his matter as are to be contained in a page, he adds thereto at the
                    bottom a line of quadrats, which are the same as spaces, but much larger, being
                    three, four, five, or six times as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539603"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9603-0556"/>long as they are broad, and places at the top the
                    folio of the page and the <hi rend="italic">running head,</hi> or line which
                    indicates the title of the work or the subject of the page or chapter, and then
                    adds such leads or other things as may be necessary, taking care that in the
                    first page he places the <hi rend="italic">signature</hi> (a letter of the
                    alphabet, intended for a guide to the binder), because by keeping this always
                    outside, and the second signature on the next leaf, he cannot fold the sheet
                    wrong. He next ties it tightly round with page-cord, and places it upon a piece
                    of coarse paper. Having made up as many pages as the sheet consists of, viz.
                    four if folio, eight if 4to, sixteen if 8vo, he next lays them down upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">imposing-stone</hi> (a large slab of marble let into a frame) in
                    the necessary order. This is, to a stranger, a very curious arrangement; they
                    appear to him to be placed at random, without any design or fixed rule, and as
                    they are necessarily laid down in two divisions, one for each side of the sheet,
                    one is of consequence the very reverse of the other. He may very easily instruct
                    himself, however; for if he take a sheet of paper, and fold it into any required
                    size, marking the folios with a pencil, and then open it without cutting, he
                    will find they fall in curious irregularity. The pages are laid down on the
                    stone reverse of the arrangement they have on the paper; for it must be
                    remembered that every type and every page is like a seal, the reverse of the
                    impression it leaves; consequently, were the pages laid down as on a marked
                    paper, viz. the first page on the right hand, it would, in type, be at the
                    extreme left, and so on. The following schemes of the <hi rend="italic">laying
                    down</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imposition</hi> of a sheet of 4to, 8vo, and
                    12mo, will give some idea of the apparent confusion of this process.</p>
                <p>The pages being properly disposed upon the imposing-stone, the compositor next
                    takes a <hi rend="italic">chase</hi> (a frame of iron divided by cross bars into
                    compartments, the inner angles of which are made rectangular with much care) and
                    places it over them, and then having ascertained the size of the paper to be
                    used, adjusts pieces of wood or metal, called furniture, between them. Within
                    the chase, but next to the pages, he now places other pieces of iron called <hi
                    rend="italic">side</hi> and <hi rend="italic">foot sticks,</hi> which are rather
                    wider at one end than the other, and between these and the chase small pieces of
                    wood, which decrease in width in the same proportion as the side-stick, and
                    which are called <hi rend="italic">quoins.</hi> With a <hi rend="italic"
                    >shooting-stick</hi> (which formidably-named weapon is merely a piece of hard
                    wood, a foot in length, an inch and a half in width, and half an inch in
                    thickness) and a mallet he forces the quoins towards the thicker ends of the
                    side and foot sticks, which consequently act as gradual and most powerful
                    wedges, forcing the separate pieces of type to become a compact and almost
                    united body, so that, every side of the pages being again and again <hi
                    rend="italic">locked up,</hi> the whole mass, consisting of many thousand
                    letters, may be lifted unbroken from the stone. This united mass is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">form;</hi> that one which contains the first page being called the
                    <hi rend="italic">miter form,</hi> the other the <hi rend="italic"
                    >inner.</hi></p>
                <p>The compositor is paid by the number of thousands of letters he composes, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> which is thus ascertained. The letter m, being on a
                    shank which is perfectly square, is taken as the standard; he ascertains how
                    many ms the page is in length, including the running head and the white line at
                    the bottom; that is, in fact, how many lines of the particular type used there
                    would be in a page of the given size, supposing it were all solid type; next,
                    how many ms it is in width, that is, how many times the letter m would be
                    repeated in a line of the given length were it to consist of nothing but ms.
                    This latter sum is then doubled, because experience shows that the average width
                    of the letters is one half of the depth, or one half of that of the letter
                    m.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> In 1804, after a protracted litigation before the
                    Court of Session, the journeymen compositors of Edinburgh succeeded in obtaining
                    the sanction of the Court for an advance of one penny per thousand letters, or,
                    upon an average, about one fourth on the prices of their work. The grounds upon
                    which the Court rested this decision were, that the wages were much too low;
                    that they had remained for forty years unaltered, whilst the price of the
                    necessaries of life had very much increased; that it was proper to avoid a rise
                    of wages which might lead to idleness, but equally necessary to place the
                    workmen upon a respectable footing, so as to enable them to do their work
                    properly, and also to encourage them in cultivating and acquiring that degree of
                    literature by which the public must infallibly be benefited; and that the fair
                    criterion was, to make the wages of Edinburgh bear the same proportion to those
                    of London which they did in the year 1785, before the London prices were
                    raised.</p>
                <p>That a court of law, whose province it is, not to legislate, but to apply and
                    enforce existing statutes, should have entertained a question regarding the
                    price of labour, for the regulation of which there not only existed no law, but
                    which had never been deemed a fit subject for legislative interference, appears
                    to be a very singular incident in the history of judicial procedure. The prices
                    thus fixed, however (namely, 4∣d. per 1000 for book-work, with an additional
                    halfpenny if nonpareil, and a penny if pearl, and 5⅜d. for law-papers and jobs),
                    being regarded as not unreasonable, have ever since been adhered to by every
                    respectable establishment in Edinburgh.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539616" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9616-0557"/>
                <p>The length of the page is then multiplied by the product of this doubled width,
                    then by the number of pages in the sheet, and the result will give the average
                    number of letters in the sheet. This will be much better understood by the
                    following <hi rend="italic">casting up</hi> of a sheet of 8vo in pica.</p>
                <p>Number of ms long 47</p>
                <p>ms wide, 24 × 2 48</p>
                <p>376</p>
                <p>188</p>
                <p>2256</p>
                <p>Number of pages in a sheet of 8vo 16</p>
                <p>13536 2256</p>
                <p>36096</p>
                <p>The compositor therefore is paid for composing 36,000 let-, ters; for odd figures
                    are dropped, unless they exceed 500, when they are paid for as if they completed
                    another 1000. If the sheet be of solid type, and of ordinary size, the price
                    paid in London is sixpence per 1000 letters; if the small type called minion,
                    sixpence farthing; if nonpareil, sevenpence; if pearl, eightpence. If, however,
                    the type be leaded, the price is a farthing per 1000 less; and if the work be
                    composed from print copy, the price is three farthings per 1000 less than it
                    would be paid if the copy were manuscript. Works in foreign languages are paid
                    one halfpenny per 1000 more in the type of ordinary size, three farthings per
                    1000 more in the smaller. Greek with leads and without accents is eightpence
                    halfpenny per 1000; without leads or accents, eightpence three farthings; with
                    accents, tenpence farthing. Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, &amp;c. are paid double. The
                    compositor, it appears, must therefore pick up 72,000 letters before he can
                    receive an ordinary week’s wages, must moreover correct all the blunders
                    mischance or carelessness may have occasioned ;· and must make up his matter
                    into pages and impose them, with great expenditure of time in many other
                    particulars; but, as is hereafter described, he must have previously placed
                    every one of these 72,000 into the appropriate boxes whence he has withdrawn
                    them in composition. Now it is usually reckoned that this latter operation,
                    called <hi rend="italic">distributing,</hi> occupies one fourth of a
                    compositor’s time, and the other operations another fourth; he has therefore
                    only one half of his time for composition; consequently he must pick up letters
                    at the rate of 144,000 per week, 24,000 per day, or 2000 per hour. His hand has
                    in picking up each letter to traverse a considerable space, say six inches, and
                    back again, to his composing-stick. His rapidity of motion is therefore
                    wonderful, and the exertion is so long continued, that the business, although
                    apparently a light one, is in fact extremely laborious. The number of thousands
                    of letters in a sheet necessarily varies with the size of the type, width and
                    length of the page, and the number of the pages. The casting up above given is a
                    solid pica sheet of demy octavo, of moderate page; a similar sheet of brevier
                    would contain 81,000 letters, and the cost of composing it would be L.2. 0s. 6d.
                    Single tables, forming one uninterrupted mass of type, will sometimes contain
                    250,000 letters; and the labour of the compositor being very great in getting up
                    tables, he is paid double. Consequently the cost of composing such a table in
                    pearl or diamond (see the I3th of Bell’s Chronological Tables, 4th edit.) would
                    be not less than L.16. 13s. 6d., without extra charges. Yet this infinity of
                    types, by the power of the wedge-formed side-sticks and quoins, is formed into
                    so solid a mass as to be moved without much danger of disruption.</p>
                <p>The sheet being now imposed, an impression is taken, called a proof, which is
                    carried down to the reader, who, having folded the proof in the necessary
                    manner, first looks over the signatures, next ascertains whether the sheet
                    commences with the right signature and folio, and then looks to the following
                    folios. He now looks over the running heads, inspects the proof to see that it
                    has been imposed in the proper furniture, that the chapters are numbered
                    rightly, and that the other directions have been correctly attended to, marking
                    whatever he finds wrong. Having carefully done this, he places the proof before
                    him, with the copy at his left hand, and proceeds to read the proof over with
                    the greatest minuteness, referring incessantly to the copy that no word may
                    escape him, correcting the capitals or italics, or any other peculiarities,
                    noting continually whether every portion of the composition has been executed in
                    a workman-like manner; and having fully satisfied himself upon all technical
                    points, he calls his reading-boy, who, taking the copy, reads in a clear voice,
                    but with great rapidity and the least possible attention to sound, sense,
                    pauses, or cadences, the precise words placed before him, inserting, without
                    pause or embarrassment, from the most crabbed or intricate copy, every
                    interlineation, note, or side-note. The gabble of these boys in a reading-room,
                    where there are three or four reading, is most amusing, a stranger hearing the
                    utmost confusion of tongues, strange unconnected sentences, and most monotonous
                    tones; the readers plodding at their several tasks with the most iron composure,
                    not in the least disturbed by the Babel around them. They follow carefully every
                    word, marking every error, or pausing to assist in deciphering every unknown or
                    foreign word. This first reading is strictly confined to making the proof an
                    exact copy of the manuscript, and ascertaining the competency of the compositor,
                    consequently first readers are generally intelligent and well-educated
                    compositors, whose practical knowledge enables them to detect the most trivial
                    technical deficiencies. Having thus a second time perused the proof, and
                    carefully marked upon the copy the commencement, signature, and folio of the
                    succeeding sheet, he sends it by his reading-boy to the composing-room to be
                    corrected by the workmen who have taken share in the composition. These
                    immediately divide the proof amongst them, and each, taking that portion of it
                    which contains the matter he had composed, and going to his cases, gathers the
                    letters marked as corrections in the margin, together with a quantity of spaces
                    of all sizes, and returns to the forms, which in the meanwhile one of them has
                    <hi rend="italic">laid up</hi> on the imposing-stones and unlocked. He then with
                    a blunt bodkin lifts up each line in which a correction is required, draws out
                    the wrong letter and inserts the right one, adjusting the spaces in such a way
                    as to compensate for the increased or diminished size of the letter substituted,
                    overrunning carefully several lines should any word have been added or struck
                    out, so that the spacing may be uniform, and the corrected matter exhibit no
                    proof whatever of any alteration having been necessary. This is an operation
                    requiring much practice and skill; and here is shown the value of attention in
                    the preliminary operations. Should the types have been care!essly laid or
                    improperly distributed, should the workman have been careless in composition,
                    capitalling, or spacing, he will consume as much time in amending his errors as
                    in composing his matter, to the great detriment of his work, the injury and
                    inconvenience of his employer and his companions, and great delay· in every part
                    of the printing-office. Thus every compositor having taken his share, another
                    proof is pulled, which, with the original proof, is taken to the same first
                    reader, who compares the one with the other, and ascertains that his marks have
                    been carefully attended to, in default of which, he again sends it up to be
                    corrected; but should he find his revision satisfactory, he sends the second
                    proof with the copy to the second reader, by whom it undergoes the same careful
                    inspection; but this time, most technical objections being rectified, the reader
                    observes whether<pb break="no" facs="nls:193539629" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9629-0558"
                    /> the author’s language be good and intelligible; if not, he makes such queries
                    on the margin as his experience may suggest; and having again followed his
                    reading-boy, he sends it up to the compositor, where it again undergoes
                    correction, and a proof being very carefully pulled, it is sent down to the same
                    reader, who revises his marks and transfers the queries. The proof is then sent,
                    generally with the copy, to the author for his perusal, and he having made such
                    alterations as he thinks necessary, sends it back to the printing-office for
                    correction. With the proper attention to these marks the printer’s
                    responsibility as to correctness ceases, and the sheet is now ready for press.
                    ∙</p>
                <p>It nced scarcely be remarked, that “correctness of the press” is a very material
                    feature in every work, and more especially in those of a scientific nature. When
                    the attention and the mind are devoted to the train of some close argument, or
                    passage of surpassing beauty, it is surprising how easily an error of the press,
                    even although it may not injure the sense, and may be as evident “as the sun at
                    noon,” will destroy the charm, and break the “thread of the discourse and even
                    in works of ordinary reading they are exceedingly offensive. Many curious
                    anecdotes are related of the methods which the earlier printers adopted to
                    attain correctness. It was the glory of the early literati to take charge of the
                    accuracy of new works; and, in return, the value and sale of each edition varied
                    with the skill and reputation of the corrector. Of these Erasmus is an
                    illustrious proof. Many of the first printers were led to the practice of the
                    art by their love of learning, and their anxiety to promote it by the production
                    of classic authors. Hence several arc better known in the world of learning than
                    in the circle of bibliographers; as the editors and correctors of valuable
                    works, than as the careful or beautiful printers of them. Aldus, it is true, has
                    so admirably succeeded in both characters, that he has fully established his
                    double fame; but whether he most valued himself upon his learning or his skill
                    may be doubted. It would appear from his letters that he considered it as his
                    chiefest duty to correct every sheet that passed through his press. In all his
                    bustle in preparing every material in use in his art, in all his occupations
                    public and private, this important duty was never neglected. He tells us, “that
                    he has hardly time to inspect, much less to correct, the sheets which are
                    executed in his office; that his days and his nights are devoted to the
                    preparation of fit materials; and that he can scarcely take food or strengthen
                    his stomach, owing to the multiplicity and pressure of business; meanwhile,”
                    adds he, “with both hands occupied, and surrounded by pressmen who are clamorous
                    for work, there is scarcely time even to blow one’s nose;” nor did his son or
                    grandson depart from his ways, but did themselves insure the correctness of
                    their works, even when the latter had risen to wealth and eminence, and enjoyed
                    the laborious dignity of a professor’s chair. The beautiful Greek works of the
                    Stephani are especially valued for their correctness. Stephens corrected his own
                    press with intense labour and minuteness, and is reported to have adopted a
                    singular plan for obtaining perfect similarity to the copy, by employing females
                    who had not the slightest knowledge of the Greek characters or language to
                    compare every letter of the proof with the manuscript; a labour so intense as to
                    be almost incredible. He is moreover said to have hung up proofs on the doors of
                    his printing-office, and to have amply rewarded any who could detect
                    inaccuracies therein. Coverdalc, it will be recollected, corrected the first
                    English Bible and Testament, and received a bishopric as his reward.</p>
                <p>The experience of every printerwill furnish a host of laughable errors; and
                    indeed these defects have been deemed of such importance as to deserve
                    preservation. (D’Isracli’s <hi rend="italic">Curiosities of Literature?)</hi>
                    The omission of the word <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from the seventh
                    commandment, in an edition of the Bible, printed by the Stationers’ Company, is
                    well known; and the company richly deserved the severe fine they incurred for
                    spreading the immoral command, “Thou shalt commit adultery.” The Bible so
                    misprinted has received the name of the “Adultery Bible;” and a copy is
                    preserved in the British Museum, the edition having been carefully suppressed.
                    There is another Bible known as the “Vinegar Bible,” from a misprint in the 20th
                    chapter of St Luke, where “Parable of the Vinegar” is printed for “Parable of
                    the Vineyard ;” this proceeded from the Clarendon press. In the reign of Charles
                    I. a very curious traffic in Bibles, &amp;c. arose; they were printed by any one
                    who chose, and imported in vast numbers from abroad. It will readily be imagined
                    that these were made for <hi rend="italic">sale,</hi> not for <hi rend="italic"
                    >use,</hi> and that they abounded with egregious errors; but, what is worse than
                    this, they were full of mistranslations and interpolations, and the omissions
                    were fearful. All these were done as much by design as by accident, the
                    Romanists and sectaries taking the opportunity of advancing their own tenets by
                    interpolating and altering texts to suit their views. These monstrous anomalies
                    produced, however, some good; they occasioned the necessity of the authorized
                    version now in use, and printed under such authority as insures perfect
                    fidelity, whilst there is sufficient competition to make it impossible that the
                    Word of God can ever become a sealed book to thehumblest andpoorest Christian.
                    Some of the blunders in these editions are sufficiently absurd to overcome the
                    repugnance which must naturally be felt at such license. Thus, in Luke xxi. 28,
                    <hi rend="italic">condemnation</hi> has been misprinted for <hi rend="italic"
                    >redemption.</hi> In Field’s Bible of 1653, called the Pearl Bible, Rom. vi. 13,
                    we find “Neither yield ye your members as instruments of <hi rend="italic"
                    >righteousness</hi> unto sin,” for <hi rend="italic">unrighteousness</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and 1 Cor. vi. 9, “Know ye not that the unrighteous <hi
                    rend="italic">shall inherit</hi> the kingdom of God ?” for <hi rend="italic"
                    >shall not inherit.</hi> It is said that these corruptions are in great measure
                    owing to Field’s cupidity, and that he received a bribe of L.1500 from the
                    Independents to alter the text in Acts vi. 3, to sanction the right of the
                    people to appoint their own pastors,“Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you
                    seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom <hi
                    rend="italic">ye</hi> may appoint over this business,” instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">we.</hi> This Bible is notorious, and, strange to say, valued, for
                    its gross incorrectness. It is asserted that no less than six thousand errors of
                    greater or less magnitude have been noted in it. But the most extraordinary
                    example of carelessness is presented by the Vulgate the printing of which was
                    sedulously superintended by no less an authority than Sextus V., a curious
                    example of the infallibility of the pope. To the astonishment of the world, it
                    swarmed with errors; and a whimsical attempt was made to remedy the defects, by
                    pasting printed slips of paper over the erroneous passages. As this, however,
                    was exceedingly laughable, the papal authority was exerted to the utmost to call
                    in the edition, and with such effect, that it soon became very scarce, and a
                    copy of it has produced the disproportionate sum of sixty guineas. To add to the
                    absurdity, the volume contains a bull from the pope anathematising and
                    excommunicating all printers who, in reprinting it, should make any alteration
                    in the text. The monkish editor of <hi rend="italic">The Anatomy of the
                    Mass,</hi> printed in 1561, a work consisting of 172 pages of text and fifteen
                    pages of errata, very amusingly accounts for these mistakes by attributing them
                    to the artifice of Satan, who caused the printers to commit such numerous
                    blunders; but he does not inform us whether it was really the archangel fallen,
                    or only his minor satellite, the printer’s devil. The editor of an Ethiopic
                    version of St Paul’s Epistles innocently confesses, in palliation of his errors,
                    “that they who printed the work could not read, and we could not print: they
                    helped us and we helped them, as the blind helps the blind.”</p>
                <p>The sheet being printed off in the way hereafter to be described, and the forms
                    returned by the pressmen to the composing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193539642"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9642-0559"/>-room, and very carefully washed with lye, and
                    rinsed with water, the compositor lays up the forms on a letterboard, and there
                    unlocks them. Each compositor employed on the work then takes a share of the
                    letter, and, wetting the face of it plentifully with a sponge, which causes the
                    types to adhere sufficiently to prevent accidents, yet not so much as to retard
                    the workman, takes up a portion on his setting-rule, with the nick upwards, and
                    the face turned towards him; he then takes between his fingers and thumb a few
                    letters, gives arapid glance at the face to see what letters they are, and then
                    passing his hand rapidly over the cases, drops each into its appropriate box. In
                    this operation the greatest attention is necessary, for it must be remembered,
                    that every letter dropped into a wrong box in distributing is sure to cause an
                    error in composing; for the workman, as before stated, never looks at the letter
                    he takes up, relying upon the correctness of the distribution. Compositors,
                    therefore, should be especially careful, when learning their business, not to
                    sacrifice certainty to swiftness; for in this instance most especially is it
                    found that too much haste is little speed. If the rapidity of motion in
                    composition strikes the stranger with wonder, what must that of distribution
                    occasion? Most compositors distribute four times as rapidly as they compose; if,
                    therefore, he pick up two thousand letters in an hour, he would distribute eight
                    or ten thousand, or about three per second. His letter being properly
                    distributed, he again proceeds to compose in the manner before described, until
                    the work is finished. The number of times the letter is returned must depend
                    upon the size of the fount. A thousand pounds weight of types would get up five
                    or six sheets, and, therefore, in a fair octavo volume, the letter would be
                    returned five or six times.</p>
                <p>The Press is the machine whereby impressions are obtained of the type, when set
                    up by the compositor as above described. On the skill and care of the pressmen
                    depend the beauty of the work. If the press-work be not good, all the labour of
                    the compositor is thrown away; his work makes no respectable appearance, and the
                    master gets no credit.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned, that very little alteration had been made in the
                    printing press from the time of the first printers to that of Blaew of
                    Amsterdam, about 1620. Blaew’s improvements, although of immense advantage, only
                    consisted in alterations in the details, and not in the principle. Blaew’s
                    presses have in their turn been superseded by those of Lord Stanhope; and very
                    few are in existence, in England at least, save in old offices, where they are
                    used as proof-presses, or kept merely as curiosities. A description of a bygone
                    piece of mechanism would be of little utility; to show, however, Lord Stanhope’s
                    ingenious invention, it is necessary to make the reader understand the original
                    construction. As a great part of the old press is retained in the new, one
                    description will serve for both; premising that the old presses, as well as
                    those first fitted with the Stanhope power, were of wood, but that very soon the
                    latterwere constructed of iron, and that, in consequence, the general appearance
                    of the press was much altered. A press then consisted of two upright pieces of
                    immense strength, which rose perpendicularly from the floor to the height of six
                    feet and a half, and were connected with cross pieces. From about the middle of
                    each of these a slide, called a rib, projected at right angles, and perfectly
                    parallel to each other; a spindle with a powerful screw, kept in its place by
                    these cross pieces, worked in a box called a hose, by means of a bar or lever
                    inserted in it; the toe of the spindle worked in a sort of cup fixed upon a
                    large solid block of mahogany, having the face planed perfectly smooth, and
                    called the platten. It will be evident, that when the bat js pulled down, the
                    spindle will descend in proportion to the worm of its screw, and force down the
                    platten to precisely the same degree, and with great power. A table was made to
                    run in and out upon the above-mentioned ribs; upon this was the form of type;
                    when run in, it was exactly under the platten, and having been previously inked,
                    and the paper laid on it, the bar was pulled over, the spindle, platten, &amp;c.
                    descended, and the consequence was a very powerful pressure of the paper between
                    the platten and the type, causing the latter to give a perfect fac-similé of its
                    surface upon the paper. Lord Stanhope’s invention consists in an improved
                    application of the power to the spindle and screw, whereby the power is
                    multiplied many times. This will be best understood by describing an iron press
                    of the modern construction. Upon reference to the engraving, this will be found
                    to consist of a very heavy mass of iron, called the staple <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa,</hi> the outline of which somewhat resembles that of a vase. It is united
                    at the top and bottom, but the neck and body are open. The upper part is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">nut b,</hi> and answers the purpose of the head in the old
                    press, as it is in fact a box with a female screw, in which the screw of the
                    spindle <hi rend="italic">c</hi> works; the louver portion of the open part
                    described as the neck is occupied with a piston and cup <hi rend="italic">d,
                    d,</hi> in and on which the toe of the spindle works. On the nearer side of the
                    staple is a vertical pillar or <hi rend="italic">arbor e,</hi> the lower end of
                    which is inserted into the staple at the top of the shoulder; the upper end
                    passes through a top-plate <hi rend="italic">f</hi> which being screwed on by
                    the upper part of the staple, holds it firmly. The extreme upper end of the
                    arbor being hexagonal, receives a head <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> which is in fact a lever of some inches length; this head is
                    connected by a <hi rend="italic">coupling bαrh,</hi> to a similar lever or head
                    into which the upper end of the spindle is inserted.</p>
                <p>The bar or lever <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> by which the power is applied by the
                    workman, is inserted into the arbor, and not into the spindle, by which
                    ingenious contrivance, lst, the lever is in length the whole width of the press,
                    instead of half, and is, moreover, in a much better situation for the
                    application of the pressman’s strength; 2d, there is the additional lever of the
                    arbor-head; 3d, the additional lever of the spindle-head; and, lastly, the screw
                    itself may be so enlarged in diameter as to have immense increased power. The
                    platten is screwed on to the under surface of the piston; the table <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> has slides underneath, which move <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    the ribs <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> them, and is run in
                    and out by means of girths affixed to each end, and passing round a drum or
                    wheel o. As the platten is of considerable weight, the workman would have to
                    waste much strength in raising the platten from the form after the impression
                    has been given, were not a balance-weight <hi rend="italic">p</hi> suspended
                    upon a lever and hook at the back of the press, which counterbalances the weight
                    of the platten, raises it from the form, and brings the bar-handle back again,
                    ready for another pull. These are the principal parts of the ma-chincry<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193539655" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9655-0560"/> whereby the
                    impression is given, and are sufficient for the general reader, with the aid of
                    the engraving in Plate CCCCXV. For the printer there are yet other appliances.
                    At the right-hand end of the table is an iron frame <hi rend="italic">q,</hi>
                    moving freely upon pivots, so as to fall upon the table, or rise until stopped
                    by what is called the gallows <hi rend="italic">r;</hi> this is covered with
                    parchment very, tightly stretched, and is then called the tympan; upon the
                    tympan blankets are placed, which are covered by an inner tympan, and fastened
                    by hooks; the whole forming a solid yet elastic and yielding surface, admirably
                    fitted for impressing the paper upon the type (for this is its use), inasmuch as
                    the surface of the parchment is soft and without grain, and readily receives the
                    impression of the type, while the blankets give freely to every projection,
                    without retaining any indentation. To protect those portions of the paper which
                    are not destined to be coloured from ink or soil, there is at the upper end of
                    the tympan another iron frame, of much lighter make, and also moving upon
                    pivots, so as to fall upon the face of the tympan. This is covered with a sheet
                    of coarse paper, and the exact size and form of the pages are carefully cut out
                    therefrom, the parts left being an excellent protection of the paper under them.
                    This is called a frisket.</p>
                <p>Such is the ordinary Stanhope press. Since this was introduced many excellent
                    presses have been invented, and very extensively introduced; but this is so
                    simple, so easily kept in order, and so powerful, that it has never been
                    excelled; and being very intelligible, has been chosen for the illustration. The
                    manner of working is the same in all. A notice of the principle of various other
                    presses will be found in a subsequent part of this treatise.</p>
                <p>On the left front of the press stands the inking table. This is a table of
                    mahogany (which is best) or iron, about four feet high and three feet four
                    inches wide; at the back is a slightly elevated stage with a recess at each end,
                    in one of which is the ink, in the other stands the brayer or muller, by which
                    the ink is spread out in a thin layer upon the front of the stage.</p>
                <p>It must be fully understood that printers’ ink is a very different composition
                    from that used tor writing. It is of such consistency, that were a small portion
                    taken up between the finger and thumb, when they were opened it would produce a
                    thread of an inch or an inch and a half in length. Of all the materials used in
                    printing, this is the most important, and the most opposite qualities are
                    required in it. It must be of excellent colour. Formerly excellence of colour
                    was deemed to consist in an exceeding dark hue, not exactly black, but black
                    enriched with a hue of the darkest blue or purple. This gave indescribable
                    effect to the works for which it was used, a richness, a gorgeousness, which it
                    is impossible to describe; but the works of Baskerville and Bulmer, especially
                    the Milton of the latter, afford the best specimens. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>
                    we hold perfection to consist in the intensest black, and all the resources of
                    chemistry and the arts have been sought to attain this end. It must stand for
                    ever; but here we have miserably failed. Compare the productions of the old
                    printers with those of twenty years back. What a difference! The works of the
                    Aldi and Elzevirs, of Plantinus, Caxton, Pynson, and Grafton, preserve their
                    colour as intense as the day they were printed; there is no yellowness or
                    brownness, no foxiness, whilst the books of those of 1810-20 are wretchedly
                    discoloured. Where fine printing, however, has been required <hi rend="italic"
                    >and paid for,</hi> the modern ink is no whit inferior to the ancient. Witness
                    the beforementioned works of Bulmer, Macklin, Ritchie, Bowyer, Baskerville, and
                    others; but certain it is that the ink in general use twenty years ago was of
                    very inferior quality. It must be perfectly mixed, and ground until it is
                    absolutely impalpable, otherwise it will speedily clog the types and inking
                    apparatus; it must adhere to the paper, and not to the type, or it will tear
                    oft' the face of the former, and clog up the latter ∙, it must be sufficiently
                    thick; it must keep perfectly undried when in large masses, and dry very quickly
                    when it is distributed in thin surface. No printers of the present day make
                    their own ink, although some add ingredients which they believe to improve the
                    colour or quality. It is an especial business, and, by the aid of machinery,
                    capital, and exclusive attention to the manufacture, the ink now supplied is
                    admirable in the qualities of thorough mixing and grinding, drying, blackness,
                    &amp;c.; but whether it will stand the test of time, time alone can show. It is
                    an expensive article, the commonest book-ink being one shilling and sixpence per
                    pound, whilst the usual qualities are two shillings and sixpence, three
                    shillings, and four shillings per pound; those used for superior work are five
                    shillings and six shillings, and those for cuts as high as ten shillings, though
                    it is questionable whether, at the latter price, the consumer is not paying for
                    a mere name.</p>
                <p>Every manufacturer has, of course, his own secrets, both of ingredient and
                    process. The universal ingredient is the finest possible lamp-black; the great
                    secret probably consists in the manner in which, and the material from which,
                    this is made. There are vast buildings appropriated to the sole purpose of
                    burning oil, naphtha, spirits, coal-gas, &amp;c. to produce this black, which is
                    collected from the sides, ceilings, &amp;c. of the buildings. It is brought from
                    Germany and many other countries; and no expense is spared to get the most
                    superior quality. The next most important article is nut or linseed oil boiled
                    and burnt into a varnish; then oil of tuqjentine, &amp;c. The following receipts
                    have been given. The first is the method used by Baskerville and Bulmer, and
                    nothing can be better than the results.</p>
                <p>1. Fine old linseed oil boiled to a thick varnish, and cooled in small
                    quantities, three gallons; a small quantity of black or amber rosin dissolved
                    therein; the mixture then stands for some months, that all impurities may be
                    deposited; after which it is mixed with the finest lamp-black, and carefully
                    ground for use.</p>
                <p>2. One hundred pounds of nut or linseed oil are reduced by boiling and burning
                    one tenth or one eighth of its bulk, and to the thickness of a syrup; two pounds
                    of coarse bread and several onions being thrown in to purify it from grease.
                    Thirty or thirty-five pounds of turpentine are boiled apart, until, on cooling
                    it on paper, it breaks clean, without pulverising. The former is poured nearly
                    cold into the latter, and well mixed. The compound is then boiled again.
                    Lamp-black is next thoroughly mixed with it, in quantity according to the ink
                    required, and being well ground, the ink is then ready for use. .Some add
                    indigo, some Prussian blue, which considerably improves the colour; but these
                    inks are so difficult to work, and so clog up the type, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">improvement</hi> is better let alone. The turpentine is added to
                    give greater varnish, and improve the drying quality; but if the oil be old and
                    fine, the quantity required is proportionally less.</p>
                <p>3. Mr Savage, an admirable artist, denies that any ink can be depended on, of the
                    varnish of which oil is the basis; he therefore gives the following receipt
                    :—Balsam capi vi, 9 oz.; best lamp· black, 3 oz.; Prussian blue, l½ oz.; Indian
                    red, ∣- oz.; turpentine soap dried, 3 oz. This ink is of beautiful colour, but
                    appears to work foul. There can be no doubt, however, that the best and cheapest
                    plan is always to purchase what is required of a proper ink-maker.</p>
                <p>At the right front of the press stand the <hi rend="italic">bank</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">liorse.</hi> The bank is a deal table of some size; the horse is
                    an inclined plane which stands upon the bank; upon it is laid the white paper
                    prepared for working, which, when worked, is brought from the press to the bank.
                    There are two pressmen to each press, one of whom attends to the inking only, to
                    ascertain the excellence of which he turns, whenever he has a moment to spare,
                    to the worked sheets upon the bank, glancing his eye rapidly over each to see
                    that every part <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539668" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9668-0561"
                    />is of its proper colour, and that no picks, or other impressions, mar the
                    work; the other attends only to the press, and gives the impression. These men
                    are paid by every two hundred and fifty impressions, or by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >token.</hi> Thus, if the number be five hundred, and the price
                    fourpence-halfpenny per token, each man receives ninepence for the five hundred
                    impressions of each form, and the cost therefore is,</p>
                <p>First form, two men, two token, at 4½d Is. 6d.</p>
                <p>Second form, do. do. do Is. 6d.</p>
                <p>3s. 0d.</p>
                <p>The price necessarily varies with the size of the type and of the form; with the
                    quality of the paper and of the ink; with the number, and the care required.
                    Common work is fourpence-halfpenny, good sixpence, superior sevenpence, the very
                    best eightpence, ninepence, or even twelvepence per token.</p>
                <p>The pressmen, having received the forms after the final correction, lay the inner
                    form, or that one which contains the second page, upon the table of the press,
                    and secure it in the centre by quoins; one of them, in the meanwhile, pastes a
                    stout sheet of paper upon the frisket frame, and then secures it upon the
                    tympan. They then ink the form, and take an impression upon the frisket, and cut
                    away all the printed part, which therefore leaves so much of it as is necessary
                    to protect the paper from soil. The puller now carefully folds a sheet of the
                    paper according to the crosses of the chase, and laying it upon the form, opens
                    it carefully, by which the paper is made to lie evenly upon the form, with the
                    same margin with which it is to be afterwards worked. Having wetted the tympan,
                    the pressman closes it down upon the form, and takes an impression, when the
                    paper will be found to adhere to the tympan, and thus become a guide whereby to
                    lay all the subsequent sheets, and therefore much care should be taken to lay it
                    properly. They now choose their points, which are thin iron arms, having a short
                    point projecting from the end, and made to screw on to the tympan-frame, which
                    must be done in such a manner as that the points may fall in grooves in the
                    cross of the chase; because if they did not, they would be battered and broken
                    upon it at the first pull.</p>
                <p>The puller now brings his paper from the wetting-room; for before any good
                    impression can be taken the paper must have been damped, by rapidly passing it,
                    one fourth or one fifth of a quire at a time, through water, and then allowing
                    it to soak for two or three days, until it is evenly and thoroughly damp; and,
                    laying a ream upon the horse, he takes a sheet, and placing it carefully over
                    the tympan- ⅛heet, closes the frisket over it, shuts both tympan and frisket
                    down upon the form, which in the meanwhile his companion has inked (a process
                    that will be described below), runs the table in under the platten, pulls the
                    handle of the bar or lever over by his full weight, until brought up by the
                    stop, at which moment the platten descends and gives a powerful impression to
                    the tympan, &amp;c. upon the form, producing upon the paper a perfect fac-similé
                    in reverse of the surface of the latter. The pressman now gradually releases his
                    hold, the balance· weight raises the platten, the bar returns to its first
                    position, the table is run out, the tympan and frisket are raised by the
                    workman, and the frisket thrown up to the catch. The sheet is taken off the
                    points, which the impression has caused to pierce through it, and carefully
                    examined to ascertain that the impression is just and even, which is the great
                    test of the workman’s skill, and the excellence of the press. Invariably the
                    first impression is defective; the parchment may have been thicker in some parts
                    than in others, the blankets worn, or one of two founts of type may not have
                    been of equal height, in which respect “the estimation of a hair” would be a
                    monstrous fault, the thinnest possible tissue paper being quite sufficient for
                    remedy. The pressman proceeds to overlay, that is, to paste upon his
                    tympan-sheets portions of paper of the exact size of the defects, thicker or
                    thinner as may be required; or if the defect be great, he places a part of a
                    sheet of paper within his tympans. If there be any small portion of undue
                    prominence, or that “comes off hard,” he rubs away a portion of the tympan-sheet
                    with wet fingers, or cuts it away altogether. Having, as he supposes, remedied
                    all blemishes, he takes another impression, which he again examines with equal
                    closeness, and carefully removes every remaining defect by the same method;
                    having at length satisfied himself, and his master or overseer, the work is
                    proceeded with, the inker taking even portions of ink well distributed, and
                    covering the form equally, the puller taking a sheet, and laying it on the
                    tympan as before. They thus proceed until the whole number of the white paper is
                    worked off. The form is now lifted from the table, and carefully washed with a
                    very strong lye. The outer form is then laid on and made ready.</p>
                <p>This varies a little from the mode previously described. It has been stated that
                    the points penetrate the paper at the first impression. These holes and points
                    are the guides whereby perfect register is obtained; that is, whereby not only
                    the pages, but the lines, are made to fall exactly upon the back of each other,
                    a deficiency in which is a great fault in good book-work. The form, therefore,
                    having been placed in precisely the same place as the previous one occupied, one
                    of the sheets which have been printed on one side is taken and placed with the
                    face inwards, in such manner that the points pass through the same holes, but of
                    course the opposite way, and an impression is taken. If the pages do not back,
                    the points are shifted until they do; or if the defect be in the form, such
                    alterations are made in it as may be necessary. The impression is then brought
                    up as before, and when all is ready, a thin sheet of white paper, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">set-off</hi> sheet, is placed over the tympan-sheet and upon the
                    points. It must be remembered that one side has been worked, that the ink has
                    not yet dried, that the paper is still damp; therefore at every impression some
                    portion of the ink will be transferred to, or impressed upon, the set-off sheet.
                    When this has taken place in many impressions, the effect will be doubled; for
                    not only will some of the ink of the print be transferred to the setoff sheet,
                    but some, a very slight portion, of the set-off will be re-transferred to the
                    sheet working, producing a most unpleasing dirty appearance, very mystifying to
                    the eyes, and utterly destructive of beauty. The puller, therefore, after a few
                    impressions, moves the set-off sheet slightly, and when it has become very
                    dirty, discards it, and replaces it with another. The pressman should be very
                    attentive to this; and the master should not grudge ample supplies of set-off
                    paper, for it is not destroyed, but is very useful afterwards in other
                    departments as waste paper. The form is now lifted and carefully washed with
                    lye, and the two are sent to the composing-room, where they are again carefully
                    washed and rinsed, and are then ready for distribution. Two good pressmen are
                    supposed to do about one token, or 250 impressions, per hour, of fair work.
                    This, however, must depend entirely upon the quality of the work required; with
                    small type, stiff ink, and many rules, the work is more slow, and paid for
                    accordingly. The finest work is seldom paid for by the token, the pressmen being
                    placed upon weekly wages, and allowed as much time as they require, the rapidity
                    being at the discretion of the overseer. Frequently they are limited to a
                    certain number per hour, often as few as fifty, the most careful inspection
                    being given to every sheet by both pressmen, and continual attention by the
                    press-overseer and other chief persons in the establishment. In such work the
                    very best materials are employed. Instead of parchment, the tympans are covered
                    with fine calico, and even silk; instead of blankets the finest broad cloth,
                    picked blotting-paper for the thick overlays, the thinnest tissue <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539681" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9681-0562"/>paper for the finer. It will
                    readily be understood, that in all operations of the press-room, where
                    everything depends upon the skill of the workmen, there are infinite minutiae,
                    which it would be tedious, if it were even possible, to enumerate. Seven years
                    apprenticeship are not more than sufficient to educate a good pressman. It is
                    the accumulated labour of a life to make a first-rate one; and, after all,
                    excellence depends upon the native talent and ingenuity of the man himself.</p>
                <p>The ink is distributed over the type either by balls or by rollers. The rollers
                    are of modern use; the balls were, until a recent invention, sheep-skins with
                    the hair taken off with lime, made into a ball with wool, gathered at all
                    corners, and nailed upon a wooden handle. One of these was held in each hand;
                    and a small portion of ink being taken, they were well beaten upon the
                    inking-table, and then upon each other, until the ink was so evenly distributed
                    over the whole surface, that if touched gently with the finger, the prominent
                    lines of the skin would be perfectly blackened, whilst the channels would be
                    left perfectly clean. The balls were then beaten over every part of the type, so
                    that the whole surface should be evenly covered; an operation requiring much
                    skill and practice. The skins were prepared and softened by the nastiest
                    processes imaginable, which converted a press-room into a stinking cloaca.
                    Thanks, however, to the observation and ingenuity of Mr Donkin and Mr E. Cooper,
                    this has been entirely done away, and a press-room now almost regales the nose
                    with a warm scent of ink and paper, anything but unpleasant. This invention has
                    been of the greatest consequence to printing. The printing machine is popularly
                    said to be the great engine of modern literature; and so it is; but without
                    this, printing machines were mere old iron and brass. For many years the workmen
                    in the potteries had used a composition of glue and treacle for applying colours
                    to their ware. Mr Donkin observed that this composition possessed every
                    requisite for the use of the printing-office, and he immediately proceeded to
                    form balls of canvass, with a facing of composition. They answered admirably,
                    proved beautifully soft, distributed beautifully, kept clean, and were easily
                    washed and purified if soiled. Some opposition was offered by the workmen; but
                    their advantages proved so great that they were readily adopted by the masters,
                    and speedily drove away for ever the nasty skins. The next step, however, was
                    more important still. Mr Donkin bethought him, that if he could cast rollers of
                    composition, without seam and perfectly cylindrical, it could not fail to be of
                    infinite utility to machine-printing. It remained, however, for Mr Cooper to
                    suggest the substitution of them for balls at the common press. In this he
                    succeeded; but it is astonishing how much difficulty there was in persuading’the
                    men to lay aside their old habits. They could not conceive that a
                    straightforward rolling would answer the purpose of their laborious and careful
                    beating. The rollers were nicknamed “rolling-pins,” but they made their way, and
                    are now in general use. They consist of a wooden cylinder, with a thick coating
                    of composition cast perfectly true; through the middle of the cylinder passes an
                    irorrrod attached to a curved bar passing over the roller, upon which are two
                    handles; and the roller revolves freely upon the rod. The pressman having brayed
                    out a narrow line of ink upon the raised stage of the inking-table (or upon a
                    distributing roller which runs the whole length of the table, and, being turned,
                    presents a line of ink to the inking-roller), takes a portion of this upon the
                    composition, and distributes it carefully upon the table until the entire face
                    is evenly covered, and then rolls the form, taking care that the whole surface
                    receives its due proportion. If he does this lightly and steadily there is no
                    fear of the result; he cannot in rolling overlook any part; but it nevertheless
                    requires some judgment. If there be any heavy titles or large type, he must roll
                    that portion several times; if there be blank pages, he must take care that the
                    roller does not sink, and so leave the pages in line with it slightly touched.
                    The chiefest judgment, however, is displayed in choosing the exact quantity of
                    ink required for the form. If the type be small, the quantity taken must be
                    small; it must be very carefully distributed, and the form rolled many times;
                    for if the quantity be too great the type will become clogged, and if too
                    little, the colour will become faint. The pressman must from time to time
                    examine the sheets as they are printed, turning up the corners of the sheets
                    that he may see whether the colour corresponds to that of the side first worked,
                    and detecting with quick eye every defect; and he must be particularly careful
                    that for every sheet of the same work he take the very same quantity of ink,
                    that the book when bound may present an even and beautiful colour, every bold
                    line being perfectly covered, and yet every fine stroke clear and distinct. This
                    can only be effected by careful distribution and repeated rolling, with exact
                    judgment as to the quantity of colour to be taken.</p>
                <p>The sheet having been thus worked off, the printed paper is taken away by the
                    warehouseman, and hung by the boys upon poles stretched under the ceiling, by
                    means of a peel, which is a handle with a broad end, upon which a quire or two
                    is hung at a time, thence transferred to the poles, and distributed in portions
                    of four or five sheets. Here they hang a day or two, until the ink and paper are
                    perfectly dry. This should be a gradual process, for if by artificial heat the
                    drying is hurried, a skin will be formed upon the surface of the ink, which will
                    prevent that underneath from drying; the work will look very well until it is
                    pressed or bound, when the skin breaks, the ink spreads, and the sharpness of
                    the letter is entirely destroyed. When perfectly dry they are taken down and
                    laid in heaps upon the gathering board, each signature separately; thus, first,
                    a heap, say 1000, of B, then C, D, E, F, and, lastly, the title-sheet A. The
                    boys then take one sheet from each heap; consequently, when they have got to the
                    last signature, each boy has one complete copy of the work. These are laid upon
                    one another in such a manner that each book is perfectly distinct. The
                    warehouseman then takes a collator (a needle inserted in a handle) and goes over
                    the whole with great rapidity, ascertaining that no sheet has been carelessly
                    omitted, and that no two of the same sheet have been taken. The books are then
                    folded down the middle, counted out in tens, thirteens, or twenty-fives, and
                    tied up in fifties. The process of printing is thus complete, and the work is
                    ready for the binder.</p>
                <p>Works of finer description, indeed most works of the present day, are submitted
                    to another process after they have been taken down from the poles, viz. hot or
                    cold pressing, which very much improves their appearance. In cold pressing the
                    sheets are placed one by one between glazed boards, or sheets of coarse material
                    pressed until there is a perfect glaze upon both surfaces. The heaps are then
                    placed in an hydraulic press, with cold iron plates at small distances, and the
                    whole is subjected to considerable pressure for some hours; they are then taken
                    out and the sheets extracted from the boards, when the indentations consequent
                    upon the working will have been all pressed out, the roughnesses of the paper
                    smoothed out, a slight gloss given to the ink, and the whole will present a very
                    agreeable smoothness to the eye and the touch. Hot-pressing is used when the
                    paper is very stout and the ink strong. The sole difference is, that the iron
                    plates are heated until they can hardly be touched. The effect is much greater
                    than that of cold pressing; the whole surface of the paper is perfectly glazed,
                    and the ink absolutely shines; but the effect is not so agreeable to the eye; it
                    is too glossy. As these processes also make the books lie perfectly flat, they
                    render great beating by the binder unnecessary, doing away with the danger of
                    such beating causing the ink to set off upon the opposite pages, which danger,
                    should it from circumstances prove necessary to beat the book much, is
                    considerably diminish <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539694"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9694-0563"/>ed, as the pressing sets the ink very effectually.
                    The glazed boards must be often cleaned by rubbing with waste paper, or they
                    will dirty the sheets placed between them. Every printing-office of credit
                    should have an hydraulic press and boards; for it is incredible how much
                    smartness pressing gives to the work, and how greatly the warehouse work is
                    facilitated by the readiness with which the hydraulic is pumped up, and by its
                    great power. A press of eight-inch ram will be found sufficient for most
                    purposes; but where much hot and cold pressing are required, one of nine-inch
                    ram will prove cheapest, because, from its immense power, a few hours arc
                    sufficient to give the requisite surface, and the press may therefore be filled
                    twice a day.</p>
                <p>Wood-blocks are very often worked with the common type. The block, having been
                    carefully reduced by the engraver to the exact height of the type, is placed in
                    the composing-stick, and justified to the width of the page; it is then made up
                    along with the other matter in its proper place. When laid upon the press for
                    working, and an impression of the form has been taken, the pressman examines
                    with great minuteness whether it stands well with the type; if not, the form is
                    unlocked, and paper placed under it if it be too low, or under any corner that
                    may be lower than the rest; if the block be too high it must be scraped or filed
                    at the bottom. Anciently the artist in wood contented himself with producing his
                    lights and shades by cutting his lines in greater or less degrees of fineness
                    upon a plane, leaving to the printer the task of producing the required effects
                    by a tedious process of overlaying; but since the introduction of machines, in
                    which such method is impracticable, from the nature of the impression, and from
                    the immense loss consequent upon the machine standings till whilst the cut is in
                    preparation, several eminent engravers have turned their attention to the
                    subject, and have succeeded in a method of so cutting away the block that it is
                    put into the printer’s hands in a great measure prepared. Notwithstanding this
                    vast improvement, the pressman has much to do; he is to a certain extent an
                    artist, and must have a good eye for perspective, and for the proper adjustment
                    of tints. These effects he produces by careful and skilful overlaying. The cut
                    may then be worked with the type without any other care than that of keeping it
                    clear from clogging or picks. When done with, it must be very carefully cleaned
                    with spirits of turpentine and a brush.</p>
                <p>The working of wood-cuts by themselves as illustrations of works, differs from
                    type-printing in no other respect than the superior materials and skill
                    required. The wood-cut must be imposed in a chase, and locked up upon the table
                    of the press, which is generally a smaller one than that used for ordinary
                    printing, of most excellent construction, and in good order. The tympans are
                    often of silk or cambric.</p>
                <p>There are in London, and probably in the larger provincial cities, parties who
                    make an especial business of the manufacture of composition balls and rollers,
                    which they supply to printers upon payment of a rent. The skill and experience
                    of these persons enable them, as must be the case in every instance where a
                    manufacture engages exclusive attention, to supply a much better and cheaper
                    article than could be manufactured by any individual whose engagements are
                    varied; consequently there are not many printers, either in town or country, who
                    do not avail themselves of these opportunities. The rent is paid for each roller
                    required, and by the quarter; that is to say, if a printer employs six presses,
                    and consequently six rollers, he pays for six rollers, the manufacturer engaging
                    to supply him with as many changes as he may require from their getting out of
                    order or being injured; in fact, to keep him supplied with six rollers in good
                    condition. The rent for a common press-roller is the moderate sum of six
                    shillings per quarter; they are sent into the country in boxes fitted for the
                    purpose. There are, of course, situations in which it is not easy to obtain a
                    regular supply of the necessary article, and in this case the printer may very
                    easily make them for himself; but the expense of the utensils is so great as to
                    exceed the usual rent for years. They consist of the following: For rollers, a
                    hollow cylinder of brass, the bore of which must be most accurately turned and
                    well polished; this mould consists of two semi-cylinders closely fitted and
                    brought into contact by screws along the sides and collars at the end, and a
                    head is made to fit into the lower end. The core, a wooden cylinder, upon which
                    the composition is cast, is held in the centre of the bore by means of a star,
                    through the radii of which the composition flows. For balls are required a
                    concave mirror of about half an inch cavity, and a board of the same size, and
                    of a quarter of an inch in convexity. A kettle for melting and mixing the
                    composition is also required. This is made double like a glue-pot, fitting
                    exceedingly close, and with a small orifice for the escape of the steam from the
                    hot water between the two; and the inner vessel should have a large lip. The
                    recipes for making the composition vary, and this appears to arise from the diff
                    erent circumstances under which it is made. The ingredients are but three, and
                    these easily purchaseable, viz. fine glue, treacle, not that procured from the
                    bakers, which is adulterated, but the best from the sugar-refiners, and a small
                    quantity of carbonate of barytes, called in commerce Paris white. The first two
                    are quite sufficient with a little skill. The following are good recipes.</p>
                <p>1. Two pounds of glue to one pound of treacle.</p>
                <p>2. Two pounds of glue to three pounds of treacle.</p>
                <p>3. One pound of glue to three pounds of treacle and a quarter of a pound of Paris
                    white.</p>
                <p>Soak the glue in water until it is soft; then place it in the inner vessel, and
                    boil quickly, until the glue is thoroughly dissolved; add the treacle, mixing it
                    well, and let it boil for an hour or more; then sift in the Paris white, but do
                    not stir it violently, or the mixture will be full of airbubbles, which are
                    destructive to the roller or ball. Rub the mould slightly with a rag dipped in
                    thin oil, taking care that no globules and streaks remain upon the surface. When
                    the mixture is ready, pour it gently between the radii of the star, so that no
                    air be detained within the cylinder until the mould be filled; allow it to set,
                    and then take it from the mould, cutting off the superfluous portion with a
                    string. When the roller has been hung up twenty-four hours it will be fit for
                    use. In making balls, having oiled the mirror, pour the composition upon the
                    centre, and having allowed it to spread itself lay over it a piece of coarse
                    canvass, place the board upon it, and lay weights upon it to press it down; it
                    will consequently be found that the composition face of the ball will be
                    slightly thicker in the centre than at the edges, which, besides being a
                    convenience in the working, will allow it to be <hi rend="italic">knocked
                    up</hi> with much facility, which is done in the ordinary manner. These balls
                    and rollers are very easily kept in order; if they are too soft, cold water will
                    harden them; if too hard, warm water will soften them. When not in use they
                    should be covered with refuse ink, and hung up in a room of even temperature,
                    and carefully scraped with a palette-knife before use. They should not be
                    cleaned with spirits of turpentine, as that will give them a hard surface. These
                    rollers will be fit for use for a long while if attention be paid to them; and
                    when spoiled, the composition may be repeatedly melted down, and, with an
                    addition of new materials, will make as good rollers as before. When the proper
                    apparatus is wanting, small balls for wood-cuts or single pages may be made upon
                    an earthen palette, or even upon a smooth dinner-plate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stereotyping.</hi></p>
                <p>Stereotyping is a mode of making perfect fac-similés in type-metal of the face of
                    pages composed of moveable types.</p>

                <p>Letter-press printing being a very expensive process, the 1 price of books
                    consequently high, and the heaviest expense ι consisting in the composition, the
                    printers of the Continent ∣ very soon set up the entire of such small works as
                    were in constant demand, and thus were enabled to sell them at: little more than
                    the cost of paper and press-work. Some <hi rend="smallcaps">í</hi> works of very
                    great extent, especially Bibles and prayerbooks, were kept standing by the
                    privileged printers. This, ι however, was exceedingly expensive, as the cost of
                    type; would be enormous; the forms would occupy vast store- 1 rooms, and be
                    liable to continual damage, both from the accidental dropping of letters, from
                    batters, and other accidents to which they would be unavoidably liable. Some
                    method, therefore, by which all or some of these disadvantages might be
                    remedied, was sought after with great anxiety. About the beginning of the
                    eighteenth century, Van der Mey, in Holland, sought to avoid this liability to
                    accidents, by immersing the bottom of his pages in melted lead or solder, and
                    thus rendering them solid masses: “c’est ιme reunion des caractères ordinaires
                    par le pied, avec de la matière fondue, de l’épaisseur d’environ trois mains de
                    papier à écrire ;” therefore the mass together would be of somewhat less than
                    the height of our type. It is not very easy to guess how they contrived to make
                    the backs of these blocks of such evenness as to produce anything like a good
                    impression; but Dibdin says that the book is very handsome. The same process was
                    followed by a Jew of Amsterdam, in printing an English Bible; but he was utterly
                    ruined by his speculation.</p>
                <p>Some time before the year 1735, there is sufficient evidence that the French used
                    casts of the calendars placed before church-books. These plates are thus
                    described by Camus: “It (one of the plates) is formed of copper, and is three
                    inches and a half long by two inches broad and one seventh of an inch thick.
                    From the roughness of the casting, it has evidently been made in a mould formed
                    of sand or clay.” After the plate had been cast, the back of it had been dressed
                    with a file, in order that it might bear equally upon a block of wood to which
                    it had been attached.</p>
                <p>Who really invented the art of stereotyping as at present practised (and, after
                    all, he who finds out the efficient <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">operandi</hi> is the inventor of the art, though he may not be of
                    the principle), is, like the inventor of the parent art, a matter of some
                    controversy, which has been carried on with more vigour than the subject
                    merited. It seems however most probable, when all assertions are weighed, that
                    William Ged, a goldsmith of Edinburgh, deserves the credit; thus exhibiting a
                    singular coincidence with Fust. According to his statement, being in 1725 in
                    company with a printer, they lamented the want of a good letter-founder in
                    Scotland; and the printer asked him whether he could do anything to remedy the
                    defect. He immediately answered, that it would be more easy to cast plates from
                    pages when composed in moveable type; and he undertook to produce, and very
                    shortly did so, a specimen of his new plan, and not long afterwards made
                    arrangements with a capitalist to advance the requisite funds. The latter
                    failing to perform his part, Ged made a similar contract with a London
                    stationer, in conjunction with whom he made many attempts; but being repeatedly
                    thwarted, he parted from his partner, and made proposals to the universities and
                    the king’s printers to stereotype Bibles and prayer-books. These all entered
                    into the scheme with some eagerness, and some works were produced quite equal to
                    the ordinary printing of the day. Nevertheless, so much ignorance and prejudice
                    prevailed amongst the workmen, and others interested, as they imagined, in the
                    old system, that the undertaking was soon abandoned, and Ged entered into
                    several subsequent arrangements, in which he was equally unsuccessful; a
                    type-foùnder, in particular, causing such obstructions that the art made no
                    progress. Ged died, therefore, before he had met with any encouragement; nor did
                    his son succeed better, although, as the practicability was made more manifest,
                    the very parties who had rejected his plans subsequently made extensive use of
                    his plates. What was Ged’s method of stereotyping is unknown, as he kept it
                    private; nor did his partners fully participate in the secret.</p>
                <p>Fifty years afterwards, Mr Tilloch made a similar invention; but, from private
                    circumstances, the design was laid aside, not however before several volumes had
                    been printed from his stereotype plates at the press of Mr Foulis. Some years
                    after this Lord Stanhope engaged an ingenious London printer, Mr Wilson, to
                    prosecute the invention; and after many trials, the noble lord’s ingenuity
                    succeeded in bringing the art into perfect use.</p>
                <p>When a work is expressly intended for stereotyping, the type used should be
                    somewhat different from that commonly employed. The letter should be cast
                    without any shoulder, but should rise in a straight line from the foot; the
                    spaces, quadrats, and leads should be of the same height as the stem of the
                    letter, because the less the cavities in the page, the less chance there is of
                    any of the mould breaking off and remaining in the form. The page having been
                    composed in the ordinary manner, and very carefully corrected, is imposed in a
                    small chase with metal furniture, and the whole is placed within a moulding
                    frame, somewhat less than half an inch higher than the type. The surface of the
                    type is then rubbed with a soft brush holding a small quantity of very thin
                    oil.</p>
                <p>The plaster of which the mould is formed is the common material of which statues
                    and busts are cast; it should be of two degrees of fineness, and may be easily
                    purchased ready prepared. These having been carefully mixed, a small portion of
                    the finer quality is gently poured upon the surface of the page, and softly
                    worked in with a brush, care being taken that every portion is fully covered,
                    and that no air-bubbles remain in any part of the letters. Immediately a larger
                    quantity of the coarser plaster is poured on and spread over the previous layer
                    without disturbing it; a straightedge is then passed over the moulding-frame,
                    clearing away the superfluous plaster, and leaving that within the frame of
                    uniform thickness. It is then left to set. When sufficiently dry, the moulding
                    frame is raised, and the mould with it; the mould is then dressed, and placed in
                    an oven until it be perfectly dry, and raised to an adequate temperature for the
                    casting. The oil with which the page is rubbed prevents the plaster from
                    adhering to the type.</p>
                <p>The melting-pot is a square vessel of iron about two inches and a half deep,
                    having a separate lid, of which the four corners are cut off, the inner face
                    being carefully turned, the outer face turned hollow towards the centre. A
                    floating plate, of which the upper surface is turned, is placed at the bottom of
                    the pot. Over the melting-pit is a crane with a rack, upon which a pair of
                    nippers are made to run. These lay hold of ears upon the melting-pot, closing
                    with its weight, and opening when relieved. The metal does not differ from
                    type-metal, and must be sufficiently fluxed to flow easily, but not made too
                    hot, or it will prove brittle. The melting-pot having been heated in the same
                    oven with the mould, and consequently to the same temperature, the latter is
                    placed within it, the face being turned down upon the floatingplate. A bar or
                    other piece of iron is screwed down upon that part of the lid which is turned
                    hollow; and the whole being suspended by the rack and crane, is swung over the
                    melting-pit, and gradually let down into the metal, which flows gently into the
                    pot through the openings left at the corners. The metal flowing slowly in
                    gradually expels all the air; the mould immediately rises to the inner surface
                    of the lid; the floating-plate, being specifically lighter than the metal, rises
                    also to the edge of the mould; consequently the metal which has run in between
                    is of the exact thickness of the depth of the mould, the upper surface being the
                    field <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539720" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9720-0565"/>upon
                    which are the casts of the type, the under surface the smooth face of the
                    floating-plate, and the rest of the melting-pot being filled with metal. The pot
                    is allowed to remain immersed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, that is,
                    until the air is supposed to be perfectly expelled. The pot is then drawn up,
                    and swung to a board resting upon a trough of water, and there allowed to cool.
                    The cooling is a process requiring much care and attention. It is obvious, that
                    unless the whole mass cool equally, the plate will be warped, and consequently
                    spoiled; it is equally clear that the heat will more readily radiate at the
                    corners, and consequently that the centre will remain fluid after the other
                    parts are set, and that the contraction must be unequal. This is provided
                    against by the lid having been turned hollow in the centre, and it will
                    therefore allow the metal under it to cool more rapidly. The mass having been
                    turned out from the pot, the metal under the plate is separated by a smart blow
                    or two of the mallet; the floating-plate will be readily disengaged, and the
                    mould be removed from the cast. Some defects will invariably be found in the new
                    plate; but these are removed by the picker, who goes carefully over it, clearing
                    away the picks from the face of the letter, and deepening the larger white lines
                    with a graver, that they may not blacken in working at press; for it must be
                    remembered, that the quadrats and spaces used in stereotyping are higher than
                    those in moveable-type printing. If the face of the plate has cooled evenly, and
                    it is in other respects a successful cast, it is placed, the face inwards, in a
                    turning lathe, and the back rendered a plane parallel to the face; the margins
                    are then squared, and the edges flanched. The plate is now ready for use.</p>
                <p>A great improvement in the stereotype art was a few years ago introduced by Mr
                    Thomas Allan, printer in Edinburgh, into his establishment, by which a number of
                    plates are cast at once, whilst the risk of broken casts is considerably
                    lessened. This is effected by means of a pot sufficiently deep to contain moulds
                    placed in a perpendicular position. The pot is an oblong square cast-iron box,
                    widening towards the mouth, and having placed inside, at each end, a wedge-like
                    block, of which one face is parallel to the side, while the other is perfectly
                    vertical. On the vertical side are perpendicular grooves, at distances rather
                    greater than the thickness of the stereotype moulds. Into these grooves are
                    inserted plates of malleable iron, by which the interior of the box or pot is
                    partitioned into spaces sufficiently wide to admit with ease the plaster moulds.
                    The moulds, when baked, being inserted into these spaces, a cross bar of metal
                    is placed over the top, instead of a cover, which serves to prevent the moulds
                    from being raised by the liquid metal flowing beneath them; and it is then
                    suspended upon the crane, and dipt into the metal-pit in the usual way. By this
                    method not only are the moulds saved from all risk of breaking by being placed
                    horizontally and pressed between the two broad surfaces of a float-block and
                    cover, as in the method of single-page casting, but a number of plates are
                    produced at one cast, and thus additional celerity is combined with greater
                    certainty of sound plates. The plates of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica,</hi> which is the most extensive work ever stereotyped, have been
                    for the most part produced by this process, in pots containing each five moulds;
                    and it is especially advantageous for large plates, the risk of breakage by the
                    old method increasing in a greater ratio than the increase in the size of the
                    page.</p>
                <p>The plates are sometimes mounted upon blocks of mahogany, the height of which is
                    the difference between the thickness of the plate and the height of the type.
                    These blocks are furnished with brass sides, the upper part of which is turned
                    over so as to take hold of the flange of the plate. Many attempts have been made
                    to accommodate these blocks to the varying sizes of the plates, by forming them
                    in portions; but, where much stereotyping is done, the plates are usually cast
                    to uniform sizes, corresponding blocks being kept ready for use. An ingenious
                    plan has been devised to remedy this inconvenience, by a series of hollow
                    squares of type-metal of the requisite height and of different sizes, by means
                    of which pages may be easily composed to any required size, from one pica m
                    upwards; the plates being fastened on by brass holders. At a small expense once
                    incurred, the stereotype printer may furnish himself for ever.</p>
                <p>There are many smaller instruments requisite, which it is quite unnecessary to
                    mention. The founder requires some practical skill, which, however, it is not
                    difficult to acquire. The excellence of the casts will depend upon the personal
                    knack and observation of the founder. The metal for stereotyping is generally
                    purchased prepared for use, in preference to melting down old type, the
                    type-founders allowing much more for it in exchange than the metal can be
                    purchased for. The price of prepared metal is about 40s. per cwt. The following,
                    however, are proportions which may be used when the prepared metal cannot be
                    procured :—</p>
                <p>1. From five to eight parts lead, one of regulus, one fiftieth of block-tin.</p>
                <p>2. One seventh of pure regulus, six sevenths of lead. The best lead is that which
                    comes from China, in the lining of tea-chests.</p>
                <p>The mixing of the lead is exceedingly injurious to the workman, and should be
                    avoided wherever it is possible. The foundry should be thoroughly ventilated, as
                    the fumes from the melting-pit, and the moisture and smell of the drying oven,
                    are very noxious.</p>
                <p>An extravagant notion prevails, especially amongst persons not experienced in the
                    mysteries of printing, of the exceeding economy of stereotyping; it would
                    therefore be of advantage to give a fair view of the case. On an average, the
                    cost of stereotyping may be taken as the same as that of composition, or even
                    higher. It is quite clear, therefore, that if the first edition of a work is
                    stereotyped, the speculator at once incurs the expense of <hi rend="italic"
                    >printing</hi> two editions, minus the press-work. The consequence is, that if
                    his untried book does not succeed, he very much increases his loss, or at best
                    he increases his chance of loss, because many books that just get through a
                    first edition never arrive at a second. Therefore the first edition of a work
                    should never be stereotyped, unless indeed the work be of such a nature as to
                    insure a general sale at a low price, as, for instance, Ready Reckoners, Tables
                    of Interest, and such like. Again, what work is there so perfect as not to
                    require some alteration and amendment in a new edition, which, in stereotype, is
                    practicable only to a limited extent. Supposing, next, that the great demand for
                    a work is ascertained, that the matter is sufficiently corrected to require no
                    farther alteration, and that the work has been stereotyped; the owner must wait
                    until the copies printed from the types from which the casting has been made are
                    sold, before he has occasion to make use of his plates. On the one hand, suppose
                    that he print sufficient for four years consumption; and on the other,
                    sufficient for one year at the same rate. The account will stand thus :—</p>

                    produce of overplus copies, which would be proportionately greater in type.</p>
                <p>If the type be small, and the composition expensive, it would be considerably in
                    favour of stereotype; but on the <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi> would be the
                    greater wear and damage of the plates.</p>
                <p>Such is a fair statement of the pecuniary profit and loss of type and stereotype;
                    but there are other considerations. Every edition from the plates must be in the
                    same type, without any of the improvements that skill or fashion may require;
                    whereas every edition from type may be varied to the taste of the day, and any
                    defects in composition or making up remedied. Every edition from the plates must
                    also get progressively worse and worse. It is asserted that no injury can accrue
                    to the plates, but the fact is precisely the reverse; for these plates are
                    particularly liable to injury, from their weight and brittleness, from blows,
                    from picks and batters, which will happen notwithstanding the greatest care,
                    from fractures at the edges in placing on the blocks or raisers, and many other
                    fortuitous circumstances. These it is difficult to remedy, and, when remedied,
                    they present a most unsightly appearance, sometimes from the same fount not
                    being at hand, or sent to the melting-pot (and great changes occur in the types
                    of a printing-office in the course of eight years), sometimes from the new
                    letters not standing of the same height, which is a common fault, and always
                    from their not standing in line. Again, printing from plates never looks so well
                    as that from type; and the most inex perienced eye may instantly detect the
                    difference, even in the first edition.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, in some cases stereotyping is of great advantage; but chiefly in
                    books of numbers, in which it is of the utmost importance that every figure
                    should be correct. In this case the proofs must be read again and again, until
                    the correctness is unquestionable, then stereotyped; and there is no fear of
                    alteration from the error of compositors or carelessness of readers, but the
                    book remains the same for ever. Such works also are most expensive in getting
                    up, and the cost of composition very much exceeds that of stereotyping. Books of
                    logarithms may be especially mentioned, tables of longitude, indexes to maps,
                    and other works, which, being once written, remain unchangeably the same: or
                    where it is found expedient to have duplicates of the work, as when immense
                    numbers are required, and it is necessary, for speed, to work on double-sized
                    paper; such, for instance, is the Penny Magazine, from which, when once
                    composed, a cast is taken, and the original and cast are worked side by side at
                    the same moment, producing two copies instead of one, in which case there is
                    another advantage, for the casting does not exceed the cost of composition, and,
                    when worked, the stereotype remains without further expense for another edition:
                    again, where it is expedient to send duplicate plates to a distance to be
                    worked, thereby saving the expense of carriage, and some time; as in the Penny
                    Magazine, where several casts are taken, and one sent to America, another to
                    Germany, &amp;c.; in Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal, where one cast is worked at
                    Edinburgh, and another in London; in Richardson’s Dictionary, where one cast is
                    used by the London publisher, and another in the United States.</p>
                <p>Wood-cuts may be stereotyped with great advantage, for a small cut which has cost
                    several guineas to engrave may be multiplied indefinitely, and that at a cost of
                    a few shillings.</p>
                <p>No printer should stereotype who wishes his type to be a credit to his house. The
                    wear of material in casting is miserable; the gypsum is at best a fine powder,
                    and grinds away the edge and face of the letter when rubbed in with the brush in
                    a frightful manner. The letter can never be entirely freed from the plaster, and
                    will present a very dirty appearance ever after. The wear of a fount of 1000
                    lbs. weight, returned six times from the foundry, is greater than would occur in
                    six years’ constant fair usage; besides which, the high spaces, quadrats, and
                    leads, are all extra expenses, for which the economical bookseller makes no
                    remuneration whatever.</p>
                <p>School-books are most frequently stereotyped, in ordinary cases with the
                    advantages and drawbacks above related. Suppose, however, a Spelling Book or
                    Primer, say Guy’s, selling from forty to fifty thousand copies yearly, in which
                    it might be supposed that stereotype would be of infinite advantage. For such a
                    book, stereotype plates would not last, even in decent condition, four years.
                    Calculate the cost, without interest, the money being constantly returned.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Polytypage.</hi></p>
                <p>The ingenuity of our lively neighbours the French has been excited for nearly a
                    century in devising a speedy and cheap mode of making solid plates, either in
                    sequence or in substitution of moveable type. Many considerable improvements in
                    stereotyping are to be ascribed to these artists; but stereotyping has never
                    been a favourite with them, and they have rather exerted their invention in a
                    series of experiments, which may be classed under the general name of
                    polytypage.</p>
                <p>The first experiment noticeable is that of Dr Franklin and Μ. Rochon; but
                    although curious, it is not polytypage in the common meaning, or the art of
                    producing letters in relief. But it is very ingenious, and is the first step in
                    that art. Franklin made an exceedingly glutinous ink, with which he wrote upon
                    thin paper, in the ordinary manner, but rather coarsely. This writing he
                    powdered with pounded emery or iron filings, and it was then placed between two
                    plates, of which the lower one was exceedingly hard, and the upper one extremely
                    soft. These were then passed between a rolling press, when the iron-filings or
                    emery sunk into the softer plate, from which impressions might be taken in the
                    manner of copperplate printing. The effect, as may be supposed, was exceedingly
                    rough and unsightly. Μ. Rochon then proposed to write with a steel point upon a
                    prepared plate, and bite in the tracing; this would give impressions in reverse,
                    which, whilst the ink was yet fresh, were to be pressed strongly between clean
                    paper, the setoff upon which would be fit for use. By this unskilful means
                    Roehon says many private works were circulated; hut it is rather doubtful. Μ.
                    Roehon next undertook a much more likely project, the stamping of punches,
                    somewhat like types, into soft metal, in the same order and with as much
                    rapidity as they are composed in ordinary printing, with mechanical contrivances
                    to make the impressions stand well, and also to insure the even depression of
                    every letter. These stamped plates were originally intended to be printed by the
                    rolling press; but afterwards the scheme was entertained of taking a cast from
                    the plate in type-metal, and printing from that. It does not appear that this
                    idea was brought into practice.</p>
                <p>In 1780, Hoffman, a German, residing in France, brought stereotyping to
                    considerable height; but, not satisfied with his success, he made many ingenious
                    efforts in polytypage. He first used Rochon’s method; and whilst he was thus
                    engaged, a practical printer, named Carez, started a new method, which Hoffman
                    afterwards pursued. The page, after being composed in the ordinary manner, was
                    attached, with the face downwards, to the upder side of a heavy block of w bod,
                    suspended from a long beam. Immediately under the page was an anvil, on which
                    was a tray of oiled paper, into which the workman poured a portion of melted
                    lead, attentively watching the cooling. When the metal seemed on the point of
                    setting, the page, block, and beam, were brought down with a very smart blow,
                    forcing the face of the type into the cooling metal, and producing a very sharp
                    mould; which again was made to take the place of the type upon the block, was
                    struck in a similar manner upon fused metal, and would thus, as was said,
                    produce a perfect and excellent stereotype plate, which, having been properly
                    dressed at the edges and back, was affixed to the usual wooden raiser; nor does
                    there seem any reason why more than one east might not be made from the same
                    mould. Carez appears to have practised this art to some extent, and
                    successfully.</p>
                <p>Hoffman was no doubt acquainted with this invention, for his next scheme was a
                    modification of it. In order to avoid the expense of composition, he prepared a
                    series of punches, consisting as well of single letters as of common French
                    terminations, which, with a very ingenious instrument, he pressed into a thin
                    layer of prepared clay; and this, when baked, he stamped upon a portion of fused
                    metal, in Carez’s manner, producing a stereotype plate. It must be quite evident
                    that in practice this could never answer, because the lining of the letters, and
                    the exact plane of the surface, cannot possibly be achieved with that nicety
                    which is indispensable in-printing. Unfortunately, also, the expense and trouble
                    of stamping in the punches separately must be considerably greater than that of
                    composing types, even were it practicable, which it does not seem to be.</p>
                <p>In 1791, Μ. Gegembre printed the fifty sous notes of the Caisse Patriotique upon
                    an improved plan. He caused the whole print of the notes to be engraved in
                    relief upon a plate of steel, the letters and ornaments being run together in a
                    manner impracticable with separate punches; and this engraving he pressed into a
                    plate of alloyed copper, from which stereotyped easts were taken by Carez’s
                    process. Any number of these casts could be taken from the copper mould, as
                    indeed was necessary, since, from the softness of the metal, they were rapidly
                    worn out; and if by chance the copper mould became injured, a new one could be
                    readily made from the steel engraving.</p>
                <p>When the revolutionary government commenced issuing assignats, it became
                    necessary to have an immense number of plates to work the enormous quantity of
                    these documents required. A design having been approved of, artists were
                    employed to engrave <hi rend="italic">three hundred</hi> fac-similés. Of course,
                    if three hundred so-called fac-similés could be engraved, there could be no
                    difficulty to other artists in engraving another hundred, nor could even the
                    bank-officers tell which was a forged fac-similé and which were engraved by
                    their authority. The consequence was utter want of confidence in the government
                    paper. To remedy this, the committee of assignats caused many experiments to be
                    instituted for the production of plates which should be not only imitative and
                    similar, but <hi rend="italic">pro re</hi> identical. The plan adopted was the
                    engraving a plate <hi rend="italic">in intaglio,</hi> from which copper punches
                    were obtained <hi rend="italic">in relief,</hi> and called <hi rend="italic"
                    >mother -punches.</hi> From these <hi rend="italic">daughters</hi> were struck,
                    which were perfect fae-similes of the original engraving, and were worked by the
                    rollerpress in the manner of copperplates. Guillot, the director, reported, that
                    from one engraving, for the 400 livres assignats, he had struck or polytyped 897
                    <hi rend="italic">mother-punches</hi> and 1487 <hi rend="italic">daughters,</hi>
                    of which number only 190 were defective; of the plate for the fifty livres
                    assignats, 4760 mother-punches and 7684 daughters, 1140 of which were defective.
                    The chief defect was, that frequently the air compressed in the mould of a
                    single letter would effectually prevent the fused metal sinking to the full
                    depth, and thus there would be no letter at all upon the plate. Upon the
                    suppression of assignats this establishment was broken up; but some of the
                    Îlates and matrices are in the public repositories of France, n printing the
                    tickets of the national lottery, Gatteaux obtained the assistance of Didot the
                    printer, whose firm soon afterwards issued proposals for printing polytyped
                    editions of the classics, at very reduced prices; and in 1798 they issued an
                    edition of V irgil, followed by many other works, remarkable for their neatness
                    and cheapness; so that then·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539759" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9759-0568"/>
                <p>plans may be pronounced to have been completely successfill. The process differs
                    little from those before described.</p>
                <p>Types of the usual form, but of very hard metal, being composed, are placed
                    within a steel box, with the face downwards upon a plate of metal, and pressed
                    slowly and smoothly, but with great force. Since, therefore, all the letters are
                    forced simultaneously and evenly into the plate, no uneven impression takes
                    place. They are then disengaged, and any faults are amended by striking in a
                    punch of the defective letter. From the matrix thus obtained plates in relief
                    are cast, from which the paper is worked, the matrix being put away to strike
                    other plates if needed.</p>
                <p>Μ. Héran, Didot’s partner, having separated from the firm, applied himself to the
                    improvement of the art, and hit upon a novel and ingenious mode. This was the
                    formation of a set of types the very reverse of the common, viz. instead of the
                    letter being in relief upon the shank, it was in *ntaglio; therefore every
                    separate letter would be a die, and instead of the letter being reversed, it
                    would stand as read on the paper. The spaces, quadrats, leads, &amp;c. were of
                    the exact height of the type. These were to be composed like types, so that the
                    entire page would present the appearance of a plate of copper into which words,
                    &amp;c. had been punched; the matter was to be read in the metal without a
                    proof, which, as the words read from left to right, was matter of no difficulty.
                    Upon the matrix thus composed fused metal was to be pressed, which would
                    obviously form a complete plate fit to be printed from; and the operation could
                    be repeated until as many plates were struck off as were required. Μ. Héran
                    first endeavoured to cast his types in a mould like that used by
                    letter-founders; but the metal proved too soft, and he afterwards struck punches
                    into shanks of copper of the required size. Works executed from such plates are
                    of remarkable neatness, and the process may be pronounced of very great utility,
                    although, as far as known, it has never been introduced into England.</p>
                <p>Towards the and of the eighteenth century, Professor Wilson of Glasgow, being
                    engaged in a series of experiments for making etchings upon glass with fluoric
                    acid for the purposes of art, thought it possible to make polytypes of glass
                    from engraved copperplates. In this he in some degree succeeded, having executed
                    several polytypes in intaglio from moulds of copperplates, and in relief from
                    woodcuts; but it cannot be said to have been practically successful, the lines
                    not having any degree of sharpness in either case, whilst the brittleness of the
                    material would be a decided objection.</p>
                <p>Messrs Heath, Perkins, and other ingenious men, having turned their attention to
                    the prevention of forgery of bank-notes, have produced many excellent plans,
                    amongst which is that of Mr Heath, of taking the impression <hi rend="italic">en
                    creux</hi> from an engraving of hardened steel upon a cylinder of soft steel
                    afterwards hardened, from which cylinder any number of the plates, fac-similés
                    of the first, may be readily executed. This plan does not differ in any degree
                    from that of Hoffman and Carez, save in respect of the cylinder; but the manner
                    in which the engraving is executed on the original steel by the lathe is most
                    astonishing. These plans have not been adopted by the Bank of England, but most
                    country banks of issue have greedily adopted this almost complete safeguard
                    against forgery.</p>
                <p>Mr Brunel has lately invented an ingenious modification in the making of moulds,
                    which consists in spreading a coating of shell-lac upon a plate of iron, and
                    hardening it in the fire. This is then dipped into the melting-pot, and receives
                    a thin covering of metal, and-is then pressed upon the types. The impression
                    produced thereby is most beautiful. The lead can never sink to any depth in the
                    hollows of the page, there arc no picks or other soils to clear away, but it may
                    be doubted whether the lead would form a very good mould to cast from.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printing in Colours.</hi></p>
                <p>One of the most beautiful aids to typography, the art of printing in colours, has
                    been entirely neglected in this country; at least as far as relates to the
                    embellishing works of ordinary excellence with vignettes, capitals, tail-pieces,
                    and other devices of fancy, in beautiful tints, in the manner of the early
                    typographers. It is true that ingenious artists of the present day have
                    exhibited much skill in illustrating works of natural history, and have shown
                    wonderful genius in publications professedly connected with the fine arts; but,
                    as far as regards the average printing of the day, it is entirely neglected.
                    This may very easily be accounted for. To print in two colours occupies more
                    than twice the time necessary to print in one; and it also requires more skill
                    and ingenuity. These unfortunately must be paid for; and this pecuniary
                    consideration is sufficient to banish from our pages this lovely art. So did not
                    our forefathers; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> took pride in choosing the most
                    tasteful designs, the most harmonious colours, to illuminate their productions,
                    and beguile the reader into study by the illusive charms of gold, and blue, and
                    crimson. Fortunately, either time was of little value, or the exclusive
                    possession of the market enabled them to demand remunerating prices for the time
                    thus well bestowed; but in the bustle and competition of our more mercantile
                    days, time is money, and blue and gold, scarlet and green, give way to the equal
                    ly useful but infinitely less beautiful uniformity of unredeemed black. To a
                    country printer, however, some knowledge of colour-printing would be of infinite
                    advantage, because, as his founts of type are more limited, he can create
                    unlimited variety by a judicious use of colours in job-work: moreover, as he has
                    usually much more time upon his hands, his ingenuity would have ample scope for
                    the production of small works of <hi rend="italic">vertù,</hi> in a taste which
                    cannot be indulged by the denizen of a busy metropolis.</p>
                <p>Except in the exccntion of works of a very high order, and the imitation of
                    intricate and delicate patterns, printing in colours requires no addition to the
                    ordinary accomplishment of printing, other than considerable ingenuity, and a
                    little practice in preparing the colours. The latter may, it is true, be
                    purchased of the ink-maker prepared for use; but the charge for them is
                    enormous, and they require constant replacement, whilst it is not possible to
                    have on hand every variety of tint. By the purchase of the most simple materials
                    from the oil-shop, the ingenious printer has at his hand every colour that fancy
                    can require, at the most moderate cost, without waste or delay. The appliances
                    are few and cheap: a muller, a marble slab, and a palette-knife; the materials,
                    a can of printers’ varnish, to be purchased of the ink-inaker, which will keep
                    any length of time, and the raw colours hereafter given, which may be purchased
                    from time to time; care, however, being taken that they are of the best quality,
                    or they will fade and turn rusty in a short time, and be a deformity instead of
                    an ornament to the work.</p>
                <p>Useful tints of <hi rend="smallcaps">Red</hi> may be prepared of orange lead,
                    vermilion, burnt sienna, Venetian red, Indian red, and lake. Vermilion is the
                    most brilliant of these reds; but its beauty depends very much upon the
                    particular parcel used. The pale vermilion is best for a bright tint, as the
                    dark, when mixed with the varnish, produces a dull red. Orange lead and
                    vermilion ground together produce a very bright tint, which is more permanent
                    than vermilion alone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Yellows</hi> are prepared with yellow ochre, gamboge, and
                    chromate of lead. Of these, the brightest is the chrome; yellow ochre, when
                    mixed with the varnish, produces a very dull tint.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539772" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9772-0569"/>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blues</hi> are made from indigo, Prussian blue, and Antwerp
                    blue. Of these, indigo is exceedingly dark, and not very easily lightened.
                    Prussian blue is a very useful colour; Antwerp blue is very light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Greens</hi> may be produced from a mixture of any of the
                    blues and yellows, as gamboge and Prussian blue, chromate of lead and Prussian
                    blue. These may be mixed in any proportions until the required tint is produced;
                    but it must be remembered that the varnish has a considerable yellow tinge, and
                    will produce a decided effect upon the mixture. With a slight portion of Antwerp
                    blue it will, without the mixture of any of the yellows, produce a decidedly
                    greenish tinge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Purples</hi> of any degree of richness are made by
                    judiciously mixing reds and blues.</p>
                <p>Saepia produces a nice brown tint, burnt umber a very hot brown, raw umber a much
                    lighter brown, bistre a brighter still. Neutral tints may be obtained by mixing
                    Prussian blue, lake, and gamboge. In fact, every pigment that painters can use
                    can be used in printing, avoiding, as much as possible, all heavy colours. In
                    truth, if the printer is desirous of imitating any particular colour, or of
                    producing any particular tint, he cannot do better than consult the nearest
                    artist in oil or water colours (oil in preference), or in default of that, the
                    neighbouring house-painter.</p>
                <p>The necessary colours having been procured, the method of preparing them is very
                    simple. Each must first be well ground by the muller upon the slab, even
                    although they may have been purchased well powdered. The colour should then be
                    well mixed with the palette-knife with the varnish, until the pigment has
                    attained the required consistency, which will vary with the quality of the work
                    to be executed; for if it be a posting-bill or coarse job, the ink should be
                    very thin, and consequently a much larger proportion of varnish should be used.
                    If, however, the work be a wood-cut or in small type, the pigment should be made
                    as thick as possible. If the colour required be a compound, the predominant tint
                    should be first mixed with the varnish, and the lighter tint added in small
                    quantities, until the exact shade required be produced. Thus, if the colour be a
                    dark green, the blue should be mixed up first, and the yellow added; but if it
                    be a very light green, then the yellow should be first applied, and the blue
                    added. If the tint desired be exceedingly light, it will be found that the
                    quantity of raw material to be employed will not make the mixture sufficiently
                    thick to be applied to the type or wood-block: in this case whitening is added
                    to thin colours, and dry white lead to the heavier in considerable quantities,
                    which must be adjusted in the course of mixing. To insure thorough combination,
                    the mixture should be scraped into a corner of the slab, and a very small
                    portion of it spread with the palette-knife, and well ground with the muller
                    until no specks or lumps appear, then scraped up and placed in another corner.
                    This should especially be done when white lead is used, as it will be found that
                    every little lump when crushed will produce a white streak upon the slab. If
                    this be not carefully done, independently of its tendency to clog the type, it
                    will very materially alter the tint. When the pigment seems sufficiently mixed,
                    it is better to bray it out with the muller instead of the usual brayer, and
                    grind again each particular portion immediately before it is used. Colours may
                    be worked either with a ball or a roller. If the job be large and coarse, and
                    the ink consequently thin, the roller will answer every purpose; but if it be
                    small, and requiring much nicety in the manipulation, decidedly with a ball; but
                    in either case the ink should be well distributed, and the form well beaten or
                    rolled. When two or more colours are employed, they must be worked at as many
                    different times. In this case extreme nicety in the register and justification
                    is required, in order that every colour may fall in its just place, without
                    overlaying any other tint employed in the print. This would be a great dis-sight
                    in any case, but most especially where the composition of colours would produce
                    a third; as, for instance, if any part of a blue line should unfortunately fall
                    upon a yellow, a green outline would be the result. The simplest way to guard
                    against this is to have the woodblocks all cut to precisely the same size, with
                    the print in the proper place upon each; when, therefore, the first colour has
                    been worked, the form is unlocked, the block taken out, and the second block
                    inserted; it then falls at once into its proper position. If the form consist of
                    type, each line should be carefully composed in its proper body, that is, if
                    three colours be employed for as many different lines in <hi rend="italic">Pica,
                    Small Pica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Long Primer,</hi> the one to be first
                    worked should be composed in pica <hi rend="italic">letters,</hi> the other
                    lines in small pica and long primer <hi rend="italic">quadrats.</hi> When the
                    second line is to be worked, its quadrats should be taken out and letters
                    inserted, while the type of the first line should be removed and quadrats
                    substituted; and so of the third line. The points on the tympan must never be
                    moved. It is clear, therefore, that if the paper be placed upon the same
                    point-holes as before, and if the form has never been moved, the new line cannot
                    fail to fall into its proper place. The illustrative Plate CCCCXIV. has been
                    worked upon this plan; the black, being the largest body, was first printed, as
                    it afforded the best guide for subsequent working. The blue was next worked,
                    because it was much easier to adjust it to the black, than to adjust the red so
                    exactly that the blue should precisely surround it and yet not infringe upon or
                    retreat from the black, while there would be no difficulty in making the other
                    red portions fall in their proper places. In these cases the paper must never be
                    suffered to dry; indeed the sooner each colour succeeds the other the better. If
                    it be covered with a wet blanket, and the edges well sprinkled, the danger will
                    be little; but if it should dry and shrink in the slightest degree, it will be
                    impossible to obtain register. For printing red-letter days in almanacs and the
                    rubrics in prayer-books (an almost extinct practice), an especial type is used
                    called rubrical; it is cast about an m higher than ordinary type. The black is
                    first worked, quadrats having been inserted in the places of the red letter,
                    which are subsequently withdrawn, and the rubrical type inserted. But as, in so
                    small an insertion in so large a body, this process does not attain any very
                    good register, and is expensive withal, the red-letter days have been abandoned,
                    and some other distinguishing type (generally old English or black) has been
                    substituted, which sufficiently indicates the day. It would not be possible here
                    to give sufficient instructions to enable a printer to execute landscapes,
                    portraits, and other delicate subjects, in various colours and shades. The chief
                    difference between this and other colour-printing consists mainly in the
                    superior individual skill and ingenuity of the artist, the excellence and truth
                    of his engravings, and the superiority of his appliances. In truth, before the
                    printer can produce any great effect, he must be excellently qualified as a
                    painter, which it is not the province of an article on printing to teach. It
                    will be sufficient to state, that the lighter and more extensive tints, and
                    especially those in which transparent colours are used, are worked first, the
                    colour being gradually deepened by successive blocks, until the required effects
                    are produced; and that the outline is printed last, to give sharpness and finish
                    to the design. The curious reader is referred to Mr Savage’s beautiful book on
                    Decorative Printing, and to the many admirable productions of Mr Baxter and Mr
                    Vizetelly. Mr Charles Knight has taken out a patent for a new process in
                    printing in colours, the principle of which consists in a new mode of obtaining
                    register of the different colours. It is understood that <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the colours are printed before the sheet of paper is taken from the
                    tympan, but not at one impression, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539785"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9785-0570"/>The outline is printed at a second operation. The
                    means whereby this is effected may be learned as soon as the specification is
                    enrolled. If the plan succeed (as yet it is but imperfectly tried), it will
                    materially reduce the cost of coloured prints of all descriptions, and
                    especially of maps.</p>
                <p>There is no difficulty in printing in gold; it is within the power of any
                    typographer. The type is composed and made ready at press in the usual manner. A
                    quantity of raw or burnt umber is mixed with printer’s varnish, to the same
                    consistency as it would be were it intended to be used as ink; but this mixture
                    is then compounded with a considerable quantity of gold size, the same as that
                    used by gilders and japanners. The first mixture is necessary, because it has
                    been found that the umber will not combine with the size. The type is then
                    rolled with this compound, in the same manner that ordinary ink is applied, and
                    the impression is taken upon the paper. Leaf-gold is then laid over it with a
                    piece of wool, and pressed slightly upon it. When the varnish has had time to
                    set, a piece of wool is rubbed roughly over the part printed, and the
                    superfluous leaf is thereby removed, leaving the gold adhering to the varnish.
                    The sharpness of the print will vary with the judgment of the printer in the
                    quantity of sizing applied to the type; for if the press-work be bad, the print
                    will be bad also. For inferior gold-printing bronze powder is extensively used.
                    For this the varnish is made very much thicker than for gold; the method of
                    printing is the same; but after the impression has been given, the powder is
                    brushed over the print, and will adhere thereto, whilst the superfluity may be
                    easily removed. In printing the golden Coronation Sun with this powder, a very
                    distressing disease arose, the hair became perfectly green, and the men were
                    very seriously affected; great caution should therefore be taken that particles
                    of the powder be not allowed to fly about the room. Dutch gold cannot be used as
                    a substitute for gold leaf.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eanlι-Notes.</hi></p>
                <p>The numbers of bank-notes are printed by an exceedingly ingenious process, which,
                    being regulated by machinery, makes it impossible to commit any fraud by
                    printing two notes with the same number. The apparatus consists of a series of
                    brass discs, of which the rim is divided by channels into projecting
                    compartments, each containing a figure. The numbers 1 to 9 having been printed
                    in the course of the revolution of the first disc, and this disc having returned
                    to figure 1, the second disc comes into play and presents a 0, and the two
                    together therefore print 10. The first disc now remains stationary until, in the
                    course of the revolution of the second disc, the numbers 1 to 19 have been
                    printed, when it presents the figure 2, and does not again move until another
                    revolution of the second disc completes the number 20 to 29. Thus the two discs
                    proceed until 99 notes have been numbered, when the third disc comes into
                    operation, and, with the two first, produces 100, consequently the first disc
                    performs one hundred revolutions to ten of the second and one of the third. The
                    notes may be numbered indefinitely by this process, without the possibility of
                    error, the machine, meanwhile, being its own check.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printing Presses.</hi></p>
                <p>In the description of the Stanhope Press it has been stated that many other
                    presses upon different principles have recently been invented; most of these,
                    however, contain some application of the Stanhope power. The most powerful, but
                    the most expensive, of these is the Columbian or Clymer Press. The power in this
                    is acquired by an extremely powerful lever, the pivot of which is in the top of
                    the near staple: it passes entirely over .the press, and is pulled down by a bar
                    inserted in the near side, connected with the Stanhope coupling bar, &amp;c. The
                    platten is attached to the centre of the lever, therefore the impression is
                    perfectly vertical. The principle may be popularly understood by balancing a
                    ruler upon the edge of a piece of wood, holding firmly one end in the left,
                    hand, and pressing down the other with the right: indeed a very' fair impression
                    of a small wood-cut may be obtained by placing it with the face downwards upon a
                    soft pad, fixing one end of a bar of wood under a staple, and pressing down the
                    other.</p>
                <p>Cogger’s Press is very powerful. Its principle is a sector or piece of curved
                    steel, so arranged that the lower portion is more curved than the upper; a steel
                    stud traverses upon this. When it moves over the lower and more inclined portion
                    of the sector, it brings down the platten with great rapidity; but in traversing
                    the upper portion, as it presents a less inclined plane, the power is
                    consequently much increased, and is greatest, very great, at the pinch. These
                    presses are complained of by the workmen as being very slow; but the greatest
                    objection to them is, that in making short pulls a ledge is worn upon the
                    sectors’, which is a great obstruction to a long fair pull: with proper
                    attention by the pressman this would not occur.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi> Press, manufactured by Cope’s executors, is a
                    general favourite for its exceeding lightness; it runs very easily, the pull is
                    short, the power great, and the means whereby it is attained so simple that
                    there is little fear of the press getting out of order; it is very easily taken
                    down for cleaning, and put up again. The power is gained by causing an inclined
                    piece of steel to become perpendicular; in so doing the platten descends, and
                    the impression takes place at the moment the piece of steel is assuming its
                    upright position.</p>
                <p>Cope and Sherwin’s <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> is another very excellent
                    press, upon principles which do not greatly differ from the Albion: they arc
                    very numerous.</p>
                <p>In Harrild’s Press the power is obtained by the straightening a knuckle or
                    elbow-joint, in precisely the same manner as the bent arm is straightened. Being
                    of very expensive construction, they have not obtained great sale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printing Machines.</hi></p>
                <p>As long as the thirst for literature was confined to books and a few periodicals
                    of limited sale and size, the ordinary printing presses sufficed to supply the
                    demand; nor was it discovered that any further speed was requisite, until the
                    increased facility of conveyance, and the important events at the close of the
                    last century, created a demand for news, that the utmost exertions of the
                    printers were unable to supply; for the attempt to increase the speed by the
                    composition of two distinct forms of type would avail little, so long as the
                    presses could turn out only two hundred and fifty or three hundred sheets each
                    per hour. Accordingly, for this branch of the art were the first machines
                    projected. Many schemes were proposed for accelerating the movements of the
                    press; but the first attempts at anything like the machine afterwards introduced
                    were made by William Nicholson, a gentleman connected with periodical
                    literature, who took out a patent about 1790, for a printing machine, of which
                    the chief points were the following: The type was to be fixed upon a cylinder,
                    being cast narrower towards the bottom, in order, as it were, to radiate from
                    the centre of it. This cylinder, with its type, was to revolve in gear with
                    another cylinder covered with soft leather; an inking apparatus was applied to
                    the type-cylinder, and the paper was to be impressed by passing between the two;
                    most of these plans were, when modified, adopted by afterconstructors. This
                    machine was never brought into practice. König, an ingenious German, was the
                    next who undertook<pb break="no" facs="nls:193539798"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-9798-0571"/> to construct a machine; and, having made
                    considerable advance in his plans, obtained a contract with Mr Walters, the
                    proprietor of the Times newspaper, for manufacturing two for that journal. In
                    these Nicholson’s plan was so far altered, that the type was laid upon a flat
                    surface, and the impression was given by their passing under a cylinder of great
                    size. He afterwards invented a machine in which the sheet was printed on both
                    sides before it left the machinery; but, in both, his arrangements for the equal
                    distribution of the ink were so complicated and clumsy, consisting of not less
                    than forty wheels, and the works of every part of the machine so intricate, that
                    it never came into practical use. The first really useful machine was
                    constructed by Messrs Applegarth and Cowper, being an extensive modification of
                    that of König; its principle improvement consisting in the application of two
                    drums between the impression-cylinders, for the purpose of insuring the register
                    of the sheet, by retaining it, after the impression of the first form, just so
                    long that it may pass on to the second cylinder in exact time to be impressed
                    thereby upon the second form; and of the distribution of the ink upon a plane
                    surface, instead of by a complication of rollers, by which König’s monstrous
                    machinery was got rid of. These machines are now in general use.</p>
                <p>For newspapers, machines are generally made to work but one side at a time. It is
                    manifest that a machine will work a much greater number (more than double) of
                    one form than of two; and that the machinery will be lighter and less expensive,
                    and of course require less motive power. One form, therefore, of a newspaper,
                    containing advertisements and the less important matter, is worked at leisure;
                    and the second form, containing the leading article, important news, and other
                    matter of consequence, is reserved until the last moment, and is then thrown off
                    with immense rapidity. For the usual description of book-work, machines are
                    constructed to work both forms. In these, perfect register and the exact and
                    even distribution of the ink are of the greatest consequence, and such immense
                    rapidity is not necessary. These machines, therefore, differ very much in
                    construction, though not in principle, from those used for newspapers.</p>
                <p>In Plate CCCCXV. will be found an engraving of Cowper’s admirable perfecting
                    machine, an explanation of which will comprehend a sufficient description of the
                    single machine. Upon slides running the length of the frame which supports the
                    whole machine, traverses a carriage which conveys the two forms of type, and
                    attached to both ends of which are tables for the distribution of the ink. The
                    reciprocating motion is given to this carriage by means of a pinion, which works
                    alternately upon the upper and under surface of a rack. In gear with this
                    carriage, and, supposing the paper to be omitted, in immediate contact with the
                    type, revolve two cylinders of large dimensions, by which the impression is
                    given; these cylinders are separated by the registering drums, but are kept in
                    uniform and steady motion by two large wheels, the teeth of which work within
                    each other. The ink is distributed over the forms by an apparatus attached to
                    each end of the frame, consisting of a trough which contains the ink, in contact
                    with the edge of which, or very nearly so, a metal roller called the <hi
                    rend="italic">ductor</hi> is made to revolve slowly by means of a catgut, which
                    passes over a pulley attached to the axis of the impressioncylinder. A
                    composition-roller is made to rise into contact with the ductor and receive a
                    portion of ink, with which it descends, and thus communicates it to the
                    inking-table as that passes underneath it at the extremity of the traverse. Two
                    composition-rollers are placed somewhat diagonally across the frame, and their
                    spindles being of extra length, as the table passes under them they are caused
                    to revolve and also to travel slightly across it, thus evenly distributing the
                    ink all over the surface of the inking-table, the cross motion removing any
                    accidental accumulation of ink. The table now traverses under four other
                    composition-rollers, supplying them with an even quantity of colour, which they
                    in turn distribute over the type as it passes under them in going and returning,
                    the form being thus rolled no less than eight times. These rollers are mere ly
                    dropped into notches in the frame, their own weight sufficing to retain them in
                    their places, and give the necessary impact upon the type. For the purpose of
                    carrying the paper round the different cylinders there are two distinct series

                    the right surface of the first cylinder, and underneath it; thence <hi

                    drum; thence to the left surface of and under the second cylinder; from this it
                    passes to the right, until it arrives at the roller first mentioned. The course
                    of the second series of tapes is different; for, following the course of the
                    first series, and in contact with it (supposing the paper withdrawn) until it
                    has passed with it under the second cylinder, it then takes a different
                    direction, and, turning to the left, passes over the machine until it arrives at
                    the roller from which we have commenced the description. Both series of tapes
                    are kept tightly stretched by means of various small rollers revolving in
                    different parts of their course. The paper being laid upon other tapes from a
                    table at the right of the machine, is moved forward until it comes in contact
                    with the endless tapes, and being received between them, it is passed under the
                    first cylinder, and the first side is then printed; thence passing over and
                    under the drums on to the second cylinder, it receives the impression upon the
                    other side; thence it passes onward to the point where the tapes take different
                    directions, when it is shot out printed on both sides, upon a board between the
                    cylinders and under the drums. The whole machine is put in motion by means of a
                    strap which passes over a wheel under the frame, and <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                    be worked by the power of men, but is mostly worked by steam. It is capable of
                    doing very fair work at the rate of from 2000 to 2400 impressions, or 1000 or
                    1200 perfect sheets, per hour; it requires but two boys, one to lay on and one
                    to take off the sheets.</p>
                <p>The machine with which the Times is printed is also constructed by Messrs
                    Applegarth and Cowper. It consists of four impression-cylinders, two of which
                    are in contact with the types at the same moment; the other two rising in the
                    meanwhile. There are consequently eight series of tapes, two for each cylinder.
                    It requires four boys to lay on and four to take off, and the machine will give
                    4200 impressions within the hour. Its appearance, of course, differs very much
                    from the machine before described.</p>
                <p>The ingenuity of these gentlemen, especially of Mr Cowper, has been exerted in
                    the invention of many mechanical improvements in printing. Several of his
                    machines, upon various constructions, have been brought into use with
                    considerable success. These, however, are the principal machines of his
                    invention. They at first, it is believed, turned their attention to the fixing
                    stereotype plates upon the periphery of the impression-cylinder, and brought the
                    scheme into practice; but these are superseded by the simpler and more useful
                    machines above described.</p>
                <p>The machines of Mr Napier are in very general repute. They have the advantage of
                    being easily worked by two men, thus saving the great expense and unavoidable
                    dirt <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539811" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9811-0572"/>where a
                    steam-engine is employed, with its necessary appliances, boilers, coals, &amp;c.
                    They stand in a very small compass, and do beautiful work. As far as regards
                    motion and impression, they do not greatly vary from those previously described;
                    but in the method of conveying the paper, obtaining register, and inking, they
                    are altogether different. The paper is laid to a certain gauge, when in the
                    revolution of the cylinder grippers are made to compress the edge of the paper
                    upon it, very much in the manner in which the fore-finger closes on the thumb.
                    It is by these means conveyed entirely round it, in the course of which the
                    first impression is given. At the commencement of the second revolution these
                    grippers open at the precise moment the grippers attached to the second cylinder
                    close, and thus convey the sheet over the second form. Tapes pass under the
                    second cylinder, <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the blanket and the paper, and
                    over a pulley upon a bar, by the mere friction of which the sheet is thrown out
                    upon a board. These grippers are made to act with such perfect certainty that
                    the best possible register is obtained. The inking apparatus consists of a
                    trough with a ductor and vibrating roller, which communicates the ink to
                    composition-rollers, by the revolution of which in contact with each other the
                    ink is perfectly distributed, and from these to the type. A cross motion is
                    communicated to the distributing roller by means of a worm in the elongated
                    spindle. As but one impression is given during the traverse of the table in each
                    direction, the cylinder which does no’t at the moment hold the paper would be in
                    contact with the type, had not Mr Napier added a beautiful adjustment, whereby
                    the cylinders rise and fall alternately, so that the one not in use passes over
                    the form intact. This machine will work from 1000 to 1200 perfect sheets per
                    hour, and requires but two boys. Mr Napier has constructed several other
                    machines of great merit, one of which, for newspapers, will perfect 2000 sheets
                    per hour by the labour of two men. Another with four cylinders, for rapid
                    newspaper work, prints the Morning Chronicle newspaper at the rate of 6000
                    sheets on one side per hour. But the perfection of speed will be obtained by one
                    for which he has lately taken out a patent, by which the extraordinary speed of
                    15,000 or 20,000 per hour will be obtained. The ordinary type is affixed to the
                    periphery of a cylinder of enormous dimensions, in contact with which ten
                    smaller impression-cylinders revolve, each with its inking and other apparatus
                    so arranged that every revolution of the large cylinder works ten sheets of any
                    size; and yet so steady and so silent is its motion, that there is no danger of
                    any disruption of the type, even at that extraordinary rate. The types are held
                    in their place by means of the rules, which are made considerably larger at the
                    top than at the bottom, thus occupying the space which would be found in
                    consequence of the types not being so formed as to radiate from the centre of
                    the cylinder. Mr Napier is the inventor of many very ingenious improvements in
                    the machinery of printing.</p>
                <p>Mr Rowland Hill has brought into partial use a machine giving 10,000 impressions
                    per hour; the types are slightly pyramidical, in order to radiate from the
                    centre of the cylinder upon which they are fixed. These machines, however, are
                    better adapted to printing stereotype plates, to which a curved form could be
                    given, which is the principle of Nicholson’s and other early machines.</p>
                <p>A machine-press has long been at work in Mr Spottiswoode’s office, in which the
                    impression is given by a self-acting platten, tables, rollers, friskets, and
                    tympans. It does beautiful work, at the rate of 600 or 700 impressions per
                    hour.</p>
                <p>A well-seeming press has also lately been imported from America, in which there
                    is an admirable application of two friskets, which are made to run in and out
                    and rise and fall alternately. The tympan is upon the platten. There appears,
                    however, to be some practical defects in the working. Owing either to this or
                    their high price, or prejudice, they have not been successfully introduced.</p>
                <p>These are by no means all the machines that have been devised, constructed, or
                    brought into use. They are, however, all that it is necessary to mention, as the
                    same principle is common to all. Every maker is at liberty to build them, with
                    such modifications as his own talents may suggest.</p>
                <p>The many-coloured excise stamps and cheques are printed by very complicated and
                    ingenious machinery, the invention of the late Sir William Congreve. They are
                    printed from steel or copper plates, the plate from which the dominant colour
                    (as black) is transferred being cut away in those parts where the red appears,
                    whilst the red plate has the parts which are to receive the ink in relief; the
                    edges of the two plates being bevelled, the relievo of the red plate fits with
                    exquisite nicety into the corresponding parts of the black plate; these being
                    properly adjusted on the machinery, the red plate descends, and is then coloured
                    by rollers, as is the black plate, which remains stationary; the red plate now
                    rising, fits itself into the black plate, and the impression is instantly given,
                    thus printing both colours at once, and with such excellent adjustment, that it
                    is almost impossible, by the minutest examination of the print, to form any
                    guess of the mode of execution. The apparatus for adjusting these plates has of
                    course nothing in common with ordinary printing machines, and it differs
                    materially from them in other respects: the table is stationary, the cylinder
                    traverses over it, and the inking appliances follow it in its traverse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copperplate Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned that the principle of printing from engravings on
                    copper or steel is the very reverse of printing from types, inasmuch as the
                    former are graven in intaglio and the latter in relief, and consequently the
                    pigments are contained within the lines of the one, and the surface of the plate
                    is free of all colouring matter, whilst the surface of the other is carefully
                    covered with ink, and the depressions as carefully kept clean. It must be
                    sufficiently obvious that these essential differences must require very
                    different manipulations. Accordingly, the printing of such engravings has little
                    in common with letter-press printing. The copperplate or roller press may be
                    described as consisting of two upright cheeks, with ribs diverging at right
                    angles. At a short distance above these ribs is a solid iron cylinder, which is
                    made to revolve by means of a star, consisting of many radii, as long as the
                    height from the ground will permit. Upon the ribs runs a carriage; under the
                    carriage, but not attached to it, is a roller, which, by means of a lever, is
                    made to rise, thus pressing the carriage with any degree of force against the
                    upper cylinder. The copperplate is laid over a brazier of ignited charcoal, and
                    when at a sufficient heat the workman takes a considerable quantity of ink upon
                    a rubber of linen rag, and smears the whole face of the plate, working it
                    carefully into every mark of the graver; the heat of the fire, at once expelling
                    the air and thinning the ink, causes it to enter into the minutest strokes, so
                    that the slightest scratch or corrosion in the copper presents itself upon the
                    paper: a plate even not sufficiently polished, that presents no visible defects
                    to the clearest eye, will cause the paper to appear dirty; so exact are the
                    effects of this mode of printing. When the ink has been sufficiently rubbed in,
                    the face of the plate is cleared of the superfluous ink with another linen
                    rubber; the workman, then, with the balls of his hands, carefully cleanses the
                    surface, drying his hands upon a lump of whitening, until the face is perfectly
                    cleaned and polished. In this operation the skill of the workman is exhibited,
                    for in thus cleansing the plate he must be most <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193539824" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9824-0573"/>careful not to rub out the
                    ink from the gravures, and to leave colour proportioned to the depths of shadows
                    required; for although the engraver may, indeed must, have defined every stroke,
                    much depends upon the manner in which the printer does his part. It is not every
                    man that has a rolling press that can produce first-rate prints. On the
                    contrary, he must be himself no inconsiderable artist, and stands in a much
                    higher relation to the engraver than the bellows-blower to the organist. The
                    plate being ready for printing, is removed from the brazier to the carriage of
                    the press; the paper, well damped, is laid upon it; a leather tympan is closed
                    over it, the carriage run in a little, and the lever raised; the carriage,
                    &amp;c. being thus brought into close contact with the upper roller, the latter
                    is made to revolve by turning the star; this causes the carriage and plate to
                    run in, and thus an immense lineal impression is given to every part. The ink
                    used in copperplate printing differs somewhat from that used by letter-press
                    printers. It is of two kinds; one for fine ornamental work, one for common
                    printing. For fine work, such as large and delicate engravings, the material
                    used is the finest Frankfort black; it is ground on a stone with a muller, and
                    mixed with weak burnt linseed oil, until it attains a consistency of thick
                    paste; a little strong burnt oil is then added, and it is then ground up again,
                    a drier to make the ink set firm on the paper being added. The drier is composed
                    of small portions of litharge, white copperas, and sugar of lead; these should
                    be well pounded with the muller before they are ground up with the oil and
                    hlack. A small portion of the best Prussian blue may be added; but the greatest
                    care must be taken that it be well triturated, as otherwise it is liable to make
                    the best work smear. The blue must be ground up by itself with weak oil; to this
                    driers are to be added. The whole compound is then to be ground up again, and
                    added to the black: the mixture must be then ground upon the stone for about ten
                    minutes, the palette-knife being freely used until all portions are thoroughly
                    commingled. The ink for common work is prepared in the same manner, but without
                    the Prussian blue; and the common English black is substituted for that of
                    Frankfort.</p>
                <p>Copper-plate presses, of a superior description, made chiefly of iron and brass,
                    have lately been introduced, in which several excellent appliances are to be
                    found to diminish the labour and improve the general quality of the work. The
                    most important improvement would appear to consist in heating and inking the
                    plates without removing them from the press, and distributing the ink over the
                    surface and in great measure removing it by means of composition rollers, the
                    ultimate cleansing being left to manual skill as before. In copper-plate
                    printing, however, so much depends upon the skill and care of the workman, that
                    whatever improvement may be made in the mode of gaining pressure and other
                    mechanical means, it does not appear probable that the present slow and careful
                    progress will ever be superseded. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. d.)</hi></p>
