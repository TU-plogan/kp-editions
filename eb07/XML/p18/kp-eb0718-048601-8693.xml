                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has been usual to trace the origin of posts to a
                    remote antiquity; certain establishments, having something in common with the
                    modern post system, being found to have existed at an early period of the
                    world’s history. Herodotus and Xenophon mention that, amongst the ancient
                    Persians, stations were appointed at intervals along the great roads of the
                    empire, where couriers were constantly kept in readiness to convey dispatches
                    and intelligence. Similar institutions, as we learn from Suetonius, were
                    maintained amongst the Romans in the time of Augustus, and such probably existed
                    much earlier.</p>
                <p>But although the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">post</hi>
                    may be traced to this source, (from the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >positus,</hi> whether as applied to the accommodation and means of transport
                    <hi rend="italic">placed</hi> at intervals for the service of the couriers, or
                    to the couriers themselves, placed or <hi rend="italic">posted</hi> at the
                    several stations,) such institutions obviously bear but a general resemblance to
                    the postoffice of the present times. The couriers were mere state messengers,
                    the communication only to and from the seat of government; nor, as far as
                    appears, was there any regular machinery for the receipt and delivery of
                    letters, so essential to the idea of a modern post establishment.</p>
                <p>The posts which were first instituted in the kingdoms of modern Europe, as those
                    by Charlemagne and Louis XI. of France, the Emperor Charles V., and some other
                    sovereigns, differed little, if at all, from those now described. It is indeed
                    probable, that whenever the posts or couriers were appointed to perform their
                    journeys at stated periods (which, as soon as the occasions for employing them
                    became frequent, would be found at once the most economical and effective mode,)
                    such a convenient means of conveying correspondence, though primarily intended
                    only for state purposes, would soon come to be used by individuals. Houses of
                    call, for the receipt and delivery of letters, would in process of time be
                    established by custom, if not by regular appointment; and in this way might grow
                    up the modern post system. The earlier posts instituted in Europe, however, were
                    in general but of temporary duration; their existence being dependent sometimes
                    on occasion, sometimes on the disposition or policy of particular monarchs.</p>
                <p>Between the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century,
                    indeed, there were several members, in succession, of the noble family of Taxis
                    in Germany who applied themselves in a remarkable manner to the establishment of
                    posts, and the office of postmaster-general of the empire was eventually
                    conferred on the family as a hereditary fief. As certain posts settled by this
                    family fat a period preceding that in which the modern post system was generally
                    introduced in Europe,) continued permanent, such posts may be considered
                    (unless, indeed, they were at first formed on the modern plan (as affording an
                    instance of transition from the ancient to the modern system. In other cases,
                    however, there is no room for representing the latter as having grown out of any
                    extension, adaptation, or improvement of the former. Thus, in our own country,
                    the insular position of which made our sovereigns less anxious about
                    intelligence from their frontier, nothing of the nature of a public post
                    establishment can be said to have existed, (with an immaterial exception in the
                    reign of Edward IV.) until after the modern form was introduced, the rise
                    ofwhich itis a matterof no difficulty to explain. Theconvey-ance of letters,
                    indeed, is what must inevitably become, in the course of human transactions, as
                    much matter of necessity, as the conveyance of persons or of commodities; and
                    the same circumstances which generate the formation of roads and bridges, and
                    give existence to the trade or occupation of carrier, shipmaster, or innkeeper,
                    must necessarily lead to the employment of the post messenger, under greater or
                    less degrees of system and regularity.</p>
                <p>History, more attentive to record the transactions of monarchs, than the steps by
                    which communities effect their advancement and improve their conveniences,
                    furnishes nothing beyond an incidental notice of the modes by which the
                    circulation of correspondence was conducted, before it became matter of state
                    regulation. Of course, however, it is not to be supposed that no such modes
                    existed, or that notices of these are entirely wanting. The conveyance and
                    delivery of letters was often part of the regular occupation of travelling
                    pedlars and others whose business led them to perform stated or frequent
                    journeys. When commerce began to advance, regular conveyances for correspondence
                    were established between some of the principal trading cities, either by the
                    municipal authorities,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Kennedy, in bis annals of Aberdeen, mentions that the magistrates of that
                    city, in the year 1590, appointed a person to convey their dispatches to and
                    from Edinburgh and other places of royal residence. This functionary bore the
                    style of <hi rend="italic">council post,</hi> and was arrayed in a garment of
                    blue cloth with the town’s armorial bearings in silver upon the sleeve. Vol. i.

                    permanent establishment of messengers for the conveyance of letters was attached
                    to the university of Par is, from the beginning of the thirteenth century, and,
                    indeed, was not abolished until the year 1719, long after a general post had
                    been settled in France. Other universities were similarly provided.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the act of Queen Anne
                    there is a special clause, permitting letters to be sent to and from the
                    universities of Oxford and Cambridge, “in manner as heretofore hath been used,
                    anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.” The privilege has since ceased
                    to exist.</p></note> In some instances powerful and opulent individuals
                    established posts, either as a mercantile speculation, or for the convenience of
                    any district in the prosperity ofwhich they took an interest. But although the
                    conveyance of correspondence was thus brought to some degree of system, or
                    rather prevailed under a variety of systems, even in places where the state
                    authorities had not yet provided any public establishment for this purpose, it
                    is easy to see that communication, especially between more distant places, must
                    have been slow, irregular, and insecure. The advantage and even necessity of
                    having a uniform and legalized system of post conveyance, could not have failed
                    to present itself to thd eyes both of subjects and rulers; although it may be a
                    question whether the sovereigns who first established such systems in their
                    dominions were, in general, moved so much by large and enlightened views of
                    public benefit, as by the wish to create, according to the practice so usual in
                    that age, a lucrative trading monopoly in behalf of some of their
                    favourites.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the modern post system, then, in regard to the mode of its
                    taking place in some of the principal countries of Europe, is not properly to be
                    viewed as of the nature of a political or civil invention; being merely the
                    assumption, on the part of the state, of the conduct of a particular department
                    of human affairs, which had grown up with the progress of society, but could no
                    longer be corn <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538706" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8706-0487"
                    />petently managed by individuals, whether acting severally or in concert. And
                    accordingly, in acts and ordinances relative to posts, there is not so much in
                    the shape of <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> of a new species of accommodation, as
                    of <hi rend="italic">prohibition</hi> against procuring the same accommodation
                    by any other than the offered means.</p>
                <p>The notices we possess of the early history of the British post-office, are but
                    meagre and indistinct. What they amount to may be stated as follows. There was a
                    chief postmaster of England in the reign of Elizabeth, if not earlier, Randolph
                    having that title assigned him by Camden (1581); but his duties, of which that
                    author takes no notice, probably related but partially, if at all, to the
                    conveyance of correspondence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The name of <hi rend="italic">posts,</hi> as already
                    observed, had its origin in relation to an arrangement of <hi rend="italic"
                    >travelling stations,</hi> a relation which it continued to preserve; and before
                    the establishment of <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> offices, the <hi
                    rend="italic">postmaster</hi> (a use of the term not yet obsolete), was the
                    person who provided the means of conveyance from one station to another. The
                    necessity of regulation and superintendence in regard to an office of this kind,
                    led to the appointment of a <hi rend="italic">postmaster-general,</hi> to whom
                    such superintendence was committed. For some time after the establishment of
                    letter-offices, the duties of postmaster, in the earlier and later meaning of
                    the term, were conjoined.</p></note> James I. appointed a postmaster to take
                    charge of the conveyance of letters to and from <hi rend="italic">foreign
                    parts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and different persons are named as
                    successively enjoying this office during his reign and that of his son Charles.
                    In 1635 Charles established a letter office for England and Scotland, which may
                    properly be regarded as the origin of the British post-office. The persons to
                    whose management it was committed, were directed to establish, within a limited
                    time, a post from London to Edinburgh, one to Westchester and Holyhead, and
                    another to Plymouth and Exeter; and the journey from London to the termination
                    of each of these lines and back, was appointed to be performed in six days.
                    Bye-posts were ordered to be established, and other principal lines opened upas
                    occasion might arise; and conveyance of letters otherwise than by post was now
                    prohibited within the kingdom, as it had formerly been between the kingdom and
                    places abroad.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In the year 1642, a committee of the House of Commons was appointed to report on
                    certain matters connected with the post-office; and the subject continued
                    afterwards, at intervals, to engage the attention of the House. In 1644, Mr.
                    Edmund Prideaux, who afterwards held the office of attorney-general to the
                    commonwealth, and who had been chairman of the committee of 1642, was elected
                    postmaster-general by resolution of both Houses of Parliament; “in the execution
                    of which office,” says Blackstone, “he first established a weekly conveyance of
                    letters into all parts of the nation, thereby saving to the public the charge of
                    maintaining postmasters to the amount of L.7000 per annum.”<note anchored="true"

                    8.</p></note> This has been interpreted to mean (whether correctly or not) that
                    the charges of the post-office previously to the improvement effected by
                    Prideaux, exceeded its income by the sum mentioned.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is stated that the revenue in 1614 was
                    estimated at L.5000. <hi rend="italic">Macpherson’s Annals of Commerce,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 408,</p></note> Be this as it may, there seems to have been, from
                    the period of these improvements, a considerable profit realised from the posts.
                    Whether from a desire to share in this profit, or for other reasons, the Common
                    Council of London, in the year 1649, set about establishing a separate
                    post-office; an attempt, however, which was promptly put down by a resolution of
                    the House of Commons, declaring that “the office of postmaster is and ought to
                    be in the sole power and disposal of Parliament.”</p>
                <p>Itappearslikely, that, originally, any surplus revenue which might be obtained
                    from the posts, was allowed to belong to the postmaster, and even that the
                    charges for postage were fixed by him, although subsequently regulated
                    otherwise.</p>

                    was first established; and narrates, that that act gave to the postmasters
                    “power to take moderate salaries,” meaning, it might be supposed, to charge such
                    rates as would afford moderate salaries; and a little later, in regard to the
                    case of Wytherings, from whom the office of postmaster had been sequestrated by

                    Mr. Wytherings ought to be restored into the possession of his place as
                    postmaster for foreign parts, and to the mean profits received since he was out

                    which it was brought nearer to the model under which it has more latterly
                    subsisted. An advantage held forth in an ordinance<note anchored="true"

                    the establishment of posts, is worth noticing, namely, that “they will be the
                    best means to discover and prevent many dangerous and wicked designs against the
                    commonwealth.” Possibly a hint from Charles, some twenty years before, as to
                    making the post-office aftbrd this sort of convenience, had not been very well
                    taken. It does not appear, however, that either at this or any subsequent time,
                    the secrecy of correspondence passing through the British post-office, was ever
                    violated to serve the purposes of government.<note anchored="true"

                    State.</p></note></p>
                <p>The arrangements made in 1657 were confirmed, and some further improvements

                    and his successors, thus becoming part of the hereditary revenues of the crown.
                    From this time nothing of importance seems to have occurred iii the history of
                    the post-office, until the year 1710, when was passed the statute 9 Anne, ch.
                    10, which may be called the charter of the British post-office.</p>
                <p>In the system of posts established by Charles I. in 1635, provision was made for
                    the conveyance of letters between England and Scotland, but the royal ordinance
                    makes no mention of an <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> post for the latter
                    kingdom. The postage between the two capitals was then eightpence; in the time
                    of Cromwell it was fourpence. After the Restoration, the postage to Berwick was
                    fixed at threepence. In the latter part of this century, however, there was a
                    postmaster-general in Scotland, and posts on some of the principal lines of
                    road. In 1667, a post was established to pass between Edinburgh and Aberdeen
                    twice a-week, and one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538719"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8719-0488"/>about the sametime, between Edinburgh and

                    ><p>The former was established by the magistrates of Aberdeen, but was
                    transferred to the direction of the Scotch postmaster-general in 1674.—Kennedy’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Aηηαls.</hi> vol. i. p. 262.</p></note> Somewhat earlier, (in
                    1662) a post was established between Ireland and Scotland, and the privy council
                    gave Robert Main, then postmaster-general, an allowance of L.200 sterling, to
                    build a packet boat for conveying the mails between Portpatrick and Donaghadee.
                    The postage to Ireland was sixpence. But whatever was effected in these respects
                    in Scotland, seems to have been entirely by the authority of the local
                    executive, or the magistrates of the principal towns; the first legislative act
                    appointing an internal post in Scotland, being that of the 20th of the 5th
                    Session of the 1st Parliament of William III., passed at Edinburgh in 1695. The
                    preamble of this act embodies the statement that, “for the maintenance of mutual
                    correspondence, and preventing of many inconveniences that happen by private
                    posts, several public post-offices have been heretofore erected for carrying and
                    receiving letters by posts, to and from most parts and places of this kingdom.”
                    This act, as also that of the 12th Charles II., was repealed (unless so far as
                    re-enacted) by the statute of Anne above referred to.</p>
                <p>The act of Queen Anne established a general post-office for, and throughout the
                    kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the colonies in North America and the
                    West Indies, with one master of such office, who was to bear the name and style
                    of her Majesty’s postmaster-general. The postmaster-general was empowered to
                    keep one chief letteroffice in Edinburgh, one in Dublin, one in New York, and
                    others in the West Indies. In the year 1784, however, about which time there
                    prevailed in Ireland a remarkable jealousy of any assumption of superiority on
                    the part of Britain, an act was passed by the Irish parliament, by which, as
                    well as by certain corresponding acts<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Geo. III. <hi rend="italic">e. 6,</hi> 8. ,</p></note> on
                    the part of the British legislature, the Irish post-office was withdrawn from
                    the government of the British postmaster-general, and placed under an
                    independent officer styled “his Majesty’s postmaster-general for Ireland ;” but
                    the two offices were, agreeably to the recommendation of the commissioners of
                    revenue inquiry, again consolidated by an act passed in 1831;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>] Wm. IV. c. 8.</p></note>
                    and at the same time the office of deputy postmaster-general of Scotland was
                    abolished. The whole affairs relating to the post-office throughout the kingdom,
                    were thus put under the direct management of the London board; but the
                    secretaries at Edinburgh and Dublin are still the organs of communication with
                    the country offices, and exercise a general administrative superintendence in
                    their respective divisions of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>During the period for which an account has now been given of what may be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi> history of. the post-office, a very
                    great increase has, as may be supposed, taken place, in the speed of conveyance,
                    and the extent of the communications maintained.</p>
                <p>For a considerable time after the first establishment of the post-office, there
                    were no relays of post-boys or horses at different stages; one man and horse
                    accomplishing the whole ride, and taking the necessary rests by the way. The
                    post between Edinburgh and Aberdeen stopped one night at Dundee, and another at
                    Montrose. This system continued in Scotland till about the middle of the last
                    century. Until 1763, the communication between London and Edinburgh was only
                    three times a week; but in that year it was made to be five times a week. At
                    first, the mail was 85 hours in travelling from London to Edinburgh, and 131
                    hours in returning. In 1757, the time was shortened to 82 hours in the one case,
                    and 85 in the other. Latterly, the journey has been performed by the mail coach,
                    in 42 and 45 hours, the 42 being farther reduced, by the use of the curricle
                    from Morpeth, now discontinued, to 40. Mails are at present conveyed partially
                    by railway, from London to Edinburgh in 33 hours, and from Edinburgh to London
                    in 36.</p>
                <p>Until the year 1788, there was no direct mail from London to Glasgow. Previously
                    to that period, the course of post had been five days, the letters being sent
                    round by Edinburgh; and as no mails were dispatched from the latter city upon
                    Sunday, there was in consequence one arrival the less at Glasgow each week. Dr.
                    Cleland<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Statistical Account of Glasccw.</hi></p></note> tells, that, when
                    a direct mail conveyance was first established (a little before the time now
                    spoken of) from London to Carlisle, the mail for Glasgow, that otherwise would
                    have been the one delayed on Sunday at Edinburgh, was transmitted through
                    Carlisle to Glasgow in four days; notwithstanding which the mails of the other
                    days were allowed for a year to be carried round by Edinburgh; and the delay,
                    the means of saving which was thus shewn in regard to one day in the week,
                    acquiesced in for all the other days.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable steps which the post-office has made in advance, is
                    usually and justly considered to be the adoption of Mr. Palmer’s celebrated plan
                    in 1784. The chief part of this plan, as is well known, was, to have the mails
                    conveyed in charge of an armed guard, by the stagecoaches, (which thus became
                    <hi rend="italic">mail</hi> coaches) instead of by a boy on horseback, or mail
                    cart, as formerly. The credit due to Mr. Palmer, is not perhaps so properly that
                    of having discovered a means to an end, as that of having conceived and aimed at
                    the end itself; for it is not easy to see how the increased speed and
                    regularity, which were in effect obtained, were bound up in his specific
                    proposal, or how (as the advantages of that proposal are sometimes described)
                    the post-office was at once to borrow regularity from the stagecoaches, and the
                    stage-coaches from the post office. Mr. Palmer’s merit really consisted in
                    seeing that a greater degree of speed and regularity in post conveyance was
                    possible, which nobody saw but himself; and in catching the hint from the
                    stage-coaches, which nobody else caught. The advantage of employing the
                    stage-coaches instead of conveyances furnished expressly by the post-office,
                    would seem to resolve mainly into the point of economy.</p>
                <p>Mr. Palmer was afterwards appointed controller of the post-office, in which
                    capacity he is understood to have made some important improvements in the
                    internal details and arrangements.</p>
                <p>The first mails on Mr. Palmer’s plan, were the Bath and Bristol, on the 2d August
                    1784. Previously to the adoption of this plan, the ordinary speed of the post is
                    said to have been but about three miles and-a-half in an hour. After that, the
                    speed was doubled. At present, the average speed of the mail coaches, is eight
                    miles seven furlongs, the highest reaching to ten miles five furlongs. This is
                    exclusive of stops.</p>
                <p>The number of miles travelled over^in England and Scotland, by the mail coaches
                    in 1833, was 5,911,006; in 1836 it was 6,643,217.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mails were first conveyed between Liverpool and Manchester, in 1828. Three
                    communications took place daily between these towns, until September 1835;
                    afterwards there were four, and latterly there have been six, from Liverpool to
                    Manchester, and five the contrary way. The important line of railway connecting
                    London with Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, and extending northwards to
                    Preston, having lately been opened, mails are now regularly transmitted by it
                    from the capital to the various towns in the extensive and populous district
                    through which it passes, and onwards to Scotland and Ireland, from its
                    terminating points in each direction. A travelling post office is conveyed along
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538732" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8732-0489"/>line, in
                    which letters are sorted during the passage, the advantage of which will be
                    afterwards explained. The only, or principal, other line of railway by which
                    mails are at present conveyed, is that connecting Carlisle and Newcastle, but
                    this mode of carriage must of course extend itself as new lines are completed. A
                    late act<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>and 2 Vict. c.
                    98.</p></note> empowers the postmaster-general to require railway proprietors to
                    carry the mails at a rate fixed by arbitration. The effect of the rapid
                    transmission of correspondence by railway, increased as that rapidity yet may
                    be, if there were added such a reduction of postage as has lately been proposed,
                    would almost be that of bringing the inhabitants of the extremes of the kingdom
                    into personal communication. The revolution which may thus be produced on trade,
                    science, government, and social economy, it is hardly possible to calculate.</p>
                <p>In the course of the last twelve or fiftecn years, the facilities of
                    communication, both inland and foreign, have been mate-riallyextended, by
                    reduction of postage duties and otherwise.</p>
                <p>Until the year 1827, letters passing between Britain and Ireland b ad been
                    charged the added amount of the British and Irish land postage, severally taken.
                    From that year, the rate has been calculated the same as if such letters had
                    been conveyed the whole distance in Great Britain. At the same time, the law
                    which required double postage to be charged on one sheet of paper with two
                    letters written on it, or a letter and invoice, &amp;c. was repealed, and a
                    single sheet declared to be in any case but a single letter.<note

                <p>In the year 1835 it was enacted,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>5th and Gth Will. IV. c. 25.</p></note> that after an
                    agreement shallhave been made with the post-office of any foreign kingdom or
                    state, it shall be optional with persons sending letters by post to such foreign
                    kingdom, to pay both the British and foreign postage at the time of sending the
                    same, or to send the same without payment of any part of the postage, or to pay
                    the British postage only: persons residing in foreign kingdoms having tb.e same
                    option. Following out the powers given by this statute, a convention was entered
                    into, and signed at Paris, on the 30th March 1836, between his Britannic Majesty
                    and the King of the French, in which the requisite arrangements are made for
                    giving the proposed option as to payment of postage on all correspondence
                    between France, on the one hand, and Great Britain and Ireland, and those
                    British colonies and possessions where the post-office of Great Britain has
                    established post-offices, on the other. The postage between Paris and the
                    British frontier is fixed at one franc, between London and the French frontier
                    at tenpence, and in proportion for other distances in each kingdom. And though
                    under the present arrangements the option of sending letters <hi rend="italic"
                    >without</hi> payment is confined to those for France alone, letters may be sent
                    through France, paid for the full distance, to any post town in Switzerland,
                    Sardinia, Central Germany, or Bavaria; also to the Southern Italian States, as
                    far as Sarzane, the Italian frontier of Sardinia, and to Austria, Bohemia,
                    Venice, &amp;c., as far as the French frontier offices of Huninguen or
                    Forbach.</p>
                <p>By the same statute,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>and
                    6th Will. IV. c. 25.</p></note> the postage on letters sent by private ship from
                    the United Kingdom to places beyond seas, (which until then had been <hi
                    rend="italic">one-half</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">packet</hi> rates), was
                    fixed at the uniform rate of eightpence, single, on letters posted at the port,
                    and one shilling if posted at any other part of the kingdom. Letters were at the
                    same time permitted to be sent abroad, from any port, by a private vessel,
                    without passing through the post-office, or from one port to another, within the
                    United Kingdom, by private ship, at a sea postage of eightpence.</p>
                <p>In 1835, a post communication was opened up between Britain and India, through
                    the Mediterranean, by which the course of post with that part of the world has
                    been very greatly shortened. Letters for India can also be forwarded through
                    France by steam boats sailing three times a month from Marseilles.</p>
                <p>Very important facilities and immunities have recently been given in regard to

                <p>At first the transmission of newspapers seems to have been a privilege confined
                    to certain officers in the post-office. In 1763 an act was passed,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>4th Geo. III. c. <hi
                    rend="italic">24.</hi></p></note> giving the sanction of law to what then seems
                    to have become the current practice, namely, that of allowing newspapers to be
                    sent free by members of Parliament and certain public officers, when signed on
                    the outside by their hand, or <hi rend="italic">to</hi> such members at any
                    place of which they had given notice in writing to the postmaster-gen cral. By
                    gradual relaxations, the restrictions on the free transmission of newspapers
                    degenerated into a mere form, that of printing or writing a member’s name on the
                    cover; and in 1825 an act<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>6th Geo. IV. c. 68.</p></note> ® was passed, rendering even the observance
                    of this form unnecessary. The same act, as subsequently amended,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>7th and 8th Geo. IV. e.
                    21.</p></note> allowed printed newspapers to be sent to the colonies, by the
                    packet boats, at a postage of one penny halfpenny each paper, and colonial
                    newspapers to be brought to Britain and Ireland, by packet or private ship, at a
                    postage of threepence. In 1834<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>4th and õth Will. IV. c. 44.</p></note> the postage on
                    newspapers sent to the colonies by packet, and on colonial newspapers brought by
                    packet, was wholly taken off. At this time, too, a most important enactment was
                    made in regard to the transmission of newspapers to and from foreign states.
                    Hitherto the power of such transmission (unless at an expense amounting to a
                    prchibition) had been enjoyed exclusively by certain officers in the
                    post-office, from whom individuals could only obtain the accommodation at a
                    considerable charge. By the statute now passed, British and Irish newspapers
                    were allowed to be sent to foreign states, and foreign newspapers received into
                    Britain and Ireland at a postage of twopence for each paper. A later
                    statute<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>and 7th Will.
                    IV. c. 54. (1836.)</p></note> extends the accommodation still farther, by a
                    clause authorising the postmaster-general to allow newspapers to pass free to
                    and from such ioreign states as grant a corresponding allowance in regard to
                    Britain; or even, if he sees fit, without such a reciprocal arrangement on the
                    part of other states; or to impose in any case an equivalent duty. And, by
                    virtue of these provisions, there is now a free transmission of newspapers
                    between Britain and the following states and places abroad: viz. Hamburg,
                    Bremen, Cuxhaven, Denmark, Spain, Greece, Ionian Islands, Hayti, Buenos Ayres,
                    Brazil, Columbia. British newspapers are sent to France without any charge in
                    this country, but pay four centimes there. Newspapers <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> France are charged one halfpenny in Britain.</p>
                <p>At this time also newspapers to or from penny post towns, passing through the
                    general post, were freed from penny postage.</p>
                <p>To these facilities for the circulation of newspapers is to be added that arising
                    from the important alteration in the stamp laws, by which the duty on newspapers
                    was reduced, from and after the 15th September 1836, from 3 <hi

                <p>In proceeding to give a brief account of the post-office business and
                    establishments, it may not be improper to advert to the new and improved
                    accommodation lately provided for the use of this department, in the metropolis.
                    About the year 1815 the premises in Lombard Street being found, after every
                    possible enlargement, to be quite inadequate for the uses they were required to
                    serve, measures were taken for the erection of a more ample, commodious, and
                    clcgant structure. It was not, however, until Scptem∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538745" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8745-0490"/>
                <p>ber 1829, that this purpose was finally accomplished, and the new building
                    brought into a state of readiness for the public service. It is constructed of
                    Portland stone, after a design by Mr. Smirke, and is in length about 390 feet,
                    width 130, and height 64. The principal front, towards the west, in St.
                    Martin’s-le-grand, is composed of three Ionic portico, that in the centre
                    surmounted with a pediment. The middle space in the interior, lying between the
                    principal and back entrances, is occupied by a hall of eighty by sixty feet in
                    extent, having a range of columns and pilasters on each side. On the right, or
                    south side of this hall, are the secretary’s, accountant’s, and
                    receiver-generaΓs chambers, together with the foreign letter and twopenny
                    post-offices. The opposite side contains the inland, the newspaper, and the
                    ship-letter offices. The mails, inwards and outwards, pass through a vestibule
                    on the eastern front, communicating with the inland office. The latter is nearly
                    ninety feet in length, and about fifty-six in width; the letter-carriers’, or
                    newspaper office, adjoining the inland, 103 by 35. The building contains a
                    variety of other apartments for the different branches of the service, general
                    and particular. To avoid the inconvenience and confusion of communication,
                    through the public hall, between the departments on each side of it, the letters
                    are conveyed from the one to the other through a tunnel below, by means of a
                    curious machinery contrived on purpose.</p>
                <p>The office at St. Martin’s-le-grand, may be said to consist of two distinct
                    establishments; one is the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> postoffice, properly
                    so called, or that devoted to the post business of the empire in general; the
                    other is just the postoffice of <hi rend="italic">London.</hi> In the first
                    division, under the postmaster-general, are the departments of the secretary,
                    accountant, the dead letter, mail coach offices, &amp;c. The principal
                    departments of the second division, are the <hi rend="italic">inlandaxA twopenny
                    post</hi> offices. The former has charge of the dispatch of the London letters
                    and newspapers, and of those from abroad, passing through London, to all parts
                    of the kingdom. It also manages the delivery of all those arriving at, and
                    destined for London.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Foreign mails arriving after the general post delivery, are delivered by the
                    twopenny post letter-carriers.</p></note> Subject to this department there are
                    seventy receiving-houses within a circle of three miles from the office. Within
                    this circle letters are taken in and delivered without any charge beyond the
                    general post rates. The inland office employs eighty-four clerks, two hundred
                    and ninety-one subsorters and lettercarriers, and about fifty messengers,
                    stampers, &amp;c. The most arduous business of this department, that requiring
                    the greatest energy and rapidity, is the dispatch of the mails, in number
                    twenty-nine, at eight o’clock each evening. So near has the time up to which
                    letters and newspapers are received, been brought to the hour of dispatch, and
                    such is the increase of business, particularly in regard to newspapers, that it
                    almost exceeds the utmost efforts of the persons engaged to accomplish the
                    duties within the limited space. By an account kept on the 19th February 1838,
                    it was found that of 47,795 letters received at the inland office, up to fifteen
                    minutes before eight, only 9,428 had arrived before half-past five, and 9,842
                    came in after seven. The sum of 6d. charged on each letter taken in during a
                    limited time each day after the receiving box is shut, amounts to above L.1000
                    a-year. Sometimes 30,000 newspapers are received within the last fifteen minutes
                    allowed for taking them in. The letters are successively stamped, sorted into
                    divisions corresponding with the principal lines of road, taxed, (or marked with
                    postage, after the necessary examination,)<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Stamping is performed at the rate of from 100 to 200 letters
                    in a minute; examining and taxing, 33; and sorting, 30.</p></note> and
                    subdivided for post towns. The amount charged on each postmaster is then told,
                    and entered in his bill, and duplicate preserved. From thirty-five to fifty-five
                    persons are employed in sorting, twenty in tax ing, and as many in telling up.
                    The newspapers are sorted by the letter-carriers in their own office: from 120
                    to 300 being thus employed on different days. Six or more arc occupied in
                    examining newspapers, to detect private communications, enclosures, &amp;c. From
                    forty to sixty newspapers are charged daily, the postage amounting to L.100
                    a-week. After all these operations are finished, the bags are to be filled,
                    tied, sealed, and delivered to the guards. The daily average of letters
                    dispatched from London is 36,000. On Mondays the number is from 40,000 to
                    50,000. The number of newspapers dispatched from London in the last three months
                    of 1835, was 3,146,127; of 1837, 5,020,230; the one period being previous, the
                    other subsequent, to the reduction of the stamp duty. On Saturdays and Mondays,
                    when the numbers are greatest, (sometimes exceeding 100,000,) it is necessary to
                    engage one or two outside seats on the coaches for their conveyance. Sometimes
                    they are sent separately by the stage-coaches. About 3000 are sent by the
                    Edinburgh mail. The weight of the Edinburgh mail, as ascertained by one
                    evening’s trial, was as follows: sacks and bags, 1 cwt. 9 lb. 8 oz.; 2296
                    newspapers, 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 3 lb. 8 oz.; two stamp parcels, 1 qr. 12 lb·; 484
                    franks, 1 qr. 19 lb. 15 oz.; 1555 chargeable letters, 1 qr. 6 lb. 14 oz.; in
                    all, 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 23 lb. 13 oz. The weight of the Holyhead mail on the 30th
                    June 1838, was: bags, 1 cwt. 10 lbs.; letters, 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 17 lbs.;
                    Newspapers, 15 cwt. 1 qr. 18 lbs.</p>
                <p>In the morning, on the arrival of the mails, the bags are counted and inspected,
                    to ascertain that all have arrived, and with the seals secure; after which they
                    are emptied, and turned inside out, and the amount of the postage marked on the
                    paid letters compared with the account sent by the postmaster. The letters then
                    undergo an examination, in order to its being seen that all have been rightly
                    charged, as single, double, &amp;c. Being then stamped, they are distributed
                    into several larger divisions, as those for the twopenny post, for the
                    window-men, and for the different districts of the town; which last divisions
                    areagain subdivided for the walks of individual letter-carriers. Each of the
                    different persons to be engaged in the delivery is then required to tell the
                    amount of postage on that portion of the letters committed to him; and on his
                    reporting an amount corresponding with that brought out by a separate telling
                    previously made, but not communicated, the charge becomes established, and is
                    signed by the party. In case of difference, reference is made to a third person.
                    Each man’s letters being then arranged, the delivery commences. The
                    letter-carriers having the more distant walks, are conveyed to the ground by
                    omnibuses, (of which ten are employed for this purpose,) each man being dropped
                    at the commencement of his walk. In the morning duties, there are fifteen
                    persons employed in opening the bags, and checking the accounts; nine in
                    examining letters; fifty sorters; and ten tellers. The number of letters
                    arriving in London daily, is from 30,000 to 40,000.</p>
                <p>There is a separate department for dispatch and receipt of foreign mails, and
                    another for the same duties in regard to ship-letter mails. Masters of vessels
                    are allowed 2d. for each letter brought from, or carried abroad.</p>
                <p>The number of letters from France in the year 1837, was from 30,000 to 36,000,
                    and about half as many more in transit, through France. Letters expedited to
                    France, from 33,000 to 39,000; in transit through France, from 11,000 to 15,000.
                    Newspapers sent to the continent of Europe, about 30,000 per month; received,
                    about 20,000.</p>
                <p>The London penny, or twopenny post, was first set on foot by a person named
                    Murray, an upholsterer, about the year 1683, and by him assigned to one Dockwra.
                    A suit, however, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538758"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8758-0491"/>was commenced against the latter by Government,
                    and the management of this post withdrawn from him. But he received an
                    indemnification, and was afterwards appointed controller of the office. The
                    present limits of the twopenny and threepenny posts were fixed in 1831.</p>

                    correspondence of a particular <hi rend="italic">portion</hi> of the district
                    belonging to any principal office. In the former respect, (however the duties
                    may be farther subdivided,) it just performs the part of one letter-carrier,
                    with merely the difference of the additional charge on the letters. All letters
                    arriving by the general post at London, for parties residing beyond a circle of
                    three, and within a circle of twelve miles, are transferred to the twopenny post
                    department for delivery; and letters posted for dispatch within the same space,
                    are collected by this department, and transferred to the general post. Such
                    letters are charged 2d. in addition to the general post rates. So far the London
                    twopenny post performs exactly the same functions as any of the penny posts in
                    other parts of the kingdom. It differs from them in so far as it collects and

                    correspondence, not merely in its own <hi rend="italic">portion</hi> of the
                    district annexed to the principal office, but in the whole of that district:
                    having its own receiving houses, and its own letter-carriers, within, as well as
                    beyond, the circle of general post delivery. Letters both posted and delivered
                    within the three-mile circle, are charged with a postage of twopence; those
                    crossing beyond it into the space within the wider circle, or <hi rend="italic"

                    between the inner and outer circles, threepence. The twopenny post subdivides
                    its duties within the three-mile circle, among four branch offices, besides the
                    chief office of the department. The correspondence to and from these, as well as
                    to and from the district beyond the three-mile circle, is conveyed by horse
                    posts, or mail carts. The rides to the country are ten in number, some dividing
                    into two branches, besides four cross rides. There are 209 twopenny post

                <p>From Falmouth, to Lisbon, Cadiz, and Gibraltar, once a-week, (steam). From
                    Gibraltar to Malta, Greece, and Ionian Islands, once a-fortnight, and from Malta

                <p>The mails are conveyed between the West India islands by steam-boats, on
                    contract.</p>
                <p>On the Falmouth station, there are thirty vessels employed in the packet service,
                    six at the Dover station, and eight steam vessels from the Thames.</p>

                <p>For communication between Britain and Ireland, there are packets from Liverpool
                    and Holyhead to Kingston, from Milford to Waterford, and from Port-Patrick to
                    Donaghadec. There are also packets from Weymouth to Guernsey and Jersey,
                    Liverpool to Isle of Man, Aberdeen to Shetland,&amp;c.</p>
                <p>Until about fifteen years ago, the post-office had the whole charge of procuring,
                    fitting out, and maintaining the different mail packets. About that time the
                    Falmouth packets were transferred to the Admiralty. A further transfer of most
                    or all of the others was recommended by different commissions appointed to
                    inquire into the management of the post-office, and carried into effect last
                    year, (1837). The grounds of this recommendation were, that the duties required
                    for the efficient and economical management of the packets, were such as the
                    peculiar habits and qualifications of the heads of a civil department did not
                    adequately fit them to perform. A great saving has accordingly been effected by
                    the change of management. The packet communication with France is regulated by
                    treaty made in 1833; and that with Belgium by a similar treaty made the
                    following year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    French mails to Dover; but receives from L.l 0,000 to L. 12,000 annually from
                    Britain for transit postage ofletters carried through her dominions to Italy,
                    Turkey, Switzerland, Spain, &lt;⅞c., according to a scale fixed by the treaties
                    of 1802 and 1836. Out of this, however, she has to pay to Austria the transit
                    duty of letters passing through that country. Hamburgh and Holland pay nothing
                    for having their correspondence conveyed by British packets, but charge no
                    transit. Belgium also charges no transit against Britain, and moreover pays
                    L.1000 yearly for packet conveyance, there being four weekly mails to that
                    country, and only two to Hamburgh and Holland. From L.200 to L.300 a-year is
                    paid by Rio Janeiro.</p>
                <p>The mode in which letters are circulated, and the post revenues collected, is as
                    follows :—Each of the three capitals, London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, sends a bag
                    direct to, and receives one direct from, every office in its respective division
                    of the kingdom. Every postmaster sends a bag to every office on the different
                    lines of road leading from his own, as far as the first office (inclusive), at
                    which the mail conveyance makes a stop. Into the bag for the most distant
                    office, are put all the letters (tied up together indiscriminately) that are for
                    places beyond it; and which, accordingly, are here sorted into the bags for each
                    place, as faι^ as that, inclusive, where the next stop takes place, and where
                    the same process is repeated. Letters thus sent to another office to be sorted
                    and forwarded arc called <hi rend="italic">forward</hi> letters. Such as are to
                    go off at a cross line, are sent, as forward, to the office from which the cross
                    line diverges. This is the general principle of the circulation. The moving
                    post-office on the railway answers all the purpose that a sorting office
                    interposed between every two stations on the line would do, at the same time
                    saving the necessity of stoppage. Every office conveys its letters, as <hi
                    rend="italic">forward,</hi> into the moving one as it passes. In it, the mails
                    for the station next occurring are immediately made up, ready against arrival
                    there: the letters going to stations beyond being separated, so to speak, as
                    forward on the <hi rend="italic">position</hi> of the moving office, after
                    passing that station. Letters are <hi rend="italic">taxed</hi> (or marked with
                    postage) as well as stamped, at the office where they arc put in; and with every
                    bag is sent a bill containing simply two <hi rend="italic">items,</hi> namely,
                    the amount of postage for letters in the bag, chargeable on the <hi
                    rend="italic">sending</hi> postmaster for <hi rend="italic">paid,</hi> and on
                    the <hi rend="italic">receiving,</hi> for unpaid. The bill consequently does <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> include the. <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> postage on
                    letters from offices <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the sending postmaster’s, nor
                    on <hi rend="italic">unpaid</hi> letters going <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the
                    receiving postmaster’s: the former having been already charged, the latter
                    afterwards to be charged on other offices. Thus the postage on every letter
                    whatever, paid or unpaid, is brought to the charge of one office or another.
                    Both the items of every bill are entered in an account at each of the two
                    offices to which its contents relate; the one account checking the other, and
                    the bill remaining to settle differences if any; and when the accounts are
                    summed, the charge against each postmaster is just his <hi rend="italic">sent
                    paid,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">received unpaid.</hi> This charge he liquidates
                    either by actual remittances, by allowances to his credit for his own salary and
                    other payments, and by his dead-letter account. The last is vouched, first, by
                    dead-letters actually returned; secondly, by receipts for overcharges; and
                    thirdly, by claims for letters <hi rend="italic">re-sent</hi> to other offices;
                    which claims, as noted on a form prepared for that purpose and transmitted along
                    with the re-sent letter, are certified by the receiving postmaster; and being
                    forwarded to the inspector of dead-letters, serve to check the claimant’s
                    account.</p>
                <p>The country postmasters’ remittances are made to the secretary, who transfers
                    them ov er to the receiver-general, after furnishing a note of the amount to the
                    accountant, who from thence credits the postmaster, and debits the
                    receivergeneral. The revenue collected at the general post-office is paid direct
                    into the hands of the receiver-general by the persons actually collecting, who
                    are merely the window clerks and the letter-carriers; the charge against each,
                    certified by the parties as admitted, being furnished at once to the
                    receiver-general and the accountant by the superintending officer. No account of
                    the <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> letters is sent from the general to the country
                    offices; the check being there maintained between one department and another.
                    Postmasters advancing the charge on a letter observed to be under-taxed, are
                    required to put their initials to the alteration, which, if the letter is for
                    their own delivery, is in effect sending out a receipt for the additional
                    charge.</p>
                <p>The deputy postmasters-general in the coloni es are charged with the amount of
                    letters sent them by each mail, in the same way as the country postmasters
                    within the kingdom; the method of check and account between the internal
                    colonial offices being also the same as between the different country offices at
                    home.</p>

                    the United Kingdom. On occasion of passing the bill for the regulation of the
                    post-office in 1657, “a proviso was tendered for freeing members of parliament

                    laid aside without a question.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    were practised by writing promissory notes or other instruments over the

                    grant from King William of the whole revenue of the post-office of Scotland,
                    together with a pension of L.300 to maintain the post. Even with this allowance,
                    however, the undertaking was considered hazardous and the grant surrendered. At
                    the union, the post-office revenue was farmed for L.l 194. The nett revenue, on
                    an average for three years preceding 1711, was estimated at only L.2000; in 1733
                    it was L.5399; in 1754, L.8927; in 1776,L.31,103. In the year ending 5th January
                    1801, the revenue was, gross, L.100,652, nett, L.83,755. It increased
                    progressively till the corresponding year 1815, when the gross was L.203,366,
                    nett, L.161,551. In 1822 the gross had sunk to L.179,404, whence again it took a
                    start in the other direction, and in 1837 was L.220,759, nett, L.160,813. The
                    expense of collection in the present century has varied from 14 to 28 per

                <p>The amount of postage charged on postmasters in the West Indiesand British North
                    Américain the year ended 5th January 1838, was L.78,905, of which above L.18,000
                    was for unpaid letters from Britain. Of the first sum, there was for Canada,
                    L.38,977, for Jamaica, L.18,274.</p>
                <p>The postmaster-general is not responsible, under any circumstances, for the
                    safety of letters passing through the post-office, nor for the value they may
                    inclose, if lost or stolen. This point was first settled in the case, Lane v.
                    the Postmaster-General, in 1699, (reported in Raymond, vol. i. p. 646). Some
                    doubts hanging over the principle of this decision, the point was again tried,
                    before Lord Mansfield, in 1778, (Whitfield <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> the
                    Postmaster-General, Cowper’s Reports, p. 754,) and judgment given for the
                    defenders. The punishment of death for letter stealing was abolished in
                    1835,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>and 6 William IV.

                    is punishable with seven years’ transportation. A newspaper with an enclosure,
                    or any writing or marks, is subject to three times the postage of a packet of
                    equal contents: which postage may be recovered from the sender,<note

                    passengers of vessels from abroad, failing to deliver their letters at the first
                    postoffice, incur heavy fines. Penalties and postage debts not above L.20, are
                    summarily recoverable. Letters once posted become the property of the person
                    addressed, and cannot be again withdrawn. Other laws (those against illicit
                    conveyance being frequently made public) are of less general concernment.</p>
                <p>In the year ending October 1834, there were fifteen criminal prosecutions in
                    England for post-office offences, and twelve convictions, some of them capital;
                    and thirty-four prosecutions for penalties, in which the parties submitted.</p>
                <p>The whole acts relating to the post-office have been consolidated into five
                    statutes, viz. 1 Victoria, ch. 32—36.</p>
                <p>The British post-office has generally been allowed to be remarkable for the
                    precision and regularity with which it circulates the correspondence passing
                    through it, and the celerity with which the official business is conducted; and
                    the prevalent opinion has until lately been, that the department, on the whole,
                    has been skilfully and efficiently administered. Instances, however, both of
                    defects and mismanagement, have, within these few years, been somewhat
                    frequently brought forward, and perhaps with a degree of exaggeration answerable
                    to the indifference with which they had in former periods been regarded. As
                    respects, in the first place, the <hi rend="italic">constitution</hi> of the
                    department, the inexpediency has been maintained of having the supreme direction
                    vested in a single person, generally a nobleman, removeable at every change of
                    government, and who, by his education and habits, cannot be supposed peculiarly
                    fitted to superintend an establishment, possessing fully more of a commercial
                    than of a civil, or even fiscal character. The tendency, and even the actual
                    effect of such a system has been alleged <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538810"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-8810-0495"/>to be, that of removing the charge from the really
                    responsible head, and throwing it upon a secondary officer. The abolition of the
                    office of postmaster-general, and the substitution of a permanent board of three
                    or more persons, has accordingly been recommended by successive commissions of
                    inquiry; and a bill for giving effect to such recommendation has been twice sent
                    np from the lower, to the upper house of parliament, but refused a second
                    reading by the latter. As regards the <hi rend="italic">laws</hi> of the
                    post-office, the grand subject of complaint, and that on which perhaps the mind
                    of the community is more made up than on any other, is the high rate of postage,
                    both generally, and in particular cases, as for shorter distances, circuitous
                    routes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Since this was
                    written, it has been announced that postage is in future to be charged only for
                    the distance by the nearest carriage road without regard to the actual distance
                    the letter may be conveyed.</p></note> penny postage on general post letters,
                    and the like. That there is a great fault in this respect, is argued from the
                    fact of there being little or no increase on the annual revenue, for more than
                    twenty years; and though this fact, to a certain extent, at least, admits of
                    other explanations, it is undeniable that a large amount of correspondence is
                    conveyed otherwise than by post, merely to avoid the expense of postage; and
                    that the existing laws are insufficient, as would any laws be that could
                    possibly be framed, to check such practice. The complaints against the <hi
                    rend="italic">administration</hi> of the post-office relate principally to the
                    alleged want of sufficiently frequent and numerous communications on various
                    lines <hi rend="italic">of</hi> road, and the consequent delay of
                    correspondence, of which the most important case is the want of day mails and
                    Sunday mails<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is,
                    perhaps, superfluous to observe, that the subject of Sunday mails and
                    deliveries, involves considerations of a nature quite distinct from those on

                    justice of any of the complaints now enumerated, (the fact of their existence
                    being all that it concerns the present purpose to notice), it may be remarked
                    with regard to the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of the particular class just
                    adverted to, that they frequently resolve into questions between the interests
                    of one portion of the community and those of another; or into similar questions
                    between a portion and the whole; or between an advantage with a corresponding
                    sacrifice, and the loss of such advantage; questions to which the administrators
                    of the post-office, at least, profess and appear to have given full
                    consideration, and, either in regard to what is done or what is contemplated, to
                    have determined with a view to the best.</p>
                <p>One cause of complaint of not unfrequent occurrence, namely, that regarding the
                    losses that occur in the post-office, by the abstraction of letters containing
                    value, may be said to have been of late in a great measure obviated by the
                    establishment of a system of <hi rend="italic">money orders,</hi> to be granted
                    by one office, payable at another, to the amount of L.5, at an expense of from
                    6d. to 1 s. 6d. Larger sums can, in general, be safely transmitted through
                    banks.</p>
                <p>Within these few years, a plan of singular boldness and ingenuity, and developed
                    with the utmost perspicuity and fairness of intention, has been put forth by Mr.
                    Rowland Hill; a plan which aims at the removal of several of the defects of the
                    present post system, but the practicability ofwhich is matterof much doubt and
                    dispute. The main feature of this plan, as every body knows, consists in a
                    proposal to reduce the postage of all letters under half an ounce weight, to a
                    penny, to be collected by a stamp-duty on the paper of the letter or envelope.
                    The great benefits of such a system as this are obvious, the objections are not
                    less so. These (omitting minor articles) resolve chiefly into this dilemma;
                    either the number of letters would not be sufficiently great to produce the
                    required <hi rend="italic">gross</hi> amount, or, if it were, they would be
                    unmanageable without an additional expense that would as much diminish theneíí.
                    On Mr. Hill’s part, the necessity of the alternative is denied. As respects the
                    first branch of it, he calculates on as many letters as would be sufficient at
                    once to keep up the revenue, and defray any additional expense, first, from the
                    falling in of all the illicit and most of the franked correspondence; next, from
                    the great number of letters that would be sent by persons who now cannot often,
                    or at all, afford postage, and are restrained by fear or conscience from
                    smuggling; and lastly from the variety of printed bills, lists, advertisements,
                    &amp;c., which may be legally sent otherwise than by post, but for which the
                    post would be preferred at a low expense. On the other branch of the alternative
                    he maintains, that, as regards the matters of receipt, despatch, and delivery,
                    the post-office, by being freed from examining, taxing, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ιchole business of accounts,</hi> would be relieved from a great
                    part of the additional labour that would be imposed upon it by the increased
                    number of letters; and, as to conveyance, that the estimated increase of
                    chargeable letters, would add but by a very small proportion to the <hi
                    rend="italic">weight</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bulk</hi> of the mails; the far
                    greater part of which is made up of newspapers, parliamentary documents, and
                    franks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That a system
                    promising so great a reduction in the expense of correspondence, would meet with
                    extensive favour and support, is what might be expected; and, consequently, in.
                    estimating the weight of the testimony in its behalf, which such support is
                    calculated to yield, it is necessary to distinguish between a desire for its
                    adoption, and a conviction of its practicability; so that we may not ascribe to
                    the latter, what may be wholly due to the former. It is to be remembered, too,
                    that what is called the <hi rend="italic">practicability</hi> of the scheme, is
                    a very vague expression. In the strictest sense, it must mean practicability,
                    consistently with the maintenance of the present revenue from the post-office,
                    or a revenue not materially smaller; in another sense, the practicability of the
                    plan may mean that its adoption would occasion no deficiency, but what could,
                    and ought to be, otherwise provided for. The supporters of the plan differ in
                    the <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> of practicability which they ascribe to it; but
                    a conviction of its practicability generally, has been expressed by so many
                    individuals and bodies of men, qualified by their knowledge and habits to judge
                    of such a matter, and so little likely to think with indifference of an
                    embarrassment of the public finances, that a strong presumption of the intrinsic
                    merits of Mr. Hill’s plan is unavoidable. The subject has been taken up in most
                    of the principal cities of the empire, by constituted bodies, or associations
                    formed for the specific purpose. Regular inquiries have been instituted by the
                    circulation of minute queries, and otherwise, with the view of ascertaining how
                    far the present system is sufficient as a means of accommodation; how far, as a
                    source of revenue, the duties it imposes are liable to be evaded; and what
                    increase of correspondence by post, or decrease of illicit conveyance, might be
                    expected to take place, under such a reduction of postage as Mr. Hill proposes.
                    Numerous petitions from the most influential and respectable quarters have been
                    presented to parliament, in behalf of Mr. Hill’s plan. A Committee of the House
                    of Commons, appointed on the 23d of November 1837, to consider, generally, the
                    subject of a reduction of postage, and especially the merits of Mr. Hill’s
                    proposal, has, in the course of two sessions, during which it has been sitting,
                    examined a great number of witnesses, officers of the post-office, merchants,
                    literary men, agents of trading companies, and philanthropic associations,
                    clergymen, and others; all descriptions of persons, in short, the most likely to
                    be able to shew the working of the present system, and to estimate the probable
                    effects of the new. The Committee has, at the same time, collected a vast body
                    of statistical evidence relating to the post establishment, in regard to every
                    particular bearing on the subject of the investigation. The results of the
                    inquiry have been communicated in two voluminous reports.</p><p>That the present
                    high rates of postage have operated, in one way, to the repression of
                    correspondence altogether, and in another, to the diversion, into illegal
                    channels, of a vast portion of its existing amount,—a portion much more vast
                    than had ever previously been suspected; that in the latter way, they beget a
                    disregard to the law, and produce that deterioration of the moral feelings,
                    which actions requiring concealment, tend to generate; that, in both ways, they
                    embarrass the motions of trade, check the dissemination of knowledge, curb the
                    <pb corresp="kp-eb0718-8823-0496" xml:id="pbn7496"/>exercise of the social
                    affections, and confine the efforts of philanthropy; that the post-office, in
                    short, is neither fully and effectually available for the purposes which it is
                    the essential object of such an institution to serve, nor able to preserve the
                    monopoly conferred upon it by law, from systematic and extensive violation;
                    these are points which may fairly be considered as settled by the evidence given
                    before the Committee.</p><p>The questions involved in the investigation, as far
                    as it relates to the practicability of Mr. Hill’s plan, have been partly of
                    fact, partly of calculation, partly of conjecture and estimate. It being
                    incumbent on Mr. Hill’s part to make it appear that the increase of the number
                    of letters would counterbalance the decrease on the postage of each, it became
                    necessary to ascertain what is the actual number by which the present annual
                    revenue is created, and annual expense incurred. This is a question of fact; how
                    many letters at any definite reduced rate would produce the same gross revenue,
                    is one of mere calculation; what increased number of letters might be consequent
                    on such reduction, is one of conjecture. Even the first two descriptions of
                    questions, however, have not been so easily determined as their nature would
                    seem to promise. Actual returns beyond the suspicion of incompleteness or
                    incorrectness are, under the circumstances of haste and perplexity, in which
                    such returns can only be made, and the incapacity of some of those who have to
                    make them, hardly to be expected; whilst, from the fluctuations in the amount of
                    correspondence at different periods, a fair season for presenting an average is
                    not easily fixed upon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Sir Edward Lees’s evidence, Q. 9413.</p></note> Even, however, after an
                    agreement, actual or assumed, has been attained on this point, several of those
                    differences on subjects of calculation (which, viewed in the abstract, might be
                    supposed of impossible occurrence, but in point of fact, arc so often found to
                    occur in regard to the admissibility of <hi rend="italic">data</hi> and the mode
                    of applying them,) have arisen to complicate and embarrass the
                    inquiry.</p><p>One cannot help observing that some of the calculations, the
                    correctness of which has been made matter of dispute, refer to rather irrelevant
                    points. Such, for instance, is that regarding the exact cost of the <hi
                    rend="italic">conveyance</hi> of letters, &amp;c. in Britain. Mr. Hill’s
                    calculations on this point, are probably subservient to the single purpose of
                    evincing the justice of a <hi rend="italic">uniform charge,</hi> which is done
                    by shewing that the cost of mere conveyance, as distinguished from other parts
                    of the charge of postage, is so small, as to make mere distance an immaterial
                    element in the adjustment of the rate. Without examining (and certainly without
                    admitting) the correctness of Mr. Hill’s statements on this subject,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If postage is to be charged
                    according to the actual cost of conveyance, as compared with the returns, then a
                    letter for ten miles will often cost more than one for 100; i f on an average of
                    such cost as applied to the whole, then, of course, the postage will be uniform;
                    but if the charge is to be fixed on the general principle, that the cost of
                    establishing and maintaining a conveyance for a large distance, must exceed that
                    for a small; and that conveyance for a large distance is worth a greater price
                    to the <hi rend="italic">payer,</hi> inasmuch, as generally it would increase
                    the difficulty to him of getting his letter conveyed, (which seems the <hi

                    made to yield to the advantage of <hi rend="italic">uniformity,</hi> especially
                    at a very low absolute rate. But conveyance being but a <hi rend="italic"

                    those <hi rend="italic">analyses</hi> which Mr. Hill makes of the composition of
                    the present post-office expenditure. It is obvious that, throughout the inquiry
                    (so far as it relates merely to a point of <hi rend="italic">finance,</hi> its
                    sole relation as presently considered) the <hi rend="italic">nett</hi> revenue

                    system Teaches or approximates to it, the merits of that system are to be
                    tested. Consequently, in comparing Mr. Hill’s plan with the present, we must
                    take the expenditure of the pos⅛office <hi rend="italic">as it is,</hi> unless
                    so far as a saving can be shewn to arise <hi rend="italic">specifically out of

                    that would be necessary on Mr. Hill’s plan, lies in the smallest possible
                    compass. The <hi rend="italic">gross</hi> revenue to be raised in a given year,
                    after deducting L.71,755, arising from extraneous sources, supposed available
                    under Mr. Hill’s plan as well as the present, is L.2,390,515, or 573,723,600
                    pence. This revenue is at present raised,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This assumption appears incorrect, as; supposing the year’s

                    instead of 52, (the postage of the weik being but 1-53.1 of the year s revenue)
                    a deuuction of about a million of letters would fall to be made from his
                    estimate.</p></note> (taking Mr. Hill’s own calculation) from fifty-seven

                    letters, Mr. Hill calculates on no increase; the <hi rend="italic">twopenny</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">threepenny,</hi> if reduced to a penny, he expects^to
                    increase threefold, making these three descriptions of letters amount to
                    forty-seven millions. Forty-seven millions of pence, deducted from the
                    573,7'23,600, leave 526,7'23,600 to be raised from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >general</hi> post letters, which Mr. Hill estimates (taking in the weights
                    above the penny rate) to produce lid. each. It requires 4'21,378,880 letters at
                    l⅛d. to produce this; and to give such a number, the fifty-seven millions (the

                    were made on the year taken, were part of the 78,000,00(&gt;; and, if so, query,
                    farther, whether these oughtnot to be deducted from the number of increasable
                    letters? The government officers would send no more letters at a penny than they
                    do at present. In the uncertainty, however, as to the grounds of this claim, let

                    Increased five-fold, they yield L.2,083,330, The cost on inland distribution he
                    makes L.868,967, which, together with L. 112,162, (other branches of
                    expenditure) makes L.981,129. This deducted from the gross, leaves L.l,102,201
                    for the nett; to which he adds the two items just mentioned of L. 196,000 and L.
                    48,000, thus making the total nett L.l,346,201, or only something more than
                    L.300,000 of a deficit on a <hi rend="italic">five</hi> fold increase. Now all
                    that is necessary for the purpose of explaining how this more favourable result
                    is brought out, is to compare the produce of his ∕⅛β-fold, with that of his
                    one-fold. The former will be found just five times the amount of the latter; and
                    as the one-fold includes all descriptions of letters, penny, twopenny, and
                    threepenny, five times the produce of the one-fold, of course, suppose an equal
                    increase on all.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Is not
                    this multiplying the penny letters in the same <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> with

                    true, that with the explanation that Mr. Hill would give it, namely, that by a

                    average of a sixfold on the general post, and a threefold on the twopenny and
                    threepenny, (the penny remaining the same); this would be merely a different
                    mode of expressing the same thing. Practically, it is a deception; because, any
                    <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> promised by Mr. Hili, being an increase <hi

                    If Mr. Hill owns, as he would own that his statement, <hi rend="italic">in this
                    meaning,</hi> would be untrue, how can he complain of Lord Litchfield for
                    supposing what would be necessary to make it true; namely, a fivefold
                    multiplication of the <hi rend="italic">penny</hi> letters, as well as of the
                    others? In <hi rend="italic">substance,</hi> then, there is an agreement as to

                    >data</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the number of letters from which a given
                    revenue is <hi rend="italic">at present</hi> drawn.</p></note></p><p>Finding the
                    average postage of a letter is merely another method of arriving at the same
                    result. The average postage of a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> post letter,
                    appears from the returns to be above 10d. An eight-fold increase (at l∣d. on
                    average for each letter) would therefore produce the same amount on the present
                    number at 10d. Other two folds of an increase would produce L.475,000, to which
                    the L.200,000 for foreign and ship letters being added, there would be L.675,000
                    for additional expenses. While it is admitted then to be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >vague</hi> statement, (vague as respects the estimate of the increased expense,
                    which can only be a guess), it is believed to be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >moderate</hi> one, to say, that on ten-fold increase of general post letters,
                    with a three-fold increase on the <hi rend="italic">twopenny</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">threepenny</hi> post letters, would be necessary to uphold the
                    present revenue.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    average postage of a letter has been represented to be 6jd; consequently, it is
                    meant to be inferred, a sixfold increase, or little more, would produce the
                    present revenue. But if this is the average <hi rend="italic">at all,</hi> is it
                    the average otherwise than by including the penny and twopenny letters <hi

                    not the more unscrupulous supporters of Mr. Hill’s plan, who blazon abroad
                    partial statements of the kind, see that they prove too much? If 6 Id. is the
                    average of <hi rend="italic">increasable,</hi> that is, of general post letters,
                    (the sense intended to be conveyed) what becomes of the outcry about the

                    certainty, to any part of the known world, and will he sympathise in the
                    complaint of excessive charge? Mr. Hill’s plan may safely be allowed to rest on
                    its merits; let it be allowed to rest there, without the employment of deception
                    and misrepresentation.</p></note></p><p>This, indeed, is a calculation, both the

                    twenty shillings to the post-office in a twelvemonth, may verify on five
                    minutes’ reflection. Let such a one consider, whether the average of his <hi

                    the average cost were reduced to l∣d., whether it could require less than ten
                    letters for one, taking into consideration the increase of expense, to uphold
                    the present revenue?</p><p>Passing now from matters of calculation, to those of
                    conjecture and estimate, we encounter, as maybe supposed, a much wider diversity
                    of opinions. This head embraces that most essential question,—what precise
                    increase of correspondence might be expected unde· such a reduction as
                    recommended by Mr. Hill. That an increase would take place which, absolutely
                    speaking, may be characterized as immense, may be held as at all hands
                    acknowledged; but in specifying the probable rate of such increase, in relation
                    to that which would be necessary for the safety of the revenue, there is every
                    possible variety of estimate,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The importance of keeping these two points distinct in the
                    mind, is shewn from this, that Lord Ashburton is made, in the Appendix to the
                    Report, to give evidence of the probability of a “great increase,” while his
                    Lordship explicitly states his belief, that the adoption of Mr. Hill’s plan
                    would be equivalent to a surrenderor the whole post-office revenue.</p></note>
                    ranging from, “very considerable” up to “beyond calculation,” from four to a
                    hundred fold ∙, of which extremes the <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> may be given
                    as “ten-fold,” or “increase that would keep up the revenue.” It is obvious,
                    however, that evidence of this nature requires to be received with some degree
                    of deduction. Besides being mostly <hi rend="italic">conjectural,</hi> it may be
                    said to be all <hi rend="italic">ex-parte,</hi> brought forward <hi
                    rend="italic">in support</hi> of the scheme, the eligibility of which was the
                    subject of investigation. There is no opposing party. Government is constrained,
                    in such an inquiry, to be neutral. To the administrators of the post-office,
                    interference would be an invidious office, seeing that even their evidence is
                    apt to be viewed as that of interested, or at all events, prejudiced persons.
                    The cross-examinations instituted by some of the members of the Committee, would
                    be required even as a counterpoise to the effect of leading questions put
                    (certainly without the slightest appearance of unfair intentions) by the others.
                    When to this is added the significant fact, that few, indeed, of the witnesses
                    ventured to state, that they would pay as much postage under the proposed
                    reduction as at present, (while an increase of outlay is admitted to be
                    inevitable on such reduction) and that the generality only hoped for a surplus
                    revenue equal to the present, after the lapse of a considerable period; when we
                    advert to another important fact, that scarcely one of the witnesses professed
                    to have examined Mr. Hill’s calculations, but merely to have <hi rend="italic"
                    >assumed</hi> their correctness; when these considerations ate taken into
                    account, it is surely not too much to say, that the adoption of the plan in
                    question would place the post-office revenue in very imminent hazard.</p><p>But
                    although Mr. Hill’s plan has been perilled by some of his supporters, if not by
                    himself, on this issue, that it would, at least, maintain the present revenue,
                    its proved insufficiency <hi rend="italic">on this issue,</hi> is not, on a
                    larger view of the question, to be viewed as conclusive against it. Even in a
                    financial point of view, a defalcation in this source of revenue would probably
                    be met by a proportionate growth in others. The increased facilities given to
                    trade, would, in a variety of ways, tend to the creation of revenue. Even the
                    increase on the paper duties might not be an inconsiderable item, though perhaps
                    liable to be balanced by a corresponding decrease on those on advertisements.
                    Viewing the advantage to commerce, literature, and morality, which would arise
                    from a cheap system of postage, there are probably few persons conversant with
                    subjects of social or political economy, who would advocate the employment of
                    the post-office as a source of revenue, on any other grounds than, in the
                    present circumstances of this country, the difficulty of finding another as a
                    snbstitute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Might such a
                    mode as this be suggested:— Let a bill be brought into Parliament, to grant her

                    after the manner described by Mr. Hill; but containing provisions, that any
                    deficiency of such revenue is to be supplied from other <hi rend="italic"
                    >defined</hi> sources. Let these sources be named by the Chancellor of the
                    Exchequer, or offered by the supporters of Mr. Hill’s scheme, (to which the
                    latter could not object, as on their principles the provisions would be
                    inoperative for want of occasion ;) but, at all events, agreed upon as an
                    essential part of the bill.</p></note></p><p>Put off the supposition, however,
                    that such an increase of correspondence would ensue, as that which has been

                    the estimates on this point, the question has arisen, to what extent a
                    corresponding increase of the post establishment must take place, both as
                    regards the <hi rend="italic">space</hi> in which the duties are to be
                    performed, and the number of persons required for such performances.<note

                    which would be experienced in the <hi rend="italic">dispatch</hi> of the mails
                    from London, and other large offices, under the circumstances of the closeness
                    of the hour of receipt to that of dispatch, to which the public are accustomed,
                    and the great proportion of letters that are put in at the very latest
                    hour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Various
                    suggestions might be offered tor !essening this difficulty. For a time, at
                    least, the system of receiving a∕ce with late letters might be extended. This
                    would be no nullification of the boon of a cheap postage; for it would be the
                    fairest and most convenient way of throwing the expense on those who most
                    created it, and whocou∣d best find their account in increasing it. Or London
                    might be split down into separate post towns, with separate bags from earh, (an
                    inconvenience that would be gradually diminishin·;, as railways, with mot∣&gt;ng
                    offices. were established.) Or three or four different kinds of stamped covers
                    might be sold, distinguishing by colour, and marked respectively, <hi
                    rend="italic">late, later, latest,</hi> and charged 3d., od , or Is. ea. h, to
                    be received up to certain hours, A cierk, at the receiving box, could, with
                    great quickness, throw out in transition all of the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>
                    colour for the <hi rend="italic">hou</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> to wait next
                    dispatch; or, as often as the sorting boxes are filled, their contents might be
                    transfened to the tags.</p></note> On these points, the officers of the
                    post-office, who can alone, or who can best form an opinion, while they concur
                    in stating that a large additional expense would certainly be incurred, profess
                    not to be able to form, or, in point of fact, not to have formed, any definite
                    idea of its extent. The sums put to this amount in the foregoing calculations,
                    may be considered as stated in mere conjecture; nor is it very easy to offer
                    anything on the subject further than to observe, that any saving of time or
                    labour, in regard to the business of dispatch, effected by Mr. Hill’s plan,
                    applies only to the taxing; partly, if at all, to the examination, and to the
                    telling up: the duty occupying the longest time, (that of sorting) together with
                    the stamping, being increased in full proportion to the increase of
                    letters.</p><p>Of the minor difficulties attending Mr. Hill’s plan, that which
                    regards the mode of collecting'the postage on <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi>
                    letters, is the most considerable. Mr. Hill seems latterly to think, that, as
                    regards these, it might be necessary to take payment on delivery. But it seems,
                    by no means clear, that Mr. Hill’s first suggestion on that point, (namely, that
                    of charging twopence in advance outwards, and nothing inwards) is liable to any
                    great objection <hi rend="italic">peculiar to this part of his plan</hi><hi

                    being generally the same who <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> from abroad. The
                    inconvenience of having letters above weight, returned (after opening) from the
                    dead letter office, cannot be allowed to stand in the way of an extensive
                    arrangement otherwise beneficial. If parties would neither be at the pains to
                    weigh their letters, nor <hi rend="italic">use a stamp of a penny higher
                    price,</hi> when in doubt, they might very fairly be left to take the
                    consequence.</p><p>But after considering all the defects and difficulties of Mr.
                    Hill’s plan, the question recurs, if we do not adopt it, what <hi rend="italic"
                    >else</hi> is to be done? That a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> reduction of
                    postage must be made, seems to be universally admitted; but what <hi
                    rend="italic">other</hi> scheme of reduction has been proposed, or who is ready
                    to propose one? If we are to reduce <hi rend="italic">at all,</hi> there seems
                    much reason to question, whether any reduction short of that proposed by Mr.
                    Hill, will be to good purpose. The Committee have recommended a penny rate for
                    distances not exceeding fifteen miles, and twopence for larger distances. But
                    there are not wanting good grounds for maintaining that the penny rate might
                    fetch a greater revenue than the twopenny one.</p><p>Speaking loosely, it may be
                    reckoned that, at a uniform penny postage, a fourfold increase on the general
                    post letters, and a threefold on the twopenny and threepenny, would more than
                    cover the charges of management. That an increase to this extent would ensue,
                    may be held for certain; that it would ensue to double or treble this extent is,
                    if improbable, not beyond the bounds of possibility. So that, at the worst,
                    perhaps, the utmost evil that would arise from the adoption of Mr. Hill’s plan,
                    would be the payment of a million and-a-half of taxes in one way, instead of in
                    another, while the vast advantage of a low rate of postage would be so much
                    clear gainobtained. And this leads to a consideration of what, in a question of
                    political economy, ought to be reckoned the <hi rend="italic">proper
                    measure</hi> of the advantage of Mr. Hill’s plan. Suppose a person to pay L.l
                    a-year in postage, and L.ó in other taxes; suppose that in another year he pays
                    only 5s. for postage, and L.5, 15s. in other taxes, it is evident that, <hi
                    rend="italic">ceteris paribus,</hi> matters will remain the same, both as
                    regards the state and the individual, that is, if the <hi rend="italic">number
                    of letters</hi> which the individual gets conveyed <hi rend="italic">remains the
                    same.</hi> But if, on the latter supposition, he gets twenty-five letters
                    conveyed, while on the former he only got twenty, the conveyance of the five
                    letters additional is a clear advantage gained. The true measure then of the
                    benefits of Mr. Hill’s plan, is not the amount of surplus revenue it creates, as
                    relative to the present, but the <hi rend="italic">number of letters conveyed,
                    on that plan, as relative to the expense of conveyance. If</hi> Mr. Hill, by
                    adding twenty-five <hi rend="italic">per cent,</hi> to the cost of conveyance,
                    can add 100 per cent, to the number of letters conveyed, this is clear benefit.
                    And as there can be no real advantage from the adoption of his plan that does
                    not resolve into this principle, so (speaking on the abstract) any alleged
                    disadvantage, not resolving into the same principle, may be regarded as only
                    apparent.</p></note></p>
                <p>The French post-office, after the modern system, had its <pb corresp="pbn7496"
                    facs="nls:193538823" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8823-0496"/>origin early in the 17th
                    century. Asin Britain, its revenues at first accrued to the postmaster, and were
                    next for a time farmed. In 1791, the French post-office yielded a revenue of
                    11,000,000 of francs; about thirty years later, the revenue had become nearly
                    double, and in 1836 it amounted to 37,405,516 francs; the number of letters for
                    that year being 78,970,561. The French post establishment is under the direction
                    of a council, consisting of a chief, and two or more members. The French differs
                    from the British office, in charging postage by <hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> a
                    mode usual throughout the continent. The French office has been remarkable for
                    the facilities it affords to the circulation of printed matter. All sorts of
                    circulars, lists, advertisements, and the like, may first be stamped on payment
                    of five centimes, and then transmitted by post for ten centimes more, in whole
                    about 1½d. British money. The number of such circulars passing through the
                    French post-office is immense. The business of the Parisian office even exceeds
                    that of the London, there being from forty to fifty thousand letters, and
                    100,000 printed papers of different descriptions, dispatched from the former
                    daily, Sundays not excepted. The French post towns amount in number to about
                    1460, but the post accommodation is carried to the utmost possible extent,
                    letters being delivered not merely within the towns and villages, but throughout
                    the country generally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The average of each letter is about fivepence. In Britain, it is probably
                    double this, at least. The charges of collection in France are about 50 per
                    cent., in Britain 28 per cent.</p></note> The same degree of dispatch in post

                <p>The post-office of the United States is under the charge of the general
                    government. For a long period it was a source of expense, and it is only during
                    the last six or seven years that it has yielded a revenue, which, however, is
                    now rapidly increasing. The following particulars regarding its present state,
                    are from a report of the Postmaster-General of the United States to the
                    President. On the first of July 1837, the post routes were about 141,242 miles
                    in extent, and the annual transportation of the mails upon them was: on horses
                    and in sulkeys 11,999,282 miles; in stages and coaches 18,804,800; and in
