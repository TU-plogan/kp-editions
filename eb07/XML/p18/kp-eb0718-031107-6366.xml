                    possession of one man or woman at the same time.</p>
                <p>Polygamy is so universally esteemed unlawful, and even unnatural, throughout
                    Europe, and in all Christian countries, that we have generally reasoned upon
                    this conviction. Both religion and reason appear at first sight at least to
                    condemn it; and with this view of the subject mankind in general remain
                    satisfied. But some bolder geniuses have taken the opposite side of the
                    question, cast off the prejudices of education, and attempted to show that
                    polygamy is not unlawful, but that it is just and necessary, and would be a
                    public benefit. Such writers recur to the common subterfuge, of which every
                    setter up of strange gods, and every conscientious troubler of the public peace,
                    have artfully availed themselves, to silence the clamour of expostulation.</p>
                <p>Dr Percival<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans,
                    vol. Ixvi. part i. p. 163.</p></note> has very justly observed, that the
                    practice is brutal, destructive to friendship and moral sentiment, inconsistent
                    with one great end of marriage (the education of children), and subversive of
                    the natural rights of more than half of the species. Besides, it is injurious to
                    population, and therefore can never be countenanced or allowed in a
                    well-regulated state; for though the number of females in the world may
                    considerably exceed the number of males, yet there are more men capable of
                    propagating their species than women capable of bearing children; and it is a
                    well-known fact, that Armenia, in which a plurality of wives is not allowed,
                    abounds more with inhabitants than any other province of the Turkish empire.</p>
                <p>Indeed it appears, that in several countries where it is allowed, the inhabitants
                    do not take advantage of it. “The Europeans,” says Μ. Niebuhr,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Niebuhr’s Travels.</p></note>
                    “are mistaken in thinking the state of marriage so different amongst the
                    Mussulmans from what it is with Christian nations. I could not discern any such
                    difference in Arabia. The women of that country seem to be as free and as happy
                    as those of Europe possibly can be. Polygamy is permitted, indeed, amongst
                    Mahommedans, and the delicacy of our ladies is shocked at this idea; but the
                    Arabians rarely avail themselves of the privilege of marrying four lawful wives,
                    and entertaining at the same time any number of female slaves. None but rich
                    voluptuaries marry so many wives, and their conduct is blamed by all sober men.
                    Men of sense, indeed, think this privilege rather troublesome than convenient. A
                    husband is by law obliged to treat his wives suitably to their condition, and to
                    dispense his favours amongst them with perfect <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193536379" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6379-0312"/>equality; but these are
                    duties not a little disagreeable to most Mussulmans; and such modes of luxury
                    are too expensive to the Arabians, who are seldom in easy circumstances. I must,
                    however, except one case; for it sometimes happens that a man marries a number
                    of wives in the way of commercial speculation. I know a Mullah, in a town near
                    the Euphrates, who had married four wives, and was supported by the profits of
                    their labour.”</p>
                <p>Selden has proved, in his <hi rend="italic">Uxor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hebraica,</hi> that plurality of wives was allowed, not only amongst the
                    Hebrews, but also amongst all other nations, and in all ages. It is true, the
                    ancient Romans were more severe in their morals, and never practised it, though
                    it was not forbidden amongst them; and Mark Antony is mentioned as the first who
                    took the liberty of having two wives.</p>
                <p>From that time it became pretty frequent in the empire till the reigns of
                    Theodosius, Honorius, and Arcadius, who first prohibited it by express law in
                    393. After this the Emperor Valentinian, by an edict, permitted all the subjects
                    of the empire, if they pleased, to marry several wives. Nor does it appear, from
                    the ecclesiastical history of those times, that the bishops made any opposition
                    to the introduction of polygamy. In effect, there are some even amongst the
                    Christian casuists who do not look on polygamy as in itself criminal. Jurieu
                    observes, that the prohibition of polygamy is a positive law, but from which a
                    man may be exempted by sovereign necessity. Baillet adds, that the example of
                    the patriarchs is a powerful argument in favour of polygamy. Of these arguments
                    we shall speak hereafter.</p>
                <p>It has been much disputed amongst the doctors of the civil law whether polygamy
                    be adultery. In the Roman law it is denominated <hi rend="italic">stuprum,</hi>
                    and punished as such, that is, in some cases capitally. But a smaller punishment
                    is more consistent with the Jewish law, in which the prohibition of adultery is
                    perpetual, but that of polygamy temporary only.</p>
                <p>Bernardus Ochinus, general of the order of Capucins, and afterwards a Protestant,
                    published, about the middle of the sixteenth century, Dialogues in favour of
                    Polygamy, which were answered by Theodore Beza. And about tile close of the last
                    century, an artful treatise was published at London in behalf of a plurality of
                    wives, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Polygamia Triumphatrix,</hi> the
                    author of which assumes the name of <hi rend="italic">Theophilus Aletheus,</hi>
                    though his true name was <hi rend="italic">Lyserus.</hi> He was a native of
                    Saxony, and his work has been answered by several writers.</p>
                <p>A new argument in favour of polygamy has been adduced by Mr Bruce, on the
                    principle, that in some parts of the world the proportion of female children is
                    much greater than that of the males. “From diligent inquiry,” says he, “into the
                    south and scripture part of Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Syria, from Mousul or
                    Nineveh, to Aleppo and Antioch, I find the proportion to be fully two women to
                    one man. There is indeed a fraction over, but it is not a considerable one. From
                    Latikea, Laodicea <hi rend="italic">ad mare,</hi> down the coast of Syria to
                    Sidon, the number is nearly three, or two and three fourths, to one man. Through
                    the Holy Land, the country called <hi rend="italic">Horan,</hi> in the Isthmus
                    of Suez, and the parts of the Delta unfrequented by strangers, it is something
                    less than three. But from Suez to the Straits of Babelmandel, which contains the
                    three Arabias, the proportion is fully four women to one man; which, I have
                    reason to believe, holds as far as the line, and 30° beyond it. The imam of Sama
                    was not an old man when I was in Arabia Felix in 1769; but he had eighty-eight
                    children then alive, of whom fourteen only were sons. The priest of the Nile had
                    seventy and odd children; of whom, as I remember, above fifty were
                    daughters.</p>
                <p>“It may be objected, that Dr Arbuthnot, in quoting the bills of mortality for
                    twenty years, gave the most unexceptionable grounds for his opinion; and that my
                    single exception of what happens in a foreign country, without further
                    foundation, cannot be admitted as equivalent testimony; and I am ready to admit
                    this objection, as there are no bills of mortality in any of these countries. I
                    shall therefore say in what manner I attained the knowledge which I have just
                    mentioned. Whenever I went into a town, village, or inhabited place, dwelt long
                    in a mountain, or travelled journeys with any set of people, I always made it my
                    business to inquire how many children they had, or their fathers, their next
                    neighbours or acquaintance. I then asked my landlord at Sidon, suppose him a
                    weaver, how many children he has had? He tells me how many sons and how many
                    daughters. The next I ask is a tailor, a smith, &amp;c., in short every man who
                    is not a stranger, from whom I can get the proper information. I say, therefore,
                    that a medium of both sexes, arising from three or four hundred families,
                    indiscriminately taken, shall be the proportion in which one differs from the
                    other; and this, I am confident, will give the result to be three women in 50°
                    of the 90° under every meridian of the globe.”</p>
                <p>The same author corroborates his argument by supposing that Mahommed perceived
                    this disproportion, and that upon it he founded his institution allowing one man
                    to have four wives. “With this view he enacted, or rather revived, the law which
                    gave liberty to every individual to marry four wives, each of whom was to be
                    equal in rank and honour, without any preference but what the predilection of
                    the husband gave her.”</p>
                <p>Having thus established, as he supposes, the necessity of polygamy in the East,
                    Bruce proceeds to consider whether there is not some other reasons why it should
                    not be practised in Britain further than the mere equality in numbers of the
                    sexes to one another. This reason he finds in the difference between the
                    constitutions of the Europeans and eastern nations. “Women in England,” says he,
                    “are capable of child-bearing at fourteen; let the other term be forty-eight,
                    when they bear no more; thirty-four years therefore an English woman bears
                    children. At the age of fourteen or fifteen they are objects of our love; they
                    are endeared by bearing us children after that time; and none, I hope, will
                    pretend, that at forty-eight and fifty an Englishwoman is not an agreeable
                    companion. The Arab, on the other hand, if she begins to bear children at
                    eleven, seldom or never has a child after twenty. The time, then, of her
                    child-bearing is nine years; and four women, taken altogether, have then the
                    term of thirty-six. So that the English woman that bears children for
                    thirty-four years has only two years less than the term enjoyed by the four
                    wives whom Mahommed has allowed; and if it be granted that an English wife may
                    bear at fifty, the terms are equal. But there are other grievous differences. An
                    Arabian girl at eleven years old, by her youth and beauty, is the object of
                    man’s desire: being an infant, however, in understanding, she is not a rational
                    companion for him. A man marries there, say at twenty; and before he is thirty,
                    his wife, improved as a companion, ceases to be the object of his desires and a
                    mother of children: so that all the best and most vigorous of his days are spent
                    with a woman he cannot love; and with her he would be destined to live forty or
                    forty-five years, without comfort to himself by increase of family, or utility
                    to the public. The reasons, then, against polygamy, which subsist in England, do
                    not by any means subsist in Arabia; and that being the case, it would be
                    unworthy of the wisdom of God, and an unevenness in his ways, which we shall
                    never see, to subject two nations under such different circumstances absolutely
                    to the same observances.”</p>
                <p>To all this argumentation, however, it may be replied, that whatever we may now
                    suppose to be the constitution of nature in the warmer parts of the globe, it
                    certainly was different at the beginning. We cannot, indeed, ascertain <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193536392" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6392-0313"/> the exact
                    position of the Garden of Eden; but it is with reason supposed not to have been
                    far from the ancient seat of Babylon. In that country, therefore, where Mr Bruce
                    contends that four women are necessary to the comfort of one man, it pleased God
                    to grant only one to the first man; and that, too, when there was more occasion
                    for population than ever there has been since, because the whole earth was to be
                    peopled from a single pair. Matters were not altered at the Flood; for Noah had
                    but one wife. And this is the very argument used by our Saviour himself when
                    speaking of divorce without any sufficient cause, and then marrying another
                    woman, which is a species of polygamy.</p>
                <p>Again, with respect to the alleged multiplicity of females in the eastern part of
                    the world, it is by no means probable that the calculations of Mr Bruce or any
                    other person can be admitted in this case. History mentions no such thing in any
                    nation; and considering the vast destruction amongst the male part of the human
                    species more than that of the females, by war and other accidents, we may safely
                    say, that if four women children were born for every single male, there would in
                    such countries be five or six grown-up women for every man; a proportion which
                    we may venture to affirm does not, and never did, exist anywhere in the world.
                    .That it was not so in former times, we can only judge from the particular
                    examples recorded in history, and these are but few. We read in the Greek
                    history, indeed, of the fifty daughters of Danaus; but these are matched by as
                    many sons of another man. Job had only one wife, yet had seven sons and but
                    three daughters. Jacob had two wives, who bore twelve sons, and only one
                    daughter. Abraham had only one child by his first wife, and that was a son. By
                    his second wife Keturah he had six sons; and, considering his advanced age at
                    the time he married her, it is by . no means probable that he could have
                    twenty-four daughters; nay, if, as Mr Bruce tells us, the women in the eastern
                    countries bear children only for nine years, it was impossible she could have so
                    many. Gideon, who had many wives, had no fewer than seventy sons by these wives,
                    and even his concubine had a son; so that if all these women had produced
                    according to Mr Bruce’s proportion, of nearly three females to one male, he must
                    have had almost two hundred and eighty-four children; a more numerous family
                    probably than any of which Mr Bruce’s eastern acquaintance can boast.</p>
                <p>With regard to the subject, however, it must be observed, that the procreation of
                    male or female children depends in some degree on the health and vigour of the
                    parents. It is by no means improbable, therefore, that the eastern voluptuaries,
                    whose constitutions are debilitated by their excesses, may have many more female
                    than male children born to them.</p>
                <p>The boldest defence of polygamy that has appeared in modern times is that by the
                    Rev. Mr Madan, who published a treatise artfully vindicating and strongly
                    recommending it, under the title of Thelyphthora, or a Treatise on Female Ruin,
                    in its Causes, Effects, Consequences, Prevention, and Remedy. Marriage,
                    according to this writer, simply and wholly consists in the act of personal
                    union, or <hi rend="italic">actus coitus.</hi> Adultery, he says, is never used
                    in the sacred writings but to denote the defilement of a betrothed or married
                    woman, and to this sense he restricts the use of the term; so that a married
                    man, in his opinion, is no adulterer, if his commerce with the sex be confined
                    to single women, who are under no obligations by espousals or marriage to other
                    men; but, on the other hand, the woman who should dare to have even but once an
                    intrigue with any other man besides her husband, let him have as many wives as
                    Solomon, would, <hi rend="italic">ipso facto,</hi> be an adulteress, and ought,
                    together with her gallant, to be punished with immediate death. This, he boldly
                    says, is the law of God, and on this foundation he limits the privilege of
                    polygamy to the man; in support of which he refers to the polygamous connections
                    of the patriarchs and saints of the Old Testament, and infers the lawfulness of
                    their practice from the blessings which attended it, and the laws which were
                    instituted to regulate and superintend it. He contends for the lawfulness of
                    Christians having, like the ancient Jews, more wives than one, and labours much
                    to reconcile the genius of the evangelical dispensation with an arrangement of
                    this sort. With this view he asserts, that there is not a single text in the New
                    Testament that even hints at the criminality of polygamous connection; and he
                    would infer from St Paul’s direction, that bishops and deacons should have but
                    one wife, that it was lawful for laymen to have more. Jesus Christ, he says, was
                    not the giver of a new law; but the business of marriage, polygamy, and divorce,
                    had been settled before his appearance in the world, by an authority which could
                    not be revoked. Besides, this writer not only thinks polygamy lawful in a
                    religious, but advantageous in a civil light, and highly politic in a domestic
                    view.</p>
                <p>In defence of his notion of marriage, which, he says, consists in the union of
                    man and woman as one body, the effects of which in the sight of God no outward
                    forms or ceremonies of man’s invention can add to or detract from, he grounds
                    his principal argument on the Hebrew words made use of in Genesis (ii. 24) to
                    express the primitive institution of marriage, viz. ww<hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    p□ι, rendered by the Seventy <hi rend="italic">πζοσκοXKn!)ησεται ττξος
                    τη</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">γυναίκα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αi&gt;του,</hi> which translation is adopted by the evangelist (Mat. xix. 5),
                    with the omission only of the superfluous preposition (ngo¢) after the verb. Our
                    translation, “shall cleave to his wife,” does not, he says, convey the idea of
                    the Hebrew, which is literally, as Montanus renders the words, “shall be joined
                    or cemented <hi rend="italic">in</hi> his woman, and they shall become (by this
                    union) one flesh.” But on this criticism it is well remarked, that both the
                    Hebrew and Greek terms mean simply and literally attachment or adherence; and
                    are evidently made use of in the sacred writings to express the whole scope of
                    conjugal fidelity and duty, though he would restrain them to the grosser part of
                    it.</p>
                <p>With respect to the Mosaic law, for which Mr Madan is a warm advocate, it was
                    certainly a local and temporary institution, adapted to the ends for which it
                    was appointed, and admirably calculated, in its relation to marriage, to
                    maintain and perpetuate the separation of the Jewish people from the Gentiles.
                    In attempting to depreciate the outward forms of marriage, this writer would
                    make his readers believe, that because none are explicitly described, therefore
                    none existed; and consequently that they are the superfluous ordinances of human
                    policy. But it is evident, from comparing Ruth (iv. 10, 13) with Tobit (vii. 13,
                    14), and from the case of Dinah, related in Genesis (xxxiv.), that some forms
                    were deemed essential to an honourable marriage by the patriarchs and saints
                    under the Old Testament, exclusive of the carnal knowledge of each other’s
                    persons. It is also evident in the case of the woman of Samaria, whose
                    connection with a man not her husband is mentioned in John,'iv., that something
                    besides cohabitation is necessary to constitute marriage in the sight of
                    God.</p>
                <p>Having stated his notion of marriage, the same writer urges, in defence of
                    polygamy, that, notwithstanding the seventh commandment, it was allowed by God
                    himself, who made laws for the regulation of it, wrought miracles in support of
                    it by making the barren woman fruitful, and declared the issue legitimate, to
                    all intents and purposes. God’s allowance of polygamy is argued from Exodus,
                    xxi. 10, and particularly from Deut. xxi. 15, which, he says, amounts to a
                    demonstration. This passage, however, at the utmost, only presupposes that the
                    practice might have existence amongst so hard-hearted and fickle a people as the
                    Jews; and therefore wisely provides against some of its more unjust and
                    pernicious consequences, such as tended to affect <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193536405" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6405-0314"/>the rights and privileges of
                    heirship. Laws enacted to regulate it cannot be fairly urged in proof of its
                    lawfulness, on the author’s own hypothesis; because laws were also made to
                    regulate divorce, which Mr Madan condemns as absolutely unlawful, except in
                    cases of adultery. Besides, it is more probable that the “hated wife” had been
                    dismissed by a bill of divorcement, than that she was retained by her husband;
                    and, moreover, it is not certain but that the two wives, so far from living with
                    the same husband at the same time, might be dead; for the words may be rendered
                    thus, “If there <hi rend="italic">should have been</hi> to a man two wives,”
                    &amp;c. The words expressing the original institution of marriage (Genesis, ii.
                    24), compared with Matthew (xix. 4, 5, 8), afford insuperable objections against
                    Mr Madan’s doctrine of polygamy.</p>
                <p>If we appeal on this subject from the authority of Scripture to the writings of
                    the earliest Fathers in the Christian church, there is not to be found the
                    faintest trace of anything resembling a testimony to the lawfulness of polygamy;
                    on the contrary, many passages occur in which the practice of it is strongly and
                    explicitly condemned.</p>
                <p>In a word, when we reflect that the primitive institution of marriage limited it
                    to one man and one woman; that this institution was adhered to by Noah and his
                    sons, amidst the degeneracy in which they lived, and in spite of the examples of
                    polygamy which the accursed race of Cain had introduced;—when we consider how
                    very few, comparatively speaking, were the examples of this practice amongst the
                    faithful; how much it brought its own punishment along with it; and how dubious
                    and equivocal those passages are in which it appears to have the sanction of
                    divine approbation ;—when to these reflections we add another, respecting the
                    limited views and temporary nature of the more ancient dispensations and
                    institutions of religion; how often the imperfections and even vices of the
                    patriarchs and people of God, in the olden time, are recorded, without any
                    express notification of their criminality; how much is said to be commanded,
                    which our reverence for the holiness of God and his law will only suffer us to
                    suppose were, for wise ends, permitted; how frequently the messengers of God
                    adapted themselves to the genius of the people to whom they were sent, and the
                    circumstances of the times in which they lived ;—above all, when we consider the
                    purity, equity, and benevolence of the Christian law; the explicit declarations
                    of our Lord, and his apostle . St Paul, respecting the institution of marriage,
                    its design and limitation ;—when we reflect, too, on the testimony of the most
                    ancient fathers, who could not possibly be ignorant of the general and common
                    practice of the apostolic church ;—and, finally, when to these considerations we
                    add those which are founded on justice to the female sex, and all the
                    regulations of domestic economy and national policy,—we must wholly condemn the
                    revival of polygamy, and thus bear our honest testimony against the leading
                    design of this and all similar publications.</p>
