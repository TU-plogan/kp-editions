                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">POLITIAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Angelo</hi></label>, was born
                    at Monte Pulciano in Tuscany, in the year 1454. He studied the Greek language,
                    of which he became a complete master, under Andronicus of Thessalonica. He is
                    said to have written verses both in Greek and in Latin when he was not more than
                    twelve years of age. He also studied the Platonic philosophy under Marsilius
                    Ficinus, and that of Aristotle under Argyropylus. Politian was one of the most
                    learned and polite writers of his time. The first work which gained him a
                    reputation was a poem on the tournament of Julian de’ Medicis. The account he
                    wrote, some time afterwards, of the conspiracy of the Pazzi, was also very much
                    esteemed. He composed many other pieces which merit approbation; and had he
                    lived longer, he would have enriched the republic of letters with many excellent
                    works. He died at the age of forty. His morals answered the homeliness of his
                    face rather than the beauty of his genius; for Paul Jovius informs us, that he
                    was a man of singularly awkward and perverse manners, of a countenance by no
                    means open and liberal, a nose remarkably large, and squinting eyes. “He was
                    crafty, satirical, and full of inward malice; for his constant way was to sneer
                    and ridicule the productions of other men, and never to allow any criticism,
                    however just, upon his own.”</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Politian was a man of consummate erudition; and not only so, but a
                    very polite and elegant writer. Erasmus, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ciceronianus,</hi> calls him a rare miracle of nature, on account of his
                    excelling in every kind of writing. “Fateor angelum prorsus angelica fuisse
                    mente, rarum naturae miraculum, ad quodcunque scripti genus applicaret animum.”
                    Some of his poems were so much admired, that several learned men have made it
                    their business to comment on them. It has often been reported that he spoke of
                    the Bible with contempt; and that, having read it but once, he complained that
                    he had never spent his time so ill. But this is not probable; for it must be
                    remembered that he was a priest and canon of Florence, and we learn from one of
                    his epistles that he preached during a whole Lent. It does not indeed follow
                    from this that he did not think contemptuously of the Bible, because many of his
                    church, especially amongst the better sort, have not been very orthodox
                    believers, and he might be one of these; but it is not likely he would speak out
                    so freely. “I could much more easily believe,” says Bayle, “the judgment he is
                    said to have pronounced on the Psalms of David and the Odes of Pindar. He did
                    not deny that there are many good and fine things in the Psalms; but he
                    pretended that the same things appear in Pindar with more brightness and
                    sweetness.” The two Scaligers have spoken highly of Politiam The elder has
                    preferred a consolatory elegy of his to that which Ovid sent to Livia upon the
                    death of Drusus, and says he would rather have been the author of it; the
                    younger calls him an excellent poet, but thinks the style of his epistles too
                    inflated and declamatory.</p>
                <p>The first edition of the works of Politian is that of Aldus, Venice, 1498, in
                    folio, which was followed by those of Paris, Badius, 1512 and 1519, in the same
                    form, and Lyons, Gryphes, 1528, 1533, and 1545, in two volumes 8vo. But the most
                    complete edition is that which appeared at Basil in 1553, and is the only one
                    that contains the history of the Conspiracy of the Pazzi, which had been
                    published separately in 1472, in 4to, probably at Florence, and which J. Adimari
                    reprinted at Naples in 1769, 4to. The original edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanea,</hi> Florence, 1489, in folio, is in greater request than those of
                    Brescia, 1496, Venice, 1508, and Basil, 1522, all in folio. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Stanze</hi> were reprinted at Bologna with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orfeo,</hi> 1494, in 4to; and many other editions followed, till 1820, when
                    they were inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Poetica
                    Italiana.</hi></p>
