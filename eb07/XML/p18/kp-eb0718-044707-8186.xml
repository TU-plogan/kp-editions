                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    />December 1759, was the son of Mr. Huggin Porson, parish clerk of East Ruston,
                    near North Walsham, in Norfolk.</p>
                <p>His father taught him, in his childhood, to practise all the common rules of
                    arithmetic by memory only; and, before he was nine years old, he had learned to
                    extract the cube root in this manner. At the same time, for teaching him to read
                    and write, he employed the method which has since been generally introduced in
                    the schools of mutual instruction, making him draw the letters with chalk or on
                    sand; and the neatness and accuracy of his hand-writing, for which he was
                    distinguished through life, may be considered as bearing ample testimony to his
                    father’s ingenuity and success.</p>
                <p>At the age of nine he was sent to a village school, kept by a Mr. Summers; but
                    his father still made him repeat by heart in the evening the whole of the
                    lessons of the day; and there seems to be sufficient evidence for considering
                    this practice of exercising the memory continually, in very early life, as the
                    best, if not the only method of cultivating, if not of producing great talent.
                    For though a strong memory by no means constitutes talent, yet its possession is
                    almost a necessary condition for the successful exertion of talent in general;
                    and, indeed, it is very possible that the other faculties of the mind may be
                    strengthened by the early cultivation of this one. It is remarkable that Wallis,
                    who was as deservedly celebrated in his day as Porson, for his unerring
                    sagacity, had also a singular facility of retaining numbers and calculations in
                    his memory, but without having taken any particular pains to acquire the habit.
                    Mr. Hewitt, the vicar of the parish of East Ruston, hearing of young Porson’s
                    uncommon capacity, undertook to instruct both him and his brother Thomas in
                    classical literature; and when he was about fifteen, Mr. Norris, a wealthy and
                    respectable gentleman of the neighbourhood, having ascertained the truth of the
                    reports that he heard of him, resolved to be at the expense of sending him to
                    Eton. Without this assistance it would have been impossible for Porson to have
                    acquired great excellence in any intellectual pursuit; for his father’s
                    situation in life was not such as to exempt his son even from the subordinate
                    occupations of the country. He went out gleaning, in the autumn, with a Horace
                    in his pocket; and he had learned by experience to appreciate the mechanical
                    labours of Penelope, before he was much acquainted with the wisdom and
                    wanderings of Ulysses.</p>
                <p>At Eton, his talents procured him the friendship and admiration of the seniors
                    amongst his schoolfellows, and, upon the unfortunate death of his first patron,
                    Mr. Norris, be found a number of liberal contributors, who stepped forward to
                    supply the deficiency; but by far the most active of them was Sir George Baker,
                    then President of the Royal College of Physicians, a man as much distinguished
                    by his own classical taste and acquirements, as by his laudable disposition to
                    cherish learning in others. He received the boy into his house for a vacation,
                    and undertook, at the request of a relation of Mr. Norris, the disagreeable task
                    of receiving, in small sums, as much as was sufficient to purchase an income of
                    L.80 a-year, for a few years, in the short annuities, which served, with great
                    economy, to enable him to remain at Eton. This favour appears to have been too
                    great to be properly acknowledged, or perhaps even duly appreciated, by its
                    object, who only after many years paid Sir George the tardy compliment of a
                    dedication, not, however, of an edition, but of a handsome copy of a single play
                    of Euripides. In his own opinion, Porson learned little at Eton besides the
                    quantity of syllables, being able to repeat by heart before he went there the
                    principal part of the authors that he had to read; that is, almost the whole of
                    Horace and Virgil, the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and many parts of Cicero,
                    Livy, and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> A story is accordingly told of his
                    book having been changed by one of his schoolfellows in joke, when he was going
                    up to a lesson in Horace, and of his having read and translated what was
                    required of him, without at all betraying the change to his master. At the same
                    time, the emulation of a public school must have been a great advantage to him,
                    as affording him a motive for exertion in his exercises, whether they were to be
                    called his own, or to be written for other boys. It was a copy of Toup’s
                    Longinus, presented to him as a reward for a good exercise, that first gave him
                    a decided inclination for the pursuit of critical researches; but he always
                    considered Bentley and Dawes as his great masters in criticism.</p>
                <p>In 1777 he was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, and at first he began to apply
                    more particularly to the mathematics, which had been the favourite study of his
                    boyhood, and in which, as he himself remarked, his proficiency first brought him
                    into a certain degree of public notice. He was, however, soon diverted from this
                    pursuit, although he attained a place amongst the <hi rend="italic">senior
                    optimes</hi> of his year. But he was in fact more calculated for classical than
                    for mathematical excellence. His memory would have been in a great measure
                    thrown away, if he had been employed in abstract calculations; and his inventive
                    powers do not appear to have been at all of the same class with his retentive
                    faculties; although certainly in the mechanical pursuit of the fashionable
                    methods of modern analysis, which are intended, like steam engines, to overcome
                    all difficulties by the inanimate force of mere patience and perseverance, he
                    was capable of filling as dis inguished a place as any living algebraist. The
                    classical prize medal, and the university scholarship, he obtained without
                    difficulty, as matters of course. The exercise, which he exhibited upon the
                    examination for the scholarship, is the well known translation of an epitaph
                    into Greek iambics; which, although not free from some inaccuracies in the use
                    of the tenses, is still a very remarkable production, when it is considered as
                    having been completed in less than an hour, with the help of Morrell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> only, and never afterwards corrected.</p>
                <p>He obtained a fellowship of Trinity College in 1781, and took his degree of
                    Master of Arts in 1785; but not thinking it right to subscribe the Articles of
                    the Church of England, he could not enter into orders, and he was therefore
                    unavoidably deprived of his fellowship in 179L having no dependence left for his
                    subsistence through life, but his own abilities and acquirements. His friends,
                    however, did not abandon him on this urgent occasion, and in order to keep him
                    out of actual want, a private subscription was set on foot, to which Mr.
                    Cracherode was one of the principal contributors, and by which enough was raised
                    to purchase him an annuity of about L.l 00 a-year for life. A small addition was
                    made to bis income, about two years afterwards, by his election to the Greek
                    Professorship at Cambridge, with a salary of only L.40 a-year. The situation,
                    however, gave him the option of at least doubling his whole receipts, by the
                    delivery of an annual course of lectures in the university; and it was supposed
                    that he would have made this exertion, if he had not been discouraged by the
                    difficulty of obtaining rooms in his college, where it would have been his wish
                    to reside.</p>
                <p>Porson married, in 1795, Mrs.Lunan, a sister of the late Mr. Perry, well known as
                    the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle,</hi> but he had the
                    misfortune to lose his wife two years afterwards. Mr. Perry continued to be his
                    greatest friend through life, and was so far his best benefactor, as he knew how
                    to oblige him essentially, without the appearance of doing him a favour. Person
                    had sometimes chambers in the Temple, and sometimes he lodged at the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> office; frequently also he was a visitor at
                    Mr. Perry’s house at Merton, where he had the misfortune to leave several of his
                    books, at the time of a fire, which destroyed them all, and amongst them some
                    letters of Rhunkenius, with whom he had begun a correspondence in 1783, and who
                    had committed to him some valuable fragments of Aeschylus, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193538212" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8212-0449"/>besides his manuscript copy
                    of the lexico of Photius, which had cost him ten months’ labour. He used indeed
                    to say that this fire had destroyed the fruits of twenty years of his life; but
                    he had the resolution to complete a second copy of the Photius, which is now in
                    the library of Trinity College. His fondness for the mechanical employment of
                    his pen has been regretted by some of his biographers, as having tempted him to
                    waste much of his most valuable time on a trifling amusement; but in fact, his
                    mode of writing Greek was fully as much calculated for expedition as for beauty;
                    and those who have not been in the habit of correcting mutilated passages of
                    manuscripts, can form no estimate of the immense advantage that is obtained, by
                    the complete sifting of every letter, which the mind involuntarily performs,
                    whilst the hand is occupied in tracing it; so that, if the correction of Photius
                    was really worth the labour of two years of Porson’s life, it would have been
                    scarcely possible to employ the greater part of those years more advantageously,
                    than by copying him twice over. Mr. Weston, in speaking of “his matchless
                    penmanship,” has observed, not very intelligibly, that “here, indeed, he thought
                    himself surpassed by” another person “not in the stroke, but the sweep, of his
                    letters.” What Porson really said on this subject was, that, with respect to
                    “command of hand,” that person had the advantage, but he preferred the <hi
                    rend="italic">model</hi> on which his own hand was formed. His writing was, in
                    fact, more like that of a scholar, whilst the method explained in Mr. Hodgkin’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Calligraphia</hi> exhibits more the appearance of the work of
                    a writing master; holding, however, a middle place between the neatness of
                    Porson, and the wonderful accuracy of the country schoolmaster who made the fac
                    simile of the Oxford Pindar in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Upon the establishment of the London Institution, his friends obtained for him
                    the very desirable appointment of principal librarian, with a salary of L.200
                    a-year, and apartments in the house of the Institution, which was then in the
                    Old Jewry; but although the arrangement was highly honourable to all parties,
                    the librarianship was little more than a sinecure. Porson was, however, in the
                    habit of attending in his place when the reading-room was open, and of
                    communicating, very readily, all the literary information that was required, by
                    those who consulted him respecting the object of their researches. Had the
                    inhabitants of Finsbury Square and its neighbourhood been more disposed to
                    classical studies, and had the librarian of the Institution survived, to witness
                    its completion and prosperity, his sphere of utility would, without doubt, have
                    been greatly extended.</p>
                <p>But it must ever be lamented that Porson’s habits of life had unfortunately been
                    such as to lay a foundation for a multitude of diseases. He suffered much from
                    asthma throughout the year 1808; his memory began to fail him a little; and in
                    the autumn he had some symptoms of intermittent fever. On Monday the 19th of
                    September he had an apoplectic attack in the street, and he was carried to a
                    neighbouring poor house in a state of insensibility. The next day an
                    advertisement appeared in one of the papers, relating the accident, and
                    describing some manuscripts which were found in his pocket, consisting of Greek
                    fragments and algebraical characters. His friends at the London Institution
                    immediately went in quest of him; he was afterwards well enough to appear in the
                    library, and to receive a visit there from Dr. Adam Clarke; but his speech was
                    impaired, and his faculties evidently imperfect. He survived only through the
                    week, and died in his forty-ninth year, on Sunday the 25th of September 1808, at
                    midnight.</p>
                <p>He was buried at Cambridge, in Trinity College Chapel, near the grave of Bentley,
                    and the monument of Newton. He founded by will an annual prize, to be given to
                    the best Greek translation from an English dramatic author; and several
                    specimens of the successful pieces have been published from time to time in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Classical Journal.</hi> His books were sold by auction, and
                    many of them found purchasers at high prices, especially such as were enriched
                    with any of his manuscript notes in their margins; but more than two hundred of
                    these, which appeared to be the most valuable, were withheld from the sale, and
                    were afterwards purchased, together with the whole of his manuscript papers, by
                    the Society of Trinity College, for the sum of a thousand guineas. He left a
                    sister, married to Mr. Siday Hawes, of Coltishall, Norfolk. His brother Thomas
                    kept a boarding-school at Fakenham, and died, without issue, in 1792: his second
                    brother, Henry, was a farmer in Essex, and died young, leaving three children.
                    His father had lived to 74, his mother to 57.</p>
                <p>The principal works of Porson are his <hi rend="italic">Letters to Travis,</hi>
                    his four plays of Euripides with their prefaces, and the manuscript copy of
                    Photius; the rest, though somewhat voluminous, are chiefly miscellaneous
                    annotations upon detached passages of a multitude of ancient authors. We find
                    nothing in the nature of theory, or of the discovery of general laws, except
                    some canons, which he has laid down, chiefly as having been used by the Greek
                    tragedians in the construction of their verses. These are chiefly contained in
                    the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Hecuba,</hi> together with its supplement.
                    1. The first is, that when a tragic iambic ends with a trisyllable, or a cretic,
                    this word must be preceded either by a short syllable, or by a monosyllable. For
                    example, an ancient tragedian would not have written the line <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,z</hi> E <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> γoι δε <hi
                    rend="italic">μηποτ lξ απfνκroij</hi><hi rend="italic">δώματος,</hi> though it
                    might have been unexceptionable in a comedy. It seems to have been about the
                    year 1790 that Porson first made this observation. He certainly did not attend
                    to it in his own serious translation of the <hi rend="italic">Epitaph on
                    Alexis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it was mentioned, in 179L by one of
                    Porson’s intimate friends, in a moment of conviviality, whilst he was somewhat
                    characteristically attempting to fill his glass out of an empty bottle; and the
                    author of this article observed in answer, that it would certainly sound better,
                    on such an occasion as then occurred, to say, <hi rend="smallcaps">∏Sp</hi>
                    eκ7rε'7rωκαs∙ oυδ <hi rend="superscript"> , w</hi> Ev∈σTI <hi rend="italic"

                    >n0τταβοs.</hi> 2. The second canon is, that an anapaest is only admissible in a
                    tragic iambic, as constituting the first foot, except in some cases of proper
                    names. This indeed had been cursorily hinted by Dawes. 3. The same critic had
                    also remarked, that the Attic poets never lengthen a short vowel before a mute
                    or aspirate, followed by a liquid, or a middle consonant followed by <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ</hi>; and Porson more amply confirmed the observation as very
                    generally, though not universally correct. On the other hand, Dawes had
                    cursorily observed that Homer, and the other ancient epic poets, generally
                    lengthened the vowel in such cases, and Porson’s great rival, Hermann, has more
                    fully established this distinction, as affording a good criterion of antiquity.
                    4. There are also some original remarks of Porson on the caesura, in iambics,
                    and trochaics, and anapaests. He showed that the scenic poets do not elide the
                    final iota, and that the tragedians do not employ the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">nepi</hi> before a vowel; and some other general laws, of greater
                    importance than these, may probably be found in some of his publications, which
                    it w ill now be ne-. cessary to enumerate in the order of time.</p>

                    in his own beautiful handwriting.” But we may here venture to apply Porson’s
                    favourite remark on the facility of transposition, and to read “a <hi
                    rend="italic">copy corrected</hi> in his own writing,” that is, on the margin of
                    Mr. Gough’s translation, as published in <hi rend="italic">Duands Coins.</hi>
                    For the whole is very negligently performed; and it is not a little remarkable
                    that this translation, which was at least approved by Porson, is decidedly less
                    accurate than the Latin translation of Heyne, as appears from the investigation
                    of the enchorial inscription published in the sixth number of the <hi

                <p>To attempt to form a just estimate of the merit of such a man as Porson, without
                    servilely following the dictates of common fame, or blindly adopting the
                    opinions of others, is a task of no small difficulty, even to one who had the
                    advantage of his personal acquaintance for the last twenty years of his life.
                    But it may safely be conceded to common fame and to partial friendship, that he
                    was one of the greatest men, and the very greatest critic, of his own or of any
                    other age. “Nothing came amiss,” says Mr. Weston, “to his memory. He would set a
                    child right in his twopenny fable book, repeat the whole of the moral tale of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dean of</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193538238"

                    Athenaeus on cups, or of Eustathius on Homer, even though he did every thing to
                    impair his mental faculties.” It cannot, however, be denied, that the talents,
                    and even the industry, that he possessed, might have made him a much greater
                    man, had they been employed in some other department of human intellect. He
                    might <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> have been as great a statesman or as great
                    a general as he was a scholar, and in these capacities his acquirements would
                    have affected the interests of a much greater multitude of his fellow-creatures,
                    than can ever be benefited by the fruits of his erudition; and he might <hi
                    rend="italic">possibly</hi> have gained more popularity as an orator or a poet,
                    than his refined investigations of grammar and prosody could ever procure him,
                    although it is not by any means certain that his fancy and invention could have
                    been rendered by anv cultivation at all comparable to his memory and acuteness.
                    But as far as regards the possession of a combination of the faculties which he
                    did cultivate, he appears to have been decidedly the most successful of any man
                    on record in the same department. On the other hand, it must be admitted that
                    the subjects of his pursuits were in their nature incapable of raising a man to
                    the first rank amongst the permanent benefactors of the human race; and, if we
                    calmly consider the ultimate objects of prosody and metre, it will appear almost
                    unfair to allow the discoverer of the prosodiacal rules, adopted by the ancient
                    poets in their mélodrames and choruses, to rank so very high amongst the
                    luminaries of an age, and yet to look down, with so much contempt as we are
                    accustomed to do, on the character of a modern <hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la daìise,</hi> notwithstanding that he thought himself the
                    third great man of his day, with Vol taire and the King of Prussia, for having
                    given soul and sentiment to the measures and movements of the choric
                    representations of the present times.</p>
                <p>Amongst the talents ofPorson, however, which were so far superior to the
                    importance of the objects on which they were employed, we ought not, perhaps, to
                    consider his remarkable strength of memory as the most to be envied, since many
                    persons who have been possessed of singular and almost miraculous, not to say
                    morbid, memories, have been but little distinguished by any other faculty. It
                    appears to be possible that a memory may in itself be even too retentive for
                    real practical utility, as if of too microscopic a nature; and it seems to be by
                    a wise and benevolent, though by no means an obvious arrangement of a Creative
                    Providence, that a certain degree of oblivion becomes a most useful instrument
                    in the advancement of human knowledge, enabling us readily to look back on the
                    prominent features only of various objects and occurrences, and to class them
                    and reason upon them, by the help of this involuntary kind of abstraction and
                    generalization, with incomparably greater facility than we could do, if we
                    retained the whole detail of what had been once but slightly impressed on our
                    minds. It is thus, for example, in physic, that the experienced practitioner
                    learns at length to despise the relation of individual symptoms, and particular
                    cases, on which alone the empiric insists, and to feel the value of the
                    Hippocratic system of “attending more to the prognostic than the diagnostic
                    features of disease which, to a younger student, appears to be perfect
                    imbecility. And it is perhaps for some similar reason that many persons, besides
                    Barnes, “of happy memory,” have had to wait long in darkness for “the day of
                    judgment.” But it must be repeated, that Person’s judgment and acuteness were
                    really almost paramount to his memory; and with the addition of these faculties,
                    his memory naturally rendered him capable of much that would have been
                    impossible without it.</p>
                <p>The respect that is justly due to classical learning has frequently been
                    exaggerated in this country, partly, perhaps, on account of the awe which is
                    naturally entertained, by an ingenuous mind, for its instructors in the earliest
                    studies, by which it is advanced towards maturity. And classical learning having
                    most wisely been placed by our ancestors the foremost, in the order of a liberal
                    education, which is most commonly adopted in Great Britain, a personal as well
                    as a general respect has been involuntarily paid to the characters of the
                    individuals concerned, and to the dignity of all those who are engaged in
                    similar occupations; besides that, the means being, by a most frequent
                    inattention of the human mind, confounded with the end for which they are
                    sought, the words and syllables, and the phrases and measures of the Greek and
                    Latin authors have often been the almost frivolous occupation of a valuable
                    life, instead of that of a few of the years of boyhood, which it was intended to
                    devote to them, and which could not have been so well engaged in any other way.
                    It is, however, wholly unjust to stigmatize the study of the classics, and of
                    languages in general, as being confined to words instead of things; for it is
                    utterly impossible that words can be learned, without the acquisition of a
                    considerable degree of knowledge of the things to which they relate, and of the
                    historical facts which they have been employed to express, and without an
                    involuntary modelling of the mind to the elegance and elevation of sentiment,
                    which pervade the works of those authors who are habitually put into the hands
                    of boys in the course of their elementary studies; an acquirement which is of
                    still greater value to the orator and the statesman, than the command of
                    language, and facility of expression, and beauty of imagery, and power of
                    reasoning, which he derives from a perfect familiarity with the great masters of
                    antiquity. But granting all the respect that can possibly be claimed for ancient
                    literature, we cannot but lament that such a man as Porson should have lived and
                    laboured for nearly half a century, and yet have left little or nothing to the
                    world that was truly and originally his own.</p>
                <p>After the full admission of the very high rank which is due to the comparative
                    merits of Person’s talents and acquirements, it may be thought almost idle, if
                    not invidious, to dwell on any trifling exceptions to their magnitude. But it
                    is, in fact, of high importance to the progress of human knowledge, to be aware
                    of the degree in which the first of mankind are liable to error. The admission
                    of the few errors of Newton himself, is at least of as much importance to his
                    followers in science, as the history of the progress of his real discoveries.
                    And it is with reason that the detection of an error in such a man is considered
                    as almost paramount to the establishment of a new fact. The English critics have
                    been reproached, and not without some foundation, as paying too servile a
                    deference to Person’s opinions; and it seems to have been very generally
                    believed amongst them, that it was scarcely possible for him to commit an error
                    or an oversight.</p>
                <p>Although Porson was in many respects irregular, and often idle, or even
                    intemperate, yet what he did perform as a critic, may be allowed to leave a
                    large balance, at the end of his life, in favour of his general industry, when
                    compared with that of most of his countrymen. It has indeed been asserted, and
                    perhaps with truth, <hi rend="italic">(Classical Journal,</hi> xxi.) that “with
                    things Porson appears to have possessed but a very inconsiderate acquaintance;
                    and not a trace is to be found amidst his writings, of that combination of
                    universal encyclopaediacal knowledge with language learning which is so
                    abundantly found in the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalaris,</hi> and the countless pages of Scaliger, Salmasius, and Casaubon.”
                    Certainly, however, neither Salmasius nor Casaubon, with all their learning,
                    much less Scaliger, with all his industry and parade, nor even Bentley himself,
                    with all his talent and acuteness, was at all comparable to Person in his own
                    department, that is, as a sound, and accurate, and refined Greek critic.</p>
                <p>But it must be confessed, that at Cambridge, even although Porson had resolved to
                    make the classics his principal study, and although there had not yet been many
                    instances<pb break="no" facs="nls:193538251" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8251-0452"/> of
                    senior wranglers, who were also senior medallists, it was scarcely reputable for
                    a man, with his undeniable abilities, to be only the twenty-first of his year in
                    mathematics. Amongst the literary objects also, which afterwards engaged his
                    attention, he might easily have found time for the study of some of the modern
                    languages; and he might have derived essential benefit from it on many occasions
                    of critical research. He had, indeed, read a good deal of French, but very
                    little Italian. He had studied the Anglo-Saxon, buthe knew nothing of the
                    kindred dialects of the north of Europe, in which it is preserved almost entire;
                    and he was wholly unacquainted with Oriental literature. He might have profited
                    materially by some of these studies, in deriving from them a clearer conception
                    of the distinctions of the tenses than he seems to have possessed, and he might
                    have enlightened us in no small degree, with respect to the history of languages
                    and of nations, by such etymological investigations as his comprehensive mind,
                    thus employed, would have rendered him peculiarly capable of pursuing with
                    success.</p>
                <p>It has been candidly and very truly admitted by a rival critic in Germany, that
                    Porson committed fewer errors than almost any other person; but it is right to
                    be aware that he has now and then committed some errors, even where he would
                    have been expected to be the most correct. There is, for example, a very strange
                    oversight in one of the criticisms contained in his early review of Weston’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermesi-ananax,</hi> which implies a palpable blunder with respect
                    to the gender of a participle, <hi rend="italic">Zωpδv μerpoυσα ßvâ&gt;u
                    ττopφυptns Aυσβιov éè viaov,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the cup of purple
                    glass, which <hi rend="italic">measured</hi> the fragrant wine and even in a
                    subsequent correction of the same passage, published in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adversaria,</hi> he has changed the gender of an adjective in a way that is at
                    least very unusual, if not wholly without example, <hi rend="italic">µerpoôv
                    ðvótvra.</hi> A mere omission, in a criticism on another author, would scarcely
                    be called an error in an ordinary person; but in such a critic as Porson, it is
                    very remarkable that he should have neglected to notice, in his catalogue of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Errors of</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Clerc,</hi> omitted by
                    Bentley, <hi rend="italic">(Ada</hi> p. 291,) the grossest of all Le Clerc’s
                    blunders, which is the quotation of the word <hi rend="italic">Hypophauli</hi>
                    cr <hi rend="italic">semibarbarous,</hi> from Pollux, with the translation <hi
                    rend="italic">Sartagines,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">frying pans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> whilst the real text of Pollux simply and plainly states
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Teganisrni</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ful-cassations,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Hippocomus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Menander,</hi> is <hi rend="italic">a semibarbarous word.</hi> These instances,
                    which have occurred in a very cursory perusal of some of Porson’s works, would
                    certainly not deserve to be noticed in a general sketch of his character, any
                    otherwise than as exceptions to bis perfect infallibility.</p>
                <p>It can scarcely be considered as an imperfection in the constitution of Porson’s
                    mind, that he wanted that amiable vanity, which is gratified by the approbation
                    even of the most inconsiderable, and which delights to choose for its objects
                    the most innocent and the most helpless of those who are casually present in
                    society. It has been observed that he would neither give nor take praise; and
                    when he was told that somebody had called him a giant in literature, he remarked
                    that a man had no right to tell the height of that which he could not measure.
                    In fact, having learned “to know how little can be known,” it is not surprising
                    that he found himself “without a second, and without a judge ;” and that he was
                    unwilling to affect a community of sentiment, and an interchange of approbation
                    with those whose acquirements and opinions he felt that he had a right to
                    despise. It might have been wiser, in some instances, to conceal this feeling;
                    but, on the other hand, he had perhaps occasion for something of the habit of
                    retreating into his conscious dignity, from his deficiency in those general
                    powers of ephemeral conversation, which are so valuable in mixed societies; for,
                    with all his learning and all his memory, he was by no means prominent as a
                    talker. He had neither the inclination nor the qualifications to be a
                    fascinating story teller, or to become habitually a parasite at the tables of
                    the affluent; but he was the delight of a limited circle of chosen friends,
                    possessing talent enough to appreciate his merits, and to profit by the
                    information that he afforded them.</p>
                <p>There has not yet been a life of Person that has collected all the particulars
                    that would deserve to be recorded by a biographer, who undertook the task on an
                    extensive scale; but of detached documents there is no deficiency. Mr. Kidd has
                    pointed out almost every work in which his name has been mentioned. The most
                    material articles relating to him will be enumerated here.</p>
