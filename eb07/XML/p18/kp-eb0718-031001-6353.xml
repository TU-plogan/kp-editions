                <p><label type="entry">POLYCARP</label>, one of the most ancient Fathers of the
                    Christian church, was born towards the end of the reign of Nero, probably at
                    Smyrna, where he was educated at the expense of Calista, a noble matron
                    distinguished alike by her piety and charity. He was unquestionably a disciple
                    of St John the Evangelist, and he conversed familiarly with others of the
                    apostles. When of a proper age, Bucolus ordained him a deacon and a catechist of
                    his church; and upon his death he succeeded Bucolus in the bishopric, to which
                    he is said to have been consecrated by St John, who also directed his
                    Apocalypse, amongst others, to him, under the title of “the angel of the church
                    of Smyrna.” When the controversy about the observation of Easter began to run
                    high between the eastern and western churches, he went to Rome to discourse with
                    those who were of the opposite party. The Roman see was then occupied by
                    Anicetus, with whom he had many conferences, which were carried on in the most
                    amicable manner; and though neither of them could bring the other to embrace his
                    opinion, they both retained their own sentiments without violating that charity
                    which is the great law of religion.</p>
                <p>Whilst at Rome he particularly opposed the heresies of Marcian and Valentinus.
                    His conduct on this occasion is related by Irenaeus, who informs us, that when
                    Polycarp passed Marcian in the street without speaking, Marcian said, “Polycarp,
                    own us ;” to which he replied with indignation, “I own thee to be the first-born
                    of Satan.” Irenaeus adds, that when any heretical doctrines were spoken in his
                    presence, he would stop his ears and say, “Good God, to what times hast thou
                    reserved me, that I should hear such things,” and immediately left the place. He
                    was accustomed to mention, that St John, going into a bath at Ephesus, and
                    finding in it Cerinthus the heretic, immediately started back without bathing,
                    crying out, “Let us run away, lest the bath should fall upon us whilst
                    Cerinthus, the enemy of truth, is in it.” Polycarp governed the church of Smyrna
                    with apostolic purity, till he suffered martyrdom in the seventh year of Marcus
                    Aurelius. The manner of his death is thus related. The persecution waxing hot at
                    Smyrna, and many having sealed their faith with their blood, the general cry
                    was, “Away with the impious; let Polycarp be sought for.” Upon this he pri√ately
                    withdrew into a neighbouring village, where he continued for some time praying
                    day and night for the peace of the church. He was thus employed, when one night
                    he fell into a trance and dreamed that, his pillow took fire, and was burned to
                    ashes. When he awoke, he told his friends the circumstance, and pronounced it a
                    presage that he should be burned alive for the cause of Christ. Three days
                    afterwards, in order to escape the incessant search after him, he retired into
                    another village. His enemies, however, were at hand, and having seized upon two
                    youths, one of whom they forced by stripes to confess, they were by these lads
                    conducted to his lodging. He might have saved himself by getting into another
                    house; but he submitted, saying, “The will of the Lord be done.” He therefore
                    came down from his bed-chamber, and saluting his persecutors with a serene and
                    cheerful countenance, he ordered a table to be set before them with provisions,
                    invited them to partake, and only requested for himself one hour for prayer;
                    after which he was set upon an ass, and conducted towards Smyrna. On the road he
                    met Herod, a justice of the province, and his father, who were the principal
                    instigators of the persecution. Herod took him up into his chariot, and
                    strenuously endeavoured to undermine his constancy; but having failed in the
                    attempt, he thrust him out of the chariot with so much violence and indignation,
                    that his thigh was bruised by the fall. When at the place of execution, there
                    came, as is said, a voice from heaven, saying, “Polycarp, be strong, and quit
                    thyself like a man.” When before the tribunal he was urged to swear by the
                    genius of Caesar. “Repent,” said the proconsul, “and say with us, take away the
                    impious.” Upon this the martyr, looking round at the crowd with a severe and
                    angry countenance, beckoned with his hand, and looking up to heaven, said with a
                    sigh, in a very different tone from what they expected, “Take away the impious.”
                    At last, having confessed himself to be a Christian, the cricr thrice proclaimed
                    his confession, and the people shouted, “This is the great doctor of Asia, and
                    the father of the Christians; this is the destroyer of our gods, who teaches men
                    not to do sacrifice to, or worship, the deities.” When the fire was prepared,
                    Polycarp requested not to be nailed, as usual, but only tied to the stake; and
                    after a short prayer, which he pronounced with a clear and audible voice, the
                    executioner blew up the fire, which increasing to a mighty flame, “Behold a
                    wonder seen by us, who were purposely reserved,” says the relator, “that we
                    might declare it to others; the flames, disposing themselves into the
                    resemblance of an arch, like the sails of a ship swelled with the wind, gently
                    encircled the body of the martyr, who stood all the while in the midst, not like
                    roasted flesh, but like the gold or silver purified in the furnace, his body
                    sending forth a delightful fragrance, which, like frankincense or some other
                    costly spices, presented itself to our senses. The infidels, exasperated by the
                    miracle, commanded a spearman to run him through with a sword; which he had no
                    sooner done, than such a vast quantity of blood flowed from the wound as
                    extinguished the fire, and then a dove was seen to fly from the wound, which
                    some suppose to have been his soul, clothed in a visible shape at the time of
                    its departure.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    miraculous part of this account is ridiculed by Dr Middleton in his Free Inquiry
                    and Defence of it; but something is offered in its favour by Mr Jorton, who
                    observes, “The circumstances are sufficient only to create a pause and a doubt.”
                    <hi rend="italic">{Remarks οη Ecclesiastical History,</hi> vol. i )</p></note>
                    The Christians endeavoured to carry off his body entire, but were not allowed by
                    the irenarch or justice, who commanded it to be burned to ashes. The bones,
                    however, were gathered up, and decently interred by the Christians.</p>
                <p>Thus died St Polycarp, on the seventh of the kalends of May, in the year 167. The
                    amphitheatre on which he suffered was mostly remaining not many years ago; and
                    his tomb, which is in a little chapel in the side of a mountain, on the
                    south-east of the city, was solemnly visited by the Greeks on the festival day;
                    whilst, for maintaining and. repairing it, travellers were wont to throw a few
                    aspers into an earthen pot which stands there for the purpose. He wrote some
                    homilies and epistles, which are now lost, except that to the Philippians, which
                    is a truly pious and Christian production, containing short and useful precepts
                    and rules of life, which St Jerome informs us was even in his time read in the
                    public assemblies of the Asiatic churches. It is singularly useful in proving
                    the authenticity of the books of the New Testament; for he has cited several
                    passages and expressions from St Matthew, St Luke, the Acts, St Paul’s Epistles
                    to the Philippians, Ephesians, Galatians, Corinthians, Romans, Thessalonians,
                    Colossians, the first Epistle to Timothy, first Epistle of St John, and first
                    Epistle of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193536366" xml:id="kp-eb0718-6366-0311"
                    />Peter; and makes particular mention of St Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians.
                    Indeed the whole of this epistle consists of phrases and sentiments taken from
                    the New Testament.</p>
