                <p><label type="entry">IGNATIUS <hi rend="smallcaps">Loyola</hi></label>, the
                    founder of the order of Jesuits, was born atthe castle of Loyola, in Biscay, in
                    the year 1491. He became, first, page to Ferdinand V. king of Spain, and then an
                    officer in the army. In the latter capacity he signalized himself by his valour,
                    and was wounded in both legs at the siege of Pampeluna in 1521. To this
                    circumstance the Jesuits owe their origin; for whilst he was under cure of his
                    wound, a <hi rend="italic">Life of the Saints,</hi> which was put into his
                    hands, determined him to exchange the military for the ecclesiastical
                    profession. His first devout exercise was to dedicate himself to the blessed
                    virgin as her knight. He then went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; and upon
                    his return to Europe he continued his theological studies in the universities of
                    Spain, though he was then thirty-three years of age. After this he went to
                    Paris, and in France laid the foundation of that new order, the institutes of
                    which he presented to Pope Pau] III. who made many objections to them, but at
                    last, in 1540, confirmed the institution. The founder died in 1555, and left his
                    disciples two famous books; first, Spiritual Exercises; second, Constitutions or
                    Rules of the Order. But it must be remembered, that though these avowed
                    institutes contain many privileges obnoxious to the welfare of society, the most
                    objectionable are contained in the private rules, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monita Secreta,</hi> which were not discovered till long afterwards; but most
                    writers attribute these, and even the Constitutions, to Lay-nez, the second
                    general of the order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ignatius,</hi><hi rend="italic">St,</hi> surnamed <hi
                    rend="italic">Theophrastus,</hi> one of the apostolical fathers of the church,
                    was born in Syria, educated under the apostle and evangelist St John, and
                    intimately acquainted with some other of the apostles, especially St Peter and
                    St Paul. Being fully instructed in the doctrines of Christianity, he was
                    ordained by St John, and confirmed, about the year 67, bishop of Antioch, by
                    these two apostles, who first planted Christianity in that city, where the
                    disciples also were first called <hi rend="italic">Christians.</hi> Antioch was
                    then not only the metropolis of Syria, but a city the most renowned of any in
                    the East, and the ancient seat of the Roman emperors, as well as that of the
                    viceroys and governors. In this important see he continued somewhat above forty
                    years, and was both an honour and safeguard to the Christian religion, till the
                    year 107, when Trajan the emperor, flushed with a victory which he had lately
                    obtained over the Scythians and Dacians, about the ninth year of his reign, came
                    to Antioch to make preparations for a war against the Parthians and Armenians.
                    He entered the city with the pomp of a triumph; and as his first care usually
                    was about the affairs of religion, he began presently to inquire into the state
                    of the new faith Christianity had by this time made such progress, that the
                    Romans became jealous and uneasy on account of its advancement. This prince,
                    therefore, had already, in other parts of the empire, commenced a persecution
                    against the Christians, which he now resolved to carry on here. However, as he
                    was naturally of a mild disposition, though he ordered the laws to be put in
                    force against them if convicted, yet he forbade them to be sought after.</p>
                <p>In this state of affairs, Ignatius, thinking it more prudent to go himself than
                    wait to be sent for, presented himself to the emperor; and it is said that there
                    passed a long and particular discourse between them, in the course of which the
                    emperor having expressed surprise how he dared to transgress the laws, the
                    bishop took the opportunity to assert his own innocence, and to explain and
                    vindicate his faith and freedom. The issue was, that he was imprisoned, and
                    sentenced to be carried bound by soldiers to Rome, and there thrown as a prey to
                    the wild beasts of the amphitheatre.</p>
                <p>He was first conducted to Seleucia, a port of Syria, about sixteen miles distant,
                    where Paul and Barnabas set sail for Cyprus. Having arrived at Smyrna, he paid a
                    visit to Polycarp, bishop of that place, and was himself visited by the clergy
                    of the surrounding country. He also wrote letters to several churches, as the
                    Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, and even the Romans, for their instruction and
                    establishment in the faith. He then set sail for Troas, a city of Phrygia, not
                    far from the ruins of old Troy, where, upon his arrival, he was much refreshed
                    with the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940987" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0987-0245"/>news
                    he received of the discontinuance of the persecution in Antioch. From Troas he
                    sailed to Neapolis, a maritime town in Macedonia; thence to Philippi, a Roman
                    colony, where the party were entertained with all imaginable kindness, and
                    conducted forwards on their journey through Macedonia and Epirus, till they came
                    to Epi-damnium, a city of Dalmatia, where, having again taken shipping, they
                    sailed through the Adriatic, arrived at Rhegium, a port-town in Italy, and
                    directed their course thence through the Tyrrhenian Sea to Puteoli, whence
                    Ignatius desired to proceed by land, ambitious to trace the same way by which St
                    Paul had travelled to Rome. But this wish was not complied with; and, after a
                    stay of twenty-four hours, a prosperous wind quickly carried them to the Roman
                    port, the station of the navy, built near Ostia, at the mouth of the Tiber,
                    about sixteen miles from Rome.</p>
                <p>The Christians at Rome, daily expecting his arrival, came out to meet him, and
                    received him with a mixture of joy and sorrow; but when some of them intimated
                    that possibly the populace might be diverted from desiring his death, he
                    expressed a pious indignation, entreating them to cast no obstacles in his way,
                    nor do any thing that might tend to deprive him of that crown of martyrdom to
                    which he ardently aspired. There are many such expressions as this in his
                    epistle to the Romans, yet it does not appear that he rashly sought or provoked
                    danger. Being conducted to Rome, he was presented to the prefect; and the
                    emperor’s letters concerning him were also delivered. The interval before his
                    martyrdom was spent in prayers for the peace and prosperity of the church. That
                    his punishment might be the more public, one of their solemn festivals, the time
                    of the Saturnalia, and that part of it when they celebrated the Sigillaria, was
                    fixed for his execution. Accordingly, on the 20th of December, he was brought
                    out into the amphitheatre, and the lions being let loose, quickly despatched
                    him, leaving nothing but a few of the hardest of his bones. These remains were
                    gathered up by two deacons wlio had been the companions of his journey; and
                    being transported to Antioch, were interred in the cemetery, without the gate
                    which leads to Daphne.</p>
                <p>St Ignatius stands at the head of those Anti-Nicene fathers who occasionally
                    delivered their opinions in defence of the divinity of Christ, whom he calls the
                    <hi rend="italic">Son of God, and his eternal word.</hi> He is also reckoned the
                    great champion of the doctrine <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the episcopal order, as
                    distinct from and superior to that of priest and deacon; and one, the most
                    important, use of his writings respects the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures,
                    which he frequently alludes to in the very same expressions which we find at
                    this day. Archbishop Usher’s edition of his works, printed in 1647. is thought
                    the best; yet there is a more recent edition published at Amsterdam, where,
                    besides the best notes, there arc the dissertations of Usher and Pearson.</p>
