                <p><label type="entry">INVERNESS-SHIRE</label>, the most extensive county in
                    Scotland, situated between 56° 40' and 57° 36' north latitude, and between 3°
                    50' and 5° 50' west longitude from Greenwich, is bounded on the north by the
                    shires of Ross and Cromarty; on the east by those of Aberdeen, Banff, Moray, and
                    Nairn, and by the Moray Frith; on the south by the counties of Perth and Argylc;
                    and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. It is from fifty to seventy-five miles in
                    length; in breadth from thirty to fifty miles; and its area is computed at 3036
                    square miles, of which the space occupied by lakes has been estimated at 132
                    miles, and the land at 29Ó4, or 1,858,560 English acres.</p>
                <p>The exterior outline of this county is exceedingly irregular. On the north-east,
                    where the county town is situated, a narrow tract runs out between Nairnshire
                    and the Moray Frith. Farther to the east, a portion of it is detached and
                    enclosed by the counties of Moray and Banff; Argyleshire penetrates into it from
                    the south-west; and on the west it is indented by Lochs Moidart, Aylort, Nevis,
                    Hourn, and other arms of the sea.</p>
                <p>The surface is still more varied, consisting of ranges of lofty mountains,
                    alternating with deep narrow valleys, the beds of a great many lakes and rivers.
                    The most prominent feature is Glenmore, or the Great Glen, for the most part a
                    mile in breadth, and bounded on either side by precipitous high grounds, which
                    traverses the county from south-west to north-east, dividing it into two nearly
                    equal parts. In this glen, from north to south, are Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and
                    Loch Lochy, which, being united by the Caledonian Canal, form a line of inland
                    navigation between the east and west seas, or from the Moray Frith on the
                    north-east, to Linnhe Loch, an arm of the Atlantic, on the south-west, a
                    distance of about sixty miles, for frigates of thirty-two guns, and vessels of
                    600 tons. Loch Ness is remarkable for never freezing, a circumstance ascribed to
                    its great depth; and for its waters having been violently agitated during the
                    great earthquake at Lisbon in November 1755. On each side of this valley there
                    is a number of glens and straths, separated by mountainous ridges, with lakes
                    which receive the waters from the high grounds, and discharge them by outlets,
                    partly into the lakes in the central valley, and partly, by a more direct
                    course, into the arms of the Atlantic on the west, or by rivers which flow from
                    this county into the counties on the east, and thence into the German Ocean.</p>
                <p>The western side, or the country between the great valley and the Atlantic, from
                    Argyleshire on the south to Ross-shire on the north, a distance of about seventy
                    miles, is the most wild and mountainous tract of Inverness-shire, and is
                    therefore known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Rough Pounds</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> yet, before reaching the sea-coast, the general elevation
                    is somewhat diminished. In this tract, beginning at the south, the principal
                    divisions are, Moidart, Arasaig, Morar, Knoidart, and Glenelg, which contain a
                    variety of glens or valleys, among which are, Glengarry, Glen Moriston, Glen
                    Urquhart, and Strathglass. The most considerable lakes in this quarter are, Loch
                    Eil, Loch Shiel, Loch Arkaig, Loch Garry, and Loch Maddy. Lochan Uain, in the
                    parish of Kilmorack, about forty miles west from Beauly, is said to have been
                    known to remain frozen all the year through. On the east side of the valley lies
                    the extensive district of Badenoch; at its southern termination is Lochaber; and
                    at its northern the Aird, the most fertile part of the county. These divisions
                    also include a great many glens, lakes, and rivers, extensive woodlands, and not
                    a little productive land. The principal valleys here are Glenroy, noted for its
                    parallel roads, which, it is now agreed, must have been formed by the gradual
                    subsidence of the waters, and not by the hand of man; Strathspey, Strathcrrick,
                    Strathearn, and Strathnairn. Treig, Ericht partly in Perthshire, Laggan, Insch,
                    and Moy, are the names of the most considerable of the lochs in this quarter;
                    and here the Spey, the Findhorn, and the Nairn, and a number of smaller streams,
                    have their source.</p>
                <p>The general aspect of Inverness-shire may be further conceived, when it is stated
                    that two thirds of the surface are covered with heath; that only a fortieth part
                    is corn land; and that the corn land, woodlands, and green pastures, together,
                    do not exceed eight acres in an hundred. In many large tracts heath prevails to
                    such a degree that, for twelve or fourteen miles, scarcely any verdure is to be
                    seen, except where a solitary rivulet has occasionally overflowed its banks. On
                    the south of Badenoch there is a flat of deep moss, supposed to be the most
                    extensive in Britain, in which a great number of small lakes are interspersed,
                    some of them containing wooded isles, where the deer, from the inaccessible
                    nature of the ground, find shelter from their pursuers. But the far greater part
                    of the county is occupied with mountains. Ben Nevis, 4380 feet high, stands on
                    the south-west, a little to the east of the Caledonian Canal; Meal Fourvounie,
                    on the west of Loch Ness, is more than 3000 feet high; and Cairngorm, partly in
                    Banffshire, upwards of 4000. It has been remarked, as a singular circumstance,
                    that several of the hills, which are covered with heath on the sides, are green
                    on the summit, and produce valuable pasturage. The productive land lies chiefly
                    on the sea-coast, and along the banks of the lakes and rivers; much of it in the
                    latter situation is alluvial and fertile. There is also clay in a few places;
                    but the prevailing soil is sand, or a sandy loam, well adapted to the growth of
                    barley, potatoes, turnips, and other green crops.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Inverness-shire are, the Spey, which rises from a loch of
                    that name, a little to the east of the Great Valley, and, flowing in a course
                    from southwest to north-east for about ninety-six miles, falls into the sea
                    about eight miles east of Elgin, in Morayshire, carrying with it the waters of
                    1300 square miles; the Ness, which issues from Loch Ness, and, flowing through
                    the town of Inverness, falls into the Moray Frith, after a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192942157" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2157-0335"/>course of six miles; the
                    Lochy issues from Loch Lochy, and has a course of tert miles westward, till it
                    falls into Loch Eil near Fort λVilliam; soon after it leaves its parent lake, it
                    is joined, from the east, by the Spean, which is remarkable for being crossed by
                    a bridge, two of the arches of which are ninety-five feet high; and the Beauly,
                    which has its source in the north-west, and carries the united waters of the
                    Glass and other two rivulets into the frith of the same name. The Findhorn and
                    Nairn on the east, and the Garry and the Morriston on the west, are smaller
                    streams. The Foyers, which flows into Loch Ness from the south, is remarkable
                    for its celebrated falls, one of which, according to Dr Garnet, is seventy feet,
                    and the other, half a mile lower, 212 feet. There are cascades not inferior to
                    these in the parish of Kihnorack, on the waters which unite to form the Beauly,
                    and at Loch Leven head in the southern quarter; near which last place there are
                    also some remarkable caverns.</p>
                <p>Granite, limestone, slate, marble, brick-clay, abound in many parts of
                    Inverness-shire. Lead has been discovered in Ben Nevis, and at three other
                    places in that neighbourhood, and also at Glengarry, but none of it is wrought.
                    A vein of plumbago has also been found at Glengarry. A great part of the
                    mountain of Ben Nevis is composed of beautiful porphyry. There is no coal, and
                    for want of it much of the limestone is of little value.</p>
                <p>From the trees found in great numbers, and some of them of a remarkable size, in
                    all the mosses, there is reason to believe that this country was, at an early
                    period, almost covered with wood; and at present there is a greater space
                    covered with natural pines here than in all the rest of Britain. In Strathspey
                    it is said that three - tiers of stocks have been found, directly above one
                    another, in a moss; from which it is inferred that the deepest must have come to
                    maturity, and been destroyed, before the one next above it was formed. In the
                    same district there are about 15,000 acres of natural firs, besides 7000 of
                    planted firs and larches; and the natural woods on Loch Arkaig, in Glengarry,
                    Glenmoriston, Strathglass, Strathfarrer, and at the head of Loch Shiel, are also
                    very extensive. Full-grown trees of ash, lime, beech, oak, plane, and
                    mountain-ash, are found at Castle Grant, Culloden, and Belladrum, in the
                    northern quarter of the county; but in most other places the woods are in the
                    state of coppice. The birch is in great abundance on the sides of Loch Ness,
                    Loch Laggan, about Rothicmurchus, and in the vale of Urquhart. Part of the great
                    Caledonian Forest extends for several miles near the boundary of this county
                    with Perthshire. Considerable tracts have been planted, chiefly with firs and
                    larches, particularly in the north-east, where the county town is situated, in
                    Badenoch, and <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Loch Eil.</p>
                <p>There are several fishing villages on the east coast, yet the sea-fishery is not
                    prosecuted to a great extent. But the arms of the sea, and the numerous lakes
                    and rivers, afford an abundant supply of fish. The herring occasionally visits
                    Loch Eil; salmon yield a considerable rent on the rivers Lochy, Beauly, and
                    Ness, and are found also in the Morrer, in Loch Insch in Badenoch, and at
                    Invermoriston. Char is caught in several of the lochs, and flounders and sprats
                    in the Beauly. The moors and woodlands are plentifully stocked with game, viz.
                    red and roe decr, the Alpine and common hare, black game and ptarmigan, grouse,
                    partridges, &amp;c.; and pheasants have lately been introduced. Foxes and wild
                    cats are still numerous, and, in the lakes and rivers, otters. There are also
                    eagles, hawks, and owls; and a multitude of water fowls, particularly swans,
                    resort to Loch Insch, and the other lakes of Badenoch.</p>
                <p>. The territory of Inverness-shire is divided into estates of great extent, and,
                    in proportion to the rental of the county, of great value. In 1804 more than the
                    half, if we may judge from the old valuation, belonged to seven proprietors, and
                    as much more was held by other six, as made the possessions of these thirteen
                    individuals equal to more than two thirds of the whole; each of them, at a
                    medium, must, therefore, have contained about 100,000 acres. There are
                    thirty-nine estates valued at above L.500, and thirty-five estates below L.500
                    and above L.100. The greatest landed proprietors are Lord Macdonald, the Earl of
                    Seafield, Mr Fraser of Lovat, Mackintosh of Mackintosh, Macleod of Macleod,
                    Macdoncll of Glengarry, Colonel Cameron of Lochiel, Lord Glenelg, the Earl of
                    Moray, Chisholm of Chisholm, Colonel Macniel of Barra, Lord Dunmore, Mr Grant of
                    Ballindalloch, Mr Stewart of Belladrum, Mr Baillie of Lochaber, Mr Grant of
                    Glenmoriston, &amp;c. The valuation taken in 1601 was L.73,188. 9s. Scots, and
                    in 1811 the real rent of the lands was L.195,843. 15s. sterling, and of the
                    houses, L.9235. 2s. sterling. The valuation taken in 1814 was L.152,078. 12s.
                    2∣d.; but this sum is nothing like the real rent, being made, merely for
                    collecting the property tax. There are several estates of very considerable
                    income, though not of great extent, such as Muirtown, Insches, Culduthell, and
                    others. The old valuation of the whole of Scotland, as fixed about the middle of
                    last century, and which is still the rule by which county assessments are
                    imposed, is to the actual rent of the lands alone in 1811, as L.l Scots is to L.
                    1.263 sterling; whereas in this county, rents have risen in so much greater a
                    proportion than in the rest of Scotland, chiefly perhaps owing to the
                    introduction of sheep-farming, that its valuation is to its actual rent only as
                    L.l Scots is to L.2.675 sterling; and it is worthy of remark, that this rise
                    cannot be ascribed in any considerable degree to the outlay of capital by
                    proprietors, in building or otherwise, as in most other parts of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Of the occupiers of the land, tacksmen, small tenants, and cottars, of the size
                    of the farms, and the rural economy of the county generally, we have little to
                    say in addition to what we have already offered under the Highland counties of
                    Scotland in the preceding part of this work. Small spots of corn-land contiguous
                    to the hamlets, of which the alternate ridges or lands belong to different
                    cultivators, who used to interchange their allotments once a year, and more
                    recently only once in three years; a larger space of <hi rend="italic"
                    >outfield</hi> beyond this, part of which is constantly cropped till it is
                    exhausted, and then left to nature, when another part, which had been treated in
                    the same manner, but which has been somewhat restored in the mean while by the
                    folding of cattle, takes its place; and beyond this outfield, separated from the
                    higher grounds by a <hi rend="italic">head dike,</hi> large tracts of common
                    pasture; these, with their miserable huts, their irregular and always
                    inefficient labour, their indolence, and their poverty, present a striking
                    picture of what must have been the condition of the great body of the people of'
                    Scotland during the feudal ages; but it is not now, as it was then, somewhat
                    relieved by hospitality and protection on the one side, and respect, gratitude,
                    and attachment, on the other.</p>
                <p>This system, indeed, has been gradually approaching to its termination during the
                    last thirty years, and in some parts of Inverness-shire it exists no longer in
                    its original form. The change has been chiefly effected by the introduction of
                    saccp, which has occasioned many complaints, and probably much real suffering
                    for a time to many individuals, but which is likely in the end to be most
                    advantageous to the public at large. With respect to its effect on population,
                    one main topic of declamation, it has not been such as its opponents allege; for
                    the population of Inverness-shire, any more than of the Highlands in general,
                    has not diminished. On the contrary, its increase in this county, from 1755 to
                    1811, has been much greater than in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942170"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-2170-0336"/>eHaddingtonshire and the other merely agricultural
                    districts of Scotland. Within that period, it has increased from 64,656 to
                    78,336, or upwards of twenty-one per cent., whilst that of all Scotland has not
                    been more than forty-four per cent.; and it is well known that the far greater
                    part of this apparently general increase has been occasioned by the extension of
                    manufactures and commerce, and is chiefly confined to a few districts.</p>
                <p>The principal exports are cattle, sheep, wool, timber, and slates. The corn grown
                    in the county, chiefly bear or big, and oats, and only on the east coast wheat,
                    is all consumed within itself, much of the bear in illicit distillation; as well
                    as all the potatoes, the most important article of food for the greater part of
                    tlrfe year; and the products of the dairy. It imports coals, lime, flour,
                    oatmeal, groceries, and other articles of domestic consumption. The manufactures
                    are, bagging from hemp, thread, kelp to a considerable extent on the west coast,
                    with some tiles and bricks. There are also tan-works, breweries, bleachfields,
                    and an iron-foundery; and some attempts have been made at different periods to
                    carry on branches of the woollen manufacture.</p>
                <p>From the west sea a few vessels come up to Fort William, from which the exports
                    are wool, skins, herrings, kelp, and slates. The most considerable village is
                    Maryburgh, or Gordonsburgh, near Fort William. Grantown is a neatly built
                    village on the great road along the Spey, and, under the auspices of Sir James
                    Grant, the proprietor, it has made considerable progress. It contains a
                    townhouse and prison, with a well-endowed school; and a few years ago a factory
                    was begun for carding and spinning wool, and for making blankets and woollen
                    cloths. Fairs are held for the sale of cattle, sheep, and wool, at Fort William,
                    Beauly, Grantown, and Kingussie, and four in the year in Inverness, where there
                    is also a well-supplied market every Tuesday and Friday. Some years back an easy
                    communication was formed throughout the greater part of the county, by means of
                    the roads made under the direction of theParliamentary Commissioners for
                    Highland Roads and Bridges, half the expense of which is borne by the county,
                    and the other half is granted by parliament.</p>
                <p>Amongst the antiquities of Inverness-shire, which we can only notice generally,
                    are the circles of stones ascribed to the Druids, which are found in many parts
                    of the county, particularly at Corrimony in its northern quarter; two artificial
                    mounts in the parish of Petty, supposed to have been places for administering
                    justice; round buildings, called Picts’ Houses, in Glenelg, and other parts;
                    forts, built without mortar, one of which, called Castle Spynie, two miles east
                    from the church of Beauly, encloses a circle of fifty-four yards, and another,
                    in the parish of Laggan, stands on a rock, a hundred yards in perpendicular
                    height; vitrified forts on the hill of Craig Phadric, about two miles from
                    Inverness, Dundhairdghall in Glen Nevis, and Dun Thion near the river Beauly;
                    and a variety of castles, of which Inverloehy Castle a building of great extent
                    and unknown antiquity, on the banks of the Lochy, near Fort William, is,
                    perhaps, the most remarkable. On a hill near Inverness, called the Castle Hill,
                    stood the castle of the Thane of Cawdor where Macbeth is said to have murdered
                    Duncan. It was razed by Malcolm Ceanmore, who removed the town to the northward,
                    where it now stands, granted its first charter, and built a fortress on the site
                    of the old town, which was repaired in 1715, and finally demolished in 1765.
                    Cromwell erected a citadel at the mouth of the river Ness, which was demolished
                    by Charles II.</p>
                <p>There is a chain of forts stretching across the island, along the line of the
                    Caledonian Canal. Fort George is a regular fortress, mounting eighty guns, with
                    barracks for 3000 men; it was begun in 1747, and completed in twenty years, at
                    an expense of about L. 160,000. It is situated eleven miles eastward from
                    Inverness, upon a neck of land on the Moray Frith, opposite to Fortrose in
                    Ross-shire. Fort Augustus, also a regular fortification, though a place of no
                    great strength, with four bastions, and barracks for 400 men, is situated at the
                    west end of Loch Ness, nearly midway between the east and west seas. It was
                    first built in 1730, at some distance from Loch Ness; but having been demolished
                    by the rebels in 1745, it was afterwards rebuilt nearer the lake. Fort William,
                    built in the reign of William HL, is situated on a navigable arm of the sea,
                    called Loch Eil, at the south-western termination of the great valley. These
                    forts are now useless in a military point of view, though kept in a state of
                    good repair, and answering as barracks for a few soldiers. On Culloden Moor, a
                    level heath to the eastward of Inverness, on the 16th April 1746, was fought the
                    battle which put an end to the rebellion of 1745; the greater part of this heath
                    is now covered with plantations.</p>
                <p>Inverness-shire contains twenty-eight entire parishes, and shares several others
                    with the counties of Argyle, Nairn, and Moray. Of these, twenty are on the
                    mainland, and the remainder in its islands. Some of the parishes on the
                    mainland, as well as in the islands, would form a square of twenty miles each.
                    Kilmalie and Kilmoraek are still larger, extending in length about sixty miles,
                    and in breadth almost thirty. Many of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics,
                    particularly in the districts of Moidart, Arasaig, Morar, and Knoidart, on the
                    west side. The county sends one member to parliament, and the town of Inverness,
                    along with Forres, Nairn, and Fortrose, choose one for the burghs. The sheriff
                    holds courts at four places, two of which, Inverness and Fort William, are for
                    the mainland, and two more for the isles in Skye and Long Island. The population
                    of the whole shire in 1811, 1821, and 1831, is given in the annexed table. (See
