                <p>Formerly it was universally believed that, in the event of all legislative
                    enactments fixing and regulating the rate of interest being repealed, its
                    increase or diminution would depend wholly on the comparative scarcity or
                    abundance of money; or, in other words, that it would rise as money became
                    scarce, and fall as it became more plentiful. Mr Hume was the first to point out
                    the fallacy of this opinion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See his <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    interest is not determined by the amount of the currency, but by <hi
                    rend="italic">the average rate of profit derived from the employment of
                    capital.</hi> No doubt it most frequently happens that, when a loan is made, it
                    is made in the currency of the country. This, however, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941962" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1962-0320"/>is really of no consequence.
                    There is obviously no difference between one individual furnishing another with
                    100 bushels of corn, to be repaid at the expiration of a twelvemonth by the
                    delivery of 104 or 105 bushels, or with as much money at four or five per cent,
                    as would have purchased the corn. Besides, it is easy to perceive that the same
                    identical sum of money might serve to negotiate an infinity of loans. Suppose A
                    lends to X L.1000, which X immediately pays away to B for commodities of equal
                    value; but B has no use for the money, and he therefore lends it to Y, who pays
                    it away for commodities to C, who again lends it to Z, and so on; it is plain
                    the borrowers X, Y, Z, have really received a loan of commodities, or capital,
                    from the lenders A, B, C, worth <hi rend="italic">three</hi> times (and it might
                    have been worth three hundred or three thousand times) as much as the money
                    employed in settling the transactions. According as the supply of currency,
                    compared with the business it has to perform, is greater or less, we are obliged
                    to give a greater or less number of guineas or livres, pound notes or assignats,
                    for the commodities we wish to obtain. It is plainly, however, by the <hi
                    rend="italic">advantage</hi> or <hi rend="italic">profit</hi> we expect to
                    derive from the acquisition of the commodities which constitute capital, and not
                    from the accidental, and, in this respect, unimportant, circumstance of a larger
                    or smaller number of pieces of gold or silver, or of bits of engraved paper,
                    being given for them, that the rate of interest, or the compensation given to
                    the lender for the use of his stock, must be determined. It may perhaps be
                    supposed, that when the quantity of metallic money is increased, goldsmiths,
                    jewellers, &amp;c. obtain the raw material for carrying on their business with
                    greater facility; but this is not always the case, and, though it were, it would
                    not affect the rate of interest. No coins are ever sent to the melting pot
                    unless when the currency is either degraded or depreciated; that is, unless it
                    be deficient in weight, or <hi rend="italic">relatively</hi> redundant in
                    quantity. And it is clear that the inducement to promise a high or low rate of
                    interest for loans of metallic money, which it was intended to work up into some
                    species of manufactured goods, would depend, not on the supply of such money,
                    but on the profit to be derived from the operation, a circumstance totally
                    unconnected with the scarcity or abundance of coin.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the rate of interest, at any given period, depends
                    exclusively on the supply of real disposable capital, such as land, machinery,
                    raw and manufactured products, &amp;c. compared with the power of profitably
                    employing it. An increase of metallic money adds only very inconsiderably, and
                    an increase of paper money adds nothing whatever, to the real capital of the
                    country, or to the material of which all loans are really composed. If an
                    increase of paper money was equivalent to an increase of capital, bank notes
                    could not be too much multiplied, and France would have been about twenty times
                    as rich at the era or the assignats as at this moment. It is not denied that
                    considerable mischief and derangement must always be experienced in a highly
                    manufacturing and commercial country like Great Britain, when any sudden check
                    is given to the facility with which discounts are generally obtained, or when
                    the currency is suddenly contracted. But the <hi rend="italic">frottement</hi>
                    and inconvenience occasioned by a contraction of the currency could only be
                    temporary. It is impossible it could have any lasting effect on the industry of
                    the oountry. We should still possess the same amount of real capital; and as
                    neither its productive power, nor the liberty to transfer it from one individual
                    to another, would be at all impaired,'the real revenue of the state would
                    continue as great as ever, and the same or a greater amount of stock might be
                    disposed of by way of loan. <hi rend="italic">Money prices</hi> would certainly
                    fall proportionally to the reduction of the currency; or, which is the same
                    thing, the value of commodities would henceforth have to be ascertained by
                    comparing them with a smaller number of bits of gold or paper. But, in every
                    other respect, the business of society would continue exactly on its former
                    footing; and, without some change in the rate of profit, on which fluctuations
                    in the value of money have almost no effect, the rate of interest would continue
                    invariable.</p>
                <p>Mr Ricardo has set this principle in a clear and striking point of view, “The
                    rate of interest,” he observes, in answer to those who had contended that it
                    would be increased by a diminution of the discounts of the Bank of England, “is
                    not regulated by the rate at which the bank will lend, whether it be five, four,
                    or three per cent., but by the rate of profit which can be maae by the
                    employment of capital, and which is totally independent of the quantity and of
                    the value of money. Whether a bank lend one million, ten millions, or a hundred
                    millions, they would not permanently alter the market rate of interest; they
                    would alter only the value of the money which they thus issued. In one case ten
                    or twenty times more money might be required to carry on the same business, than
                    what might be required on the other. The applications to the bank for money,
                    then, depend on the comparison between the rate of profits that may be made by
                    the employment of it, and the rate at which they arc willing to lend it. If they
                    charge less than the market rate of interest, there is no amount of money which
                    they might not lend; if they charge more than that rate, none but spendthrifts
                    and prodigals would be found to borrow of them. We accordingly find, that when
                    the market rate of interest exceeds the rate of five per cent, at which the bank
                    uniformly lend, the discount office is besieged with applicants for money; and,
                    on the contrary, when the market rate is even temporarily under five per cent.,
                    the clerks of that office have no employment.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is foreign to the object of this article to enter into any detailed
                    examination of the causes which tend to elevate or depress the rate of profit.
                    Whatever diversity of opinion may be entertained respecting them, it is
                    abundantly evident that the tate of interest afforded for the use of borrowed
                    capital must be proportional to the profits which might be derived from its
                    employment. In the United States, the market rate of interest varies from ten to
                    fourteen per cent.; and in Holland, previously to the invasion of the French in
                    1794, it did not exceed two or three per cent. The immense extent of fertile and
                    uncultivated land in America, the lowness of taxation, and the absence of all
                    restrictive regulations, naturally occasion high profits, and consequently high
                    interest; whilst the sterility and limited extent of the soil of Holland, the
                    excessive load of taxes, laid equally on necessaries and luxuries, and the
                    injudicious restraints imposed upon various branches of commerce, by rendering
                    it impossible to derive large returns from capital, proportionally sink the rate
                    of interest. Had the soil of Holland been as fertile, and taxation as light, as
                    in the United States, profits and interest would, notwithstanding the abundant
                    supply of capital, have been equally high in the one republic as in the other.
                    It is not by the absolute amount of the stock of a country, but by the
                    comparative facilities for its advantageous employment, that the compensation or
                    interest which a borrower can afford for its use must always be regulated.
                    Previously to the termination of the late war, the market rate of interest in
                    this country, for sums which could not be immediately demanded, fluctuated from
                    five to twelve <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941975" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1975-0321"
                    />per cent. It has since fallen to four or five per cent.; a decline which has
                    not certainly been occasioned by any sudden increase of capital, but by the
                    extraordinary depression of commerce, and the consequent impossibility of
                    investing stock so as to yield as large a profit as it did during the period
                    when we engrossed almost the whole trade of the world.</p>
                <p>Besides such variations as are proportional to variations in the general and
                    average rate of profit, and which <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> affect <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> loans, the rate of interest must vary according <hi
                    rend="italic">to the degree of security afforded for the repayment of
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">principali</hi><hi rend="italic">and the duration of
                    the loan.</hi> No capitalist would lend on the personal security of a gunpowder
                    manufacturer, and on <hi rend="italic">mortgage</hi> over a valuable estate, at
                    the same rate of interest. The extraordinary hazard of the gunpowder trade
                    exposes the stock invested in it to an extreme degree of <hi rend="italic"
                    >risk.</hi> It may be dissipated in -an instant, and the power of the borrower
                    to refund the capital he had borrowed annihilated for ever. A lender of money on
                    mortgage is almost entirely relieved from such contingencies. The owner of an
                    estate on which a loan is secured may become bankrupt; but the estate itself
                    will remain, and may either be sold or taken possession of by the lender. It is
                    plain, therefore, that there must be a very great difference in the rate of
                    interest paid by those whose security for the repayment of the principal is so
                    exceedingly different. The gunpowder manufacturer, besides paying a rate or
                    per-centage equivalent to the common and average rate of interest derived from
                    the most secure investments, would have to pay an <hi rend="italic"
                    >additional</hi> rate, which, although it might not be designated by that name,
                    would really constitute a <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> of insurance
                    proportioned to the greater risk to which the lender was exposed of losing his
                    principal. The preferable security offered by the landholder would relieve him
                    from the necessity of paying any considerable premium, or excess of interest, on
                    account of risk; and of course he would be able to borrow at so much less than
                    the manufacturer. We should mistake, however, if we supposed that the latter was
                    thus placed in a comparatively disadvantageous situation. He would be completely
                    indemnified for the greater risk to which his stock was exposed, and for the
                    higher rate of interest which he was in consequence obliged to pay, by the
                    greater <hi rend="italic">gross profits</hi> he would derive from his business.
                    The constantly operating principle of competition will not permit, taking every
                    thing into account, a greater <hi rend="italic">nett profit</hi> to be
                    permanently derived from one department of industry than from another. But those
                    who invest their stock in employments of more than ordinary hazard, must he able
                    to dispose of their produce at such a price as will yield them the common and
                    average rate of profit, besides affording a surplus adequate to insure their
                    stock against the extra risk to which it is exposed. If this were not the case,
                    no capitalist would place his property in a state of comparative danger, and no
                    undertakings of a hazardous nature would be entered into. Wherever there is
                    risk, that risk must be compensated. And it may, and very frequently does,
                    happen, that the manager of a hazardous branch of industry, paying from ten to
                    twenty per cent, for borrowed capital, is realizing a larger nett profit than
                    the landlord who has purchased an estate with money for which he only pays three
                    or four per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    principle is never lost sight of in bargaining for loans. In Athens, the rate of
                    interest was not regulated by law; and it is distinctly mentioned by ancient
                    authors, that the average rate of interest paid by those who employed their
                    stock in the shipping trade with the countries situated on the Euxine and
                    Mediterranean Seas amounted, on account of the hazard of the voyage, to about
                    thirty percent.; whilst bankers, agriculturists, and others, whose security was
                    preferable, paid only about twelve per cent. Say, in noticing this striking
                    fact, supposes that the thirty per cent, was charged by the voyage; and that, as
                    two voyages to the Crimea or ιcuv might be made annually, <hi rend="italic"
                    >maritime</hi> interest really amounted at Athens to sixty per cent. There does

                    was of considerable length. But here, as in every other case, the real interests
                    of the borrower and lender coincide. The same circumstances which prevent a
                    borrower from giving as high a rate of interest for a loan payable on demand as
                    if it were payable at a fixed and distant term, induces the lender to rest
                    satisfied with a smaller compensation in the one case than in the other. We wish
                    to be able to exercise a complete command over our capital. No merchant would
                    ever consent to lend his stock on mortgage. If he did, he would no longer be
                    able to carry on his business with advantage. He would be deprived of all power
                    of speculating; and although this might in many instances be for his advantage,
                    yet the flattering opinion which everyone entertains of his own abilities and
                    good fortune would but seldom allow him to doubt of its being a very material
                    disadvantage. It is by this principle that we are able to account for the
                    comparatively low rate of interest at which banking companies who pay the sums
                    deposited with them on demand, and governments whose circumstances are perfectly
                    desperate, are able to borrow. A stockholder’s mortgage (his claim on the
                    revenue of the country) can be immediately converted into cash at the current
                    prices. And, however much the majority of the public creditors may be impressed
                    with a conviction of the inability of the state to discharge <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the claims upon it, every particular individual, confident in his own
                    good fortune, foresight, and acuteness, flatters himself with the idea that <hi
                    rend="italic">he,</hi> at least, will be able to predict the coming tempest, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be able to sell out before a national
                    bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>Instead, however, of leaving the rate of interest to be adjusted by the
                    unfettered competition of the borrowers and lenders, on the principles we have
                    thus briefly explained, the governments of most countries have interfered,
                    either to prohibit the taking interest altogether, or to fix certain rates which
                    it was declared legal to exact, at the same time that any excess over these
                    rates was declared to be <hi rend="italic">usury,</hi> and prohibited under the
                    severest penalties. In the rude and unenlightened ages in which these enactments
                    had their origin, the precious metals, then the only species of money, were
                    considered as uninfluenced by the same principles which regulate the value of
                    other products. Being used both as standards whereby to ascertain the
                    comparative value of different commodities, and as the equivalents for which
                    they were most frequently exchanged, they acquired a factitious importance, not
                    merely in the estimation of the vulgar, but in that of persons of the greatest
                    discernment. The simple consideration that all buying and selling is really
                    nothing more than the bartering of one commodity for another, of a certain
                    quantity of corn or beef, for example, for a certain quantity of gold or silver,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> was entirely overlooked. The attention
                    was gradually transferred<pb break="no" facs="nls:192941988"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1988-0322"/> from the money’s worth to the money itself; and
                    the wealth of states and of individuals came to be measured, not by the
                    abundance of their disposable produce, by the quantity or value of the
                    commodities with which they could afford to purchase the precious metals, but by
                    the <hi rend="italic">quantity of these metals</hi> actually in their
                    possession. Because it sometimes happened that the holders of ordinary
                    commodities were unable easily to dispose of them at any price, whilst money was
                    always sure to find a ready and advantageous market, it was considered as
                    something mysterious, as areal <hi rend="italic">marchandise</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence.</hi> We cannot, therefore, be surprised at the
                    measures to which the erroneous opinions entertained respecting it necessarily
                    led; or that efforts should have been made to protect the interests of those who
                    were unprovided with so powerful an instrument, from becoming a prey to the
                    encroachments of their more fortunate neighbours. Every individual was allowed
                    freely to dispose of his corn, cattle, land, &amp;c.; but it was imagined there
                    was something peculiar in money, and that the desire to obtain it was so great,
                    that, unless the lenders were restrained in their demands, they would, by taking
                    advantage of the necessities of the borrowers, infallibly ruin them, and engross
                    the whole property of the country.</p>
                <p>Another source of the prejudice against stipulating for interest must be sought
                    for in the dislike so universally entertained in remote ages to accumulation.
                    There can be no accumulation without economy, without a saving of income; and
                    this was then not only considered as indicative of a sordid and avaricious
                    disposition, but as being positively hurtful. Before the nature and functions of
                    capital were properly understood, it was believed that it could not be increased
                    otherwise than by injuriously abstracting a portion of the national revenue, and
                    that any advantage it might give to the proprietor must have been obtained at
                    the public expense. It did not occur to our ancestors, that an individual who,
                    by his economy, has accumulated stock, has really added to the wealth of the
                    state, without diminishing that of others; nor were they aware that this stock,
                    when afterwards expended, as is almost always the case, in the support of
                    productive industry, would afford the means of producing an increased income.
                    But reckoning, as they did, the savings of individuals as so much withdrawn from
                    the public income, it was natural enough that they should endeavour to limit the
                    advantage to be derived from their employment.</p>
                <p>Much, also, of the prejudice against bargaining for interest, so prevalent in the
                    middle ages, may be traced to the authority of some texts of Scripture, which
                    were understood entirely to prohibit its exaction. It has, however, been shown,
                    that these texts will not really bear this interpretation; but, supposing that
                    they did, nothing, it is plain, could be more absurd than to consider the
                    municipal regulations of a people placed in such peculiar circumstances as the
                    Jews, as general and fixed principles, applicable in all ages and countries.</p>
                <p>But, whatever may have been the causes of the efforts so generally made to
                    regulate and limit the rate of interest, it is certain that, so far from
                    succeeding in their object, they have had a precisely opposite effect. Should a
                    borrower find it for his advantage to offer six, seven, or eight per cent, for a
                    loan (and unless it were for his advantage, nothing could possibly induce him to
                    make such an offer), what right has the legislator to interfere, and to prohibit
                    the lender from receiving, and the borrower from paying, more than four or five
                    per cent.? Such an interference is not only uncalled for and unnecessary, but it
                    is, in the highest degree, prejudicial. Restrictive laws, instead of reducing,
                    have uniformly contributed to raise the rate of interest. Nor is this any thing
                    more than might have been foreseen and expected. It is plain that no law can be
                    so framed as to prevent a borrower from offering a higher rate of interest than
                    what is fixed by statute; and if the lender had implicit confidence in the
                    secrecy and solvency of the borrower, he might accommodate him with the sum
                    wanted, without requiring any additional interest or <hi rend="italic">premium
                    of insurance</hi> because of the danger of entering into what the law declares
                    to be an <hi rend="italic">illegal</hi> transaction. But this must be a very
                    rare case. Gratitude, and a sense of benefits received, are, unfortunately, when
                    they come into contact with self-interest, but slender securities for honourable
                    conduct. Numberless unforeseen events occur to weaken and dissolve the best
                    cemented friendships; and a transaction of this kind would undoubtedly afford an
                    additional source of jealousies and divisions. In such matters, indeed, men are
                    more than usually sharp-sighted, and are very little disposed to trust to moral
                    guarantees for the security of their property. But neither the threatenings of
                    the law, nor the powerful inducements which it holds out to dishonest debtors to
                    break their engagements, and treacherously to recede from the stipulations to
                    which they had agreed, have been able to prevent, or even greatly to lessen,
                    what are termed <hi rend="italic">usurious</hi> bargains. Their only effect has
                    been, to oblige the lender to demand, and the borrower to bind himself to pay, a
                    higher rate of interest than would otherwise have been required. A bargain for
                    more than the statute rate of interest being declared illegal, the lender is
                    thus exposed to an additional <hi rend="italic">risk.</hi> But no person will
                    gratuitously place his fortune in a situation of comparative hazard; and,
                    therefore, the sum necessary to cover this risk must be proportioned to the
                    greater or less anxiety on the part of government to prevent and punish such
                    bargains; or, in other words, the rate of interest is invariably increased
                    according as the laws intended to reduce it become more severe, and diminished
                    according as they are relaxed.</p>
                <p>Thus a capitalist might be inclined to lend a sum at six or seven per cent.; but
                    as the law declares that any individual who shall stipulate for more than five
                    per cent, shall, if detected, forfeit <hi rend="italic">three times the
                    principal,</hi> it is clear, provided there was no method of defeating this
                    statute, that there must be an end of all borrowing, except when the market rate
                    of interest was below the statutory rate. Whenever it was above that rate, no
                    person would be able to obtain a single farthing in the way of loan. There
                    could, then, be no transference of capital. It would continue locked up in the
                    same hands; and the national property and welfare would, in consequence, suffer
                    severely. Luckily, however, the mutual interest and ingenuity of borrowers and
                    lenders have always proved an overmatch for the enactments of the law. These
                    have done nothing but fetter the transference of stock, and force the borrowers
                    to pay a higher rate of interest for it. What might have been borrowed at six
                    per cent., had there been no hazard from anti-usurious statutes, is, on account
                    of that hazard, raised to perhaps eight or even ten per cent.; and, what is
                    still worse, a contempt for the institutions of society, and a habit of carrying
                    on business in a secret and underhand manner, are generated. The odium which
                    attaches to a positively pernicious regulation, weakens the respect which would
                    otherwise be felt for those which are acknowledged to be advantageous; and that
                    spirit of frankness, openness, and sincerity, which, wherever it predominates,
                    is so highly valuable, is cramped in its development, or altogether supplanted,
                    by duplicity, extortion, and cunning.</p>
                <p>These conclusions do not rest on theory only, but are supported by a constant and
                    uniform experience. At Rome, during the period of the republic, the ordinary
                    rate of interest was excessively high. The debtors, or plebeians, were every now
                    and then threatening to deprive their creditors, who were generally of the
                    patrician <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942001" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2001-0323"
                    />order, not only of the interest of their capital, but of the principal itself.
                    Repeated instances occurred to show that these were not mere empty threats; and
                    the patricians were therefore obliged to indemnify themselves, by means of a
                    corresponding premium, for the risks to which they were exposed. “Des continuels
                    changements,” says Montesquieu, “soit par des loix, soit par des plebiscites,
                    naturalisèrent à Rome l’usure; car les créanciers, voyant le peuple leur
                    débiteur, leur législateur, et leur juge, n’eurent plus de confiance dans les
                    contrats. Le peuple, comme un débiteur decrédité, ne tentoit à lui prêter que
                    par <hi rend="italic">des gros profits;</hi> d’autant plus que, si les loix ne
                    venoient que de temps en temps, les plaintes du peuple étoient continuelles, et
                    intimidoient toujours les créanciers. Cela fit que tous les moyens honnêtes de
                    prêter et d’emprunter furent abolis à Rome, <hi rend="italic">et qu’une usure
                    affreuse, toujours foudroyée, et toujours renaissante, s y établit.</hi> Le mal
                    venoient de ce que les choses n’avoient pas été ménagés. Les loix extrêmes dans
                    le bien font naitre le mal extrême: <hi rend="italic">il fallut payer pour

                <p>In Mahommedan countries, notwithstanding the positive prohibition in the Koran,
                    the ordinary rate of interest is at least ten or twenty times as high as its
                    ordinary rate in Europe. “Eusure augmente dans les pays Mahometans d <hi

                <p>During the middle ages, the average rate of profit could not be much higher than
                    at present: “But the clamour and persecution raised against those who took
                    interest for the use of money was so violent, that they were obliged to charge
                    it much higher than the natural price, which, if it had been let alone, would
                    have found its level, in order to compensate for the opprobrium, and frequently
                    the plunder, which they suffered; and hence the usual rate of interest was what
                    we should now call most exorbitant and scandalous usury.”<note anchored="true"

                    lenders were exposed rendered the premium of insurance on all sorts of capital
                    excessively high; for, of the fifty and even a hundred per cent, which borrowers
                    then frequently engaged to pay as interest, not more than eight or ten per cent,
                    can properly be said to have been given for the productive services of capital.
                    The rest must be considered as a <hi rend="italic">bonus,</hi> to compensate the

                    very accurate estimate of the rate of profit in the middle ages; yet several
                    striking facts may be adduced in support of the opinion advanced in the text. At
                    Verona, in 1228, the interest of money wasfixed by law at twelve and a half per
                    cent. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, the republic of Genoa paid only
                    from seven to ten per cent, to her creditors; and the average discount on good
                    bills at Barcelona, in 1435, is stated to have been about ten per cent. But
                    whilst the rate of interest m Italy and Catalonia, where a considerable degree
                    of freedom was allowed to the parties concerned in bargaining for a loan, was
                    hus comparatively moderate, it was, in despite of its total prohibition,
                    incomparably higher in France and England. Matthew Paris mentions that, ⅛ the
                    reign of Henry III., the debtor paid ten per cent, every two months; and this,
                    though absolutely impossible <hi rend="superscript"> a3 a</hi> g <hi

                    far from the average interest charged on the few loans that were then contracted
                    for. (Hallam’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Middle Ages,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    402.)</p></note></p>
                <p>In France the rate of interest was fixed at five per cent, so early as 1665; and
                    this, a few short intervals only excepted, continued to be the legal rate until
                    the Revolution. Laverdy, in 1766, reduced it from five to four per cent.
                    Instead, however, of the market rate being proportionably reduced, it was raised
                    from five to six per cent. Previously to the promulgation of the edict, loans
                    might have been obtained on good security at five per cent.; but an additional
                    per cent, was now required to cover the risk of illegality. This caused the

                <p>Ιhe same thing happened in Livonia in 1786, when the Empress Catherine reduced
                    the legal rate of interest from six to five per cent. Hitherto, says Storch <hi
                    rend="italic">(in loco supra citato),</hi> those who had good security to offer
                    were able to borrow at six per cent.; but henceforth they had to pay seven per
                    cent, or upwards. And such will be found to have been invariably the case,
                    wherever governments have interfered to reduce the statutory below the market
                    rate of interest.</p>
                <p>From the earliest period of the history of England down to the reign of Henry
                    VIII., the taking of interest Was absolutely forbidden to all persons within the
                    realm except Jews and foreigners, who, nevertheless, were frequently plundered
                    for the sake of enriching the crown, under the miserable pretext of punishing
                    them for what were then called their “hellish extortions.” The disorders
                    occasioned by this ruinous interference on the part of government at length
                    became so obvious, that, notwithstanding the powerful prejudices to the
                    contrary, a statute was passed in 1546 (37 Hen. VIII. cap. 7), legalizing the
                    taking of interest to the extent of ten per cent, per annum; and this because,
                    as is recited in the words of the act, the statutes “prohibiting interest
                    altogether have so little force, that little or no punishment hath ensued to the
                    offenders.” In the reign of Edward VI. the horror against taking interest seems
                    to have revived in full force; for, in 1552, the taking of <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> interest was again prohibited, “as a vice most odious and detestable,”
                    and “contrary to the word of God.” But, in spite of this tremendous
                    denunciation, the ordinary rate of interest, instead of being reduced,
                    immediately rose to fourteen per cent., and continued at this rate until, in
                    1571, an act was passed (13 Eliz. cap. 8) repealing the act of Edward VI., and
                    reviving the act of Henry VIII., allowing ten per cent, interest. In the
                    preamble to this act it is stated, “that the prohibiting act of King Edward VI.
                    had not done so much good as was hoped for; <hi rend="italic">but that rather
                    the vice of usury hath muck mare exceedingly abounded,</hi> to the utter undoing
                    of many gentlemen, merchants, occupiers, and others, and to the importable hurt
                    of the commonwealth.” This salutary statute was opposed, even by those who, it
                    might have been expected, would have been among the first to emancipate
                    themselves from the prejudices of the age, with all the violence of ignorant
                    superstition. Dr John Wilson, a man famous in his day, and celebrated for the
                    extent and solidity of his learning, stated, in his place in the House of
                    Commons, that “it was not the amount of the interest taken that constituted the
                    crime; but that all lending for any gain, be it ever so little, was wickedness
                    before God and man, and a damnable deed in itself, and that there was no mean in
                    this vice any more than in murder or theft.” In order to quiet the consciences
                    of the bench of bishops, a clause was actually inserted, declaring <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> usury to have been forbidden by the law of God, and to be
                    in its nature sin, and detestable. When first enacted, this statute was limited
                    to a period of five years; but, “forasmuch as it was by proof and experience
                    found to be very necessary and profitable for the commonwealth of this realm,”
                    it was, in the same reign, made perpetual. (39 Eliz. cap. 18.)</p>
                <p>In the 21 st of James I. the legal rate of interest was reduced<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192942014" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2014-0324"/> to eight per cent., by an
                    act to continue for seven years only, but which was made perpetual in the
                    succeed-, ing reign. (3 Car. I. cap. 4.) During the commonwealth, the legal rate
                    of interest was reduced to six per cent., a reduction which was afterwards
                    confirmed by the act 12 Car. II. And, finally, in the reign of Queen Anne, a
                    statute (12 Anne, cap. 16) was framed, reducing the rate of interest to five per
                    cent., at which it now stands.</p>
                <p>In the preamble to this statute, it is stated, that, “whereas the reducing
                    interest to ten, and from thence to eight, and thence to six, in the hundred,
                    hath from time to time, by experience, been found very beneficial to the
                    advancement of trade and the improvement of lands, it is become absolutely
                    necessary to reduce the high rate of interest of six per cent, to a nearer
                    proportion to the interest allowed for money in foreign states.” It was for
                    these reasons enacted, that all bargains or contracts stipulating for a higher
                    rate of interest than five per cent, should be utterly void. And “that all
                    persons who should after that time receive, by means of any corrupt bargain,
                    loan, exchange, chevizance, or interest, of any wares, merchandise, or other
                    thing whatever, or by any deceitful way or means, or by any covin, engine, or
                    deceitful conveyance for the forbearing or giving day of payment, for one whole
                    year, for their money or other thing, above the sum of L.5 for L.100 for a year,
                    should forfeit, for every such offence, the <hi rend="italic">triple</hi> value
                    of the monies or other things so lent, bargained,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, previously to the Reformation, no interest could be legally exacted
                    for money. But this great event, by weakening the force of those religious
                    prejudices, which had chiefly dictated the laws prohibiting interest, occasioned
                    the adoption of sounder opinions on the subject, and led to the enactment of the
                    statute of 1587 (11 Parlt. Jac. VI. cap. 52), which legalized the taking of
                    interest to the extent of ten per cent. In 1633 the legal rate was reduced to
                    eight per cent., and in 1661 to six per cent. The statute of Queen Anne,
                    reducing the rate of interest to five per cent., extended to both kingdoms.</p>
                <p>The statutes prohibiting the taking <hi rend="italic">of</hi> interest in Ireland
                    were not repealed until 1635, when, by the statute 10 Car. I. cap. 22, liberty
                    was given to stipulate for interest to the extent of ten per cent. In 1704 this
                    rate was reduced to eight per cent.; in 1722 it was reduced to seven per cent.;
                    and in 1732 it was further reduced to six per cent., at which it has since
                    continued fixed.</p>
                <p>It has been observed by Dr Smith, that the different statutory regulations,
                    reducing the rate of interest in England, were made with great propriety.
                    Instead of preceding, they followed the fall which was gradually taking place in
                    the market rate of interest; and, therefore, did not contribute, as they
                    otherwise must have done, to raise the rate which they were intended to reduce.
                    Sir Josiah Child, whose celebrated Treatise, recommending a reduction of
                    interest to four per cent, was published about 1670, states positively, that the
                    goldsmiths in London, who then acted as bankers, could obtain as much money as
                    they pleased, upon their servants’ notes only, at four and a half per cent. The
                    supposed insecurity of the revolutionary establishment, and the novelty of· the
                    practice of funding, occasioned the payment of a high rate of interest for a
                    considerable portion of the sums borrowed by the public in the reigns of William
                    III. and Anne; but private persons, of undoubted credit, could then borrow at
                    less than five per cent. During the reign of George II. the market rate of
                    interest fluctuated from three to four and four and a half per cent.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the 18th of December 1752,
                    the three percents, brought the highest price they have hitherto reached,
                    namely, 10G; per cent. On the 20th of September 1797, the day on which the
                    failure of Lord Malmesbury’s attempt to negotiate with the French republic
                    transpired, consols fell to 47-∣, being the lowest price at which they have ever
                    been sold.</p></note></p>
                <p>Dr Smith mentions, that the increased means of profitably investing capital
                    acquired during the war which terminated in 1763, raised the market rate of
                    interest, subsequently to the peace of Paris, to a level with the statutory
                    rate, or perhaps higher. But this rise was only temporary, and it was not until
                    the late war that any very material or general inconvenience was found to result
                    from the limitation of the rate of interest to five per cent.</p>
                <p>It is necessary, however, to observe, that this remark applies exclusively to the
                    loans negotiated by individuals who could offer unexceptionable security; for,
                    ever since the passing of the act 1714, persons engaged in employments of more
                    than ordinary hazard, whose character for prudence and punctuality did not stand
                    high, or who could only offer inferior security, were unable to borrow at five
                    per cent., and have in consequence been compelled to resort to a variety of
                    schemes for defeating and evading the enactments in the statute. The most common
                    device was the sale of an annuity. Thus, supposing an individual whose personal
                    credit was not good, and who had only the liferent of an estate to give in
                    security, wanted to borrow any given sum, he sold an annuity to the lender
                    sufficient to pay the interest stipulated for, which, because of the risks and
                    odium attending such transactions, was always higher than the market rate, and
                    also to pay the <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> necessary to insure payment of
                    the principal on the death of the borrower. It is curious to observe, that
                    although the sale of an <hi rend="italic">irredeemable</hi> life annuity, at a
                    rate exceeding legal interest, was not reckoned fraudulent or usurious; yet, so
                    late as 1743, Lord Hardwicke held, that in their less exceptionable form, or
                    when they were <hi rend="italic">redeemable,</hi> annuities could only be looked
                    upon as an evasion of the statute of usury, and a loan of money.<note

                    inexpediency of this distinction soon became obvious, and the law on this
                    subject is now entirely changed. The greater extension of the traffic in
                    annuities, and the advantage of giving as much publicity as possible to such
                    transactions, led to various parliamentary inquiries and regulations respecting
                    them in the early part of the reign of his late majesty. The consequence has
                    been, that irredeemable annuities are now nearly unknown, and that the sale of a
                    redeemable annuity cannot be impeached, although it should appear en the face of
                    the deeds that the lender had secured the principal by effecting an assurance of
                    the borrower’s life·<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By
                    the act 53 Geo. III. cap. 141, it is enacted, “That a memorial, setting forth
                    the date of every deed, bond, instrument, or other assurance, whereby an annuity
                    or rent-charge shall be granted for one or more life or lives, or for a certain
                    number of years, the names of all the witnesses, and of all the parties thereto,
                    the sum given for the security, and the amount of the annuity itsel*; shall be
                    registered in the Court of Chancery.” This act only applies to England and
                    Wales.</p></note></p>
                <p>During the greater part of the late war, however, the usury laws operated, not to
                    the prejudice of one, but of all classes of borrowers. The extent of the loans,
                    the high rate of interest given by the state, the facility of selling out of the
                    funds, the regularity with which the dividends were paid, and the temptations
                    arising from the fluctuations in the price of funded property, diverted so large
                    a proportion of the floating capital of the country into the coffers of the
                    treasury, as to render it next to impossible for a private individual to borrow
                    at the legal rate of interest, except from the trustees of public companies, or
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942027" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2027-0325"/>through the
                    influence of circumstances of a very peculiar nature. The proprietors of
                    unencumbered freehold estates, of which they had the absolute disposal, were
                    almost universally obliged to resort to those destructive expedients which had
                    formerly been the resource only of spendthrifts, and persons in the most
                    desperate circumstances. Annuities were not unfrequently granted for the term of
                    several lives, at the rate of twelve, fourteen, fifteen, and even twenty per
                    cent., exclusive of the premium of insurance on the lives of the persons named
                    in the grant of the annuities. Mr Onslow, in his speech on the usury laws, 23d
                    of May 1816, mentions that he knew the case of a gentleman possessed of a very
                    large estate in <hi rend="italic">feesimple,</hi> who had <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> been compelled to grant an annuity for <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    lives (and the survivor of them), named by the grantee, for <hi rend="italic"
                    >eight</hi> years’ purchase.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Report of the Committee on the Usury Laws, laid before die
                    House of Commons in</hi> 1818, contains much valuable evidence, establishing the
                    impolicy and the pernicious effects of these laws in the clearest manner. Mr
                    Sugden, a gentleman very extensively concerned in the management of landed
                    property, stated, that when the market rate of interest rose above the legal
                    rate, the landed proprietor was compelled to resort to some shift to evade the
                    usury laws. For this purpose, Mr Sugden informed the committee he had “known
                    annuities granted for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> lives, at ten per cent, upon
                    fee-simple estates, unencumbered, and of great annual value, in a register
                    county. He had also known annuities granted for <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    lives, and more would have been added, but for the danger of equity setting
                    aside the transaction on account of the inadequacy of the consideration.
                    Latterly many annuities were granted for a term of years certain, not depending
                    upon lives.” On being asked whether, if there were no laws limiting the rate of
                    interest, better terms conld or could not have been obtained, Mr Sugden
                    answered, “I am decidedly of opinion that <hi rend="italic">better terms</hi>
                    could have been obtained; for there is a stigma which attaches to men who lend
                    money upon annuities, that drives all respectable men out of the market. Some
                    leading men did latterly embark in such transactions, but I never knew a man of
                    reputation in my own profession lend money in such a manner, although we have
                    the best means of ascertaining the safest securities, and of ob- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> taining the best terms. In all loans, two solicitors
                    are invariably concerned, one for the borrower and one for the lender; and
                    although the borrower always pays the expense of the securities, yet a regular
                    professional bill is invariably made out; whereas, in the case of an annuity,
                    although it is in strictness a loan, only one solicitor is employed, and he
                    never makes out a regular bill, but charges what is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lumping sum,</hi> for all his expense and trouble in the transaction.” And, in
                    another place, Mr Sugden observes, “the temptation on the part of a solicitor to
                    lend money upon annuities is very strong, because, <hi rend="italic">without any
                    check upon his charges, he demands whatever sum he pleases, and he takes care
                    that it is instantly paid</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">for in
                    no instance is the borrower allowed to leave the room until lie has paid the
                    solicitor’s charge!’</hi> “Nothing,” Mr Sugden justly adds, “short of <hi
                    rend="italic">a repeal of the usury laws</hi> can put a stop to the abuses which
                    attend grants of annuities: they strongly encourage a spirit of gambling; for,
                    as the repayment of the money lent cannot be enforced, and the annuity is
                    granted upon a contingency, the borrower too frequently neglects to provide for

                    annuity.”</p>
                <p>“T lie laws against usury,” says Mr Holland, partner of ħ ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ous</hi> θ °f Raring, Brothers, and Company, and one of the
                    best informed merchants in the country, <hi rend="superscript"> ¢¢</hi> drive
                    men in distress, or in want of money, to much more disastrous modes of raising
                    it than they would adopt if no usury laws existed. The landowner requires
                    capital to increase his live stock, or improve his land, or for any other
                    purpose, at a period when the government is borrowing money at above five per
                    cent., or when the funds give a greater interest than five per cent.; no one
                    will then lend to the landowner, because his money is worth more to him than the
                    law allows him to take; the landowner must, therefore, either give up his
                    improvements, or borrow money on annuity interests, on much more disadvantageous
                    terms than he could have done if no Jaw existed against usury. The man in trade,
                    in want of money for an unexpected demand, or .disappointed in his returns, must
                    fulfil his engagements, or forfeit his credit. He might have borrowed money at
                    six per cent., but the law allows no one to lend it to him, and he must sell
                    some of the commodity he holds, at a reduced price, in order to meet his
                    engagements. For example, he holds sugar which is worth 80s.; but he is
                    compelled to sell it immediately for 70s. to the man who will give ĥim cash for
                    it, and thus actually borrows money at twelve and a half per cent., which, had
                    the law allowed him, he might have borrowed from a money dealer at six per cent.
                    It is known to every merchant, that <hi rend="italic">cases of this kind are
                    common occurrences in every commercial town, and more especially in the
                    metropolis.</hi> A man in distress for money pays more interest, owing to the
                    usury laws, than he would if no such laws existed; because now he is obliged to
                    go to some of the disreputable money lenders to borrow, as he knows the
                    respectable money lender will not break the laws of his country. The
                    disreputable money lender knows that he has the <hi rend="italic">ordinary
                    risk</hi> of his debtor to incur in lending his money <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi>, and he has further to encounter the <hi rend="italic">penalty of the
                    law,</hi> for both of which risks the borrower must pay. If no usury laws
                    existed, in common cases, and where a person is respectable, he might obtain a
                    loan from the respectable money lender, who would then only have to calculate
                    his ordinary risk, and the compensation for the use of his money.”</p>
                <p>In every part of the appendix to the <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> we meet with
                    equally conclusive evidence of the pernicious effects of the laws restraining
                    the rate of interest. And the committee admitted the full force of this
                    evidence, by agreeing to the following resolutions: Is/, “That it is the opinion
                    of this committee, that the laws regulating or restraining the rate of interest
                    have been extensively evaded, and have failed of the effect of imposing a
                    maximum on such rate; and that, of late years, from the constant excess of the
                    market rate of interest above the rate limited by law, they have added to the
                    expense incurred by borrowers on real security <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>,
                    and that such borrowers have been compelled to resort to the mode of granting
                    annuities on lives; a mode which has been made a cover for obtaining a higher
                    rate of interest than the rate limited by law, and has farther subjected the
                    borrowers to enormous charges, or forced them to make very disadvantageous sales
                    of their estates. 2d, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the
                    construction of such laws, as applicable to the transactions of commerce as at
                    present carried on, have been attended with much uncertainty as to the legality
                    of many transactions of frequent occurrence, and consequently been productive of
                    much embarrassment and litigation. 3⅛ That it is the opinion of this committee,
                    that the present period, when the market rate of interest is below the legal
                    rate, affords an opportunity peculiarly favourable for the repeal of the said
                    laws.”</p>
                <p>In spite, however, of the recommendation of the committee, and of the clear and
                    satisfactory nature of the evidence on which it is founded, the popular
                    prejudice on this subject continues so strong, that there does not seem much
                    reason to expect that this desirable measure will be speedily effected.</p>
                <p>It is most absurdly supposed, that, were the laws limiting the rate of interest
                    repealed, every individual who has <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942040"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-2040-0326"/>capital to lend would henceforth indulge in all
                    those mean and disgraceful practices which at present characterise the lowest
                    class of money brokers. But it might just as reasonably be supposed, that were
                    country gentlemen allowed to sell game, they would immediately become addicted
                    to all the vices of the poacher. The truth is, that if the rate of interest was
                    left to be adjusted by the unrestricted competition of the parties, there would
                    be almost no employment for the inferior class of money dealers: Except when the
                    <hi rend="italic">market</hi> rate of interest is below the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legal rate</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> i</hi> the
                    usury laws prevent all persons, whose credit is not extremely good, from
                    obtaining loans from capitalists of the highest character, and force them to
                    have recourse to those who are less scrupulous. Supposing the market rate of
                    interest to be six or seven per cent., an individual in ordinarily good credit
                    might, were the usury laws abolished, easily obtain a loan at that rate. But the
                    law having declared that no more than five per cent, shall be taken, and
                    consequently having affixed a species of stigma to those lenders who bargain for
                    a higher rate, necessarily excludes the rich and more respectable capitalists
                    from the market, and obliges borrowers to resort to those of an inferior
                    character, who, in addition to the premium for the risk incurred by entering
                    into an illegal transaction, must receive an indemnification for the <hi
                    rend="italic">odium</hi> which, in such cases, always attaches to the lender. It
                    is idle and ridiculous to attempt to secure individuals against the risk of
                    imposition in pecuniary, more than in any other species of transactions. But
                    although the object were really desirable, it could not possibly be obtained by
                    such inadequate means. The usury laws generate the very mischief they are
                    intended to suppress. Far from diminishing, they most unquestionably multiply
                    usurious transactions in a tenfold proportion, and powerfully aggravate all the
                    evils they were designed either to mitigate or remove.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be more unreasonable, or more entirely unfounded, than the clamour
                    that has been set up against usurers, as money-lenders are sometimes termed,
                    because of their exacting a higher rate of interest than ordinary from prodigals
                    and spendthrifts. This, surely, is the most proper and efficient check that can
                    be put upon the thoughtless or unprincipled extravagance of such persons.
                    Supposing the security of a prodigal and of an industrious man to be nearly
                    equal, and this can scarcely ever be the case, does not the capitalist who would
                    lend to the latter at a lower rate of interest than he would lend to the former,
                    confer a real service on his country? Does he not prevent those funds which
                    ought to be employed in supporting useful labour, and in adding to the real
                    wealth of the nation, from being wasted in ridiculous extravagances or
                    boisterous dissipation?</p>
                <p>But, perhaps, we shall be told, that this is mistaking the object of the usury
                    laws; that they were not intended to force capitalists to lend to spendthrifts
                    at the same rate of interest as to industrious persons, but to protect the
                    prodigal and unwary from the extortion of usurers, by declaring any stipulation
                    between them for more than a given rate of interest to be null and void. But why
                    all this solicitude about the least valuable class of society? Wby fetter and
                    restrict the free circulation of capital amongst those who would turn it to the
                    best account, lest any portion of it might chance to fall into the hands of
                    those who would squander it away? If the prevention of prodigality be an object
                    of sufficient importance to justify the interference of the legislature, why not
                    at once put the prodigal under an <hi rend="italic">interdicts</hi> This is the
                    only way in which it is possible to restrict him. It is not so much by borrowing
                    money at high interest, as by contracting debts to merchants, on whose charge
                    there is no check that spendthrifts generally run through their fortunes. Mr
                    Bentham has justly observed, that so long as a man is looked upon as one who
                    will pay, he can much easier get the goods he wants than he could the money to
                    buy them with though he were content to give for it twice or thrice the ordinary
                    rate of interest. How ridiculous is it, then, to stimulate this natural facility
                    of purchasing, to permit prodigals to borrow (for it is really borrowing) the
                    largest supplies of food, clothes, &amp;c. at twenty, thirty, or even a hundred
                    per cent, interest, at the same time that we inflict a real injury on every
                    other class of society, rather than permit them to borrow the smallest supply of
                    money at more than five per cent. Instead of being of any service, this
                    restriction is evidently injurious to the prodigal. It narrows his choice, and
                    drives him from a market which might have proved much less disadvantageous, to
                    one in which no disgrace attaches to the exaction of the most exorbitant
                    interest, and where he can scarcely escape being ruined.</p>
                <p>Neither is the outcry raised against capitalists for taking advantage of the
                    necessities of industrious individuals, in any degree better founded than that
                    which is raised against them for taking advantage of the extravagant and
                    thoughtless disposition of the prodigal or the simple. According as a person has
                    a character for sobriety, and for punctuality in making his engagements, and
                    according to the presumed state of his affairs at the time, so will he be able
                    to borrow. To say that a capitalist took advantage of the necessities of any
                    individual, is only saying that he refused to lend to a person in suspicious or
                    necessitous circumstances, at the same rate of interest he would have done had
                    he been in high credit, or, which is the same thing, had there been no <hi
                    rend="italic">risk</hi> of losing the principal; and had he not acted in this
                    manner, should we not have justly considered him as a fool or a madman?</p>
                <p>But, as has already been shown, whatever may be the extortion of lenders, the
                    usury laws afford no means of checking it; on the contrary, they compel the
                    borrowers to pay, over and above the common rate of interest, a <hi
                    rend="italic">premium</hi> sufficient to indemnify the lender for the risk and
                    odium incurred in <hi rend="italic">breaking them.</hi> They attempt to remedy
                    what is not an evil, and what, consequently, ought not to be interfered with;
                    and in doing this they necessarily create a real grievance. What should we have
                    thought of an act of parliament to compel the underwriters to insure a gunpowder
                    magazine and a salt warehouse on the same terms? Yet this would not have been in
                    any respect more absurd than to enact that the same rate of interest should be
                    charged on capital lent to those whose security is widely different.</p>
                <p>Luckily we are not left to infer from general principles, however well
                    established, the many advantages that would result from a repeal of the laws
                    limiting the rate of interest. The case of Holland furnishes a practical and
                    striking proof of the correctness of the theory we have been endeavouring to
                    establish. It is an undoubted fact, that the rate of interest has been, for a
                    very long period, lower in Holland than in any other country in Europe; and yet
                    Holland is the only country in which usury laws are altogether unknown, where
                    capitalists are allowed to demand, and borrowers to pay, any rate of
                    interest.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strictly
                    speaking, this applies only to the state of Holland previously to the Revolution

                    it appears, from the Report of the Parliamentary Committee on the Usury Laws,
                    that they have not, in any instance, been acted upon.</p></note> Notwithstanding

                    interest in Holland has continued comparatively steady. During the whole of that
                    period, persons who could offer unexceptionable security have been able to
                    borrow at from three to five and a half per cent. ;· nor has the average rate of
                    interest charged on capital, advanced on the worst species of security, ever
                    exceeded six or seven per cent., except when the government was negotiating a
                    forced loan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The general

                    According to the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon,</hi> only six per cent,
                    interest is allowed to be taken in commercial affairs, and five per cent, when
                    money is advanced on the security of real property. There is not, however, any
                    difficulty in evading this law. The method resorted to for this purpose, is to
                    give a <hi rend="italic">bonus</hi> before competing the transaction, or, which
                    is the same thing, to frame the obligation for the debt for a larger sum than
                    was really advanced by the lender. None of the parties particularly interested
                    can be called to swear to the fact of such a <hi rend="italic">bonus</hi> being
                    given; so that the transaction is unimpeachable, unless a third party, who was
                    privy to the settling of the affair, can be produced as a witness. The Bank of
                    France never discounts at a higher rate of interest than five per cent., but
                    sometimes at a lower rate.</p>
                <p>In Hamburg the rate of interest is quite unrestricted; or, if there be a written
                    law restraining it, it has become altogether obsolete. The rate, therefore,
                    varies according to circumstances. Occasionally it has been at seven, eight, and
                    even ten per cent.; and, in 1799, a period of great mercantile embarrassment and
                    insecurity, it was as high as fourteen per cent. Generally, however, the rate of
                    discount on good bills does not exceed four or five per cent. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>; In Russia the legal rate of interest is six per
                    cent. But as Russia is a country capable of much improvement, and where there
                    are very great facilities for the advantageous employment of capital, the market
                    rate of interest is invariably higher than the statute rate, and the law is as
                    constantly as it is easily evaded. <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi></p>
                <p>At Trieste, and throughout the Austrian empire in general, the usual rate of
                    interest is fixed by law at six per cent.; but capital can seldom be obtained
                    for less than eight or ten per cent. <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi></p>
                <p>At Leghorn the ordinary rate of interest is a half per cent, per month, or six
                    per cent, per annum; but there is no law to prevent the taking of a higher
                    rate.</p>
                <p>In Spain the ordinary rate of interest is six per cent.; but no law exists
                    against taking a higher rate, and it seldom falls below five or rises above
                    seven per cent.</p>
                <p>In the United States legal interest is fixed at six per cent.; but the market
                    rate fluctuates from ten to twelve per cent. Efforts, Mr Birkbeck informs us,
                    are now making in various parts of the Union, particularly in Virginia and North
                    Carolina, to do away the restraints on usury, which, as he justly observes, “<hi
                    rend="italic">operate merely as a tax on the needy borrower?</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 6</hi></p>
                <p>If usury laws are to have any existence, they ought certainly to be made to
                    operate on the greatest of all borrowers; on those who do not borrow on their
                    own credit, but on that of others. Is it not the extreme of folly, that, whilst
                    an industrious manufacturer, or agriculturist, is prevented from giving more
                    than five per cent, for capital, which he might be able to invest so as to yield
                    ten or twelve per cent., government should be allowed to borrow at six, eight,
                    ten, or twenty per cent.? What is this but holding out a bait to loan-mongers,
                    and causing the capital of the country to flow with an accelerated and unnatural
                    velocity into the treasury? Nothing surely can be more impolitic than this. If
                    we are to have usury laws, they ought to operate alike on every class of
                    borrowers; and, considering the superior attractions which the facility of
                    repossessing the principal gives to the investment of capital in the funds, the
                    rate of interest at which government should be allowed to borrow should be <hi
                    rend="italic">less</hi> than the rate at which private individuals might
                    borrow.</p>
                <p>We trust, however, that we have said enough to show the inexpediency and the
                    pernicious tendency of all such regulations. If a landlord is to be allowed to
                    take the highest rent he can get offered for his land, a farmer the highest
                    price for his raw produce, a manufacturer for his goods, why should a capitalist
                    be restricted and fettered in the employment of his stock? Every principle of
                    natural justice, and of sound political expediency, is outraged by such a
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>So long as the market rate of interest continued higher than the statutory rate,
                    it cannot be doubted that considerable inconvenience would have resulted from
                    any <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> abolition of the usury laws. It is certain,
                    indeed, that this inconvenience would have been very speedily compensated by the
                    check which the abolition would have given to the traffic in annuities, and by
                    the easier circulation and more advantageous distribution of capital. Now,
                    however, when the market is fallen below the statutory <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192942066" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2066-0328"/>rate of interest, no
                    inconvenience could attend their repeal. It could not lead to any demand for
                    payment of borrowed money, for no individual would require payment of what he
                    could not relend to greater advantage. But, while their repeal would be in no
                    respect disadvantageous, it would enable those who are engaged in employments of
                    more than ordinary hazard, to procure adequate supplies of stock on more
                    favourable terms; and it would also secure us against the risk of future
                    mischief should the market again rise above the legal rate of interest. It is
                    unnecessary, however, to urge the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> repeal of the
                    usury laws. We think it quite visionary to apprehend any danger from the instant
                    application of a sponge to the whole of the anti-usurious statutes, but it is
                    enough if they are repealed <hi rend="italic">gradually.</hi> To avoid exciting
                    any alarm in the minds of the most timid, the rate at which capital may be
                    legally lent at interest might .be annually raised <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">one half</hi> per cent., until the rate had been extended to
                    eight or ten per cent., when it is clear every restrictive regulation might be
                    abolished, without the possibility of the smallest derangement happening in
                    consequence.</p>
                <p>Were the usury laws abolished, it would be proper to frame a statute which should
                    fix the interest to be paid in those cases in which no previous agreement had
                    been made respecting it. But as, in cases of this description, there is very
                    frequently considerable doubt whether it was the intention of the parties at the
                    time the transaction took place, that any interest should be charged, it would
                    be proper to give the borrower the full benefit of this doubt, by fixing the
                    rate payable in such cases at the lowest market rate.</p>
                <p>Before concluding, we may remark, that, until the laws regulating the rate of
                    profit and the increase of capital had been accurately investigated, the great
                    wealth and commercial prosperity of Holland was invariably appealed to as a
                    practical proof of the advantages of a low rate of interest. But Sir Josiah
                    Child, and those who have insisted so much on this example, forget that the
                    lowness of interest in Holland was the necessary effect of the circumstances in
                    which that country was placed; of the lowness of profits, caused by the
                    oppressiveness of taxation, and the deficient supply of fertile soil, and not of
                    any <hi rend="italic">interference</hi> on the part of the government. Neither
                    was this lowness of interest any advantage, but a positive disadvantage. A
                    country, whose average rate of profit, and consequently of interest, has been
                    reduced considerably below the level of surrounding nations, may,
                    notwithstanding, abound in wealth, and be possessed of an immense capital; but
                    it would be the height of error to suppose that this reduction of profits and
                    interest could have facilitated their accumulation. Capital cannot be
                    accumulated otherwise than by a saving of income; and wherever incomes are
                    large, and this will always be the case where the rate of profit is
                    comparatively high, there must be a proportionably increased facility of
                    gratifying the prevalent passion for accumulation. The case of Holland far from
                    contradicting, furnishes a striking exarpple of the truth of this principle. Sir
                    William Temple mentions that her trade was rather on the decline in 1670; and
                    the large capital of which she was then in possession had been accumulated
                    previously to her wars with Cromwell, and when the rate of profit was much
                    higher than at any subsequent period. Low profits are a certain proof that
                    society has become clogged in its progress. They show that it is approaching, if
                    it has not already reached, the stationary state, and that, unless measures can
                    be devised for relieving the pressure on the resources of the state, it will be
                    thrown back in the career of improvement, and outstripped by its neighbours. The
                    rate of profit and the rate of interest are ordinarily twice as high in the
                    United States as in Great Britain or France, and it is to this that the more
                    rapid advancement of the former in wealth and population is entirely to be
                    ascribed. High profits, it is true, may not in every instance be accompanied by
                    a great degree of prosperity; for a despotic government, or the want of
                    sufficient protection, may paralyze all the efforts of those who are otherwise
                    placed in the most favourable circumstances for the accumulation of wealth. But,
                    <hi rend="italic">if the government be equally liberal, and if property be
                    equally well secured, the degree of national prosperity will be correspondent
                    to' the rate of profit.</hi> The demand for labour, or, which is in effect the
                    same thing, the funds for supporting the largest and most valuable portion of
                    society, increase or diminish in exact proportion to the increase or diminution
                    of profits. Wherever they are high, the labourer is well paid, and the society
                    rapidly augments both its population and its riches; on the other hand, wherever
                    they are low, the demand for labour is proportion ably reduced, and the progress
                    of society rendered so much the slower.</p>
                <p>Instead, therefore, of a low rate of profit, and a low rate of interest, for the
                    one must be always directly as the other, being any proof of the flourishing
                    situation of a country, it is distinctly and completely the reverse. High
                    profits show that capital may be readily and beneficially invested in the
                    different branches of industry, and wherever this is the case, it will be better
                    for the borrower to pay a high rate of interest than it would be for him to pay
                    a lower rate, in countries where there is less facility of employing his stock
                    with advantage. The borrower who pays ten or twelve per cent, for capital in the
                    United States generally makes a more profitable bargain than the English
                    borrower who pays only four or five per cent. It is obviously not by the
                    circumstance of the rate of interest payable on loans being absolutely high or
                    low, but by the proportion between that rate and the average rate of profit,
                    that we must determine whether they have been obtained on favourable or
                    unfavourable terms. (c. c.)</p>
