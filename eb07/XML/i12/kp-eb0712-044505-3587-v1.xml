                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">hasty</hi> inspection of irrigation and draining would
                    Iead to the belief that they are founded on opposite principles. It is seen that
                    draining deprives the land of water, and that irrigation, on the contrary,
                    supplies it with water. It is obvious that the great object of draining, and
                    particularly of furrow-draining, is to present surface water which descends
                    through the upper soil to the retentive substrata below it, with frequent
                    opportunities of egress; and it is also obvious, that the great object of
                    irrigation is to supply the upper soil, the firm foundation on which plants rear
                    their superstructures, as much of surface-water as it can retain, for the
                    purpose of promoting increased vegetation. Notwithstanding this apparent
                    difference in principle between them, both induce similar effects, but the
                    origin of which, lying deeper than the surface of the ground, might easily
                    escape the notice of superficial observers. Both operations, in the first place,
                    are meant to prevent all <hi rend="italic">stagnation</hi> of water in the upper
                    and under soils; both in fact create <hi rend="italic">currents</hi> of water in
                    the soil; and these circumstances are of themselves quite adequate to explain
                    the effects of draining and irrigation on the same principle, and for the same
                    purpose,—the promotion of vegetation. It has been found that all plants usually
                    cultivated in agriculture cannot survive in stagnant water, and that in it their
                    places are taken by others of a coarse nature. Now, aqueous meteors are
                    generated in the atmosphere, and afterwards fall on the ground, and reach plants
                    by the absorption of the soil in large quantities, and would stagnate there,
                    were draining not to draw off the superfluous water unnecessary to vegetation in
                    sensible currents, and prevent its stagnation. In like manner, although
                    irrigation presents a copious flow* of water to the soil; yet it provides the
                    means of drawing off the redundancy in sensible currents, and preventing
                    stagnation. As draining has the effect of rendering retentive subsoils porous,
                    so irrigation is practised with most effect on porous soils. In short, so
                    dependent are irrigation and draining on each other, that the former acts most
                    beneficially only in conjunction with the latter. Thus the principle which is
                    common to draining and irrigation is the prevention of the stagnation of water;
                    and although of a negative character, it affords sure outlets to the
                    superabundant moisture, and directly promotes vegetation.</p>
                <p>The principle on which land is irrigated being thus explained, let us see how it
                    may be made to operate practically, how land is really irrigated. There are four
                    ways of irrigating land with water; and in order to preserve a command over its
                    motions, it must in all cases enter the land to be irrigated at a higher level
                    than where it leaves it.</p>

                <p>This disposition of materials is the only way to make water move in a sensible
                    and equable current, líŕ, One kind of irrigation is called Bed-work Irrigation,
                    which is the most efficient kind by which currents of water can be applied to
                    level ground. 2&lt;7, Another kind is called Catch-work Irrigation, which is
                    suited to uneven ground. 3&lt;Z, A third gets the name of Subterraneous
                    Irrigation, from the water being supplied upwards to the surface through drains
                    in the subsoil. <hi rend="italic">Ath,</hi> And the fourth kind is called
                    Warping, when the water is allowed to stand over a level field till it has
                    deposited the mud it contains.</p>
                <p>Several particulars require deliberate consideration before determining on
                    forming any kind of water-meadow. The vicinity of a river is a requisite
                    particular, not so much on account of the supply of water, for that may be
                    obtained in winter beside a mountain torrent or a lake, but on account of the
                    fertilizing matter which is generally suspended in the waters of a river. Hcnce
                    a river, flowing through an alluvial and cultivated country, is preferable to
                    one through a mountainous and rocky country. An ample supply of water is
                    absolutely necessary to beneficial irrigation. It is folly to incur the expense
                    of forming the most perfect water-meadow without an ample supply of water to
                    fill the channels to overflowing. The supply of the water must be on a higher
                    level than the ground to be irrigated. The fall need not be more than is
                    necessary for a pretty rapid current of water, which in ordinary cases may be
                    ten inches or a foot for one hundred or two hundred yards, and about two feet
                    for three hundred yards. The water, if possible, should be taken as far above
                    the meadows as to have a sufficient fall without damming up the river. When this
                    plan is impracticable, but only when impracticable, a dam should be thrown
                    across the stream at such a distance above the meadow, as to secure not only a
                    sufficient fall, but the fields on both sides of the river from inundation,
                    whether the fields belong to different proprietors or not. For, in regard to
                    dams across small streams which form the boundaries of farms or estates, it may
                    not bc ’rrelevant to mention that altercations have frequently arisen from
                    supposed damages arising from inundations or infringements on the rights of
                    waters. In every case, therefore, of constructing a dam for irrigation, it will
                    be wise to avoid the chance of disputes, by acquiring, in the first place, the
                    right for such an erection by purchase or otherwise. When a dam is inevitable,
                    it should be constructed substantially. The first cost will bc less than the
                    repairing of a dam which has blown up from under or burst out at the sides. When
                    water cannot be obtained under these pre-requisites, conjoined to an ample
                    supply, then the formation of water-meadows at that place should be altogether
                    relinquished. But should the requisite desiderata be available, the field to be
                    converted into a water meadow should in the first place be thoroughly drained.
                    The most perfect piece of workmanship as a water-meadow will be comparatively
                    useless, unless the water which has passed through the soil to the subsoil find
                    a free egress by drains. Without drains the water will inevitably stagnate on
                    the subsoil, unless indeed the subsoil consists of very porous materials, such
                    as sand, gravel, or fissured rock.</p>
                <p>Besides the particulars enumerated, two essential rules in the formation of
                    water-meadows should never be neglected, namely, that no part of them, however
                    small, should be on a dead level; and that every drop of water, while
                    irrigating, should be kept constantly in motion. These rules are founded on the
                    very principle of irrigation which has been illustrated in the prefatory
                    remarks. True inclined planes can be the only form of surface to which these
                    rules will strictly apply; but although it may not be possible to stretch such
                    planes along a great extent of surface, as ground is proverbially uneven, yet
                    every portion of it which is watered directly from the main supply should be so
                    exactly inclined. The spirit-level should be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vade-mecum</hi> of the irrigator, the eye being deceptive in regard to the
                    levelness of ground; and even with that indispensable instrument, the irrigator
                    will find the formation of a complete water-meadow on an irregular surface no
                    easy task. Superficial observers may see little difficulty in the operation; but
                    the practical irrigator knows how nice a thing it is to adjust irregularities of
                    ground to the constant and equable flow of water. So great is this difficulty,
                    that none but professional irrigators ought to attempt the formation of
                    water-meadows, and they ought to be of established character and experience;
                    for, as Arthur Young wisely remarks, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> I should
                    recommend, in the first instance, the employment of a professed irrigator, could
                    the young farmer possess knowledge enough to ascertain the skill of such a man;
                    but I have seen such gross blunders made in Norfolk by such a one, on the farms
                    of four or five persons, and yet highly recommended and coming from
                    Gloucestershire, that I really think a man may just as well trust to himself,
                    with the assistance of books, as put any faith in men who are reputed skilful
                    only in proportion to the ignorance of those who employ them. In the cases to
                    which I allude, the ignorance was unpardonable; for, as they discovered that he
                    drew out all his works without the assistance of a spirit level, they ought to
                    have dismissed him. Not that such a man cannot make improvements, no one can
                    well contrive to bring water on land without improving it; but to pay L. 4 or L.
                    5, or perhaps more, per acre, for using a small quantity of water to <hi
                    rend="italic">same</hi> advantage, when the same might be used elsewhere to the
                    <hi rend="italic">greatest,</hi> is, comparatively speaking, throwing away
                    money.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>The first thing to be done for any water meadow is to make the conductor or drain
                    which brings the water from the river to the meadow. The size of the conductor
                    depends entirely on the quantity of water which the meadow requires. Its bottom,
                    at its junction with the river, should always be as low as the bottom of the
                    river, in order to carry away as much mud as possible to the meadows. Its course
                    should be as straight and as near an inclined plane as possible. The stuff taken
                    out of the conductor should be employed in equalizing its banks, or filling up
                    irregularities in the meadow. These general directions naturally lead to the
                    examination of the particulars of which the different kinds of water meadows
                    enumerated consist.</p>
                <p>I. BED-WORK IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>This species of irrigation is eminently applicable to level ground, and under it,
                    as the name implies, the ground is thrown into <hi rend="italic">beds</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">ridges.</hi> After the conductor has been brought from the
                    river to the meadow as directed, it should be led along the highest end or side
                    of the meadow in an inclined plane; and should it terminate in the meadow, and
                    not have to proceed farther on to another, its end should be made to taper when
                    there are no feeders, or to terminate in a feeder. The tapered end will retard
                    the motion of the water, and containing, of course, less water, the water will
                    overflow the banks of the conductor. The main drain to carry off the water after
                    it has irrigated the meadow should next be formed. It should be cut in the
                    lowest part of the ground at the lower end or side of the meadow. Its dimensions
                    should be capable of carrying off the whole water used, so quickly as to prevent
                    the least stagnation, and discharge it into the river. The stuff taken out of it
                    should be used to fill up irregularities in the meadow. In case the river takes
                    a turn along the lower end or side of the meadow, the turn should be used as a
                    main drain to carry off the water, and save the expense, of cutting a drain It

                <p>may be imagined that as a portion of the water will be absorbed by the soil, the
                    main drain need not be made so large as the conductor, merely to carry off the
                    water that has been used; but in practice it will be found, that when the water
                    is muddy, but little of it comparatively will enter the ground, because the
                    sediment, acting as an impervious covering, prevents much of the water from
                    descending into the ground. The next process is the forming of the ground
                    intended for a water-meadow into beds or ridges. That portion of the ground
                    which is to be watered by one conductor should be made into beds to suit the
                    circumstances of that conductor; that is, instead of reducing all the beds over
                    the meadow to one common level, they should be formed to suit the different
                    swells in the ground, and should any of these swells be considerable, it will be
                    necessary to give each side of them its respective conductor. The beds should
                    run at or nearly at right angles to the line of the conductor. The breadth of
                    the beds is regulated by the nature of the soil and the supply of water.
                    Tenacious soils and subsoils, and a small supply of water, require as narrow
                    beds as thirty feet. Porous soils and a large supply of water may have beds of
                    forty feet. The length of the beds is regulated by the supply of water and the
                    fall from the conductor to the main drain. If the beds fall only in one
                    direction longitudinally, their crowns should be made in the middle; but should
                    they fall laterally as well as longitudinally, as is usually the case, then the
                    crowns should be made towards the upper sides, more or less according to the
                    lateral slope of the ground. The crowns should rise a foot above the adjoining
                    furrows. The beds thus formed should slope in an inclined plane from the
                    conductor to the main drain, that the water may flow equably over them. The beds
                    are watered by what are called <hi rend="italic">feeders,</hi> that is, by
                    channels gradually tapering to the lower extremities, and cut down their crowns,
                    wherever these are placed. The depth of the feeders depends on their width, and
                    the width on their length. A bed two hundred yards in length requires a feeder
                    of twenty inches in width at its junction with the conductor, and it should
                    taper gradually to the extremity, which should be one foot in width. The taper
                    retards the motion of the water, which constantly decreases by overflow as it
                    proceeds, whilst it continues to fill the feeder to the brim. The stuff which
                    comes out of the feeders should be carefully and evenly laid along the sides of
                    the beds. The water overflowing from the feeders down the sides of the beds is
                    received into small drains formed in the furrows between the beds. These small
                    drains discharge themselves into the main drain, and are in every respect the
                    reverse of the feeders; that is, their tapering extremities lie up the slope,
                    and their wide ends open into the main drain, to accelerate the motion of the
                    departing water. The depth of the small drain at the junction is made about as
                    deep as that of the main drain, and it gradually lessens towards the taper to
                    six inches in tenacious and to less in porous soils. The depth of the feeders is
                    the same in relation to the conductor. The stuff obtained from the small drains
                    is employed to fill up inequalities in the meadow. For the more equal
                    distribution of the water over the surface of the beds from the conductor and
                    feeders, small masses, such as stones, solid portions of earth or turf fastened
                    with pins, are placed in them, in order to retard the momentum which the water
                    may have acquired. These <hi rend="italic">stops,</hi> as they are termed, are
                    generally placed at regular intervals, or rather they should be left where any
                    inequality of the current is observed. Heaps of stones answer very well for
                    stops in the conductor, particularly immediately below the points of junction
                    with the feeders. Solid portions of earth are usually left in the feeders, or
                    tough pieces of turf fastened down with wooden pins; but care must be taken to
                    keep the tops of the pins below the reach of weeds floating on the surface of
                    the water. These stops, however, are nothing but expedients to rectify work
                    imperfectly executed. It must be] obvious that a perfectly-formed water-meadow
                    should re-' quire fcw or no stops. The small or main drains require no stops.
                    The descent of the water in the feeders will no doubt necessarily increase in
                    rapidity, but the inclination of the beds, and the tapering of the feeders,
                    should be so adjusted as to counteract the increasing rapidity. At all events
                    <hi rend="italic">notches</hi> cut into the sides of the feeders to retard the
                    velocity of the water, is much more objectionable than stops, although some
                    writers recommend them; but where they have been observed, the spectator may
                    depend on having seen an imperfect water-meadow. The distribution of the water
                    over the whole-meadow is regulated by the sluice, which should be placed at the
                    origin of every conductor. By means of these sluices any portion of the meadow
                    that is desired can be watered, whilst the rest remains dry; and alternate
                    watering must be adopted when there is a scarcity of water. Each sluice should
                    be placed according to the elevation or depression of the ground which it
                    supplies with water. All the sluices should be substantially built at first with
                    stones and mortar; because a carelessly constructed sluice will permit the
                    leakage of water at all times; and should the water from the leak be permitted
                    to find its way into the meadow, that portion of it will stagnate and produce
                    coarse grasses. In a well formed water-meadow it is as necessary to keep it
                    perfectly dry at one time, as it is to place it under water at another. A small
                    sluice placed in the side of the conductor opposite to the meadow, and at the
                    upper end of it, will serve to drain away the leakage that may haply have
                    escaped from the head sluice. The laying out of the beds, feeders, and small
                    drains, constitutes the nice part of the formation of a water-meadow; it
                    constitutes the test by which the skill of the irrigator is tried; and it is
                    impossible to acquire the skill without practice.</p>
                <p>To obtain a complete water-meadow, the ground should be broken up and remodelled;
                    for it is rare to find a piece of ground naturally possessing the requisite
                    qualifications of a water-meadow. Such a remodelling will no doubt be attended
                    with cost; but it should be considered that the first cost is the least; and
                    remodelling the only way of obtaining the desired object of having a complete
                    water-meadow which will continue for years to give satisfaction. To effect a
                    remodelling when the ground is in stubble, let it be ploughed up, harrowed, and
                    cleaned as in a summer fallow; the levelling-box employed when required, the
                    stuff from the conductors and main drains spread abroad, and the beds ploughed
                    into shape. All these operations, as of the farm, can be performed at little
                    expense, and they <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> form the substantial foundation
                    of the nicer operations of the spade, the barrow, and the level. The meadow
                    should be ready by August for sowing with grass-seeds. The seeds best suited for
                    a water-meadow are perennial rye-grass <hi rend="italic">(Lolium perenne),</hi>
                    sweet-scented vernal grass <hi rend="italic">(Anthoxaηthum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >odoratum),</hi> crested dog’s-tail grass (<hi rend="italic">Cynosuras

                    >(Poa</hi><hi rend="italic">trivialis),</hi> and florin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Agrostis stoloιιiferα).</hi> The florin is the prevailing grass in all good
                    water-meadows, and it makes a most delicious hay. It is best propagated by
                    sowing the stems chopped into pieces like chaff. These grasses do not always
                    produce^ a good crop the first year, but the rye-grass will assist to thicken
                    the crop. Some writers, and particularly Mr Smith in his <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    on Irrigation,</hi> assert that it is of no importance what grasses are sown in
                    water-meadows, as the most congenial kinds will in time spring up and banish all
                    the others; but is it not better to supply the ground at once with the best
                    grasses than wait for the extirpation of the worst? The method now described of
                    forming a water-meadow is attended with one great disadvantage; the soft ground
                    cannot be irrigated for two or three years after it is sown with
                    grass-seeds.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943626?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3626-0448"/>
                <p>This disadvantage can only be avoided where the ground is covered with old turf
                    which will bear to be lifted. On ground in that state a water-meadow may be most
                    perfectly formed. Let the turf be taken off with the spade, and laid carefully
                    aside for relaying. Let the stript ground then be neatly formed with the spade
                    and barrow, into beds varying in breadth and shape, according to the nature of
                    the soil, and the dip of the ground; the feeders from the conductor, and the
                    small drains to the main drain being formed at the same time. Then let the turf
                    be laid down again and beaten firm, when the meadow will be complete at once,
                    and ready for irrigation. This is the most beautiful and most expeditious method
                    of making a complete water-meadow, and should always be adopted where
                    practicable, although it should at first be the most expensive.</p>
                <p>7. The water should be let on, and trial made of the work, whenever it is
                    finished; and the motion of the water regulated by the introduction of a stop in
                    the conductors and feeders, where a change in the motion of the current is
                    observed, beginning at the upper end of the meadow. Should the work be finished
                    as directed by August, a good crop of hay may be reaped in the succeeding
                    summer. There are few pieces of land where the natural descent of the ground
                    will not admit of the water being collected a second time, and applied to the
                    irrigation of a second and lower meadow. In such a case the main drain of the
                    watered-meadow may form the conductor of the one to be watered, or a new
                    conductor may be formed by a prolongation of the main drain; but either
                    expedient is only advisable where water is scarce. Where it is plentiful, it is
                    better to supply the second meadow directly from the river, or by a continuation
                    of the first main-conductor. In some instances it may be necessary to carry a
                    conductor over a hollow piece of ground along an aqueduct made for the purpose,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">carry, bridge.</hi> Such an aqueduct may be made
                    either of wood, cast-iron, or stone and mortar.</p>
                <p>As a real example of a water-meadow, such as has been described, will illustrate
                    the several particulars specified more accurately than any imaginative case,
                    fig. 1 is a design of one belonging to Mr Loch of Rachan in Peeblesshire, and
                    executed in 1823 by Mr George Stephens, drainer and irrigator, Edinburgh. The
                    design is taken from Mr</p>
                <p>Stephens’ <hi rend="italic">Practical Irrigator and Drainer,</hi> 1834 (p. 10), a
                    work of great practical utility. The meadow, as may be seen, in fig. 1, lies on
                    both sides of the river Biggar, and contains eight acres, partly of clay, but
                    mostly of gravel, and both resting on a gravelly subsoil. The river supplies the
                    meadow amply with water. The expense of straightening the river, building the
                    dam and sluices, and forming embankments against inundations in every flood, was
                    L. 9 per acre. The work was executed late in spring 1823, and in 1825, four
                    hundred stones of hay per acre were cropped, worth sixpence per stone, or L. 10
                    per acre, and L. 1 per acre for the aftermath, from land that was not worth L. 2
                    per acre before being irrigated. The references to the cut are these: <hi

                <p><hi> II</hi>. CATCH-WORK IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>This kind of irrigation is only applied to sloping banks, and should never be
                    practised where the bed-work system can be introduced, although many are
                    tempted, by the ease and economy of its construction, to prefer it. It is quite
                    different in its construction from the bed-w’ork. Were the feeders placed up and
                    down the slope at right angles to the conductor, as in the case of bed-work
                    irrigation, the water would acquire such a momentum in its descent, as to cut
                    the ground into ruts. No number of stops could prevent this mischief. In order
                    to prevent it, the feeders are cut across the face of the slope in parallel rows
                    below each other. The water overflowing from the upper feeder is caught by the
                    one below it, and so on in succession, till at last it finds its way into a main
                    drain or the river. Main drains are less useful in this kind of irrigation than
                    in the bed-work, as there are no small drains necessary to open into them, the
                    tapering ends of the feeders discharging the water equally over the margin into
                    the river. But it is obvious, that were the feeders on the lower level to
                    receive their whole supply of water from those above them, the sediment in the
                    water would be chiefly deposited by the upper feeders. It is therefore requisite
                    to give a direct communication from the conductor to each feeder. To effect
                    this, the direction of the feeders is made at an acute angle with the conductor,
                    and their dis ∙ tance from each other is regulated by the fall of the ground,
                    and the nature of the subsoil. WTιere the subsoil is porous, and the fall of the
                    ground one foot in twenty or thirty, the distance between the feeders may be
                    made from twenty to thirty yards; but where the declivity is less, and the
                    subsoil tenacious, the distance should never exceed ten yards. Stops should be
                    placed in the conductor immediately be low the points of junction with the
                    feeders; and in the feeders at regular distances, or rather where the current
                    appears to accelerate its motion.</p>
                <p>The expense of forming a catch-work meadow may vary from L. 3 to L∙ 5 per acre.
                    The comparative cheapness of this kind of irrigation, induces many to adopt it
                    in situations which ought to be occupied with bed-work irrigation.</p>
                <p>The following design of a catch-work meadow, is taken from Mr Stephens’ work
                    above referred to. The meadow was formed by him in 1823, on the estate of
                    Closebum, in Dumfries-shire, belonging to Mr Stuart Mentcith. The references to
                    the cut are these: <hi rend="italic">a a a,</hi> fig. 2, is the river; <hi
                    rend="italic">bb b</hi> are conductors; <hi rend="italic">cec</hi> feeders; <hi
                    rend="italic">ddd</hi> main drains, and the river also acts as a main drain; <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> is a lake; <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the dam across the
                    river; <hi rend="italic">g g</hi> are sluices in the conductors; .... stops in
                    the conductors and feeders.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943639?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3639-0449"/>
                <p>It may frequently happen that the bed-work and catchwork systems may be
                    beneficially united at the same fall of water. The conductor may be led along
                    the higher ground, and give rise to a system of catch-work irrigation on the
                    sloping ground, and terminate in the bed-work on the more level portion below.
                    Such a compound structure may save much expense in levelling, and will make the
                    most of the water. Instances of this compound-work may be seen at Whitehaugh in
                    Peeblesshire, belonging to Sir John Hay, Bart., and at the Townfoot Meadow of
                    Dolphinton in Lanarkshire, belonging to Mr Richard Mackenzie, writer to the
                    Signet, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>MANAGEMENT OF WATER-MEADOWS.</p>
                <p>The formation is not the only difficulty attending watermeadows; their good
                    management is a nice business, and essential to the deriving of benefit from
                    them. It must be confessed that much ignorance and negligence prevail in their
                    management; and when the risk is considered of losing the whole of the fine
                    herbage, and getting coarse in its stead, by bad mangement, a skilful irrigator
                    is a character who ought to be highly appreciated. The particulars which require
                    constant attention are, the state of the water in the river, whether there is
                    sufficient to water the whole, or only a part of the meadow; the regulating of
                    the sluices, so as not to permit more nor less water than the part of the meadow
                    intended to be watered requires; the length of time the water should be allowed
                    to remain on the meadow at different periods of the season; the proper time at
                    wdιich hay harvest and pasturage should commence and terminate; the state and
                    nature of the soil to be irrigated,-whether porous or impervious; and the
                    removal of all minute obstructions to the perfect irrigation of the meadow.</p>
                <p>Every size of river is not equally suitable for irrigation. A large flowing
                    stream, supplying sufficient water at all times, affords facilities for
                    irrigating a part or the whole of a meadow, much better than a brook which
                    swells and falls with every shower of rain. At the same time whatever may be the
                    command of water, it is an error to attempt to irrigate too large a surface at
                    one time. The attempt to force a larger quantity of water than the feeders and
                    drains can easily convey, will end in deluging one part, whilst another will be
                    stinted; and where there is inequality of irrigation, there will be inequality
                    in the quantity and quality of the grass. Where there is an ample supply of
                    water, therefore, no more ground should be irrigated at one time than can be
                    covered equally to the requisite depth by the natural force of the water. Where
                    the supply is short of this, which is more frequently the case, the water
                    should, only have as much ground allotted to it as it can effectually irrigate.
                    The intervals between the irrigations will be greater when the supply of water
                    is scanty than when plentiful; but notwithstanding this, the effects produced on
                    the meadow in both cases may be nearly equal, according as the weather is
                    favourable or otherwise. The adjustment of the water by the sluices is a
                    delicate operation under every circumstance, but particularly so when there is
                    at times a deficiency of water. The falling or rising of the water in the river
                    requires particular attention, and the changing of the water from one part of
                    the meadow to another, or even from one bed to another, according to its
                    abundance or deficiency, particular dexterity. Attention to the sluices for a
                    short time every day, will obviate many risks of bad management. A great error
                    may be committed by permitting the water to remain too long on the ground at a
                    time. Unless the ground gets the air and becomes dry at stated periods, the
                    finer grasses will be destroyed, and those of coarse quality will spring up. The
                    watering may be con ∙ tinued for as long as fifteen days in the beginning of the
                    irrigating season in November, but the time should be gradually lessened till
                    March or April, when it should cease altogether. Between the intervals of
                    watering, the land should be laid completely dry. Precautions are particularly
                    necessary in letting the water off and on in frosty weather, frost taking quick
                    hold of wet grass land, and throwing the plants out by the roots. The water
                    should be let off on the morning of a dry day, and the land thus becoming dry in
                    the course of the day, the frost will not injure the grass at night. Or, what is
                    a still safer method, the water should be taken off in the morning and put on
                    again at night, but few persons will take the trouble of attending so minutely
                    to irrigation. In spring the new grown tender grass will be easily destroyed by
                    frost, if the utmost attention be not paid to the state of the ground, either by
                    protecting it with water, which is the surest protection it can receive, or
                    making the ground thoroughly dry in dry weather, for dry cold never injures even
                    young grass. There is another error which should be guarded against: when water
                    remains too long on the ground in the spring, it generates a white scum, of the
                    consistence of melted glue, which, when left on the grass, inevitably destroys
                    it. Instances may be observed of water being permitted to remain on meadows from
                    the autumn till eight or ten days before the cutting of hay. The consequences
                    are, that the hay is of the coarsest quality, and the early bite for sheep
                    entirely lost. It seems to be a judicious recommendation to depasture the early
                    grass on water-meadows with ewes and lambs in March and April, and to eat it
                    barely down before May with a heavy stock. After that the grass is allowed to
                    stand for hay; but some recommend that it should be irrigated for a week, or a
                    few days, to clean the pasture; whilst others think the irrigation unnecessary,
                    and even dangerous, where sheep are kept, by tainting them with rot on the
                    aftermath. There is no doubt that grass after being irrigated in summer, wall
                    affect sheep with rot; but whether that which has been irrigated in May, before
                    the hay has been cut down, will so affect them on the aftermath, is not so
                    decidedly known. At all events it is well known that the purest water allowed to
                    irrigate land too long at any time, but particularly in spring or summer,
                    deposites a substance which cannot be called a sediment, nor, judging by the
                    eye, can it even be called an impurity. It is a very fine transparent colouring
                    on the grass, nearly resembling the fine cobwebs which float through the air in
                    a beautiful day in autumn. From its bad effects on sheep it was observed by our
                    forefathers, and known to them by the name of <hi rend="italic">lace.</hi> It
                    may occasionally be observed on the sides of mountains near wells, having a
                    sparkling appearance. This <hi rend="italic">lace</hi> is a rapid promoter of
                    rot in sheep.</p>
                <p>When it is determined to irrigate, the drains and feeders should be previously
                    inspected, all obstructions removed, and dilapidations amended. Whatever
                    difference of opinion may exist on irrigating at this particular period of the
                    season, all irrigators are agreed that early irrigation in autumn produces
                    greater effects than late, and that water <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943652?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3652-0450"/> should be used
                    largely during the winter, and scantily during the spring. It is possible that
                    the benefits derived from early irrigation, especially after rains, may arise
                    from the good effects of manure of various kinds, accumulated on the land during
                    summer, being washed down by the rains, and mixed with the irrigating water; and
                    it is certain that abundant irrigation in winter protects the grass from cold,
                    as the temperature of grass under water in winter is seldom under 40°
                    Fahrenheit. The signs of early and luxuriant vegetation observable on
                    water-meadows in spring, when the rest of the ground may be covered with snow,
                    evince the protective power of water. After the hay is carried off, the water is
                    sometimes let on, to promote the growth of the aftermath, which it will no doubt
                    do; but the rank grass encouraged by this summer irrigation will undoubtedly rot
                    sheep. Where sheep are kept, and intended to depasture meadows, there should be
                    no irrigation in summer. Cattle are not affected as sheep.</p>
                <p>Should the irrigation be postponed till the autumn, in the beginning of October,
                    the first duty of the irrigator is to see that all the feeders and drains are
                    cleared of every obstruction, occasioned by the treading of sheep or cattle. The
                    sluice is then drawn up, and if the water be abundant, the conductor and feeders
                    will he filled with water in about half-an-hour. The motion of the water should
                    first be adjusted in all the conductors; then in the feeders nearest the upper
                    part of the meadow, and then in the lower ones in succession. The sluices
                    regulate the water in the conductors, and the position of the stops regulates
                    the water in the feeders. The stops should be so placed, as to cause the water
                    to overflow the sides of the feeders, by making the openings at the sides of the
                    stops wider or narrower. This first general inundation will shew any
                    irregularities on the surface of the meadow; and that some irregularities will
                    exist in the best-constructed water-meadows, it is not in the power of art to
                    prevent. The earth in the filled-up hollows will subside, whilst the hard
                    portions of ground which have been reduced will maintain their new shape. The
                    irregularities should now be marked and rectified in the ensuing summer. At
                    least three such adjustments of the water are necessary, before an irri gator
                    should be satisfied that the meadow is properly irrigated with the requisite
                    depth of one inch of water. This quantity of water should be continued over the
                    meadow during October, November, December, and January, from fifteen to twenty
                    days in succession, according as the weather is fresh or frosty, wet or dry.
                    Between every such interval, the meadow should be laid thoroughly dry for five
                    or six days, to give the grass air; and should the weather threaten a lengthened
                    period of hard frost, the watering should be entirely discontinued for the time;
                    for in thawing, the sheet of ice which covers the surface of the meadow will
                    draw every plant of grass out by the roots, and make the soil like a mass of
                    fermented dough. During the period of irrigation, the meadows should be
                    regularly visited and inspected once in every three or four days, to correct any
                    deviation from regular watering, such as may arise from collections of weeds,
                    petty depredations of men and beasts, sticks, stones, or leaves, that may have
                    fallen in and been detained in the conductors and feeders.</p>
                <p>In February, great attention is required from the irrigator, as the grass will
                    now begin to vegetate. The periods of watering must be shortened, and those of
                    drying must be proportionally lengthened. White scum, frost, and such like
                    evils, should be carefully avoided, as the tender grass will sensibly feel their
                    injurious effects.</p>
                <p>In March, the same precautions are requisite; but in the south of England, where
                    grass is sufficiently abundant for. stock in this month, the irrigation should
                    be dispensed with. In Scotland, irrigation may be continued all April, but with
                    such caution, that the water should be allowed to run only five or six days at a
                    time, and gradually lessened towards the end of the month; and in the beginning
                    of May dispensed with altogether, and the meadow laid thoroughly dry for the
                    summer. It should be borne in mind, that this is the most trying season for
                    young grasses in Scotland; and also, that if watering is continued after this
                    month, the. blades of grass will be covered with a gritty sediment, which not
                    only injures the quality of the hay, but renders the mowing of it a difficult
                    process.</p>
                <p>The annual expense of keeping a water-meadow in repair may be about five or six
                    shillings an acre. The greatest expense in keeping a meadow will be incurred in
                    the second year, on account of the sinkings of those places which had been made
                    up with loose earth having to be brought up to the common inclination.</p>
                <p><hi> III</hi>. SUBTERRANEOUS IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>This species of irrigation is so named, because the supply of water is derived
                    from under the surface of the ground to the upper soil. It is only applicable to
                    perfectly level ground, so raised above the supplying river, as to admit of a
                    complete drainage of the field to be irrigated. This system of irrigation
                    consists, in the first place, of ditches being formed around all the sides of
                    the field. These act the part of conductors when the field is to be flooded, and
                    of main drains when it is to be laid dry. The water flows from the ditches as
                    conductors into built drains or conduits, formed at rightangles to them, in
                    parallel lines through the fields, and it rises upwards in them as high as the
                    surface of the ground, and again subsides through the soil and the conduits into
                    the ditches as main drains, and thence into the river. Sluices are requisite to
                    convey the water from the river into the ditches. This submersion, as it may be
                    called, rather than overflow, of the ground in water, must be conducted with
                    great care, and the water let on very calmly; for were the water let on or taken
                    off with a forcible current, the finer particles of the soil would be detached,
                    and carried off into the river. Indeed, however carefully the operation may be
                    conducted, the only advantage derived from this species of irrigation is the
                    moistening of dry ground in dry weather, which would otherwise be parched up;
                    and in this respect the operation is best conducted in summer, and is as
                    applicable to arable as to pasture land. It can therefore be of no importance to
                    subterraneous irrigation, whether the water be clear or turbid, since all the
                    sediment must be seethed through the soil, before it can possibly reach the
                    surface of the ground.</p>
                <p><hi> IV</hi>. WARPING.</p>
                <p>Warping is the overflowing of level ground with salt water within tide mark. Of
                    course, it can only be practised near the'-sea, and most frequently it is
                    attempted within the estuaries of large rivers, which have flowed through
                    alluvial cultivated countries. Its immediate effect, which is highly beneficial,
                    is the deposition of silt from the tide. To insure this deposition, it is
                    necessary to surround the field to be warped with a strong embankment, in order
                    to retain the water as the tide recedes. The water is admitted by valved
                    sluices, which open as the tide flows into the field, and shut by the pressure
                    of the confined water when the tide recedes. These sluices are placed on as low
                    a level as possible, to permit the most turbid water at the bottom of the tide
                    to pass through a channel in the basé of the embankment. The silt deposited
                    after warping is exceedingly rich, and capable of carrying any species of crop.
                    It may be admitted in so small a quantity as only to act as a manure to arable
                    soil, or in such a large quantity as to form a new <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943665?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3665-0451"/> soil. This
                    latter acquisition is the principal object of warping, and it excites
                    astonishment to witness how soon a new soil may be formed. From June to
                    September, a soil of three feet in depth may be formed under favourable
                    circumstances. These circumstances are summer, and the very driest season and
                    longest drought. In winter and in floods warping ceases to be beneficial. In
                    ordinary circumstances, a soil from six to sixteen inches in depth may be
                    obtained, and inequalities of three feet filled up. But every tide generally
                    leaves only one-eighth of an inch of silt, and the field which has only one
                    sluice can only be warped every other tide. The silt, as deposited in each tide,
                    does not mix into a uniform mass, but remains in distinct layers. The water
                    should be made to run completely off, and the ditches should become dry, before
                    the influx of the next tide, otherwise the silt will not incrust, and the tide
                    not have the same effect. Warp soil is of surpassing fertility. The expense of
                    forming canals, embankments, and sluices for warping land, is, on an average,
                    about L. 10 an acre. A sluice of six feet in height, and eight feet wide, will
                    warp from sixty to eighty acres, according to the distance of the field from the
                    river. The embankments may be from three to seven feet in height, as the field
                    may stand in regard to the level of the highest tides.</p>
                <p>V. FLOODING.</p>
                <p>Flooding land on the margins of lakes may be considered as a species of
                    irrigation or warping. A successful attempt of this kind may be seen on the
                    margin of Loch Ken, in Kirkcudbright, where 240 acres can be flooded at
                    pleasure, when the water of the lake is in a favourable state.</p>
                <p>In Great Britain, irrigation is practised to the greatest extent in
                    Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Drumfriesshire, and partially in some other
                    counties. In England it has long been successfully practised. Into Scotland it
                    is comparatively of recent introduction. The estates of the Duke of Buccleuch on
                    the Esk, Ewes, Yarrow, and Ettrick rivers, first enjoyed the benefits of
                    irrigation to any extent in Scotland; but it is painful to observe that those
                    water-meadows have fallen into decay from inattention. The land is now in a
                    worse condition than if it had never been irrigated, because the very means
                    which were used to direct the water to the land for beneficial irrigation, now
                    form receptacles in which surface-water stagnates. Many of these meadows have
                    since been broken up for corn culture, the high price of corn during the war
                    having tempted their destruction. Now that live-stock remunerates the farmer
                    better than corn, the rash step of destroying them has no doubt been by this
                    time sincerely repented of. The water-meadows belonging to Mr Menteith of
                    Closeburn, in Dumfriesshire, were formed about the same time, but having, since
                    their formation, been carefully attended to, they continue to yield
                    abundantly.</p>
                <p>Warping is only practised in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, in the estuary of the
                    Humber, in the rivers Trent, Ouse, and Dun, which flow into it. The silt is an
                    extraordinary substance. It seems to be doubted whence it comes. The Humber is
                    clear at its mouth, and none of the rivers which flow into it bring the silt
                    down in the floods. On the contrary, the floods invariably injure its quality,
                    which is in the highest perfection in the driest summers. Apparently it is a
                    mixture of sand and clay, for it cakes on drying, and will cleanse cloth of
                    grease like fuller’s earth; and its arenaceous property is quite obvious; but
                    its analysis by a chemist many years ago afforded no clay, the principal
                    ingredients being a fine sand, a considerable portion of lime, some mica, and a
                    minute portion of saline matter. It would be desirable to have a correct
                    analysis, by some eminent chemist of the present day, of this remarkable
                    substance.</p>
                <p>Subterraneous irrigation is chiefly practised in drained morasses, which are apt
                    to become too dry in summer, by closing up the mouths of the main drains, and
                    causing the water in them to stand back in all the drains till it rises up to
                    the soil. It was recommended by the late celebrated engineer Mr Rennie, to be
                    practised on some extensive fens which he had drained in Lincolnshire, near
                    Boston. To irrigate effectually in this manner, it is necessary to build the
                    mouths of the main drains with strong masonry, and erect sluices for the
                    retention of the water in the drains. This species of irrigation may also be
                    attempted on any flat piece of ground resting on a gravelly bottom, by means of
                    ditches which surround it, and which can command water from a lake or river.
                    Turnips or potatoes, or any kind of crop, whether drilled or not, might be
                    beneficially watered in this manner in a dry summer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">advantages of water-meadows and warping.</hi></p>
                <p>The advantages derived from water-meadows and warping, as stated by authors who
                    have written on those subjects, almost exceed credibility. One author of some
                    standing says :—“Having heard that the proprietor of an old floated meadow at
                    South Cerney (in Gloucestershire), had dispersed of the produce of it, in the

                    account of the product, and I received the folowing statement—In order to make

                    see the advantages of this art in a still stronger light, when he is told that
                    this meadow, which is now in the occupation of a miller, was a few years ago in
                    the hands of a farmer, who, being at variance with the miller, was entirely
                    deprived of the use of the water for a whole winter, which, unfortunately, was
                    succeeded by a very dry spring and summer; of course the spring feed was lost;
                    and the whole hay crop of eight acres was only three tons.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>These two cases may suffice as examples of successful irrigation in England. The
                    following cases occur in Scotland, a country, from its irregularity of surface,
                    not naturally suited to that species of improvement. Nevertheless, in all the
                    pastoral districts, both in the north and south, an abundance of early food in
                    spring for ewes and lambs might be obtained, by judicious irrigation, in every
                    valley which contains a river. In mountainous districts, the rivers may not
                    supply the richest quality of water for irrigation, but there the soil on the
                    margins of rivers being generally of friable loam, would be peculiarly benefited
                    by irrigation. Such land is invariably sound for sheep when drained; and if made
                    dry, and then irrigated, it would, early in spring, and indeed throughout the
                    summer, afford the finest quality of the richest herbage. Water-meadows in such
                    situations could be inclosed by themselves, and they could supply hay, if
                    required, for the sheep-stock in winter, or be pastured at pleasure by any kind
                    of stock during the summer.</p>
                <p>To begin with an instance of simple irrigation in a pastoral district. “Fallaw
                    Meadow, on a large sheep-farm belonging to Sir George Montgomery, Bart, of
                    Macbiehill, in Peeblesshire, containing fifteen acres, was inclosed from
                    moorland in 1816; and by collecting'the water from the surrounding sheep-drains,
                    five acres are partially irrigated, and the remaining ten are top-dressed with
                    the manure made from part of the produce which is consumed in winter by the
                    sheep of the farm, in a wooden shed near the meadow. By this simple method of
                    improvement, fifteen acres of common sheep-pasture land give the proprietor from
                    three thousand five hundred to four thousand stones of hay per annum, averaging
                    sixpence per stone. What an immense advantage to a sheep-farm! By this simple
                    process of inclosing, and cutting a few small feeders and drains, the owner is
                    enabled to provide food for his flock, when his less fortunate neighbours’ sheep
                    must either starve or be supplied from the farm-yard; but I am afraid there are
                    very few sheep-farmers who are so fortunate as to have any hay beyond what is
                    requisite for stock at home. Sir George fed the same number of sheep on the farm
                    as he did before the meadow was taken off and inclosed; and I am fully persuaded
                    that the same improvement might be made on almost every sheep-farm in Tweeddale,
                    for in almost all of them, there are situations where fourteen or fifteen acres
                    might be inclosed and partially irrigated, as in every pastoral district there
                    are numerous rills which might be easily collected and used to the greatest
                    advantage, at a very trifling expense; so that, instead of being obliged, in
                    snow-storms, to send fifty thousand sheep to a milder climate in the southern
                    parts of Dumfriesshire (where owners are obliged to be at the mercy of their
                    southern neighbours, not to mention the very serious injury the flocks receive
                    by long and fatiguing journeys), by adopting the above system of improvement a
                    considerable part of the losses generally sustained every year would be
                    prevented.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stephens’

                <p>Here is an instance of the conversion of peat-bog of little value into a
                    water-meadow of great value. “Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, Bart, of Castle
                    Craig, commenced, in the year 1817, by forming five acres with the plough and
                    spade into regular bed-work. The land, in its natural state, was a complete bog,
                    valued at eight shillings of yearly rent per acre. The formation was difficult,
                    on account of the great number of deep peat-holes which were obliged to be
                    filled up, to bring the surface to a proper level. The expense of levelling and
                    forming the beds was L. 6 per acre, the crop of hay was 466 stones of 22 lb. per
                    stone per acre, valued at fivepence per stone, and the after-grass at 18s. per
                    acre, making L. 10: 12: 2 per acre of gross produce.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>But the greatest promoter of irrigation in Scotland is Mr Stuart Menteith of
                    Closeburn, in Dumfriesshire. His water-meadows comprehend both mossy and good
                    soil. They extend to about two hundred acres, and are connected with reservoirs
                    for containing water which can flood two hundred acres more. In his estate in
                    Ayrshire, on the river Nith, Mr Menteith intends to form two hundred acres more
                    of water-meadows. As a proof of the possibility of improving good land by
                    irrigation, the catch-work meadow, represented by fig. 2, containing twenty-five
                    acres, is a remarkable and satisfactory instance of Mr Menteith’s operations.
                    “The land of this meadow, before being watered, was worth L 3, 10s. per acre,
                    the expense of levelling and formation L.5 per acre. The produce of 1824 was as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>200 ewes and lambs for seven weeks, at 5d. each per week, ...... L.29 3 4 300
                    stones of hay per acre, at 8d. per stone, 250 0 0 Aftermath, at 20s. per acre, .

                <p>L.304 3 4</p>
                <p>Being L.12: 3: 4 per acre. The quality of the hay was equal to that of any
                    clover-hay in the kingdom.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Another instance only, among many which exist in Scotland, shall be given of the
                    advantages derived from common irrigation, and that is, of the bed-work
                    water-meadow belonging to Mr Loch of Rachan, in Peeblesshire, and forming the
                    subject of the first figure illustrating this paper. “It was formed late in the
                    spring of 1823; the crop of hay in 1825 was judged by the neighbours to be
                    upwards of 400 stones per acre, worth sixpence per stone, and the aftermath at
                    L.l per acre, making the gross produce worth L.ll per acre, instead of L.2, at
                    which the land was valued before being irrigated.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>But this enumeration of the several cases of successful irrigation would be
                    incomplete, were the water-meadows in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh omitted to
                    be particularized. The city of Edinburgh stands on an eminence, which commands
                    the cultivated country around it. Commanding as the situation is, water from the
                    Crawley Spring, in the Pentland Hills, situate at seven miles distance, flows to
                    the top of every house in the city., A ready means is thus provided of washing
                    away all the filth of the houses and streets, which is conveyed in large sewers
                    to the lower end of the town, where their contents arc made to irrigate many
                    acres of naturally rich and also of poor soil. Probably upwards of 200 acres are
                    thus irrigated for the production of grass for the cowfeeders who supply milk to
                    the inhabitants. The rent for which these meadows are let in small portions to
                    cowfeeders varies on an average from L.20 to L.30 per acre. Some of the richest
                    meadows were let in 1835 at L.38 per acre; and in that season of scarce forage,
                    1826, L.57 an acre were obtained for the same meadows. The largest proprietor of
                    these meadows is Mr Miller of Craigintinny, who possesses about one hundred and
                    thirty acres; part of them, comprising land <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943691?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3691-0453"/> now of the
                    richest quality, having been thus watered for nearly a century, and part of them
                    of the poorest sandy soil. The waste land called the Figget Whins, containing
                    thirty acres, and ten acres of poor sandy soil adjoining them, were formed into
                    water-meadows in 1821, at an expense of L.1000. The pasture of the Figget Whins
                    used to be let for L.40 a-year, and that of the ten acres at L.60. Now the same
                    ground, as meadows, lets for L.15 or L.20 an acre a-year, and will probably let
                    for more as the land becomes more and more enriched. It is stated by Mr
                    Stephens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stephens’ <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Irrigator,</hi> p. 77∙</p></note> that one hundred and
                    ten acres of Mr Miller’s meadows, in 1827, yielded a clear profit of L.2300. The
                    repair of these meadows costs from tĉm to fifteen shillings per acre, which is
                    comparatively a large sum for repairs, but then they are not only watered during
                    the winter, but for two or three days between the intervals of cutting the grass
                    during the summer. The grass is cut from April to November, every three, four,
                    or five weeks, according to the richness of the vegetation. It is exceedingly
                    tender and succulent, and suitable to the production of a large quantity of
                    milk; and were it not frequently cut, it would lie down, and soon rot at the
                    roots.</p>
                <p>After these striking instances of the advantages which are derivable from
                    irrigation in a pecuniary point of view, by largely increasing the rent of land,
                    must be mentioned the advantages which are derived from a large increase in the
                    produce of the soil. The early grass in March, which could only be fostered by
                    irrigation, is of the most essential use to ewes and lambs, and it offers an
                    excellent substitute for the artificial grasses, which are usually obliged to be
                    heavily stocked in early spring, when they are unable to bear it; and in truly
                    pastoral districts, where artificial grasses are cultivated to a limited extent,
                    and where old grass is generally long in springing, the breeding stock of sheep
                    is apt to suffer in spring; but an irrigated meadow would not only supply early
                    and abundant food, but it would enable the store-masters to raise an early crop
                    of lambs. The large crop of fine hay which is subsequently cut from
                    water-meadows after the pasturage of the early grass, also insures the safety of
                    the flock, and the growing condition of the herd, in the severest winter;
                    -whilst it at the same time supplies the manure which fertilizes, to an
                    increasing extent, tne land kept under arable culture. Whether, therefore, in
                    pastoral districts, or in the neighbourhood of large towns, or wherever an
                    abundant supply of river water through an alluvial cultivated country can be
                    obtained, irrigation will certainly repay, in a short time, all the expense and
                    trouble which are necessary for its preparation.</p>
                <p>The advantages of warping are thus described, in a particular instance, by Arthur
                    Young:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Farmer's Calendar,</hi> p. 387∙</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> 2 ti</hi> Mr
                    Webster, Bank-side, has made so great an improvement by warping, that it merits
                    particular attention. His farm of 212 acres is all warped, and to show the
                    immense importance of the improvement, it would be necessary only to mention
                    that he gave L.ll an acre for the land, and would not now (1805) take L.70 an
                    acre; but he thinks it worth L.80, and some even L.100; not that it would sell
                    so high at present; yet his whole expenses of sluices, cuts, banks, &amp;c. did
                    not exceed L.2500, or L.12 an acre. Take it at L.12, and add L.11, the purchase
                    money, together L.23 an acre; if he can sell it at L.70, it is L.47 per acre
                    profit. This is prodigious, and sufficient to prove that warping exceeds all
                    other improvements. He began only four years ago. He has warped to various
                    depths eighteen inches, two feet, two and a half feet, &amp;c. He has some, that
                    before warping was moorland, worth only one shilling and sixpence per acre, now
                    as good as the best. Some of it would let at L.5 for flax or potatoes, and the
                    whole at fifty shillings. He has twenty acres that he warped three feet deep
                    between the beginning of J une and the cnd of September, and eighteen acres,
                    part of which is three feet and a half decp. He has applied it on stubbles by
                    way of manuring, for it should be noted, as a vast advantage in this species of
                    improvement, that it is renewable at any time; were it possible to wear out by
                    cropping or ill management, a few tides will at any time restore it. As to the
                    crops he has had, they have been very great indeed; of potatoes from 80 to 130
                    tubs of 36 gallons, selling, the round sorts, at three shillings to three
                    shillings and sixpence a tub, and kidneys at five to eight shillings. Twenty
                    acres warped in 1794, could not be ploughed for oats in 1795, he therefore sowed
                    the oats on the fresh warp, and scuffled in the seed by men drawing a scuffler,
                    eight to draw and one to hold; the whole crop was very great, but on three acres
                    of it, measured separately, they amounted to fourteen quarters one sack per
                    acre. I little thought of finding exactly the husbandry of the Nile in England.
                    I had before heard of clover-seed being sown in this manner on fresh warp, and
                    succeeding greatly. He warped twelve acres of wheat stubble, and sowed oats in
                    April, which produced twelve quarters an acre. Then wheat thirty-six bushels an
                    acre. His wheat is never less than thirty. Six acres of beans produced thirty
                    loads per acre, or ninety bushels; one acre, measured to decide a wager, yielded
                    ninety-nine bushels; has had 144 pods from one bean on four stalks; and
                    Tartarian oats seven fect high. One piece warped in 1793, produced oats in 1794,
                    six quarters an acre; white clover and hay-seeds were sown with them, mown twice
                    the first year; the first cutting yielded three tons of hay an acre; the second
                    one ton, and afterwards an immense eddish. Flax forty to fifty stones per acre.
                    Warping, it seems, brings weeds never before seen, particularly mustard, and
                    cresses, wild celery, with plenty of docks and thistles.”</p>
                <p>It is seen, from this statement of Mr Young, that the advantages of warping are
                    very great; and surely so important an improvement ought not to be neglected
                    when it can be put into practice. It is much superior in its effects to
                    irrigation with common water, the mud creating a new soil, and not merely
                    amending an old one. What the land intended to be warped may be, is not of the
                    smallest consequence; a bog, clay, sand, peat, is all one, as the warp raises a
                    soil in one summer of six to eighteen inches thick, and fills up every
                    inequality.</p>
                <p>Warped land at first being raw and cold, requires particular treatment. Corn is
                    not the best crop after warping. Oats, it has been seen, may succeed, barley is
                    never attempted, and wheat is not advisable, but sown grass-seeds thrive most
                    luxuriantly. It is good husbandry, therefore, to sow warp with grass-seeds, and
                    let them remain for at least two years; after them wheat will succeed, then
                    beans, and then wheat again, but never barley on any consideration. All the
                    green crops succeed well. In some instances, warp may contain as much salt as to
                    hurt vegetation, in which case an exposure to the air in summer is necessary to
                    neutralize its pernicious action on vegetation.</p>
                <p>The quality of the water is an important element in the process of irrigation. It
                    has been alleged that whether water is clear or turbid, irrigation is of service
                    to grass land. There is much truth in this allegation; but it does not declare
                    the whole truth. No doubt moisture alone is of great service to the vegetation
                    of grass on sandy soils in a dry season; but a deposition of mud along with the
                    moisture would surely not benefit the grass the less, nor would it injure the
                    bare soil.</p>
                <p>The waters of the Nile and Ganges would alone promote vegetation on their banks,
                    the soils of which seldom experience<pb break="no"

                    sustenance of rain; but the inundations of those mighty rivers would not be
                    hailed with ecstasy and gratitude on the return of every season, were their
                    waters devoid of the fertilizing mud with which they are largely impregnated.
                    Major Rennell states that the Ganges contains a two-hundredth part of its volume
                    of mud, and that it thus carries 2,509,056,000 cubic feet of it per hour. In
                    like manner, the Nile contains a hundred and twentieth part of its bulk in mud,
                    or 14,784,000 cubic feet of it per hour. It is impossible but that the water of
                    all rivers contains at all times, even when purest, some sediment; but it is
                    obvious that those rivers which flow through cultivated countries must contain
                    at all times the greatest quantity of sediment. In this way the rivers of plains
                    must contain more mud than the rivers of mountains; and hence irrigation
                    exhibits the most favourable results in the plains. But were no other proof of
                    the superiority of turbid over clear water for irrigation to be found, the
                    luxuriant produce of the water-meadows in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, which
                    are watered from the common sewers of that city, would <hi rend="subscript">

                    holes are dug in the ground, for the purpose of catching the grosser materials
                    with which it is charged, before it is used for irrigation.</p>
                <p>VI. HISTORY OF IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>Irrigation is at least coeval in antiquity with embanking and draining. It is
                    probably of greater antiquity. Nature had, no doubt, first taught man the art of
                    irrigation by the inundations of rivers; but nature could teach neither
                    embanking nor draining. Egypt was the field which was first artificially
                    irrigated. There the fertilizing effects of the water of the Nile, after its
                    overflow, could not fail to attract the attention of its inhabitants, and teach
                    a simple lesson to the Egyptians, who had only to imitate nature, to secure the
                    fertility of the soil lying beyond the reach of the inundations of the Nile. The
                    remains of canals as capacious as the beds of rivers, which are still to be seen
                    in that sand-desolated country, evince the gigantic efforts which had at one
                    time been made by its inhabitants to irrigate that portion of their country upon
                    which a drop of rain never falls to refresh its languishing vegetation. These
                    canals tràverse the whole country, and are so directed as probably to have been
                    made to receive the water of the Nile, and conduct it to every part, to the top
                    of the rising grounds as well as to the bottom of the hollows; the inequalities
                    of hill and dale not being great in Egypt. The large lakes of Moeris, Behire,
                    and Mareotis, all probably artificial excavations, had perhaps once formed
                    extensive reservoirs to supply the canals, after the Nile had retired within its
                    own banks. At what time all these mighty contrivances were begun, history is as
                    silent as on the origin of the pyramids. It is, however, related that Sesostris
                    greatly increased the number of the canals, which must have been at a period of
                    great antiquity, for he reigned about the sixteenth century before the Christian
                    era. Greater efforts to promote irrigation were more urgent in Egypt than in
                    most other countries; for no rain fell in that country to cherish vegetation;
                    and rice forming the chief food of its inhabitants, it could not be raised
                    without a great supply of water.</p>
                <p>It is therefore highly probable that the remains of great canals and lakes are
                    indicative of the majestic scale with which the Egyptians had prosecuted the art
                    of irrigation. It is, however, prudent to speak with caution on matters
                    connected with the agriculture of ancient Egypt; for our knowledge of its
                    husbandry is chiefly derived from hints contained in Scripture history, and not
                    from its own historical records. The historian of Egypt, Herodotus, was a Greek,
                    and lived at so late a period as the fifth century before the Christian era,
                    long after the glory of Egypt had departed; whereas the Scriptures supply us
                    with facts of Egyptian agriculture of much greater antiquity, isolated though
                    they certainly are. Such circumstances as the following indicate the existence
                    of irrigation in Egypt at a very remote period of the world. When Abraham and
                    Lot journeyed together in search of a country to abide in after they had left
                    Egypt, they agreed to separate, when they found that the land they were then in
                    could not supply sufficient food for their united flocks and herds; and we are
                    told that Lot chose the plain of Jordan, because it was watered as well as the
                    land of Egypt. “And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan as
                    thou comest into Zoar, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord
                    destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of
                    Egypt.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gen. xiii.
                    10.</p></note> Egypt never contained rivers to water it, there being only the
                    Nile; so that the similitude between <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> the plain
                    of Jordan” and “the land of Egypt,” to the mind of Lot, must have arisen from
                    the rivers in Jordan being as numerous as the canals in Egypt; and Lot having
                    witnessed the fertilizing powers of the water of these canals in Egypt,
                    naturally supposed that the rivers would produce a similar effect on the plain
                    of Jordan. The Egyptians had been in the habit of watering their gardens as well
                    as their fields, and this they accomplished at pleasure, by raising water with a
                    machine which they worked with the foot. Simple as such contrivances were, and
                    they are to be seen in Egypt at this day, they could not fail to be troublesome.
                    Dr Clarke describes the Egyptians, when raising water for their gardens, as
                    requiring to work stark naked, or only partially covered with a blue striped
                    shirt. When Moses, therefore, described the promised land to the Israelites, he
                    represented it as a land which was supplied with water in a natural manner, in
                    contradistinction to the more difficult and artificial way by the foot in Egypt:
                    “For the land whither thou goest to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt from
                    whence thou earnest out, where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy
                    foot, as a garden of herbs: But the land whither ye go to possess it, is a land
                    of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven: And it shall
                    come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandment which I command
                    you this day, that I will give you the rain of your land in due season, the
                    first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy
                    wine, and thine oil.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Deut. xi. 10, 11, 13, 14.</p></note></p>
                <p>By irrigation, the soil of Egypt had been rendered so fertile that Pliny compares
                    it to that of the Leontines, formerly the most fertile part of Sicily. Certain
                    it is that Egypt was very prolific in corn even in the days of Abraham, who had
                    recourse to it in years of famine, and that was at least eighteen centuries
                    before the Christian era.</p>
                <p>Too little is known of the agriculture of the ancient kingdoms of Assyria,
                    Babylon, Carthage, Phoenicia, and Greece, to enable any one to ascertain how
                    they practised irrigation; but as they all had Egypt as an example in
                    agriculture and the arts, it is probable that they had followed those practices
                    in husbandry which were most suitable to their respective countries. The little
                    that Xenophon says in his <hi rend="italic">Anabasis</hi> of the husbandry of
                    Persia, would lead to the belief that canals had been cut from rivers to
                    irrigate the country after the manner of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The sagacious Romans⅛ it is well known from the writings of their rustic
                    countrymen, adopted irrigation on an extensive scale, as one of the best means
                    of improving land. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943717?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-3717-0455"/> oldest Roman rustic writer, Cato, expressed his
                    opinion that the way to become rich quickly was “by grazing cattle well,” and
                    hence he gives the preference to meadows. He does not maintain that grass is the
                    most valuable crop which the land can produce, for he only places meadows in the
                    fifth degree of value, giving preference in this respect to vineyards, watered
                    gardens, willow fields, and olive gardens, but that they yielded most profit in
                    proportion to the expense attending them, and they were always ready; hence
                    their ancient name, <hi rend="italic">parata.</hi> Agreeably to this opinion,
                    Cato recommends the formation of meadows, and particularly of water-meadows,
                    whenever there is a command of water: <hi rend="italic">Prata irrigua,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic">aquam habebis, potissimum
                    facito.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cat. cap.
                    ix.</p></note> Columella recommends the same precept, and enters more minutely
                    into the kinds of soils which should be converted into water-meadows, and of the
                    nature of the surface best adapted to them, as well as the management of the
                    water in the time of irrigation, “Land that is naturally rich,” says he, “and
                    that is in good heart, does not need to have water set over it; and it is better
                    hay which nature of its own accord produces in a juicy soil, than what water
                    draws from a soil that is overflowed. This, however, is a necessary practice
                    when the poverty of the soil requires it; and a meadow may be formed either upon
                    stiff or free soil, though poor, when water may be set over it. Neither a low
                    field with hollows, nor a field broken with steep rising ground, are proper; the
                    first, because it contains too long the water collected in the hollows; the
                    last, because it makes the water run too quickly over it. A field, however, that
                    has a moderate descent may be made a meadow, whether it is rich or so situated
                    as to bc watered; but the best situation is where the surface is smooth, and the
                    descent so gentle as to prevent either showers or the rivers that overflow it
                    from remaining long; and on the other hand, to allow the water that comes over
                    it quietly to glide off. Therefore, if in any part of a field intended for a
                    meadow, a pool of water should stand, it must be let off by drains, for the loss
                    is equal, either from too much water or too little grass.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Col. lib. 2. cap. xvii.</p></note> But none
                    of the Roman rustic writers give directions <hi rend="italic">how</hi> a
                    røoŵr-meadow should be made, nor say any thing about the utility of sluices,
                    although Columella gives minute directions about the formation of <hi
                    rend="italic">dry</hi> meadows. It does not appear, moreover, that they were
                    acquainted with the raising of turf and laying it down again for meadows,
                    because they only recommend hay-seeds from the hay-lofts and cribs to be sown,
                    and deprecate the watering and pasturing of cattle on the new meadows till the
                    surface becomes hard. There is no specific notice taken by any of them of how
                    long a period meadows should be watered, if one sentence of Pliny be excepted,
                    wherein he directs that “meadow’s ought to be watered immediately after the
                    equinox, and the waters restrained whenever the grass shoots up into the
                    stalk;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    intervals.</p>
                <p>Pliny alone mentions watering before the first crop of hay is cut, on the
                    principle that wet grass, whether wetted by water or dew, is cut more easily
                    than dry: <hi rend="italic">Noctibus roscidis secari</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">lb.</hi> lib. 18, cap. xxviii.</p></note> The Romans were in the
                    custom of cutting their meadows at least twice a-year, in May and August or
                    September, and making hay of both these cuttings; but meadows for forage were
                    cut sometimes four times. The autumnal hay was emphatically called <hi
                    rend="italic">cordum,</hi> and being soft, and sweeter than hay come to its full
                    growth, it was the kind most proper to be given to sheep in winter. The produce
                    of the Roman meadows appears to have been very considerable, and it is therefore
                    no wonder that they put such a high value on grass-land. Both Columella and
                    Pliny estimate it a day’s work for a man to mow a <hi rend="italic">jugerum</hi>
                    and bind 1200 bundles of hay, of four pounds each. According to a calculation
                    made by Dr Dickson, these quantities would give a produce of 265 hay stones, of
                    22 lb. to the stone, per acre (416 imperial stones per imperial acre), of
                    prepared hay, besides the autumnal crop and the rakings taken up afterwards, and
                    which may be estimated at one-half more.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    making hay, which differed from the method of this country, but having alluded
                    to hay having been bound in bundles, it may not be irrelevant to state that the
                    Romans made up their hay into bundles of four pounds each before they carried it
                    into the barns or haylofts, and that they never ricked it but in rainy
                    weather.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the fall of the Roman empire, agriculture declined, and was
                    kept in a very depressed state during the middle ages, which depression, with
                    respect to agriculture, lasted about ten centuries. It need therefore excite no
                    surprise that the general agriculture of Italy was not much improved, from what
                    it had been amongst the Romans, till after the revival of letters. Irrigation
                    was perhaps the only branch of agriculture which received improvement or
                    extension before the expiration of the dark ages; and its improvement at that
                    time was even confined to the north of Italy. The irrigation of Lombardy to this
                    day forms the principal feature of its agriculture. The Lombard kings, following
                    the example of the Romans, encouraged and extended irrigation, and they were
                    ably assisted by the inmates of their numerous and wealthy religious
                    establishments.</p>
                <p>Under these favourable auspices, irrigation had been extended on a great scale in
                    Lombardy as early as 1037; and such expert hydraulic engineers had the monks of
                    Chiare-valle become, that they were consulted and employed as such by the
                    Empcror Frederick I. in the thirteenth century; and, ever since, so assiduous
                    has been the care with which the agriculturists in Lombardy have preserved
                    entire, and in good working order, their water-meadows, that at the present day
                    no other part of the globe can exhibit that operation on so grand a scale and in
                    such excellent order, and producing so rich a pasturage, verdant throughout the
                    year. The largest rivers in the north of Italy, the Po, the Adige, the
                    Tagliamento, and others, are put under requisition for a supply of water in
                    summer and winter, for the purposes of irrigation; the whole country from Venice
                    to Turin being almost one continued water-meadow. But there irrigation is not
                    confined to grass-land; water being also conducted between the ridges of
                    corn-land; in the hollows between drilled crops; among vines; and over the flats
                    appropriated to the production of rice: and it is also used to deposite mud, in
                    the manner of warping, where it contains sediment. Irrigation naturally passed
                    from Lombardy into the south of France, where it is used to raise many of the
                    more valuable productions of the soil. Spain to this day employs irrigation to
                    so considerable an extent, that few crops are there raised without it. Some
                    watermeadows in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, which are said to
                    have existed from time immemorial, have led to the belief that irrigation has
                    been practised in Britain from the time of the Romans. It is, indeed, extremely
                    probable, that had the Romans constructed such works during their sojourn in
                    Britain, the pastoral habits of their Saxon successors would have preserved them
                    from destruċ-tion. But be this as it may, it is certain that irrigation after
                    the method of Italy was not extensively introduced into Britain till the
                    sixteenth century, when it was attempted on a large scale in Cambridgeshire, on
                    the estate of Barbraham, by one Pallavicino, the collector of Peter’s pence in
                    the reign of Queen Mary, but who, on the accession of Elizabeth, had the art to
                    turn Protestant, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943730?mode=fullsize"

                    which he had in his possession, amounting it is said to L. 30,000 or L. 40,000,
                    and appropriate it to his own use.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    gross, that his example as an irrigator was not followed at the time, nor indeed
                    were many water-meadows formed in England till the end of the last or beginning
                    of the present century. Since that time, many of them have been scientifically
                    made both in England and in Scotland, which all have proved how profitably
                    irrigation might be extended, and of which a few successful examples have been
                    enumerated. As might be expected from the nature of the climates, irrigation is
                    extensively practised in India, China, and parts of America, particularly
                    Mexico; but as the irrigation of those countries presents no features peculiarly
                    different from that related of Egypt and Italy, it is unnecessary to enlarge
                    upon it.</p>
                <p>VII. THEORY OF IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>The theory of irrigation, as propounded by the late Sir Humphrey Davy, is given
                    by him in these words: “Water is absolutely essential to vegetation; and when
                    land has been covered with water in the winter or in the beginning of spring,
                    the moisture which has penetrated deep into the soil, and even the subsoil,
                    becomes a sort of nourishment to the roots of the plants in the summer, and
                    prevents those bad effects which often happen in lands in their natural state
                    from a long continuance of dry weather. When the water used in irrigation has
                    flowed over a calcareous country, it is generally found impregnated with
                    carbonate of lime, and in this state it tends, in many instances, to ameliorate
                    the soil. Common river water also generally contains a certain portion of
                    organizable matter, which is much greater after rains than at other times, and
                    which exists in the largest quantity when the stream rises in a cultivated
                    country. Even in cases where the water used for flooding is pure, and free from
                    animal and vegetable substances, it acts by causing the more equable diffusion
                    of nutritive matter existing in the land; and in very cold seasons it preserves
                    the tender roots and leaves of the grass from being affected by frost. . . . In
                    general, those waters which breed the best fish are the best fitted for watering
                    meadows; but most of the benefits of irrigation may be derived from any kind of
                    water. It is, however, a general principle, that waters containing ferruginous
                    impregnations, though possessed of fertilizing effects, when applied to a
                    calcareous soil, are injurious on soils that do not effervesce with acids; and
                    that calcareous waters, which are known by the earthy deposite they afford when
                    boiled, are of most use on siliceous soils, or other soils containing no
                    remarkable quantity of carbonate of lime.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of Agriculture,</hi>
                    vol. v. p. 24.</p></note> To show the protective power of water against cold, it
                    is only necessary to state the well-known physical fact, that water is of
                    greater specific gravity at 42° Fahrenheit than at the freezing point of 32°;
                    and hence water in contact with the roots of grass is rarely below 40°, a degree
                    of temperature not at all prejudicial to the living organs of plants. Professor
                    Rennie, of King’s College, London, has recently given another theory of
                    irrigation. It was promulged by Μ. De Candolle of Geneva, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologic Vegetale,</hi> and his views have recently been
                    corroborated by the experiments of M.’Macaire of Geneva, that plants exude an
                    excretion from their roots into the soil, and that this excretion is detrimental
                    to the healthy growth of the same kind of plants which produced it. Hence it is
                    concluded that grasses do not continue permanently in a healthy state in the
                    same site, because they are in time injuriously affected by their own
                    excretions, which, encouraging the growth of plants of a different nature, such
                    as mosses, they spring up and extirpate the grasses. It is supposed to be
                    probable that every species of grass is not alike affected by its own, or the
                    excrementitious matter from other grasses, and therefore some species withstand
                    the poison longer than others. Now, the water of irrigation, in its descent
                    through the soil and subsoil, washes away or carries off in solution the
                    injurious excrementitious matter exuded by the grasses, and thereby cleanses the
                    soil in which they are growing free of it. Hence the <hi rend="italic">perennial
                    verdure</hi> of <hi rend="italic">irrigated</hi> grass.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Agricultural
                    Chemistry,</hi> 4to edition, p. 205.</p></note> These theories establish four
                    advantages which are derivable from irrigation. It supplies moisture to the
                    soil, necessary in dry seasons and in tropical countries; it affords protection
                    to plants against the extremes of heat and cold; it disseminates manure most
                    minutely to plants; and it washes away injurious matter from the roots of
                    plants.</p>
                <p>Whichever theory is adopted, or both of them, for they are not inconsistent with
                    each other, the benefits derivable from irrigation are purely mechanical; they
                    have no reference to chemical action. The opinion of Sir Humphry Davy,
                    therefore, that “in the artificial watering of meadows, the beneficial effects
                    depend upon many different causes, some <hi rend="italic">chemical,</hi> some
                    mechanical,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Agricultural Chemistry,</hi> p. 305.</p></note> appears very
                    problematical. Chemical action only commences after irrigation has ceased. This
                    conclusion will appear evident, when the following particulars have been
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The operation of water bringing matter into minute subdivision; the sediment
                    which it contains when used in irrigation being minutely distributed around the
                    stems of the plants; water protecting plants in irrigation against the extremes
                    of heat and cold, by completely covering and embracing every stem and leaf; and
                    the supplying of moisture to the soil, and washing excrementitious matter out of
                    it, are all purely mechanical operations. Warping is obviously a mechanical
                    operation. Could the hand of man distribute manure around the roots and stems of
                    grass as minutely and incessantly as turbid water; could it place a covering of
                    woollen manufacture upon each blade and around each stem of grass, as completely
                    as water can embrace each plant and keep it warm; could it water the grass as
                    quietly and constantly as the slow current of irrigation; and could it wash away
                    injurious matter from the soil as delicately around the fibres of the roots of
                    grass as irrigating water, there would be no need of irrigation; the husbandman
                    could then command at will verdant pasturage for his flocks and herds throughout
                    the year, and in the driest season. His me chanical agency would be as effective
                    as that of irrigation. But the relative powers of things being as at present
                    constituted, man employs irrigation as the instrument of his will, and attains
                    the maintenance of his live-stock by inducing Nature to assist him in a work in
                    which she undoubtedly displays her superiority over him both in indugtry and
                    dexterity.</p>
