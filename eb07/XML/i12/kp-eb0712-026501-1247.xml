                <p><label type="entry">INDIANA</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    is bounded on the north by Lake Michigan, and the territory of the same name; on
                    the south by Kentucky; on the east by Ohio; and on the west by Illinois. It
                    extends from Lat. 37° 50 ’ to Lat. 41° 45 ’ north; and from Long. 84° 45 ’ to
                    Long. 88° west; being 270 miles in length, 220 in breadth, and containing a
                    superficies of 36,000 square miles. Although this state is more hilly than
                    Illinois, it contains no mountains of any great height. The southern front has
                    the usual belt of river hills, bluffs, and knobs, known by the name of Ohio
                    Hills, which often rise immediately from the waters of the Ohio, in forms of
                    picturesque grandeur and beauty, and sometimes retreat from it to a considerable
                    distance, leaving between the river and their base, a bottom of two or three
                    miles in extent. A range of hills, called the Knobs, stretching from the Ohio to
                    White River of the Wabash, forms the limits of the table ìands which separate
                    the waters of the Ohio from those of White River. North of the Wabash, the hills
                    which bear the same name, are precipitous, and the country is to a considerable
                    extent broken and rugged. Large portions of the state may be pronounced hilly,
                    but three-fifths of it at least consist of vast tracts of level country. The
                    wide extent of land watered by the White River is for the most part level. The
                    prairies, so characteristic of the New World, have the usual distinction of high
                    and low, swampy and alluvial. They differ in no respect from those of Illinois,
                    being alike rich, level, and prolific of grass and flowering plants. Those which
                    are situated along the course of the Wabash have been particularly admired for
                    their beauty and fertility. Many of the prairies are long and nairow, some of
                    them, like those of Illinois, are larger than can be taken in at once by the
                    eye, and others are only large enough for a few farms. They are usually bounded
                    by dense forests, and are not unfrequently adorned with copses of small trees.
                    In spring and summer, the luxuriant growth of grass and fragrant flowers, with
                    which they are covered, rises to from six to eight feet in height. For a
                    considerable extent on the northern frontier of the state, between the Wabash
                    and Lake Michigan, the country is for the most part an extended plain,
                    alternately prairie and woodland, diversified by swamps, and by small lakes and
                    ponds. No part of the western world presents larger tracts of rich land, than
                    that portion of White River country, of which Indianopolis, the capital of the
                    state, is the centre. The river or low prairies are levels destitute of timber,
                    and are said to exhibit vestiges of former cultivation. The high or upland
                    prairies are elevated from thirty to one hundred feet above the others, and are
                    far more numerous and extensive. The ordinary depth of the vegetable soil is
                    from two to five feet, but in some places it has been found to extend twenty-two
                    feet downwards. The forest trees, shrubs, plants, and grasses, do not materially
                    differ from those of Illinois, but there is a much greater proportion of beech
                    timber. The principal productions of the state are wheat, Indian corn, rye,
                    oats, barley, buckwheat, and potatoes. There are some prairies and “bottoms” too
                    rich for growing wheat, until the natural wild luxuriance of the soil has been
                    somewhat reduced by cropping. Upland rice has been cultivated with success, and
                    some of the more sheltered and warm valleys have, in favourable years, yielded
                    considerable crops of cotton. This state is exceedingly well adapted for rearing
                    the finest fruits, and fruit-bearing shrubs. There are in many places abundance
                    of wild berries; and on some of the prairies the strawberries are large and
                    fine. It is stated that in the low prairies in the northern parts, whole tracts
                    are covered with the beautiful fowl meadow-grass, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poa</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis</hi> of the north. But wherever the natural
                    prairie grass has been destroyed by being pastured by domestic animals, it is
                    succeeded by the blue grass of the western country, which furnishes not only a
                    beautiful sward, but covers the ground with a carpeting of rich fodder, not
                    unlike the second crop, which is cut in the northern states as the most valuable
                    kind of hay. For all the objects of farming, and raising of grain, hemp,
                    tobacco, and other necessaries, and the rearing of cattle, sheep, swine, horses,
                    as well as other animals, the emigrant could not find a more advantageous
                    country than Indiana. In the rich “bottoms” of the southern parts, the reed
                    cane, and uncommonly large ginseng, are abundant.</p>
                <p>This state possesses a great number of rivers and springs, very happily
                    distributed over the country. Their origin is generally to be traced to swamps
                    or lakes, and the surrounding districts are too low and wet for cultivation. The
                    southern extremity is well watered throughout its whole length by the Ohio; and
                    into this noble stream a considerable number of tributaries flow. But the chief
                    river of Indiana is the Wabash, which, after Tennessee, is one of the most
                    considerable tributaries of the Ohio. It traverses the central parts of the
                    state, and, by its extensive branches, irrigates a great portion thereof. White
                    River enters the Wabash from the eastern side, sixteen miles below Vincennes. It
                    is the most considerable tributary of the Wabash, and one of the most important
                    ∙rivers of the state. It waters a vast tract of very fertile country, in a
                    lateral direction to the main stream. It receives a great number of considerable
                    tributaries from the west, and several smaller ones enter it from the eastern
                    side. White Water, which rises in Ohio, waters a large portion of fertile
                    country. The northern frontier of the state, bordering on the territory of
                    Michigan, and the lake of the same name, is watered copiously by rivers which
                    discharge their waters into that lake and Lake Erie. The courses of these
                    streams are generally short, but they carry along large volumes of water. Most
                    of them have their origin in lakes and ponds, of which above one hundred exist
                    along the northern frontier. Many of them have the peculiar character of the
                    waters in this region; that is, they are situated on an elevated plateau, from
                    one extremity of which the waters are discharged into the lakes, and from the
                    other into the waters of the Mississippi. The amount of inland navigation of
                    Indiana is great, although it is not equal to that of Illinois. It possesses the
                    whole extent of the Wabash and White River, with its numerous branches navigable
                    by fly-boats. A navigable canal now connects the White Water with the Ohio, at
                    Cincinnati; others are either completed, in progress, or in contemplation; and,
                    as the wealth and commerce of the state increase, it will emulate the
                    enterprise, the canals, and the great public works of the sister state of Ohio.
                    The whole recent extent of inland navigation which it enjoys may be fairly
                    computed at 5000 miles. A great national road, passing from east to west through
                    the state, is in progress, and a rail-road, from Ohio to Lake Michigan, has been
                    projected.</p>
                <p>The climate of Indiana resembles that of Illinois, and the other neighbouring
                    states. That part of it which is contiguous to Lake Michigan is subject to
                    copious rains, and, being otherwise low and marshy, much of the land is unfit
                    for cultivation. For a considerable distance from the lake, sand heaps covered
                    with a few stunted junipers, and swept by the gales of the lake, give little
                    promise of a fine country or propitious climate. But beyond the point to which
                    the breezes of the lake extend, the climate is mild and temperate. The state in
                    general is rather less exposed than Illinois to the extremes of heat and cold.
                    The climate is in general healthy; indeed, the astonishing increase of the
                    population within a few years, affords a proof of this. The higher regions are,
                    of course, more so than those which are low and are swampy. The winters are
                    mild, compared with those of New England or Pennsylvania. Winter commences in
                    its severity about Christmas, but seldom lasts longer than six weeks. During
                    this period, the rivers which have not very rapid currents are frozen; although
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941260" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1260-0266"/>winters occur
                    in which the Wabash cannot be crossed upon the ice. Snow does not fall to any
                    great depth; in the middle and southern parts rarely more than six inches. Peach
                    trees are generally in blossom early in March, and the foliage of the forest
                    assumes its green tint in the middle of April.</p>
                <p>The interior and northern parts of this state are abundantly stocked with game.
                    Bears, and especially deer, are common. Wild turkeys abound, and prairie hens,
                    partridges, and grouse are seen in countless numbers. The streams, especially
                    those which communicate with Lake Michigan, are stocked with fish of various
                    kinds and the best qualities. Venomous reptiles are sometimes met with, most
                    commonly in the vicinity of ledges of rocks. The rattlesnake and the copper-head
                    are the most numerous and dangerous.</p>
                <p>There are salt springs in different parts of the state, but they do not appear to
                    be wrought to any extent. Stone-coal of the best quality is found in various
                    places. Native copper has been discovered in small masses, in the northern parts
                    of the state. Iron-ore is also found in some places. But in general it is too
                    level a country to afford many minerals.</p>
                <p>Like Alabama and Tennessee, this state abounds with subterranean wonders, such as
                    caves. Many of these have been explored, and some of them have been described.
                    One of them is generally known in the western country by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epsom Salts Cave.</hi> It is situated at a short distance from
                    Jeffersonville. When first discovered, the salts were represented as being ⅛ome
                    inches deep on the floor. The interior of this cave possesses the usual domes
                    and chambers of extensive caverns, through which the visitant gropes his way
                    inwards for a mile and a quarter, till he reaches the Pillar, which is a
                    splendid column, 15 feet in diameter, and 25 feet in height, regularly reeded
                    from top to bottom. Near it are smaller pillars having the same appearance. The
                    salt in question is sometimes found in lumps, varying from one to ten pounds.
                    The floor and walls are covered with it in the form of frost-work, which, when
                    removed, is speedily reproduced. The earth yields from four to twenty pounds to
                    the bushel, and the product is said to be of the best quality. Nitre is also
                    found in the cave in great abundance; and likewise sulphate of lime, or plaster
                    of Paris.</p>
                <p>With regard to the towns of this state, to enumerate all that have attained some
                    degree of importance, would only be to present a barren catalogue of names. We
                    shall shortly describe the principal of these, beginning with Law-renceburgh, on
                    the south-eastern angle of the state. This town, the seat of justice for the
                    county of Dearborn, stands on the northern bank of the Ohio, twenty-three miles
                    below Cincinnati, and two miles below the Big Miami, the eastern limit of the
                    state. It is situated in the centre of a rich “bottom,” and since its
                    commencement has made very rapid progress. Its position in relation to the
                    river, the rich adjacent country, and the Big Miami, is highly eligible. Many of
                    the houses are handsome, and have a fine appearance from the river. There are a
                    number of respectable manufactories, and every thing promises a large and
                    populous town at no distant date. At present the inhabitants are above 1000 in
                    number. Vevay, the seat of justice for Switzerland county, is situated
                    forty-five miles below Cincinnati. It contains between two and three hundred
                    dwelling-houses, a court-house, jail, academy, a printing-office, from which
                    issues a weekly journal, and a branch of the bank of Indiana, besides other
                    public buildings. In the neighbourhood of this town there is the largest
                    vineyard in the United States. Vines have been cultivated to a great extent, and
                    with a success unrivalled in the western world. The inhabitants are chiefly
                    emigrants from Switzerland, who brought with them, from the vine-clad mountains
                    of their native country, those simple manners, and those habits of industry and
                    perseverance, for which that people are distinguished. They are constantly
                    making improvements in the cultivation of the grape, and the wiiae made from it
                    is of a very superior quality. The Swiss have created some manufactures peculiar
                    to themselves, particularly that of straw-hats. Madison, a populous and thriving
                    town, situated on the Ohio, and nearly equidistant from Louisville and
                    Cincinnati, was commenced in the year 1811. Its position on the Ohio is
                    peculiarly favourable, as it is the point of the river nearest to Indianapolis,
                    and the landingplace for the imports from the Ohio to a number of the
                    newly-settled and thriving counties. Besides churches and public buildings, it
                    has nearly thirty stores of dry-goods, many of which transact extensive
                    business. Large exports of the produce of the country are made here, and the
                    town is particularly noted for the quantity of pork which is barrelled in it. It
                    contains above 2000 inhabitants. Jeffersonville, which is situated just above
                    the Falls of Ohio, is a considerable and handsome village. Four miles and a half
                    below it stands New Albany, the seat of justice for Floyd county. It has a
                    convenient yard for building steam-boats, and is a thriving and busy village,
                    containing about 2000 inhabitants. Passing over some places of minor note, we
                    come to Corydon, the seat of justice for the county of Harrison, and once the
                    political metropolis of the state. It is situated in the forks of Indian Creek,
                    about twenty-three miles from Jeffersonville, and thirteen miles from Ohio.
                    Salem, which is situated on a small branch of Blue River, thirty-four miles
                    north of Corydon, is a flourishing country town, containing above one hundred
                    houses. Vincennes, one of the oldest places in the western world, was settled by
                    French emigrants in the beginning of the last century. It is situated 150 miles
                    above the mouth of the Wabash, and fifty-four from the nearest point of the
                    Ohio. It contains above 300 dwelling-houses, a number of public buildings, and
                    about 1500 inhabitants. Harmony lies fifty-four miles below Vincennes, and
                    sixteen miles from the nearest point of the Ohio, on a rich and heavily-wooded
                    plateau, or second “bottom.” It is situated on high ground, is healthy, has a
                    fertile soil, and is in the vicinity of small and rich prairies. It was first
                    settled in 1814 by a religious sect of Germans, denominated Harmonites. They
                    settled firstin Pennsylvania, whence they moved in a body, amounting to 800
                    persons, to this place. Like the primitive Christians, they held their property
                    in common, and their lands were laid off with all the regularity which the
                    compass and square could give to them. For some time they laboured industriously
                    and in perfect peace, but their eyes ultimately began to revert to the temperate
                    climate and the rich savannahs where they had first settled. Whilst under the
                    influence of these yearnings, the leader of a new sect appeared amongst them.
                    This was Robert Owen of New Lanark, in Scotland, the expounder of a new social
                    system. He purchased a large portion of territory, together with a village, and
                    in a short period from seven to eight hundred persons were admitted members of
                    the new establishment. For some time matters seemed to promise fair for the
                    success of the experiment, but it finally shared the fate of the former
                    settlement, as well as that of every other by which theorists would attempt to
                    divert the stream of things from its natural course. The social system is now
                    abandoned. Brookville, which is situated in the Forks of the White River,
                    contains about 100 houses. The surrounding country is well timbered and watered.
                    The soil is rich and productive, and has acquired celebrity on account of the
                    excellence of the tobacco which it produces. Harrison is situated on the north
                    bank of White River, eight miles from its mouth, and eighteen north-east of
                    Brookville, i≈ <hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ^ <hi

                    is divided between the jurisdiction of Indiana and Ohio. In the rich and
                    extensive “bottoms” which surround this place are found great numbers of Indian
                    mounds, containing human bones, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941273"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1273-0267"/>axes, vases, and various other implements of war
                    and domestic utensils. Indianapolis, the seat of the government of the state, is
                    situated on the western bank of White River, nearly in the centre of the state,
                    and at a point accessible by steam-boats, in the ordinary state of the Wabash.
                    It is surrounded by one of the most extensive and fertile tracts in North
                    America, and it is being settled with unexampled rapidity. A few years have been
                    sufficient to convert it from a deep and almost impenetrable forest into a
                    populous town and a cultivated country. There are several excellent public
                    buildings, and many comfortable dwelling-houses. In course of time Indianapolis
                    will no doubt become one of the largest towns between Cincinnati and the
                    Mississippi.</p>
                <p>This state was admitted into the Union in 1816, when its present constitution was
                    formed. It does not essentially differ from those of the other western states. A
                    governor and lieutenant-governor are chosen by the people triennially. There is
                    a general assembly, consisting of a senate, the members of which are chosen for
                    periods of three years, a third part being elected annually; and of a house of
                    representatives, the members of which are .elected annually. The number of
                    representatives may be increased to one hundred, and of senators to fifty; but
                    at present they do not amount to much more than the half of these numbers. The
                    judges of the supreme court are appointed by the governor, with the consent of
                    the senate; the presidents of the circuit courts by the legislature; and the
                    associate judges are elected by the people. A thirty-sixth part of the land in
                    each township is reserved, by a compact between the state and the rest of the
                    Union, for the support of education; and reservations of land have been made for
                    the support of a college, which is established at Bloomington. Very considerable
                    interest is taken in the cause of education throughout this state. Schools arc
                    established in all the considerable towns and villages, and many of them have a
                    reading-room and library. An historical society has been formed, the object of
                    which is to collect and preserve the antiquities of the state.</p>
                <p>This part of the country was first colonized by some French soldiers of Louis
                    XIV., who settled at Vincennes as early as 1702. For nearly a century this
                    solitary colony remained isolated from the rest of mankind, and even retrograded
                    towards the state of the savages who surrounded it, and with whom the colonists
                    intermarried. During the revolution, they manifested a disposition so favourable
                    to the republic, that the general government ceded a tract of land to them at
                    the termination of the war. The savages, however, continued to harass them until
                    the peace, which was restored by the treaty of Greenville. The greater part of
                    the territory was still claimed by the natural heirs of the soil; but in 1811,
                    in consequence of their depredations and murders, a military force was sent
                    against them, and they were defeated in the bloody battle of Tippecause. Since
                    the peace they have been quiet, and have ceded the greater part of their lands
                    to the United States. The remnants of several tribes still remain, and possess
                    either lands or annuities from government. Their numbers may amount to about
                    5000.</p>
                <p>The increase of population in this state has been unusually rapid. In 1820, the
                    inhabitants amounted to 147,000, and the census of 1830 states them to be
                    344,000, but this number include only persons resident in the state. Ιhe revenue
                    for 1831 was 103,000 dollars, and the expenditure 37,765 dollars. <hi
