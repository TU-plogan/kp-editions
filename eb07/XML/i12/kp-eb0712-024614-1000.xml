                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">1LLE-Vilaine,</hi> a department of the north of France, on the
                    sea coast, formed out of a part of the ancient province of Normandy. It extends
                    in north latitude from 47. 39. to 48. 42. and in west longitude from 1. 13. to
                    2. 16. It is bounded on the north by the English Channel, on the east by the
                    department of Mayenne, on the south by the Lower Loire, and on the west by
                    Morbihan and the Lake du Nord. It is 2756 square miles in extent, and is divided
                    into six arrondissements, which are subdivided into forty-three cantons and 352
                    communes. The population, according to the Annuaire for 1834, amounted to
                    547,052 individuals. They almost exclusively adhere to the Romish church, as the
                    few Protestants are in no place sufficiently numerous to form a congregation.
                    They are for the most part of a Celtic race, and speak a language much like that
                    of the Welsh; and though some French words have been introduced, they are
                    scarcely intelligible by the French people. Those on the sea coast are employed
                    in the fisheries, and in the numerous small craft make excellent sailors. The
                    inland inhabitants are much attached to their ancient customs, are uninstructed,
                    and most superstitious. They live much on food composed of buck-wheat, made into
                    a kind of pudding <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941013"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1013-0247"/>called <hi rend="italic">galettee</hi>; and
                    chestnuts form a material part of their sustenance. The country people are ill
                    clad, generally with domestic manufactures. The estates are much divided; a farm
                    of sixty acres is deemed a large one, and the far greater number do not exceed
                    twelve acres. Hence they are for the most part excessively poor, and,
                    particularly in winter, suffer much hardship. The face of the country is
                    generally level, but with a few slight undulations. The highest of these hills
                    are in the arrondissement of Fougeres on the east, and in that of Montfort to
                    the west. The coast is surrounded with cliffs, and with small rocky projections;
                    and on the borders there are artificial dams, constructed to prevent the
                    encroachments of the sea. The rivers which give their name to the department
                    neither rise within it, nor do they discharge their waters into the sea till
                    they enter fl&lt;e adjoining province of Morbihan. The Vilaine is navigable for
                    vessels of 200 tons by help of the tide, up to Vitrè, from whence is a
                    communication by a canal with the town of Rance.</p>
                <p>The soil is unfavourable to cultivation, scarcely exceeding an inch in depth, and
                    resting on a bed of clay or slaty stone. Much of the land is covered with
                    morasses and swamps, which, with the woods and heaths, leaves but little for
                    agriculture, though on the sides of the rivers there is some tolerably good
                    pasture land. The department scarcely grows sufficient corn for the inhabitants,
                    though they use most of the lowest description. Hemp and flax are grown, and
                    chiefly used at home. Fruit trees are abundant and productive. Some horses are
                    bred for sale to other districts, and some cows are kept for the dairy; but the
                    breed of sheep is much neglected. There is little trade, and few manufactures;
                    the latter are limited to twine and sail-cloth. There is very little wine made,
                    but abundance of cedar. The cities and towns are small. The only ones having
                    more than 4000 persons are, the capital, Rennes, with 29,680; Fougeres, with
                    7677; Saint Malo, with 9890; Vitrè, with 8856; and Redon, with 4504.</p>
