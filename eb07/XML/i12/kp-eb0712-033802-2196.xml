                <p><label type="entry">IONA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Icolmkill</hi></label>, one of
                    the Hebrides, a small but celebrated island, “once,” as Dr Johnson expresses it,
                    “the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and roving
                    barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge and the blessings of religion.” The
                    name <hi rend="italic">Iona</hi> is derived from the Hebrew word signifying a
                    <hi rend="italic">dove,</hi> in allusion to Columba, who landed here in 565. It
                    is said to have been a seat of the Druids before his arrival, when its name in
                    Irish was <hi rend="italic">Inis Drunish,</hi> or the Druid Island. The Druids
                    being expelled or converted, Columba founded here a cell of canons regular, who,
                    till 716, differed from the church of Rome in the observance of Easter and in
                    the tonsure. After his death the island retained his name, and was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Yeolumb cill</hi> or Columb’s cell, now <hi rend="italic"
                    >Icolmhill.</hi> The Danes dislodged the monks in the seventh century, and the
                    Cluniacs were the next order who settled here.</p>
                <p>This island, which belongs to the parish of Ross, in Mull, is three miles long
                    and one broad. The east side is mostly flat, the middle rises into small hills,
                    the west side is very rude and rocky, and the whole forms a singular mixture of
                    rock and fertility. There is in the whole island only one village, or rather
                    collection of huts, inhabited by a population of about 450 individuals, for
                    whose education and religious improvement a church and schoolhouse have been
                    erected by the Society for the Diffusion of Christian Knowledge. Near the town
                    is the bay of the martyrs who were put to death by the Danes. An oblong
                    enclosure, bounded by a stone dyke, and called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clach-nan-Druinach,</hi> in which bones have been found, is supposed to have
                    been a burial-place of the Druids, or rather the common cemetery of the town’s
                    people. Beyond the town are the ruins of the nunnery of Austin canonesses,
                    dedicated to St Oran, and said to have been founded by Columba. The church was
                    fifty-eight feet by twenty, and the eastern roof is entire. On the floor,
                    covered deep with cow-dung, is the tomb of the last prioress, with her figure
                    praying to the Virgin Mary, and this inscription on the ledge: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hic jacet</hi><hi rend="italic">domina</hi><hi rend="italic">Anna Donaldi
                    Eerleti</hi><hi rend="italic">filia,</hi><hi rend="italic">quondam prioressa de

                    A broad paved way leads hence to the cathedral; and on this way there is a large
                    handsome cross called Macleane’s, the only one that remains of three hundred and
                    sixty which were demolished here at the Reformation. Reilig Ouran, or the
                    burying-place of Oran, is the large enclosure where the kings of Scotland,
                    Ireland, and of the isles, with their descendants, were buried, in three several
                    chapels. The dean of the isles, who travelled in 1549, and whose açcount has
                    been copied by Buchanan, says, that in his time, on one of these chapels, or
                    “tombes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> stain fornfit like little chapels, with ane
                    braid gray marble or quhin stain on the gavil of ilk ane of the tombes,”
                    containing, as the chronicle says, the remains of forty-eight Scotch monarchs,
                    from Fergus II. to Macbeth, sixteen of whom were pretended to be of the race of
                    Alpin, was inscribed <hi rend="italic">Tumulus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regum</hi><hi rend="italic">Scotiae ∙</hi> the next was inscribed <hi
                    rend="italic">Tumulus</hi><hi rend="italic">regum Hibernice</hi> and contained
                    four Irish monarchs; and the third, inscribed <hi rend="italic">Tumulus regum
                    Norwegiae,</hi> contained eight Norwegian princes, or viceroys of the Hebrides,
                    whilst these islands were subject to the crown of Norway. Boecius savs, that
                    Fergus founded this abbey to serve as a burial-píace for his successors, and
                    caused an office to be composed for the funeral ceremony. All that Mr Pennant
                    discovered here, consisted in certain slight remains, built in a rigid form, and
                    arched within, but the inscriptions were lost. These were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Jornaire nan righ,</hi> or “the ridge of the kings.” Amongst those
                    stones are to be seen only two inscriptions, in the Gaelic or Erse language, but
                    written in the ancient Irish characters: <hi rend="italic">Cros Domhail
                    fat'asich,</hi> “the cross of Donald Longshanks,” and that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urchυine o Guin;</hi> and another inscribed <hi rend="italic">Hic jacet
                    priores</hi><hi rend="italic">de Ily</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Johannes, Hugenius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Patricius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in decretisolim baccalaureus,</hi><hi rend="italic">qui
                    obiit</hi><hi rend="italic">an.</hi><hi rend="italic">Dom.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >milles</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> mο</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quingentesimo.</hi> About three hundred inscriptions were collected here by Mr
                    Sacheverel in 1688, and given to the Earl of Argyll, but afterwards lost in the
                    troubles of the family. The place is in a manner filled with grave-stones, but
                    so overgrown with weeds that few or none are at present to be seen, far less can
                    any inscriptions be read. Here also stands the chapel of St Oran, the first
                    building commenced by Columba, which the evil spirits would not suffer to stand
                    till some human victim had been buried alive; a service for which Oran offered
                    himself, and his red grave-stone is still to be seen near the door. In this
                    chapel are tombs of several chiefs, and others. A little north-west of the door
                    is the pedestal of a cross, on which are certain stones that seem to have been
                    the supporters of a tomb. Numbers who visit this island think it incumbent on
                    them to turn each of these thrice round, according to the course of the sun.
                    They are denominated <hi rend="italic">Clachabrath</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    for it is thought that the <hi rend="italic">brath,</hi> or end of the world,
                    will not arrive till the pedestal on which they stand is worn through. Mr
                    Sacheverel informs us, that originally there were here three noble globes of
                    white marble, placed on three stone basons, and that these were turned round;
                    but the synod ordered them and sixty crosses to be thrown into the sea. The
                    present stones are probably substituted instead of these globes. The precinct of
                    these tombs was held sacred, and enjoyed the privileges of a girth or sanctuary.
                    These places of retreat were, by the ancient Scotch law, not designed to shelter
                    indiscriminately every offender, as was the case in more bigoted times in
                    Catholic countries; for here all atrocious criminals were excluded, and none but
                    the unfortunate delinquent or the penitent sinner was shielded from the instant
                    stroke of rigorous justice. A little to the northward of this enclosure stands
                    the cathedral, built in the form of a cross, 115 feet long by twenty-three
                    broad, and the transept seventy feet; the pillars of the choir have their
                    capitals charged with scriptural and other histories; and near to the altar are
                    the tombs of two abbots and a knight. A fragment remains of the altar stone, of
                    white marble veined with gray. This church is ascribed to Maid win, in the
                    seventh century; but the present structure is far too magnificent for that age.
                    Most of the walls are built of red granite, from the Nun’s Island in the Sound.
                    Two parallel walls of a covered way, about twelve feet high and ten wide, reach
                    from the south-east corner to the sea· In the church-yard is a fine cross of a
                    single piece of red granite, fourteen feet high, twenty-two inches broad, and
                    ten inches thick. Near to the south-east end is Marys <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192942209" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2209-0339"/>chapel. The monastery is
                    behind the chapel, of which only a piece of the cloister remains, and some
                    sacred black stones in a corner, on which contracts and alliances were made and
                    oaths sworn. To the east of it were the abbot’s gardens and offices; and to the
                    north was the palace of the bishop of the islcs after the separation from them
                    ofMan. This see was endowed with thirteen islands, several of which were
                    frequently taken away by the chieftains. The title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soder,</hi> which some explained as Zwrng, <hi rend="italic">Soter,</hi> the
                    name of Christ, or Soder an imaginary town, is really derived from the
                    distinction of the diocese into the northern islands or Nordereys, that is, all
                    to the north of Ardnamurchan Point, and the Southern or Sudcreys; which last
                    being the most important, the Isle of Man retained both titles.</p>
                <p>Other ruins of monastic buildings and offices may be traced, as well as some
                    druidical sepulchral remains. Several abbeys were derived from this, which, with
                    the island, was governed by an abbot-presbyter, who had rule even over bishops.
                    The place where St Columba landed is a pebbly beach, where a heap of earth
                    represents the form of his ship. Near it is a hill with a circle of stones
                    called <hi rend="italic">Cnoe∙nan aimgeal,</hi> or “the hill of angels,” with
                    whom the saint held conference; and on Michaelmas day the inhabitants coursed
                    their horses round it, a relic of the custom of bringing them there to be
                    blessed. In former times this island was the place where the archives of
                    Scotland and many valuable old manuscripts were kept. Of these most are supposed
                    to have been destroyed at the Reformation; but many, it is said, were carried to
                    the Scotch college at Douay in France, and it is hoped some of them may still be
                    recovered. In 1830 an intelligent antiquary cleared away the rubbish from the
                    ruins of the religious edifices, for the purpose of bringing to light every
                    relic that might remain. In this search, besides the advantages resulting from
                    disentombing these interesting ruins, and exposing them to the eye of the
                    visitor, a great many statues and monuments were discovered.</p>
