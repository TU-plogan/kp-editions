                <p><label type="entry">ICELAND</label>, one of the largest islands in Europe (being
                    little inferior, in point of superficial extent, to Ireland), is situated in the
                    north part of the Atlantic Ocean, between the 63d and 67th degrees of north
                    latitude, and the 12th and 25th degrees of west longitude. Its extreme length
                    from east to west is about 280 miles, and its breadth from north to south varies
                    from 180 to 200.</p>
                <p>The precise period at which this island was discovered and first colonized is
                    unknown; but, from the Landnamabok, an ancient Icelandic chronicle, and a work
                    generally relied upon as authentic, we learn that the Norwegians were the first
                    settlers upon its coasts. Naddodr, a famous pirate of that adventurous nation,
                    was, on his return to the Feroe Islands from a predatory excursion, about the
                    year 860, driven by a tempest upon the coast of Iceland. He ascended to the
                    summit of a mountain, but observing around him neither the vestige of a human
                    residence, nor aught else than vast and trackless fields of snow, he immediately
                    abandoned it. Probably aware of this discovery, Gardar Svarfarson, a Swede,
                    followed the same track a few years afterwards, and, succeeding in
                    circumnavigating the country, discovered it to be an island. He there spent the
                    winter, but finding little inducement to make it a permanent residence, he in
                    the following spring returned to Norway. The third adventurer on this coast was
                    one Floki, another celebrated Norwegian pirate, who, during two seasons,
                    explored a considerable portion of the southern and western coasts. His attempt
                    at forming a permanent settlement proved, however, like that of his predecessor,
                    a failure; his cattle-died, his expected crops were ruined, and, after
                    experiencing numerous distresses and hardships from the inclemency of the
                    weather, he determined to repair to a warmer region, and gave to the island at
                    his departure the name by which it has ever since been known. That this name,
                    and the report which he spread on his return, of the inhospitable nature of the
                    island, were principally the effect of prejudice and disappointment, is evident
                    from the contradictory account given of it by his companions, one of whom
                    thought he could only convey an adequate idea of its richness and fertility by
                    declaring that butter dropped from every plant.</p>
                <p>These expeditions, though affording a slight knowledge of the country, would
                    probably not have led to its colonization, had not disturbances in Norway
                    induced some of the inhabitants of that country to quit their native soil.
                    Harold Harfagra having subdued most of the petty princes of that country, put an
                    end to the system of liberty and independence which the inhabitants of Norway
                    had hitherto enjoyed; and thus drove many even of its nobility, with their
                    families and dependents, from their homes. A body of these voluntary exiles,
                    under the conduct of Ingolf, one of the discontented subjects, sailed from
                    Norway, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 874, from which year the Icelanders date
                    the occupation of their island. When Ingolf approached the coast of Iceland, we
                    are informed that he threw into the sea the wooden door of his former habitation
                    in Norway; and finding it some time afterwards cast upon the shore at Reikiavik,
                    he fixed his abode on the spot where the capital of the island now stands. He
                    was followed by several others, and in a short time considerable portions of the
                    southern and eastern districts of the island were taken possession of. Harold,
                    it appears, did not at first oppose the emigration of his subjects; but
                    afterwards finding it carried on to a great extent, he imposed a fine of four
                    ounces of fine silver upon every person who should leave Norway to settle in
                    Iceland. The Landnamabok, already mentioned, whose object was to afford a
                    picture of the colonization of the island, describes with singular minuteness
                    the arrival and spreading of the different settlers, and records, together with
                    those of the Norwegians, the names of many Danes and Swedes, and even some
                    Scotch and Irish, who at this period selected Iceland as their place <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> residence. The natural consequence of progressive
                    colonization under the feudal tenure which was thus produced, was frequent
                    contention between the new comers and those who had already settled in the
                    country. To obviate these, a chief was named, under whose guidance and direction
                    the concerns, interests, and feelings of the yet separate communities might be
                    regulated and assimilated. This beneficial change was effected A. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 928, and a republican form of government was thus
                    established, well calculated to provide for the emergencies which gave it birth.
                    We say a republican form of government; because, though there was only one
                    supreme magistrate, who decided all disputes, and presided at the <hi
                    rend="italic">all’</hi><hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> or great general assembly
                    of the nation, still he was elected to this office by the free choice of the
                    people, and retained it no longer than while he preserved their confidence. This
                    state of liberty the Icelanders enjoyed with uninterrupted harmony for the space
                    of nearly 400 years. During this period, education, literature, and even the
                    refinements of poetical fancy, flourished amongst them; and the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">sagas</hi> or talcs of the country, the most remarkable literary
                    productions of that dark age, were principally penned prior to the fourteenth
                    century.</p>
                <p>The ancient Icelanders possessed, as is still the case with their posterity, few
                    of the luxuries or refinements of life; and were occasionally exposed to severe
                    privations, from the nature of their soil, and the seasons under which they
                    lived. There is reason, however, to believe, though the fact cannot with perfect
                    accuracy be ascertained, that the climate of Iceland was once less austere than
                    it now is, and that not only trees and shrubs, but even corn, were grown upon
                    the island. Of the ancient existence of the former, the trunks occasionally
                    discovered in the bogs afford pretty satisfactory evidence. Corn of any
                    description is not now a native of the island; and a few birch twigs afford the
                    only approach towards timber. Like the present inhabitants, the ancient
                    Icelanders were much dispersed over the country, their habitations being seldom
                    grouped together, but placed wherever the situation and nature of the soil
                    appeared suitable. Their occupations and modes of life appear also to have borne
                    much similitude. The produce of the farm, and the capture of fish, afforded
                    them, as they do their posterity, the principal means of subsistence; and their
                    traffic with foreign countries made a valuable addition to their domestic
                    comforts. The moral habits of the people were good, though, prior to the
                    introduction of Christianity, in the year 1000, they were blended with
                    superstition and some unnatural customs, such as the exposure of their infants.
                    The putting down of heathenism is not the least remarkable event in the early
                    history of Iceland. Frederic, a bishop of Saxony, was the first who preached
                    Christian doctrines in this distant land. The propagation of his tenets,
                    however, met <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939661" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9661-0143"
                    />with every species of opposition; but the numbers who adopted them gradually
                    increased so considerably, that the national assembly which met at Thingvalla in
                    the year 1000 took the matter into consideration. Whilst the question was warmly
                    debated, the story told is, that a messenger hurried into the assembly and
                    announced that fire had burst from the earth in the southern part of the
                    country, and was carrying destruction before it. The heathen party instantly
                    exclaimed that this was the vengeance of the gods against the presumption of
                    their opponents. But Snorro, who was a zealous advocate for the Christian cause,
                    immediately demanded, “For what reason was the anger of your gods kindled when
                    the very rock was burning on which we stand ?” Thinġvalla being in the midst of
                    a volcanic country, and precipitous cliffs of lava surrounding the place of
                    public assembly. The promptitude of the reply had the desired effect, and
                    ultimately procured a decision in favour of the Christians. On the promulgation
                    of Christianity, all religious contest was suspended; the whole people espoused
                    the new faith; and a church establishment was soon afterwards formed. The
                    Icelanders appear to have equalled the blindest of their fellow Catholics in
                    their attachment to the hierarchy; and it was not till the year 1551 that the
                    Reformation, under Christian III. of Denmark, found its way into the island.
                    Since that period the form and ceremonies of the Icelandic church have been
                    strictly Lutheran, though, from the poverty of the country, their churches are
                    in general extremely wretched, and the pittances allotted to their clergy still
                    more so.</p>
                <p>But to return to earlier periods. We are indebted to the enterprise of the
                    ancient inhabitants of Iceland for the discovery both of Greenland and
                    Newfoundland. A mariner named Eric accidentally approached the former of these
                    countries about the year 972, and was so delighted with his discovery, that he
                    gave it the name which it still bears. His flattering accounts of the country
                    had the desired effect of alluring his countrymen to its shores; and in this he
                    so far succeeded, as in a short time to form an extensive and thriving
                    settlement. The colonists maintained a constant commercial intercourse with
                    Iceland and Norway; and the records of the settlement come down uninterruptedly
                    to the beginning of the fifteenth century, when at once every trace and vestige
                    of it was lost. The causes of this singular fact have never yet been fully
                    ascertained, although the most probable supposition is, that an accumulation of
                    ice took place about this time on the Greenland coast, which prevented the
                    access to it by sea. The breadth of the sea between the two countries does not
                    exceed 100 miles; and yet the fate of this ancient colony, commonly called by
                    distinction Old Greenland, is quite unknown. The northern shores of America were
                    first known from Biono Heriolforn, a native of Iceland, being driven upon them
                    during a voyage to Greenland in 1001. Attracted by the account of this
                    discovery, Leif, another enterprising navigator, pursued the same route
                    considerably farther southwards, and finding an agreeable and pleasant country,
                    he wintered there, giving it, from the circumstance of wild vines growing on it,
                    the appellation of Vinland. This was subsequently, to a partial extent,
                    colonised by the Icelanders; but few particulars are known of their progress,
                    and what ultimately became of the colony is now a mere matter of
                    speculation.</p>
                <p>The independent and happy state of Iceland was not destined to be uninterrupted.
                    About the year 1250, party disputes and internal feuds arose, which the ambition
                    of the mother country enabled Haco, the then king of Norway, to foment. In 1261
                    a formal proposal was consequently made in the national council, to submit to
                    that sceptre; but in doing so, the Icelanders stipulated that they should be
                    allowed to retain their ancient laws and privileges, that they should be exempt
                    from taxes, and that the annual importation of the most necessary articles of
                    foreign produce should be secured to them. For upwards of a century Iceland was
                    under the dominion of Norway, without any occurrence taking place of the
                    slightest importance; and when in the year 1380 that country became subject to
                    Denmark, the island was transferred to the same power, without tumult or
                    opposition. The change in the constitution of the island, from its annexation to
                    a European monarchy, naturally produced a corresponding change in the character
                    and habits of the people. Not that the foreign yoke was a tyrannical one,
                    otherwise a portion at least of the ancient vigour and activity of the
                    inhabitants would have displayed itself in occasional acts of insurrection. On
                    the contrary, the Danish monarchs not only exercised their sway with a lenient
                    and forbearing hand, but paid much attention to the welfare and the wants of
                    this remote part of their dominions; and thus repose and security succeeding to
                    internal broils, produced a state of comparative apathy and indolence. Rank and
                    property became more nearly equalized, and the trade of the country was
                    gradually transferred to the natives of other kingdoms. A plague which
                    devastated the island in 1402, and carried off, it is said, nearly two thirds of
                    the whole population, tended still further to depress the spirit of the people,
                    and destroy the strength and prosperity of the country. The reformation of
                    religion, which, as above stated, took place in Iceland in the year 1551, was
                    the first dawn of an improvement amongst the natives, which the introduction of
                    printing and the establishment of a press about the same period aided greatly in
                    extending. The recent history of Iceland is principally characterised as a
                    record of physical calamities, which, from 1707, when the ravages of the
                    small-pox carried oft' sixteen thousand of its inhabitants, down to 1753 and
                    1759, when the inclemency of the seasons created the most dreadful and
                    distressing famines, and lastly, the memorable year 1783, when the great
                    eruption from the Skaptaa Yokuil took place, have rarely ceased in one form or
                    another to devastate the island.· The scene of this last-mentioned eruption is
                    amongst lofty mountains in the interior of the island, known only to the natives
                    by the remote view of their snow-clad summits. From this desolate and
                    unfrequented region, Sir George Mackenzie remarks, vast torrents of lava issued
                    forth, overwhelming all before them, and filling up the beds of great rivers in
                    their progress towards the sea. For more than a year, a dense cloud of smoke and
                    volcanic ashes covered the whole of Iceland, extending its effects even to the
                    northern parts of continental Europe; the cattle, sheep, and horses of the
                    country were destroyed; a famine, with its attendant distresses, broke out
                    amongst the inhabitants; and the small-pox invaded the island at the same time,
                    with its former virulent and fatal effects. From these combined causes, more
                    than eleven thousand people perished during the period of a few years; an extent
                    of calamity which can only be understood, by considering that this number forms
                    nearly a fourth part of the whole population of the country. The destruction of
                    the fishery upon the southern coasts of the island by these volcanic eruptions
                    was another more permanent source of distress, and one which is not even now
                    fully removed.</p>
                <p>The government of Iceland is committed to an officer appointed by the crown of
                    Denmark, who is occasionally a native of the island, but more frequently a Dane
                    by birth. This supreme magistrate has the title of Stiftamt-man, and is
                    intrusted with a general superintendence of every department. Under him are the
                    amtmen or provincial governors, each of whom rules one of the four provinces of
                    the island, and possesses a similar jurisdiction <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939674" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9674-0144"/>over his respective quarter,
                    as his superior officer does over the whole island. Each province again is
                    divided into syssels or shires, over which the sysselmen preside. This office is
                    likewise in the appointment of the crown; and, on account of its importance, it
                    is always given to one of the most respectable landed proprietors within the
                    district. The rank of sysselman corresponds in some degree to that of sheriff in
                    this country. The hreppstiore is a subordinate parochial officer, whose duty it
                    is to attend to the condition of the poor, and to assist the sysselman in the
                    preservation of the peace. He is usually chosen from among the farmers; whilst
                    the forlikunarmen are those appointed as arbiters for the decision of disputes
                    among the parishioners. The laws of Iceland, like the general form of government
                    as established nearly six hundred years ago, have undergone little important
                    alteration; but the judicial changes have been more considerable, and the forms
                    of justice in most respects now resemble those of Denmark.</p>
                <p>Crimes are rare; the gentle and peaceable disposition of the natives, their moral
                    and religious education and sober habits, act as preventives of such as are of a
                    flagrant description. Small thefts, especially of sheep, are the most frequent;
                    but the high court has seldom to decide more than six or eight cases annually.
                    The whip is the only punishment applied in the country, excepting fines; those
                    who are punished with hard labour or banishment being sent to Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>There are about 194 parishes or livings on the island; but the clergy number at
                    least 300, as many of the parishes have two churches, the great distance and the
                    danger of travelling, particularly in winter, when the rugged fields of lava are
                    covered with snow, making it frequently impossible for all the peasantry of the
                    same parish to attend at one church. The clergy are partly supported by a
                    species of tithes, which are mostly paid in kind. These stipends, however, are
                    extremely miserable; the largest in the island not exceeding 185 dollars, and
                    the average being little above 35 dollars, or L.6 sterling, per annum. They must
                    therefore depend almost entirely for subsistence on their glebe land and their
                    stock of cattle, and a small pittance they are entitled to for the few baptisms,
                    marriages, and funerals that occur among their parishioners. “The clergy,”
                    observes Mr Barrow, “almost universally submit to every species of drudgery from
                    necessity. Their incomes are too small to allow them to hire and feed labourers;
                    and nothing is more common than to find the parish priest in a coarse woollen
                    jacket and trousers, or skin boots, digging peat, mowing grass, and assisting in
                    all the operations of haymaking. They are all blacksmiths also from necessity,
                    and the best shoers of horses on the island. The feet of an Iceland horse would
                    be cut to pieces over the sharp rock and lava if not well shod. The great resort
                    of the peasantry is the church; and should any of the numerous horses have lost
                    a shoe, or be likely to do so, the priest puts on his apron, lights his little
                    charcoal fire in his smithy (one of which is always attached to every
                    parsonage), and sets the animal on his legs again.” Their poverty was quaintly
                    but very contentedly alluded to by one of themselves, when he said, in a few
                    lines he composed on occasion of Mr Henderson’s visit to his mansion :—“Ever
                    since I came into the world I have been wedded to poverty, who has now hugged me
                    to her bosom these seventy winters all but two; and whether we shall ever be
                    separated here below, is only known to Him who joined us together.”</p>
                <p>The clergyman of the parish having thus to undergo the same toils and hardships
                    as the most humble of his flock, and enjoying no superior comforts or
                    refinements, must feel that it is by his intellectual attainments only he çan
                    retain that station, and command that respect from his parishioners, which it is
                    so necessary for him to possess. Literary pursuits are therefore the principal
                    occupation of the clergy during the long and dreary period of winter; and it is
                    astonishing, considering the difficulties in their way, the progress most of
                    them have made. The history and literature of the more refined nations of Europe
                    now form a part of their studies. The English language, in which they find so
                    many words of their own, and so many borrowed from the Latin, is cultivated by
                    many of the clergy. The German they find still more easy; the Danish and
                    Norwegian languages approximate to their own; and many of the choicest works in
                    all these dialects have been translated into Icelandic. The present state of
                    literature in Iceland thus appears to be of a different description from what it
                    was in ancient times. Its supposed decline is the subject of general complaint,
                    though in point of fact it has only changed its character from the'heroic and
                    romantic to the useful and intelligible. Von Troil, in comparing the state of
                    the sciences in the island to the four stages of human life, remarks that “their
                    infancy extended to the year 1056, when the introduction of the Christian
                    religion produced the first dawn of light. They were in their youth till 1110,
                    when schools were first established, and the education and instruction of youth
                    began to be more attended to. Their manly age lasted till about the middle of
                    the fourteenth century, when Iceland produced the greatest number of learned
                    men. Old age appeared towards the end of this same fourteenth century, when the
                    sciences gradually decreased, and were almost entirely extinct, no work of any
                    merit appearing. History now drooped her head, poetry had no relish, and all
                    other sciences were enveloped in darkness.” But a new dawn of knowledge spread
                    rapidly over the island after the Reformation; and the introduction of the
                    printing press produced the same beneficial effects in Iceland as in other parts
                    of Europe. A very important change took place in the nature of the studies
                    pursued; and the clergy in particular, instead of occupying their time in making
                    and transcribing <hi rend="italic">eddas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sagas,</hi>
                    that is, political and historical romances, have turned their attention to sober
                    history, to the collection and registration of events, and to other literary
                    productions of more intrinsic value, which the printing press, still actively
                    employed on the small island of Vidoe, opposite Reikiavik, affords them the
                    opportunity of turning to account.</p>
                <p>There are no public hospitals, or charitable institutions of that description, on
                    the island; the sick and the poor being almost wholly supported by their own
                    families. Indeed a sort of disgrace attaches to those who send them away to be
                    taken care of by strangers, even though maintained at their own expense. On the
                    other hand, there is an important collegiate school at Bessestad, which may well
                    be considered as the only public institution of importance in the country. It is
                    intended principally for the education of young men destined for the church, and
                    is attended by about forty scholars. There are three masters, the one, professor
                    of theology, instructs the pupils in Hebrew and Greek, as far as the Greek
                    Testament, and Xenophon; the second, who is the lecturer, teaches them Latin,
                    history, mathematics, and arithmetic; and the third the Danish, Norwegian,
                    German, and Icelandic languages. Their attendance is constant from October to
                    May, the intermediate months being the period of vacation, when the students go
                    to their several homes. The funds appropriated for this excellent institution
                    are said to be sufficient to pay the teachers, and to afford board, books, and
                    clothing to the scholars gratis.</p>
                <p>Property is held either of the crown or in fee simple; the crown lands and many
                    others are let to farmers, on what may almost be called perpetual leases. The
                    rent is paid in two parts; the land rent, fixed at an old valu»- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939687" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9687-0145"/>tion, which it has not been
                    found necessary to alter, and a rent for the number of cattle which it is
                    calculated the farm is able to support; and these are transferred from one
                    tenant to another, each succeeding one taking them, and leaving a similar number
                    on quitting the farm. This, however, does not prevent a farmer keeping as much
                    stock as he can maintain, without paying an additional rent. The tenant is for
                    life, provided he does not injure the farm; but he may quit whenever he pleases,
                    on giving six months’ notice. His rent is generally paid in produce, on the
                    coast in fish, in the interior in wool, tallow, butter, sheep, &amp;c. or,
                    according to agreement, in money. Individuals who cultivate their own
                    properties, and tenants who are in easy circumstances, generally employ one or
                    more labourers, who, besides board and lodging, have from ten to twelve dollars
                    of annual wages. In Iceland, as in Norway, there is no such thing as entailed
                    property, and the law of descent excludes primogeniture. If an individual dies
                    intestate, his estate is sold or valued, and divided amongst the children, so as
                    to give equal shares to the sons, and half shares to the daughters. If, however,
                    any of the brothers can pay the shares to his brothers and sisters, it is
                    generally arranged that the freehold estate be made over to him, in order to
                    retain it in the family.</p>
                <p>The gross population of Iceland is about 53,000, a very scanty proportion for an
                    island whose surface is to that of Ireland as four to five; but that surface, it
                    is true, from its nature, and the character of the climate, is perhaps as
                    unfavourable as any which exists between the limits of the two arctic circles.
                    Deducting the areas of the numerous fiords with which it is intersected, the
                    square contents of the land may be calculated at 37,388 statute miles; but as
                    the centre of the island consists entirely of snowy and uninhabited mountains,
                    the peopled portion cannot be considered more than 25,000 square miles; and the
                    population therefore will not much exceed two persons on each square mile. The
                    number of births in the year 1832 was 2516; and the number of deaths during the
                    same year amounted to 1390, of which 784, considerably more than one half, were
                    children under ten years of age. The whole population is employed either in
                    farming, which occupies about three fourths of them,' or in fishing. Other
                    employments do not exist, nor is there any other class of people or townsmen,
                    save the small number of merchants in Reikiavik and the other trading
                    establishments. Every branch of industry is therefore domestic, and confined
                    chiefly to articles of clothing, such as coarse cloth, gloves, mittens, and
                    stockings. The peasantry are generally ingenious, and manufacture such simple
                    pieces of furniture as their cottages require; some also aspire to make trinkets
                    of silver, and articles from the walrus tusks. The trade of Iceland has never
                    been managed in a way to be of important benefit to its inhabitants, those who
                    are engaged in it being almost exclusively Danes, and other foreigners. Of late
                    years, however, there has been an annual export of from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000
                    pounds of raw wool, besides about 200,000 pairs of knitted stockings, and
                    300,000 mittens, or gloves without fingers. The Iceland sheep have remarkably
                    fine fleeces of wool, which the farmers in the spring of the year take oft’
                    whole; their weight being usually from four to five pounds. The other exports of
                    Iceland are dried fish, salted cod, and other species, for the quality of which
                    the fishing banks of the island are celebrated, but which latterlyjiave been
                    much invaded by the French and Dutch fishermen, to the great grievance of the
                    nation. Fish-oil, whale-blubber, skins, eider-down, feathers, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lichen Islandicus</hi> for medicinal purposes, may also be
                    included amongst their list of exports. These the natives dispose of to the
                    Danish merchants in exchange for coffee, sugar, tobacco, snuff, a small quantity
                    of brandy, rye and rye-bread, biscuit, wheaten flour, salt, soap, and such other
                    small articles as are in constant use for domestic purposes. Those who can
                    afford it purchase a supply of linens and cottons, which of late years have
                    become of more common use, and which must tend greatly to cleanliness, and the
                    prevention of those diseases which woollen clothing worn next the skin tends to
                    engender. The traffic thus occasioned takes place in the early part of summer,
                    and whilst it lasts creates a kind of fair, with no little bustle and business,
                    in the capital. All the articles brought from the interior for sale at the
                    sea-ports, and all those taken back for winter consumption, are transported on
                    pack-horses. There is not, in fact, in all Iceland such a machine as a
                    wheel-carriage; and indeed if there were, they would be useless, as there is
                    nothing in the shape of a road on which they could move.</p>
                <p>The Icelanders are generally middle sized and well made, though not very strong.
                    Their manners are exceedingly simple, and they are very respectful as well as
                    obliging to strangers. Though their poverty disables them from imitating the
                    hospitality of their ancestors in all respects, yet they cheerfully give away
                    the little they have to spare, and express the utmost satisfaction if the gift
                    shall have proved acceptable. They possess but few peculiar customs, and those
                    not of particular interest. Their sole occupation during summer is to provide
                    means of subsistence for the winter season; and when confined during the
                    dreariness of an arctic winter to their huts, their great source of amusement is
                    the tales of olden times, when the learning of their country rendered it
                    renowned in every quarter of Europe. “Being of quiet and harmless dispositions,”
                    says Sir George Mackenzie, “having nothing to rouse them into a state of
                    activity, nothing to inspire emulation, no object of ambition, the Icelanders
                    may be said merely to live. But they possess innate good qualities, which,
                    independently of the consciousness of their former importance, have preserved
                    their general character as an amiable community. They have indeed become
                    negligent with respect to the cleanliness of their persons and dwellings, but
                    they deserve a high place in the scale of morality and religion. To religious
                    duties they are strictly attentive; and though the clergy are not generally
                    raised above the level of the peasantry in any respect but in their sacred
                    office, yet they have been able to preserve the regard due to those who are
                    considered as peculiarly the servants of the Supreme Being.” The poor Icelander,
                    too, is strongly attached to his native soil, and, like the Swiss, has been
                    known to throw up lucrative appointments which he held elsewhere, for the sake
                    of rejoining his family and friends on the island, being never so happy as when
                    he sees a prospect of returning to it.</p>
                <p>Few countries in the world present a more forbidding aspect, or have less
                    apparently to invite the approach either of the traveller or the merchant, than
                    Iceland. The appellation given it by its first discoverers seems still
                    peculiarly its own; and if the statement be accurate, of its having in former
                    days grown considerable forests, whilst now scarce a shrub will rear its head,
                    there is little probability of that name ever being belied. “Imagine to
                    yourself,” says Von Troil, “a country which, from one end to the other, presents
                    to your view only barren mountains, whose summits are covered with eternal snow,
                    and between them fields divided by vitrified cliffs, whose high and sharp points
                    seem to vie with each other to deprive you of the sight of a little grass, which
                    scantily springs up among them. These same dreary rocks likewise conceal the few
                    scattered habitations of the natives, and nowhere a single tree appears which
                    might afford shelter to friendship and innocence. The prospect before us, though
                    not pleasing, was uncommon and surprising. Whatever presented itself to our view
                    bore the marks of devastation; and our eyes, accustomed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939700" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9700-0146"/> to behold the pleasing
                    coasts of England, now saw nothing but the vestiges of the operation of a fire,
                    Heaven knows how ancient.” Nor does Reikiavik, the capital of the country, the
                    residence of the governor, the centre of its trade, present a much more inviting
                    prospect to a stranger on his arrival, “He perceives,” says Mr Barrow, “only a
                    long row of houses, or rather the upper parts of houses, running parallel to and
                    close behind a rising beach of a black shingle, their red or brown roofs being
                    the most conspicuous, and the tops of the doors only, and perhaps about half of
                    a row of windows, peeping above the said beach; but he sees enough of them to
                    satisfy himself that they are of a low, mean character. On each extremity of
                    this line of houses he will observe a rising eminence, scarcely deserving the
                    name of a hill, on which he will perceive a number of sod or turf huts, raised a
                    little, and but a little, above the level of the ground; their roofs, and
                    generally their sides too, verdant enough and well clothed with grass, the
                    abodes chiefly of fishermen, labourers in the merchants’ employ, and idlers, of
                    which there are not a few sauntering about. Among these hovels, or rather above
                    them, on the western eminence, stands conspicuously the house of the
                    physician-general of Iceland, or perhaps more properly surgeon and apothecary of
                    Reikiavik; for he acts in all these capacities; which tall building, speaking
                    comparatively with its neighbours, is kept in countenance by a still taller one,
                    the only windmill on the island.” “The lower part of their turf huts is built of
                    rude stones to the height of about four feet, and between each row layers of
                    turf are placed with great regularity, to serve instead of mortar, and in fact
                    to keep out the wind. A roof of such wood as can be procured rests upon these
                    walls, and is covered with turf or sods. A window is a luxury; a cask or barrel,
                    with the two ends knocked out, answers the purpose of a chimney; but the smoke
                    is frequently allowed to escape through a hole in the roof. The only fire ever
                    burnt within their walls is that of the kitchen, which forms a small separate
                    apartment, frequently detached.”</p>
                <p>The surface of the country is for the most part highly mountainous and rugged;
                    some of the yokuls or snowcapped eminences, as the Snaefeil, the Skaptaa, Kateja
                    Torsa, and Hecla, rising to the height of from 4000 to 6000 feet above the sea.
                    The centre of the island, however, is traversed by considerable plains, some of
                    which are covered with tolerable pasture, whilst others form extensive wastes,
                    morasses, and fields of lava. It is also watered by a number of large rivers,
                    which, from the rapid melting of the snows in summer, present a turbid, and some
                    of them so white an appearance, that they are denominated from that
                    circumstance. The smaller streams which rise in the lower grounds are however
                    transparent, and are celebrated for the abundance and beauty of the salmon which
                    frequent them. There are also a number of lakes, of which the principal are
                    called Thingvalla Vatn, an expanse of water from ten to fifteen miles in length,
                    and six to eight in width, on whose banks the great assemblies of the nation
                    used to be held; My Vatn, in the north-eastern extremity of the island; and
                    Fiske Vatn, a lake so designated from the fine fish it affords to the
                    inhabitants of the midland districts.</p>
                <p>The coast, like that of Norway, is in every direction deeply indented with creeks
                    and arms of the sea; few of them, however, afford safe anchorage; and along the
                    southern coast, eastward from where the great river Elvas empties itself into
                    the sea, there are extensive shoals, formed partly, no doubt, by the depositions
                    of the rivers proceeding from the great range of yokuls to the eastward of Mount
                    Hecla, but principally from the remains of volcanoes, which, like the Sabrina
                    and Graham Islands, have at one period appeared above the surface, but from the
                    action of the waves have subsequently sunk below it.</p>
                <p>It is extremely probable that Iceland owes its origin to some great convulsion of
                    nature; for no part of the globe presents such a number of volcanic mountains,
                    so many boiling springs, or such immense tracks of lava. The frequent and
                    long-continued eruptions of its volcanoes are all on record in the historical
                    annals of the island; their number since the year 1004 is stated at sixty-five.
                    Of Hecla no less than sixteen great eruptions are mentioned; but, with the
                    exception of that in 1818, this celebrated mountain has been in a quiescent
                    state since the middle of last century. By far the most dreadful occurrence of
                    this description was that already mentioned, which took place from the great
                    range of the Skaptaafell Yokul in the year 1783; an eruption which devastated
                    the finest portion of the island, and produced famine and disease amongst its
                    inhabitants to an extent scarcely credible.</p>
                <p>The boiling springs of Iceland have long attracted the attention of scientific
                    men, and they are assuredly amongst the most curious and most remarkable
                    phenomena which it presents. These are very numerous in many quarters of the
                    island; but it is to the fountains termed the Geysers that we would now
                    particularly allude. These extraordinary springs are situated in the western
                    part of the island, in a small plain sixteen miles north of the village of
                    Skalholt. The siliceous depositions of the waters of the Great Geyser have
                    formed for it a basin about fifty-six feet in the greatest diameter, and
                    fifty-two in the narrowest, a projection from one side causing the circumference
                    to deviate from a perfect circle. A mound has thus been produced, which rises
                    considerably above the surface of the plain, and slopes on all sides to the
                    distance of a hundred feet or thereabouts, from the borders of the basin on its
                    summit. The basin is from four to five feet deep, and slopes a little, like a
                    saucer, towards the centre. At this point there is a cylindrical pipe or tube,
                    about twelve feet in diameter and seventy feet deep, up which the boiling water
                    rises and the eruptions burst forth. At intervals of some hours, when the basin
                    is full, explosions are heard from below like the distant firing of cannon, and
                    at the same time a tremulous motion of the ground is felt around the basin. “We
                    observed,” remarks Sir John Stanley, “the water in the basin to be much
                    agitated; it boiled violently, and heaved as if some expansive power were
                    labouring beneath its weight, and some of it was thrown up a few feet above the
                    basin. Again there were two or three shocks of the ground, and a repetition of
                    the same noise. In an instant the surrounding atmosphere was filled with volumes
                    of steam rolling over each other as they ascended, in a manner inexpressibly
                    beautiful, and through which columns of water shivering into foam darted in
                    rapid succession to heights which at the time we were little qualified to
                    estimate, but afterwards ascertained by means of a quadrant to be about
                    ninety-six feet. At last, the water having filled the basin, it rolled in great
                    waves over its ed e, and forming numerous rills, made its way down the sides of
                    the mound. Much was lost in vapour also, and still more fell to the ground in
                    heavy showers of spray. The intervals at which the several jets succeeded each
                    other were too short for the eye to distinguish. As they rose out of the basin,
                    they reflected by their density the purest and most brilliant blue. In certain
                    shades the colour was green, like that of the sea; but in their farther ascent
                    all distinction of colour was lost, and the jets, broken into a thousand parts,
                    appeared white as snow. Several of them were forced upwards perpendicularly; but
                    many, receiving a slight inclination as they burst from the basin, were
                    projected in beautiful curves, and the spray which fell from them, caught by a
                    succeeding jet, was hurried away still higher than it had been perhaps before.
                    The jets were made with inconceivable velocity, and those which escaped
                    uninterrupted terminated <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9713-0147"/>in sharp points, and lost themselves in the air.”
                    After continuing for some minutes, the explosions cease, when the pipe and basin
                    are both found empty.</p>
                <p>Such are the phenomena presented during an eruption of the Great Geyser. In
                    external appearance, as well as in the magnitude and violence of its ejections,
                    this Geyser differs materially from the other two principal springs in its
                    vicinity. Indeed, although it has been satisfactorily ascertained from
                    historical records that they have been playing for the last six hundred years,
                    yet very material changes are evidently taking place from time to time amongst
                    them. One which Sir George Mackenzie mentions as being particularly active when
                    he visited the island in 1809, and whose eruption Sir John Stanley describes as
                    incessant, is now, by Mr Barrow’s account, extinct; and the surface of the
                    neighbourhood has been so totally altered, that it is with difficulty the
                    accounts of recent travellers can be made to coincide with those at the
                    commencement of the century. It is admitted, however, that the phenomena they
                    all exhibit are occasioned by the production and confinement of steam in
                    cavities, so formed, that when the accumulation arrives at a certain point, the
                    pressure of the water opposing its escape is overcome, and the water is thrown
                    out before it. The siliceous incrustations which are formed around the brim of
                    the basin, and along the edge of the streamlets running out of it, are not the
                    least remarkable productions of the Geyser. They consist of little tufts or
                    knobs, grouped in such a manner as to bear a resemblance to the heads of
                    cauliflowers; of so delicate a texture, however, that it is almost impossible to
                    remove them in a perfect state. This deposit is principally formed from the
                    condensed steam or vapour. The sides of the tube and the bottom of the basin, on
                    the contrary, are, doubtless from the constant friction of the water, perfectly
                    smooth, and as hard as agate.</p>
                <p>Another very remarkable hot spring is the mud volcano of Reykialid, near Myvatn,
                    towards the north-eastern extremity of the island. This occupies the crater of
                    Mount Krabla, one of the principal volcanoes of Iceland, and is thus described
                    by Henderson, who made the circuit of the island during the year 1815. “At the
                    bottom of a deep gulley lay a circular pool of black liquid matter, at least
                    three hundred feet in circumference, from the middle of which a vast column of
                    the same black liquid was erupted with a loud thundering noise. This column is
                    equal in diameter to that ejected by the Great Geyser at its strongest
                    eruptions. The height of the jets varies greatly, rising on the first
                    propulsions of the liquid to about twelve feet, and continuing to ascend, as it
                    were, by leaps, till they gain the highest elevation, which is upwards of thirty
                    feet, when they again abate much more rapidly than they rise; and after the
                    spouting ceases, the situation of the aperture is rendered visible only by a
                    gentle ebullition, which distinguishes it from the general surface of the pool;
                    the eruptions take place every five minutes, and last about two minutes and a
                    half.” In the same vicinity are the hot springs of Husavik, which, though they
                    bear no comparison in magnificence to those of Skalholt, are extremely
                    interesting in many respects. The pipe of one of them, the Oxalwer, which is
                    said to have derived its name from the circumstance of an ox having fallen into
                    it, is about eight feet in diameter, is surrounded with a strongly incrusted
                    brim, and shortly below the surface trends to one side, and becomes quite
                    irregular. Its jets rarely exceed twenty feet in height, but, according to
                    Henderson’s account, they are conducted with the utmost regularity in point of
                    time. It was amongst the beautiful incrustations formed around the basin of this
                    spring that Mr Rose of Edinburgh, during his mineralogical excursion a few years
                    ago, observed that variety of apophyllite, to which the synonyme of Oxalwerite
                    was subsequently applied.</p>
                <p>Though it cannot be denied that these springs have some communication with the
                    volcanoes which abound in the island, yet it is a remarkable fact that they are
                    seldom found very near them, although dispersed throughout the whole country.
                    They possess unequal degrees of heat, ranging from 188° to 212°, and are
                    generally devoid either of taste or smell, although the flavour of sulphur is
                    occasionally perceptible. When their situation suits, they are turned to good
                    account by the inhabitants, both as bathing quarters, and for various culinary
                    purposes, in boiling fish, evaporating sea-water, and the like. At Reikholt
                    there is a celebrated bath of this description, which was constructed six
                    hundred years ago by the famous Snorro Sturleson. It is fourteen feet in
                    diameter and six feet deep, being supplied, by means of covered conduits, both
                    with hot and cold water, from springs about a hundred yards distant, so that any
                    desired temperature might be obtained.</p>
                <p>The contents of the Geyser water Dr Black ascertained to be, in 10,000 grains, or

                <p>Though Iceland has been visited at different periods by several scientific men,
                    little is comparatively known either of its geology or its mineralogy. To Sir
                    George Mackenzie the world is indebted for a pretty minute description of the
                    mineral products of the south-western portion of the island;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Museum of the Royal
                    Society of Edinburgh is enriched by an extremely interest-ing suite of minerals,
                    collected by Sir George Mackenzie in this part of Iceland, and presented by him
                    to the Society.</p></note> but of the east coast, which has long been celebrated
                    for its magnificent zeolites and splendid calcedonies, little has as yet been
                    made public. The island, from one extremity to the other, exhibits undoubted
                    demonstrations of volcanic origin; immense tracks of lava, extensive beds of
                    tuff, basaltic columns, greenstone, and amygdaloid, appear in succession at
                    every step. The surfaces of some of the lavas which Sir George Mackenzie
                    observed in Iceland he describes as not unlike coils of ropes or crumpled cloth;
                    in other respects they appear to resemble the lavas of recent volcanoes
                    elsewhere, being, like those of Aetna, thrown up into large flattened masses.
                    These, it is well known, are produced by the formation of a crust on the lava
                    during its course, which, as it accumulates, breaks through the hardened
                    surface; and thus, when it cools, leaves a wide extended plain of the most
                    ruggedand impassable description. In some places the surface has swelled during
                    the course of the lava into knobs, from a few feet in diameter to forty or
                    fifty, many of which have burst, and disclose caverns lined with melted matter
                    in the form of stalactites. Of these some remarkable instances are mentioned
                    amongst the extremely rugged lava of Buderstad, in the vicinity of the Snaefell
                    Yokul, where several of the caverns extend to the depth of forty yards. Stappen
                    <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> in the same part of the island, presents, for the
                    extent of about two miles, the most striking columnar appearances, both in the
                    cliffs which form the shore, and in the numerous insulated rocks which appear at
                    different distances from the land. In general, the ranges of columns assume a
                    vertical position, and an elevation of about fifty feet; but in some places <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192939726" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9726-0148"/> they are disposed
                    indiscriminately upon one another in bundles, and in several instances appear
                    diverging from a centre. Sir John Stanley describes a cavern on this coast which
                    his party rowed into, as more curious even than the cave at Staffa; the columns,
                    which were very lofty, diverging considerably from the roof towards the base.
                    Frequently these columnar basalts are associated with or imbedded in tuffa, a
                    volcanic production of the most universal occurrence. “Lava and tuffa,” says Sir
                    George Mackenzie, “are sure indications of each other. The mountains of the
                    Guldbringé GysSel are almost entirely composed of tuffa. The hills round Mount
                    Hecla, near the Snaefell Yokul, and in the neighbourhood of every lava I met
                    with, consist of that substance; in fact, it appears to be the predominant
                    rock.” Amygdaloid forms the larger portion of the eastern extremity of the
                    island, and it is imbedded in this that those splendid specimens of calcareous
                    spar <hi rend="italic">par excéllence</hi> denominated Iceland-spar are found.
                    This rock is likewise the matrix of all the different varieties of the zeolite
                    tribe, of the magnificent calcedonies, and in fact of most of the fine minerals
                    which have long rendered Iceland so celebrated a locality among collectors.
                    Fossilized wood is found in several places; that variety termed Surturbrand is
                    peculiar to the north-eastern volcanic district. It is remarkable that the
                    specimens hitherto brought home of this last substance appear to be oak. It
                    burns with flame, and can be cut and shaped like jet; but from its brittleness
                    does not admit of being sliced into shavings. Pumice, obsidian, and other
                    volcanic minerals appear in great beauty in many districts of the island,
                    particularly near Hecla, and to the north of Krabla.</p>
                <p>There is little remarkable in the zoology of Iceland. The only wild animals are
                    foxes, which in some parts of it are very numerous, and do much damage to the
                    farmers in destroying their lambs and other produce. Rein-deer were introduced
                    from Sweden about the middle of last century, and have since increased and run
                    wild. The Iceland horse is small, but hardy, active, and capable of sustaining
                    considerable fatigue. Dogs and cats they have in abundance, and rats and mice
                    are proportionally numerous. The floating ice occasionally transports a polar
                    bear or two from the Greenland coasts during spring, which, however, are no
                    sooner heard of than the neighbouring country are up in arms to kill them, and
                    they are consequently hunted down and destroyed without mercy. The skins of the
                    foxes, particularly those of the blue species, are valued as an article of
                    commerce.</p>
                <p>Amongst the land-birds of the island are the sea-eagle or erne, a very
                    destructive bird among the eider-ducks; the falcon, which used formerly to be a
                    valuable item in the exports of the island; and the raven, which is a larger and
                    more powerful bird than those of Britain, frequently pouncing upon and carrying
                    off young lambs, and destroying poultry; it is met with in great numbers,
                    particularly on the cliffs near the sea-coast. The ptarmigan, snipe, golden
                    plover, wagtail, and curlew, are well known. Waterfowl of every description,
                    common to northern latitudes, are met with on the coasts and in the lakes. Of
                    these the most valuable to the inhabitants is the eider-duck, which is strictly
                    preserved, a penalty of half a dollar being exigible for shooting one of these
                    birds. From this circumstance they become so remarkably tame, especially in the
                    breeding season, that they frequently make their nests close to the houses, and
                    in spots which have been prepared by ridges of stones artificially built up for
                    them; and in such places, during the process of incubation, it is not unusual
                    for the female to remain on the nest, and suffer herself to be fondled. The
                    lining of their nests, being the downy substance plucked off their own breasts,
                    is taken away, even a second and third time, until the poor bird has plucked
                    herself nearly naked. Their eggs, too, are removed once or twice, and are eaten
                    in the same manner as plovers’ eggs. Swans are very numerous in some of the
                    lakes of the central part of the island, where they remain unmolested until the
                    ice sets in, when they betake themselves to the sea-shore. The eggs, the
                    feathers, and the down of this fine bird, like those of the eider-duck, supply
                    the peasantry with an article of food, and also of commerce.</p>
                <p>The vegetable productions of the island, as already stated, are the reverse of
                    luxuriant. With the exception of a few stunted birch, rarely above six feet
                    high, and some dwarf willows, in the southern and eastern districts, nothing in
                    the shape of a tree occurs; and, even in the sheltered situations afforded by
                    the gardens surrounding the merchants’ houses near Reikiavik, all attempts to
                    raise the most common culinary vegetables occasionally fail. Even in good years,
                    Dr Hooker remarks that in many of these little enclosures the cabbages were so
                    languid and small that a half-crown piece would have covered the whole of the
                    plant. It is a curious fact, however, that timber has in former periods grown in
                    more abundance, as is evident from the logs so frequently met with in the
                    morasses and peat-bogs of the country. These the peasants are in the habit of
                    extracting and using for firewood. The Surturbrand, already mentioned, has
                    nothing to do with the antediluvian state of the island.</p>
                <p>The scanty produce of the land is, however, to a great degree compensated for by
                    the abundance of fine fish which occurs on the coast. In several parts of the
                    island, particularly on the north and north-west, the shark fishery is a regular
                    occupation. Strong hooks fastened to chains arc baited and anchored a little way
                    out to sea, and the fish when caught are thus towed to shore. Of the skin shoes
                    are made, a considerable quantity of oil is extracted, and some parts of the
                    flesh are occasionally smoked and used by the natives for food. The cod is very
                    plentiful; the haddock grows to a large size; ling, skate, flounders, and
                    halibut arc likewise very common; the herring, too, frequents the fiords in vast
                    shoals, but this branch of the fishery has hitherto been little attended to. The
                    salmon in the rivers are said to be very fine, and no country in the world
                    produces them in greater quantity. Seals are particularly numerous on the shores
                    of the Breide-fiord and the western coast.</p>
                <p>Such is a rapid sketch of the most remarkable features of Iceland. The ardour,
                    however, with which the sciences of natural history and geology are now pursued
                    in Britain, coupled with the increasing facility every year afforded by means of
                    steam navigation, will no doubt, in the course of a very few summers, present us
                    with more minute and more accurate information respecting the truly
                    extraordinary natural productions of this wild but wonderful island.</p>
