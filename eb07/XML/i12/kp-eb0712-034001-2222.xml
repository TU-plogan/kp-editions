                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Ionian Islands formerly constituted a small part of
                    the Venetian dominions; and, by a fate somewhat singular, they were raised to
                    the rank of an independent power without any efforts of their own, at the very
                    period which witnessed the extinction of Venice itself, with Genoa, Ragusa, and
                    many other small states which had existed for ages. These islands, which are
                    seven in number, exclusively of some small dependent islets, are situated on the
                    western and southern shores of Greece, between 36° and 40° of north latitude,
                    and between 19° 40' and 23° 10′ of east longitude. Four of them lie in a group
                    opposite the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth; two others, Corfu and Paxo, are
                    situated about eighty miles north-west of this central group, from which Cerigo,
                    the remaining island, is distant about 150 miles south-east. The subjoined table
                    gives a view of their extent and population; but the measurements can only be
                    considered as approximations, as, we believe, no accurate map of all the islands
                    has ever been published.</p>

                <p>According to this table, these islands contain about 150 persons to each square
                    mile, a density of population nearly equal to that of the most populous
                    countries of Europe, and very remarkable, considering how a great proportion of
                    their surface is too rugged to admit of any species of cultivation.</p>
                <p>The climate of the Ionian Islands resembles that of the continent of Greece,
                    except that the surrounding seas temper in a greater degree the extremes of heat
                    and cold, and render the atmosphere more humid. Snow often falls during the
                    winter, and lies on the high grounds, but very rarely in the plains. The winter
                    rains sometimes bring with them great quantities of a reddish sand, which the
                    people think has been transported from Africa by the south wind. Sudden and
                    furious squalls are frequent, and the Sirocco, or hot wind, which occurs at
                    certain periods, produces the usual effects, a dull headach, lassitude, and a
                    sense of oppression. The harvest, which is generally in May on the continent, is
                    here in June. Earthquakes are very frequent, though not often very destructive.
                    In Zante, two or three sometimes occur in a month; it is observed that they are
                    preceded by a peculiar state of the atmosphere, producing a feeling of
                    heaviness, or a sulphurous smell, and that they are generally followed by rain.
                    Malaria prevails in low situations in the autumnal months; and the itch, which
                    is common in some parts, instead of being eradicated by medical means, is rather
                    cherished by the people, from a strange notion that it is a preservative against
                    malaria. In other respects the climate is agreeable and healthy, and instances
                    of remarkable longevity are known.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The rocks of all these islands belong to the same great calcareous formation
                    which occupies the continent of Greece. They contain some, though very few,
                    organic remains, and are disposed in highly inclined strata. The limestone,
                    which is accompanied occasionally with beds of gray foliated gypsum, and with
                    beds or masses of sandstone, is conjectured by Dr Holland to belong to the first
                    floetz limestone of Werner. At one spot, ten miles south of the town of Zante,
                    are found a number of pitch wells, agreeing in their situation and appearance
                    with the description given by Herodotus two thousand four hundred years ago.
                    They consist of small pools of water, fed by springs, in a marshy tract near the
                    shore, having their sides and bottoms lined with petroleum in a viscid state,
                    which, by agitation, is raised to the surface in flakes. It.is collected once a
                    yea’, and the produce is about a hundred barrels.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Holland, chap. i. and ii.</p></note></p>
                <p>The surface of all these islands is so remarkably mountainous, that they do not
                    contain a quantity of arable land nearly sufficient to afford corn to the
                    population; and were it not that the vine, the olive, and the currant, enable
                    them to extract a valuable produce from their rocks and declivities, they could
                    support but a very small number of inhabitants. There is a considerable
                    diversity, however, in the aspect and qualities of the surface of the different
                    islands, which renders it necessary to speak of their topography separately. To
                    begin with Corfu, the most northern, and the seat of the general government.
                    This island, which is about forty English miles long, and fifteen in extreme
                    breadth, lies opposite the coast of Albania, from which it is separated at one
                    .point by a strait two miles broad. A range of mountains occupies the centre of
                    this island, the highest summits of which, Mount Kassopo, must be nearly 4000
                    feet high, since the coast of Italy, at eighty miles distance, is visible from
                    it. The island is rather bare of wood, and not abundant in good pasturage. Wheat
                    is raised in some low situations near the coast; but though called “fruitful
                    Corcyra” by Dionysius, and celebrated for its riches by other ancient authors,
                    its inhabitants depend<pb break="no" facs="nls:192942235"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-2235-0341"/> chiefly on importation for corn, which they
                    procure in exchange for their wine, oil, and salt. The capital, also named
                    Corfu, which lies on the east side of the island, contains about 15,000
                    inhabitants, and is a pretty strong place. This island is the Phaeacia of Homer.
                    A small bay, five or six miles south of the capital, is conceived to be the
                    Alcinus Portus, where Ulysses, after his shipwreck, met with the daughter of
                    Alcinous; and Fano, a small rocky islet seven or eight miles in circumference,
                    lying twelve miles off the north-west coast of Corfu, is the island of
                    Calypso.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Paxo, the next in order, which is about seven miles long and three broad, lies
                    eight miles south-east of Corfu, and twelve miles west of the coast of Albania.
                    Its surface is highly beautiful, much enclosed, and nearly covered with olive
                    trees. Its capital, St Gago, contains a great proportion of the population,
                    amounting to 3948 persons, who depend very much on trade for their subsistence.
                    Anti-paxo, an islet five or six miles in circumference, and inhabited by a few
                    fishermen, lies near it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Santa Maura, about twenty miles long and eight or nine broad, lies so close to
                    the coast of Greece that it was formerly joined to it by an isthmus. It is sixty
                    miles southeast from Corfu, three miles from Ithaca, and five from the nearest
                    point of Cephalonia. The surface consists of a range of limestone mountains,
                    which rise to the height of nearly 3000 feet, and terminate on the south-west in
                    the celebrated Leucadian promontory, where unhappy lovers, following the example
                    of Sappho, came to cure themselves of an unrequited passion. The cliff is not
                    very lofty, though sufficiently so for the purposes of despairing lovers. It is
                    still the custom of the neighbouring mariners, when passing, to throw in a small
                    piece of money as an expiatory offering. The island contains very little level
                    surface. Its principal products are olives and vines; and salt is made on the
                    coast. The capital, also named Santa Maura, containing 5000 inhabitants, is
                    situated at the northern point of the island, where it is separated by a narrow
                    channel from the continent. The ancient name, Leucadia, or, as it is now
                    pronounced, Lefcadia, is still known among the inhabitants, and ought to be used
                    to distinguish the island from its capital.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Theaki, the ancient Ithaca, the regal seat of Ulysses, consists merely of a
                    narrow ridge of limestone, seventeen miles long and four in extreme breadth,
                    rising into rugged eminences, with scarcely a hundred yards of continuous level
                    surface in its whole extent. Near the middle it is intersected by a deep bay,
                    which penetrates four miles inwards. Upon this bay the town of Vathi, the
                    capital, is situated, containing 2000 inhabitants. The chief produce of the
                    island is currants; but it yields also a small quantity of oil and wine, the
                    latter much esteemed. The grain raised suffices only for three months’
                    consumption. On a hill near Vathi are some massive ruins of ancient walls, with
                    a number of sepulchres, which are supposed to mark die site of the capital of
                    Ulysses. Near the south-east end of the island is a cliff called Koraka at
                    present, and supposed to be the rock Korax, mentioned in the Odyssey; and under
                    it, in a secluded and picturesque spot, is a fountain, conceived to be that of
                    Arethusa, where Ulysses met the faithful Eumaeus. The island is still named
                    Ithaca by the more intelligent natives, which is corrupted into Theaki by some
                    of the lower classes. Between Ithaca, Santa Maura, and the continent, are
                    situated four small rocky isles, named Meganisi, Calamo, Atako, and Car to,
                    besides several minute islets, of little or no importance.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Cephalonia, three miles from the nearest point of Ithaca, is the largest of all
                    the Ionian Islands. Its greatest length is forty English miles, and its greatest
                    breadth twenty-four. A lofty chain of mountains, the Mount Aenos of antiquity,
                    nearly 4000 feet high, occupies the centre of the island, and sends off branches
                    to all the principal promontories. The wood which covered a part of these hills
                    was wantonly burnt, about twenty years ago, during some internal disturbances. A
                    deep gulf penetrates far inland from the south side of the island; and, upon the
                    east side of this gulf stands Argostoli, the capital, containing 4000
                    inhabitants. Lixuri, the only other town, contains 5000 inhabitants; and there
                    are in the island 175 villages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Turner, 192.</p></note> The surface of Cephalonia is
                    generally rocky; the soil thin, and less fertile than that of Zante. Its chief
                    productions are currants, oil, and wine. Some ruins of Cyclopian walls mark the
                    site of the city of Samus, mentioned by Homer; and there are some remains of
                    Krani, Pronos, and other ancient cities. Vestiges of the altar of Jupiter
                    Aenesius are said still to exist on the top of Mount Aenos.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Zante, which lies ten miles south from the nearest point of Cephalonia, is about
                    sixty miles in circumference. Unlike the neighbouring islands, its surface
                    consists chiefly of a large plain, reaching from the southern to the northern
                    coast, but bounded on the east and west sides by calcareous ridges about 1200 or
                    1300 feet high. This plain, covered with vineyards and olive groves, with only a
                    few spots in tillage, presents the appearance of luxuriant fertility, and has
                    procured for the island the title of the “Garden of the Levant.” The capital,
                    Zante, situated on the eastern side of the island, contains 18,000 inhabitants.
                    Zante contains very few antiquities; and, though smaller and inferior in
                    population to some of the other islands, is the richest of them all.<note

                <p>Cerigo, the ancient Cythera, the last of the seven islands, is about fifty miles
                    in circumference, and is situated near the south coast of the ancient Laconia,
                    150 miles from the nearest of its Ionian confederates. The face of the island is
                    mountainous, and, though reported to be the birth-place of Venus, it is rugged,
                    barren, and destitute of beauty. Its productions are similar to those of the
                    other islands, but it is less commercial; and, abounding more in pasturage, it
                    raises a considerable number of sheep and cattle.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Landed property, in all the islands, is in the hands of a comparatively small
                    number of persons, who form a proud, oppressive, and rapacious aristocracy. The
                    Venetian senate, whilst it possessed these islands, kept all the more solid
                    advantages to its own citizens, but bestowed titles, which cost nothing,
                    profusely upon the petty insular chieftains; and nobles, destitute of education,
                    honour, or property, are as common here as in Italy. The lands are generally let
                    by the year, the tenant paying half the produce to the landlord; a species of
                    tenure almost universal in rude countries. In Cephalonia, where property is
                    pretty much divided, the largest proprietor has not above L.800 or L. 900 a
                    year; but in Zante there are estates of more than double this value.<note

                    the rural economy of the Ionian Islands, corn is an object of secondary
                    importance, and farming is conducted on the rudest principles. Barley, wheat,
                    maize, and oats, are cultivated, but the quantity of grain of all kinds raised
                    does not exceed one half, and in some of the islands is not one third, of the
                    annual amount of consumption. Of the corn raised in Ithaca, one tenth is wheat
                    and nine tenths barley. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942248"

                    of the islands. Cephalonia is computed to yield of the latter 100,000 pounds
                    annually, of an excellent quality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Vaudoncourt, 438.</p></note> The number of oxen, sheep, and
                    goats, is considerable in the islands less adapted to the cultivation of the
                    currant, vine, or corn; but others, such as Zante, have very few, and all are
                    partly supplied with cattle and poultry from the Morea. Milk cows are rare, the
                    milk of goats being preferred for ordinary use, as well as for the manufacture
                    of cheese. The produce of wax and honey in some of the islands is very great.
                    Cerigo is stated to have had 1280 hives in 1811, and 60,000 or 80,000 pounds of
                    honey of an excellent quality are collected annually in Cephalonia.<note

                <p>The cultivation of vines and olives is an object of greater attention to the
                    inhabitants than that of corn, and is more skilfully conducted. Nine sorts of
                    olives grow in Zante, differing considerably in their qualities. The fruit
                    begins to ripen in November, but does not fall off till towards the end of
                    December or the beginning of January. This is the time when they are gathered,
                    but in some places they are plucked with the hand, and not allowed to fall. They
                    are carried to the mill in April, but the harvest is not entirely at an end till
                    the month of May. The oil is carried to the sea-ports in sheep-skins. Olives are
                    cultivated to the greatest extent in Corfu, where the produce collected every
                    two years amounts, in middling seasons, to 700,000 jars or 90,000 barrels<note

                    30,000; Leucadia, 3000; Paxo, 8500; and Ithaca, 1500. Including Cerigo, the
                    annual produce of olive oil will not be much less than 200,000 barrels. While
                    the Venetians were masters of the island, and retained a monopoly of the oil
                    trade, the price averaged from forty to forty-three livres of Corfu (6s. 8d. to
                    7s. 2d.) per jar; but in 1802 it rose to sixty livres (10s.); and in 1807 (a
                    dear year) was seventeen and a half dollars per barrel, or about 19s. per jar.
                    The oil is of four different qualities, the finest of which is fit for the
                    table, and the other three species are used in various manufactures.<note

                <p>Wine is made in all the islands to a small extent. In Zante, forty species of
                    grape arc distinguished, but the small black species, known under the name of
                    currants, is the only kind extensively cultivated. Ithaca produces about 12,000
                    barrels of wine annually, of a quality superior to that of the other islands,
                    and which sells at about twenty dollars per barrel. Cephalonia produces from
                    30,000 to 35,000 barrels of good wine. Zante yields only about 4000 barrels;
                    Leucadia 1000. The produce of the other islands is not known.<note

                    Oranges, lemons, and citrons, are raised in several of the islands, both for
                    domestic use and exportation; and salt is supplied for exportation in large
                    quantities from Corfu and Leucadia.</p>
                <p>The currant is the staple produce of Zante, where it occupies nearly two thirds
                    of the cultivated land. It is raised also in Cephalonia and Ithaca, but does not
                    succeed in Corfu or Leucadia. Its culture is conducted with great neatness, and
                    when the flower is out, the aspect of the great vineyards is singularly rich and
                    beautiful. It thrives best in a deep rich soil, at the foot of mountains. The
                    currants are gathered about the beginning of September, somewhat sooner than
                    other grapes; are spread abroad for eight or ten days, and are usually ready for
                    packing by the end of September. The annual produce of Zante is from 7,000,000
                    to 8,000,000 pounds, the price of which in the island varies from 14s. to 18s.
                    per hundredweight. Cephalonia yields from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 pounds, and
                    Ithaca 500,000. The whole produce of the Ionian Islands in this article may
                    therefore be estimated at 13,000,000 or 14,000,000 pounds.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mr Williams gives the estimated value of the annual produce of the three islands,
                    Zante, Paxo, and Ithaca, in corn, wine, oil, currants, honey, and flax, the
                    chief productions, but excluding minor articles, such as cheese, fruit, &amp;c.
                    The estimates appear to be official, and as they are probably deduced from
                    surveys made for the purpose of taxation, they are entitled to some degree of
                    confidence; but it would have been more satisfactory had he stated upon what
                    basis they were formed. The annual produce of Zante, in 1815, is stated at
                    1,066,145 dollars, or L.234,000; that of Ithaca, 98,896 dollars, or L.22,000;
                    that of Paxo, 104,018 dollars, or L.23,000. These three statements give, on an
                    average, L.6 sterling of produce for each inhabitant; but as some of the other
                    islands are less favourably situated, L.5 is probably high enough as a mean; and
                    if we compute the annual value of the produce of the whole on this principle, it
                    will be L.970,000,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Williams, 72-183, and <hi rend="italic">Appendix,</hi> No. iii.</p></note>
                    or, in round numbers, L.l,000,000 sterling; and this is exclusive of what is
                    derived from commerce and the mechanic arts.</p>
                <p>The situation of the Ionian Islands gives them naturally, and in some measure
                    necessarily, a commercial character. Their position near the coast of Greece,
                    where the tyranny of the Turks renders property so insecure, tends to make them
                    a medium of communication with that country, and an entrepôt for its
                    commodities. The narrowness of their territories, which obliges them to import
                    provisions, and the peculiar nature of the soil and climate, which are better
                    adapted to raise other productions than corn; their insular situation, and long
                    connection with the Venetians; all dispose them to engage largely in commercial
                    transactions. The trade of the islands, considering their extent and
                    circumstances, is, in truth, considerable, and has increased greatly since it
                    was freed from the shackles imposed upon it by the monopolizing spirit of the
                    Venetians. The exports consist of olive oil, currants, wine, honey, wax, salt,
                    soap, oranges, lemons, tobacco, cheese, &amp;c. The imports are corn, woollen,
                    cotton, and linen goods, velvets, cured fish of various kinds, sugar, coffee,
                    iron, lead, dyestuffs, paper, drugs, spices, &amp;c. Zante, in 1815, exported
                    goods to the value of 591,000 dollars. Cephalonia has 250 vessels of various
                    sizes. The little island of Paxo has 56 vessels, and exported goods to the value
                    of 96,000 dollars in 1815. Ithaca, in 1815 or 1816, had 3598 tons of shipping,
                    which, with boats belonging to the island, employed 823 men, and 74,360 dollars
                    of capital. The little island of Cerigo, the least commercial of the whole, had,
                    in 1809, only about twenty-five vessels, nearly all boats, employing 230 men.
                    The number of Ionian vessels that trade with Turkey was estimated, in 1816, at
                    250, of which 200 were under their own flag, and fifty under the Russians. We
                    should probably not err much if we estimated the exports of the whole islands at
                    something more than double those of Zante, or about one third of the computed
                    gross produce of the land, namely, L.300,000 sterling. A great number of their
                    vessels trade with the Russian ports in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942261"

                    Italy, France, and Spain. In the intercourse between the islands which lie near
                    one another, a species of long, slender boat is used, named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monoxylon,</hi> made of a single piece of wood, preserving both the form and
                    the name of the vessels used in the earliest and rudest stage of Greek

                    money, in common cases, is ten per cent. The merchants are generally poor and

                    fortunes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Williams,

                    will attract a considerable part of the trade which now centres in Salonica,

                <p>This small expenditure appears to include only the charges of the civil
                    government, and perhaps not the whole of these. The body of 3000 troops, chiefly
                    British, kept in the islands, would alone evidently absorb a larger revenue. And
                    although it was fixed by the constitution that the islands should defray the
                    expense of their own military establishment, it appears, in point of fact, from
                    a parliamentary paper (dated 25th of February 1820, No. ≡0, that the British
                    government incurred an expense of L.145,203 in the Ionian Islands in 1817, and
                    L.120,045</p>
                <p>in 1818, for purposes chiefly military, but partly civil. It is difficult to
                    conceive that there can be any British objects in that quarter requiring such an
                    expenditure, or that the money has been advanced provisionally, to be afterwards
                    repaid, since the revenues of the islands must now be on a permanent footing.
                    There remains but one admissible supposition, that these islands are to form a
                    permanent burden on the people of Britain; and yet, at a period when our own
                    expenditure presses so heavily, it seems little less than infatuation to
                    increase our difficulties gratuitously, by relieving a distant country, less
                    heavily taxed, of the expense of defending itself.</p>
                <p>The existing constitution of the Ionian Islands, which was sanctioned by its own
                    legislative assembly in 1817, vests the supreme power in the high commissioner,
                    the senate, and the legislative assembly, which have jointly the title of the
                    Parliament of the Ionian Islands. The legislative assembly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> consists of forty members, of whom twenty-nine are
                    elective and eleven <hi rend="italic">integral,</hi> and all must belong to the
                    class of <hi rend="italic">syìiclitoe,</hi> or nobles, the common people having
                    nothing to do with the laws but to obey them. The eleven <hi rend="italic"
                    >integral</hi> members consist of the president and members of the old senate,
                    with the regents or governors of the five largest islands, all of whom are
                    substantially, though not directly, nominated by the high commissioner. The
                    twenty-nine elective members are chosen by the nobles of the different islands,
                    from prepared lists sent down by the primary council, in the following
                    proportions:</p>
                <p>Corfu 7</p>
                <p>Cephalonia 7</p>
                <p>Zante 7</p>
                <p>Leucadia 4</p>
                <p>Ithaca 1</p>
                <p>Cerigo 1</p>
                <p>Paxo 1</p>
                <p>28</p>
                <p>And each of the last three in rotation elects a second member, which makes
                    twenty-nine. The legislative assembly elects its own officers, fixes the amount
                    of the supplies, and all its members have the power of proposing new laws or
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>The primary <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> council, mentioned above, which acts
                    only during a dissolution of parliament, consists of the president and members
                    of the last senate, with five members of the last legislative assembly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, nominated by the high commissioner.</p>
                <p>The senate consists of five members and a president, the latter appointed
                    directly by the high commissioner. The five members are elected by the
                    legislative body out of its own number, and confirmed by the high commissioner.
                    If he negative the election of an individual, another is elected; and if he
                    negative the second also, the vacancy is filled up by his nominating two
                    individuals, of whom it then falls to the legislative body to choose one. This
                    senate is an executive council as well as a deliberative body. It nominates most
                    of the officers under the general government, such as judges, regents,
                    archivists, &amp;c.; but its nominations must be confirmed by the high
                    commissioner. It makes regulations during the recess of the legislative
                    assembly, which have, <hi rend="italic">pro tempore,</hi> the force of laws; and
                    it deliberates and decides upon all propositions submitted to it by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the high commissioner, or sent up from the lower
                    house, but its members have not a power to initiate legislative proceedings.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192942274" xml:id="kp-eb0712-2274-0344"/>
                <p>The legislative assembly and the senate are elected for five years, but may be
                    dissolved at the lapse of a shorter period by the high commissioner. The
                    appointments of judges, regents, and other officers, are also for five
                    years.</p>
                <p>The high commissioner is nominated by the protecting sovereign. He appoints the
                    president of the senate, who has the initiative.of all proceedings in that body.
                    He appoints a resident for each of the islands, who has the power of suspending
                    any proceeding of the local government. He nominates a number of officers, and
                    has a negative, direct or indirect, upon the appointment of most of those whom
                    he does not nominate. He has a <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> on all propositions
                    which have passed the two houses; but though he give his sanction to any
                    specific measure, there is still another <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> behind,
                    lodged in the king of Britain, who may annul the proceeding at any period within
                    one year of its enactment.</p>
                <p>Each island has a local government, consisting of a municipal council of five
                    members, selected by the regent (with the approbation of the high commissioner),
                    out of a list of ten, chosen by the <hi rend="italic">synclitoe.</hi> And
                    besides these, there are five active functionaries, a regent, secretary, fiscal,
                    archivist, and treasurer, all, except the last, nominated by the senate, and
                    confirmed by the high commissioner.</p>
                <p>The judicial power is lodged in a supreme court at the seat of government,
                    consisting of four ordinary and two extraordinary members. Of the former, two
                    are native Ionians, named by the senate, and approved of by the commissioner;
                    and two, directly named by the commissioner, may either be British subjects or
                    Ionians. When these four are equally divided on any question, reference is made
                    to the two extraordinary members, who are the high commissioner and president of
                    the senate. Subordinate to this supreme court are twenty-one inferior tribunals,
                    that is, a civil, a criminal, and a commercial tribunal in each island. And
                    under these, again, are justice of peace courts, for minor offences, and small
                    civil suits. Besides the general appellant jurisdiction which the supreme court
                    has over the local tribunals, it is empowered to send a delegation of its
                    members on circuit on special occasions, when thought necessary by the senate
                    and high commissioner. The number of judges in the local courts is not fixed by
                    the constitution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sanita,</hi> or health establishment, is under the sole
                    direction of the high commissioner. The army, consisting entirely of the troops
                    of the protecting sovereign, is also under the orders of his representative. The
                    expense of the army is to be defrayed by the islands if the number does not
                    exceed three thousand men. There is, besides, a national militia, commanded by
                    native officers.</p>
                <p>Individuals, or bodies of men, have the right of representation or petition to
                    the protecting sovereign or his ministers.</p>
                <p>We have described this constitution more in detail than its importance merits;
                    for, without exaggeration, it may certainly be pronounced to be the very worst
                    among the numerous plans of representative government framed within the last
                    thirty years. It is, in fact, little else than a compact between the British
                    government and the petty despots of the islands, settling in what proportions
                    the power, patronage, and taxes of the country are to be shared between them.
                    The rights and interests of the mass of the people, for which even the German
                    princes in their new constitutions profess a decent respect, are not the object
                    of one single stipulation in this long and detailed instrument.</p>
                <p>The style of building in the Ionian Islands is chiefly Italian, and the interior
                    of some of the cities shows great neatness. The streets are generally narrow;
                    the houses some of wood, some of stone, are three, four, or even five stories
                    high, with open latticed windows. The shops are tolerably well supplied with
                    manufactured and colonial articles; and the persons employed in them display
                    more alertness and civility than the indolent shop-keepers of Spain, Portugal,
                    and Sicily. The churches, as in Greece are disproportionately numerous. Some of
                    them have steeples, others have merely an elevated façade. The population, in
                    consequence of the long dominion of the Venetians, is, in manners and habits, as
                    well as in costume and language, intermediate between the Greek and Italian
                    character. Though enjoying more liberty, they are, in some respects, inferior to
                    the continental Greeks. Their exterior is less dignified, their manners more
                    corrupt, and they show less capability of again becoming a people. This
                    degradation of character may be attributed chiefly to the vicious nature of the
                    Venetian government. The governors and judges whom it sent out to the islands
                    were very often nobles of decayed fortune, who undertook the duties as a
                    speculation to retrieve their affairs. Bribery was practised openly; toleration
                    for a crime might easily be purchased; and the laws, imperfect in themselves,
                    were rendered wholly null by the corruption of the judges. The petty insular
                    aristocracy separated into factions, which trampled on the laws and oppressed
                    the people. The Venetian government, by a detestable policy, encouraged their
                    feuds to prevent their combination, and exposed the country to all the evils of
                    a continued civil war. As happens in all countries where justice is denied by
                    the laws, private revenge and assassination prevailed to a frightful extent. In
                    the island of Zante alone, with 33,000 inhabitants, the number of assassinations
                    sometimes exceeded one for each day of the year. Many of the nobles, indeed,
                    kept assassins in their pay; and others of them fitted out privateers for the
                    trade of general piracy, in which the vessels of their own countrymen were not
                    spared. These nobles are generally educated in Italy, and speak the Italian
                    language; but in knowledge and refinement they are scarcely on a level with the
                    middle ranks in England. The lower classes, like the continental Greeks, use the
                    Romaic language, but with a larger mixture of Italian words; and, like them,
                    too, they are active, ingenious, adroit, loquacious, subtle, and intriguifl⅛.
                    Physic and law are favourite professions, and the better order of lawyers and
                    physicians, who have been educated in Italy, form the most intelligent part of
                    society. The clergy are extremely numerous, but less informed, and inferior in
                    respectability to the two former classes. They were very active in resisting
                    some of the reforms attempted by the British. When Major du Bosset introduced
                    the culture of the potato in Cephalonia, they laboured to persuade the peasants
                    that this was the very apple with which the serpent tempted Adam and Eve in
                    paradise.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Holland,

                    society, and are, of course, ignorant, superstitions, and feeble in their

                    laxity of morals prevails, but the poor are less corrupted than the rich. Most
                    of the nobility have mistresses, and the laws allow them to legitimate the issue
                    of these connections by a subsequent marriage. A sort of agreement is not
                    unfrequent, by which a young woman is made over by her parents, with her own
                    consent, to her admirer, at a stipulated sum. This species of concubinage, which
                    frequently terminates in marriage when the girl is respectable and has children,

                    some modifications; but in the towns the Italian dress prevails, as well as the

                    Venetians, indeed, to extinguish the national spirit of the Ionians, to deprive
                    them of the means of education, and to brutalize their character by every method
                    in their power, that they might convert them into passive instruments of their
                    sovereign will. But, after three centuries of such policy, there can be no doubt
                    that the Venetians lost more by the odious nature of the innovations attempted
                    than they gained in security by the result.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The attachment of the Ionians to the Greek religion, however, has effectually
                    resisted the innovating spirit of their masters. The Catholic worship is
                    tolerated, but the national faith has lost little of its influence upon the
                    minds of the people. Each island has its patron saint, in the efficacy of whose
                    intercession the people are taught to believe. The British authorities humour
                    the popular superstition in this particular; and, in Corfu, the patents from the
                    health office bear to be “in the name of God, and by the intercession of Saint
                    Spiridion.” Ceremonies and processions, with fasts, frequent and severe, take
                    the place of piety and good works. A ruffian engaged in a project of
                    assassination has refused to taste animal food during the season of the fast. As
                    in many other countries, the lower orders are comparatively strict in their
                    religious observances, while indifference and infidelity are common among the
                    higher classes. But, if religion is in a low state, it is not from the want of
                    priests and churches, the number of which is out of all proportion to the number
                    of inhabitants. The little island of Paxo, with 4000 inhabitants, has thirty-six
                    churches; and Cerigo, with 9000 inhabitants, is said to have the incredible
                    number of 260 churches or chapels, and 165 priests. These swarms of priests are
                    a sort of privileged mendicants. They are, in general, too illiterate to
                    understand religion themselves, and, of course, they are incapable of teaching
                    it to others. But as they derive their subsistence chiefly from fees for
                    absolution, and from gifts and offerings, they find it necessary to support
                    their influence by filling the minds of those under their care with a thousand
                    idle or pernicious superstitions. Besides the secular clergy, there are a number
                    of regular religious in convents scattered over the islands, but of their number
                    or condition we have seen no satisfactory account.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Ionian Islands make no considerable figure in ancient history. Cephalonia,
                    Zante, Ithaca, and Santa Maura (then joined to the continent), formed part of
                    the kingdom of Ulysses; and, if we may judge of their condition from the
                    armament which their prince carried with him to the Trojan war, we should
                    conclude that they were less populous and less improved than the continental
                    parts of Greece. These islands, along with a part of the opposite continent,
                    furnished only twelve ships, whilst the little island of Salamis, not one
                    twentieth part of the extent, sent as many.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Cephalonia having twenty-four, Zante twenty, and Ithaca twelve. At a later
                    period, the Corinthians planted colonies in Leucadia and Corcyra, and probably
                    in some of the other islands over which they maintained some degree of
                    authority. The Leucadians sent 800 men to fight the Persians at Plataea, and the
                    Cephalenians of Pale 200.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    situation, rapidly became strong by sea, and not only shook off their dependence
                    on the parent state, but committed depredations on the commerce of the other
                    Grecian cities, till the Athenians, shortly after the battle of Marathon,
                    attacked them and broke their naval strength. The jealousy between the
                    Corcyreans and Corinthians, about forty-five years later, led to hostilities
                    between the parties, in which the Athenians were drawn in to take the part of
                    the former; and the extension of this petty quarrel at length produced the
                    celebrated Peleponnesian war. The Corcyreans had 120 triremes when the contest
                    began, and were the second naval power in Greece.<note anchored="true"

                    Cerigo, from its situation, was almost always an appendage to Laconia. These
                    islands, with the rest of Greece, at length fell under the dominion of the
                    Macedonians. In the wars between Philip and the Aetolians, however, we find the

                    state of Venice, transferred to France the Ionian Islands, with their
                    continental dependencies, consisting, at that time, of five sea-port towns,
                    Butrinto, Go-menitza, Parga, Prevesa, and Vonitza. When the invasion of Egypt
                    led to hostilities between France and Turkey in 1798, Ali, pasha of Albania,
                    besieged and took Prevesa and the other continental towns, except Parga; and the
                    islands, having been reduced by the fleets of Russia and Turkey, were erected
                    into an independent state, by a treaty between these powers, dated 21 st March
                    1800. They were placed under the protection of the Porte, as its vassals, and
                    were to pay it an annual sum of 75,000 piastres.<note anchored="true"

                    But the inhabitants of Parga, dreading the merciless disposition of the Albanian
                    pasha, took up arms in their own defence, and, favoured by the strength of their
                    position, repelled his assaults. A constitution was given to the republic in
                    1803, which it is unnecessary to describe, as it has since been superseded. It
                    is sufficient to say, that it was drawn up by Russian ministers of state,
                    ignorant of the circumstances of the islands, and contained such a specimen of
                    republican principles as might be expected from Muscovy. The war between Russia
                    and the Porte in 1806 led to the occupation of the Ionian Islands by the former;
                    but by a secret article of the treaty of Tilsit (June 1807), they were made over
                    to France. The French, during their first occupation of the islands, had
                    abolished the use of the Italian language in public acts, and re-established the
                    Romaic. Connecting these possessions with his projects against Turkey, Napoleon
                    was anxious to revive the national spirit of the Greeks. A Romaic newspaper was
                    set on foot, and has been continued by the British; establishments for promoting
                    scientific education were projected; and, to crown these schemes by a piece of
                    French extravagance, the reckoning by olympiads was introduced. These projects
                    held out only a distant prospect of good, but the expense of the large military
                    force stationed by the French in the islands was a real and immediate grievance.
                    In 1810, a British force, under General Oswald, took possession of Zante,
                    Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Cerigo, almost without opposition; and also of Santa
                    Maura after some resistance. Corfu and Paxo having garrisons too strong to be
                    attacked, were merely subjected to a maritime blockade, which, however, could
                    not be so rigorously enforced as to reduce them. They were surrendered to the
                    British after the general peace in 1814. The Turkish government now renewed its
                    claim to Parga, under the treaty <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1800, though that
                    claim had been virtually set aside by subsequent circumstances. That government
                    had entirely failed in affording the Ionian Islands the stipulated protection,
                    since it had suffered first the Russians, and afterwards the French, to occupy
                    them with a military force. It had been a party to subsequent treaties, by which
                    this had been in substance annulled. The original treaty bound the Turks to
                    protect the Pargui-notes; and it was now obvious, from the fate of the other
                    towns, and from the feelings of the inhabitants, that its surrender would be
                    equivalent to a warrant for its destruction. Lastly, the British had no right to
                    make over Parga to the Turks, for it was not reduced by our arms, but its
                    inhabitants put themselves under our protection by a voluntary act, and upon the
                    express condition that their town was to remain attached to the Ionian republic.
                    From ignorance or inattention to these circumstances, however, the Congress of
                    Vienna had resolved that Parga should be given up. And, in obedience to the
                    mandate of this conclave of sovereigns, the soldiers of Ali took possession of
                    the bare walls in June 1819; the inhabitants, amounting to 5000, having, to a
                    man, emigrated to Paxo and the other islands, after receiving a very inadequate
                    indemnity for the loss of their property.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Ionian Islands, either as a separate state or as a dependency of Great
                    Britain, are of little importance. The interest felt in their fate was founded
                    partly on classical associations, and partly on the means they were supposed to
                    afford for restoring the Greeks to their existence as a nation. But, under the
                    political system established in the islands, the hopes raised on the latter
                    ground proved almost entirely chimerical. The Ionian Greeks must be enlightened
                    and improved themselves before they can become useful auxiliaries in the work of
                    enlightening and improving the rest of their countrymen. To effect this change
                    in their character, and to create and nourish a national spirit, three things
                    are indispensable, with which their new constitution leaves them entirely
                    unprovided; a system of national education, a free press, and a free government.
                    The British ministry, in patronizing a plan for erecting a university in the
                    islands, began its operations at the wrong end. The first and most indispensable
                    step is to increase the small number of schools at present in existence, till
                    they become sufficiently numerous to afford common education to the whole
                    population. A university may then be useful; but the Greeks can never be
                    enlightened by giving a learned education to a few individuals, whilst the mass
                    remains sunk in ignorance and superstition. On the other hand, when a moderate
                    degree of knowledge is generally diffused, ardent spirits will emerge from the
                    multitude, and rise to eminence by their native force, while their countrymen
                    will then be better prepared to reap advantage from their exertions. At present
                    a well-informed Greek finds his acquisitions useless. Again, without a free
                    press in their native language, the Greeks cannot receive that political
                    instruction which is necessary to fit them for becoming once more a nation;
                    knowledge cannot be rendered popular, nor of course useful; and a university
                    will become a mere establishment of sinecures, or an engine for propagating
                    corrupt and servile doctrines, worse than ignorance itself. It is no solid
                    objection that the Ionian Greeks are mere children in literature, and could not
                    make a discreet use of the press. Feeble as their powers may be, they will
                    continue children still, if they do not use them. Their own blunders will often
                    be better instructors than the mature wisdom of others. With general education
                    and a free press, should be conjoined the invigorating spirit of a popular
                    government; not a government bottomed on close corporations and privileged
                    classes, but one broadly republican in its forms and spirit. Whatever may be the
                    defects of such a government, it is calculated, beyond all other human
                    inventions, to call forth the energies of man. It was this inspiring power that
                    carried forward the ancient Athenians in their brilliant career of improvement
                    and glory; that raised the Italian and Dutch republics to sudden wealth and
                    power; and that is already giving a new aspect to the vast continent of North
                    America. The people are ignorant and disorderly, but probably not more so than
                    the Athenians in the time of Solon, or the Italians in the thirteenth century,
                    who were, nevertheless, found capable of supporting republican institutions. The
                    errors into which their ignorance might have led them would most probably have
                    soon cured themselves. And, at any rate, the Ionians are in that precise
                    situation which would have divested such institutions of the dangers usually
                    supposed to attend them. The natural influence of the British government, as the
                    protecting power, would have moderated the violence of factions, and preserved
                    the government stable amidst their struggles. Had a free, active, and
                    enlightened community been raised up in these islands, speaking the language of
                    Greece, and almost m contact with the country, the emancipation of the
                    continental Greeks would not only have been secured by the joint operation of
                    moral and political causes, but so much light would have been diffused among
                    them, and such a good model set before them, that they would have been in a
                    condition to make a wise and safe use of their independence, and step at once
                    into the enjoyment of a free constitution. As matters have been managed,
                    however, it would be foolish to expect that these islands will contribute <pb

                    degree to the improvement of the Greeks. Exclusively of the prerogatives of the
                    high commissioner, all power is vested in the nobles, who are universally
                    described as the most worthless part of the population. Votes alone will command
                    office; and the mass of the people, who have no votes to give, though not
                    expressly, will yet be substantially excluded from every place of trust and
                    honour, and kept in the same state of vassalage as under the Venetians. Public
                    burdens will naturally accumulate, because those who impose taxes have a
                    separate interest from those who pay them; and abuses will multiply, because the
                    nobles, hanging on the government for support, are gainers by a system of waste
                    and profusion. A free press, which would have corrected some, of these evils,
                    has been jealously guarded against by the constitution; and as for the right of
                    petition, in a government so constructed, it must be an empty name. In all
                    probability, then, the Ionians will consider the Turkish practice of
                    insurrection as the only effectual method of making known their grievances.
                    Accordingly, since the new constitution was promulgated in 1817, several
                    attempts at insurrection have been made. But whether these have originated in
                    the factious spirit of the nobles, or the discontents of the body of the people,
                    has not been clearly explained. Yet though but little comparatively has been
                    done for the people, the change has certainly been for their advantage. The
                    administration of justice has improved; the private wars and open rapine of the
                    nobles have been restrained; and the powers taken from these persons, and
                    conferred on the commissioner, have been more beneficially exercised for the
                    inhabitants at large. But a much more stable foundation would have been laid for
                    good government, had the people been furnished with constitutional rights to
                    protect themselves, even although they had not made a very wise use of those
                    rights in the first instance.</p>
