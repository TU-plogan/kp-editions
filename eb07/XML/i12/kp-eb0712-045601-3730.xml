                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    <hi rend="italic">Medicine,</hi> a term first invented by Glisson, and adopted
                    by Haller, to denote an essential property of all animal bodies, which exists
                    independently of, and in contradistinction to, sensibility. This ingenious
                    author calls that part of the human body <hi rend="italic">irritable,</hi> which
                    becomes shorter upon being touched; <hi rend="italic">very irritable,</hi> if it
                    contracts upon a slight touch; and the contrary, if by a violent touch it
                    contracts but little. He calls that <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943743"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-3743-0457"/>a sensible part of the human body, which, upon
                    being touched, transmits the impression thereof to the soul; and in brutes, he
                    calls those parts sensible, the irritation of which occasions evident signs of
                    pain and disquiet in the animal. On the contrary, he calls that insensible,
                    which being burned, torn, pricked, or cut till it is quite destroyed, occasions
                    no sign of pain or convulsion, nor any sort of change in the situation of the
                    body. From the result of many cruel experiments, Haller concludes that the
                    epidermis is insensible; that the skin is sensible in a greater degree than any
                    other part of the body; that the fat and cellular membrane are insensible; and
                    that the muscular flesh is sensible, its sensibility being ascribed by him
                    rather to the nerves than to the flesh itself. The tendons, he says, having no
                    nerves distributed to them, are insensible. The ligaments and capsulae of the
                    articulations are also believed to be insensible; and hence Haller infers, that
                    the sharp pains of the gout are not seated in the capsulae of the joint, but <hi
                    rend="underline">in</hi> the skin, and in the nerves which creep upon its
                    external surface. The bones are all insensible, says Haller, except the teeth;
                    and likewise the marrow. Under his experiments, the periosteum and pericranium,
                    the dura and pia mater, appeared insensible; and he infers, that the sensibility
                    of the nerves is owing to the medulla, and not to the membranes. The arteries
                    and veins are held to be susceptible of little or no sensation, excepting the
                    carotid, the lingual, temporal, pharyngal, labial, thyroidal, and the aorta near
                    the heart, the sensibility of which is ascribed to the nerves that accompany
                    them. Sensibility is allowed to the internal membranes of the stomach,
                    intestines, bladder, ureters, vagina, and womb, on account of their being of the
                    same nature with the skin; the heart is also admitted to be sensible, but the
                    lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, are possessed of a very imperfect, if any,
                    sensation. The glands, having few nerves, are endowed with only an obtuse
                    sensation. Some sensibility is allowed to the tunica choroides and the iris,
                    though in a less degree than the retina; but none to the cornea. Haller
                    concludes, in general, that the nerves alone are sensible of themselves; and
                    that, in proportion to the number of nerves apparently distributed to particular
                    parts, such parts possess a greater or less degree of sensibility.</p>
                <p>Irritability, he says, is so different from sensibility, that the most irritable
                    parts are not at all sensible, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> He alleges
                    facts to prove this position, and also to demonstrate, that irritability does
                    not depend upon the nerves, which are not irritable, but upon the original
                    formation of the parts which are susceptible of it. Irritability, he says, is
                    not proportioned to sensibility; and in proof of this, he observes, that the
                    intestines, though rather less sensible than the stomach, are more irritable,
                    and that the heart is very irritable, though it has but a small degree of
                    sensation.</p>
                <p>Irritability, according to Haller, is the distinguishing characteristic between
                    the muscular and cellular fibres; and hence he determines that the ligaments,
                    periosteum, meninges of the brain, and all the membranes composed of the
                    cellular substance, are void of irritability. The tendons are not irritable; and
                    though he does not absolutely deny irritability to the arteries, yet his
                    experiments on the aorta produced no contraction. The veins and excretory ducts
                    are in a small degree irritable, and the gall-bladder, the ductus choledochus,
                    the ureters and urethra, are only affected by a very acrid corrosive; but the
                    lacteal vessels are considerably irritable. The glands and mucous sinuses, the
                    uterus in quadrupeds, the human matrix, and the genitals, are all irritable; as
                    are also the muscles, particularly the diaphragm. The oesophagus, stomach, and
                    intestines, are irritable; but of all the animal organs, the heart is endued
                    with the greatest irritability. In general, there is nothing irritable in the
                    animal body but the muscular fibres; and the vital parts are the most irritable.
                    This power of motion, arising from irritations, is supposed to be different from
                    all other properties of bodies, and probably resides in the glutinous mucus of
                    the muscular fibres, altogether independently of the influence of the soul. The
                    irritability of the muscles is said to be destroyed by drying the fibres,
                    congealing the fat, and more especially by the use of opium in living animals.
                    The physiological system, of which an abstract has now been given, has been
                    adopted and confirmed by Castell and Zimmermann, and also by Brocklesby, who
                    suggests, that irritability, as distinguished from sensibility, may depend upon
                    a series of nerves different from such as serve either for voluntary motion or
                    sensation. This doctrine, however, has been controverted by Μ. le Cat, and
                    particularly by Dr Whytt, in his Physiological Essays.</p>
