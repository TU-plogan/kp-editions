                    whereof one cannot be denoted as either multiple, aliquot part, or aliquot
                    parts, of the other, or whose ratio cannot be represented by numbers.</p>
                <p>The great Σror&gt;∕ε∕ωnj5 of the ancients has not expressly called attention to
                    this negative relation of magnitudes earlier than in the tenth book of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he has kept it steadily
                    in view in the preceding parts of the work. Hence he has two distinct treatises
                    of proportion; the one of proportion in <hi rend="italic">magnitudes,</hi> the
                    other of proportion in <hi rend="italic">numbers.</hi></p>
                <p>In the second proposition of the tenth book it is shown, that if from the greater
                    of two magnitudes we take the less, or the highest multiple of the less which it
                    contains, then take from the less the remainder, or the highest multiple of the
                    remainder which is contained in it, and so on continually; whenever this process
                    becomes interminable, the magnitudes have no common measure.</p>
                <p>The simplest instance of this interminable process to which we can refer, is in
                    the case of a straight line and the greater segment of the same divided in
                    extreme and mean ratio. For, by proposition 5, book xiii. it appears, that when
                    the greater segment is taken from the whole, the remainder (that is, the less
                    segment) has exactly the same relation to this greater segment which the greater
                    has to the whole, and so on for ever.</p>
                <p>If we begin a similar process with the diagonal and side of a square, at the end
                    of every two operations the two lines with which we have to proceed have the
                    same <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> magnitude as the two with which we began;
                    and thus we should never come to an end. If, therefore, the side of a square be
                    one foot, we cannot possibly express the diagonal in feet or parts of a
                    foot.</p>
                <p>In fact, although, in ultimate practice, every quantity with which the
                    mathematician has to deal is represented by numbers, whole or fractional, the
                    cases where this representation is not metaphysically accurate are far more
                    numerous than where it is perfect.</p>
                <p>Take, for instance, the vulgar logarithms of the natural <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    numbers. Let^ be the logarithm of the number N (where <hi rend="italic">p,
                    q,</hi> and the other general characters which we shall use, p denote integer
                    numbers). Then N = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi>, whence N <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ¢</hi> &gt; = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> p</hi> = 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> × <hi rend="italic">5</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> p</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> And, since the <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> power of N contains no prime factors but 2 and 5, N itself can contain
                    no other. Let N = <hi rend="italic">2</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi>
                    × 5 <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>. We have now <hi rend="italic">2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> qr</hi> × 5 <hi rend="superscript"> Çf</hi> = 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> × 5 <hi rend="superscript"> P</hi>; so that <hi
                    rend="italic">qr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qs</hi> being each equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">ĩ- = r,</hi> and N = 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. Thus^ is necessarily integer, consequently not one
                    logarithm of the series can be properly a fraction; and those which are integer
                    succeed only at intervals, of which each is ten times as great as the
                    preceding.</p>
                <p>We have said that the impossibility of reducing the relation of concrete
                    magnitudes to that of numbers, in an infinity of cases, has caused Euclid to
                    form two distinct treatises of proportion. And it is easy to see by what
                    considerations he has passed from the simpler to the more complex, though this
                    last has priority in the order of the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>Two numbers are called proportional to two other, or “the first is said to have
                    to the second the same ratio which the third has to the fourth, when the first
                    is the same multiple (aliquot) part or parts of the second which the third is of
                    the fourth.” But we have seen that there may be <hi rend="italic">magnitudes
                    of</hi> the same kind, whereof one is neither multiple, part, nor parts of
                    another; in other words, that have no common measure, no numerical ratio. ìet we
                    may conceive two such magnitudes to be related to each other κατα Ω∙^λ∕zorjjra,
                    exactly like other two.</p>
                <p>If D and S be the diagonal and side of a square; and Δ and Σ the diagonal and
                    side of another square; and if S and Σ be divided into the same number of equal
                    parts, however great the number and small the parts, we may <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941169" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1169-0259"/>conceive and easily prove,
                    that whenever D is greater than <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of the parts of S, but
                    less than <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 1, Δ is also greater than <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> of the parts of S, but less than <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 1. So that,
                    amongst incommensurable magnitudes, the first mi&lt;dit be said to have the same
                    ratio to the second which the third has to the fourth, when, “according as the
                    first is greater or less than any multiple, part, or parts whatsoever of the
                    second, the third is greater or less than the same multiple, part, or parts of
                    the fourth.” And both commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes might be
                    brought under the following definition: “The first of four magnitudes has the
                    same ratio to the second which the third has to the fourth, when, according as
                    the first is greater than any multiple, part, or parts whatsoever of the second,
                    equal to it, or less, the third is greater than the same multiple, part, or
                    parts of the fourth, equal to it, or less.”</p>
                <p>7Z . .</p>
                <p>Thus, if — B signify <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the magnitudes, of which B
                    contains rn, we might say, A has the same ratio to B which C has to D, if,
                    according as A is greater than —B,</p>
                <p>72</p>
                <p>equal to it, or less, C is greater than —D, equal to it, or less;anand <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> being not particular numbers, but any whatsoever. But if A
                    = —B, we have <hi rend="italic">mA</hi> = nB; and <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    thence, according as A is greater than - B, equal to it, or less, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">mA</hi> greater than <hi rend="italic">nB,</hi> equal to it, or
                    less; and similarly, <hi rend="italic">rnC</hi> greater than <hi rend="italic"
                    >nD,</hi> equal to it, or less. Thus we are brought to Euclid’s definition (book
                    v. def. 5), Ev <hi rend="italic">τlji</hi><hi rend="italic">αυτψ</hi><hi

                <p>On the foundation of this definition he has constructed, in his sixth book, what
                    appears to us a far more elegant treatise than any by which modern writers of
                    elements have endeavoured to supersede it. That he has been able to accomplish
                    it logically, without even mentioning the existence of incommensurable
                    magnitudes, is the best possible evidence of its perfection.</p>
                <p>His tenth book has often been called a treatise of incommensurables, or of surds.
                    Not that Euclid has any mode of expressing abstract surds; but he treats of
                    lince and areas whose relation could not be signified arithmetically without
                    surds. The extent of his doctrines on this subject, in more than a hundred
                    propositions, only embraces relations expressed by square roots, and their union
                    with integral or fractional numbers, including repeated extractions of square
                    roots, so as to produce biquadratic roots, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">in
                    infinitum.</hi></p>
                <p>It is manifest that he knew what is expressed in the algebraic formula √A + B = √
                    {⅜(A + √A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)}
                    <hi rend="italic">+ √ {⅜ (A</hi> — √A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — B <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) }; or that, as the same may be expressed implicitly,
                    “the square root of A + B is the sum of the square roots of the numbers whose
                    sum is A and product ⅜B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>;” which gives this
                    geometrical proposition: “The straight line equal in power to the rectangle
                    under a given line, and the sum of two unequal lines, is composed of two
                    straight lines, which are severally equal m power to the rectangles under the
                    given line and those segments of the greater of the unequal lines whose
                    rectangle is a fourth of the square of the less.” He discusses with equal
                    fulness the propositions contained in the kindred formula √AB = √U(A + √A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)} — ^{⅜(A — √A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)}∙</p>
                <p>This affords a clew to the design of the greater part of the book, and some of
                    the most elegant constructions. In particular, we may discover, in an attentive
                    consideration of these formulae, the origin of those <hi rend="italic"
                    >hexads</hi> of irrational lines, of which he has been obliged to distinguish
                    some by long and rather uncouth names.</p>
                <p>The tenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is amongst the very finest
                    performances of antiquity, for subtilty, clearness, and elegance. (o. o. o.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Incommensurable</hi><hi rend="italic">Numbers</hi> are such
                    as have no common divisor that will divide them both equally.</p>
