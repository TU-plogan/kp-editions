                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">IMAGE</label>, in a religious sense, is an artificial
                    representation or similitude of some person or thing, used either by way of
                    decoration and ornament, or as an object of religious worship and adoration. In
                    the last sense it is used indifferently with the word idol.</p>

                    their ancestors, which were commonly made of Wax or wood, though sometimes of
                    marble or brass, and had them carried in procession at their funerals and
                    triumphs. They placed these images in the vestibules of their houses, where they
                    remained, even if the houses happened to be sold, it being accounted impious to
                    displace them. It was not, however, permitted to all who had the images of their
                    ancestors in their houses, to have them carried at their funerals. This was a
                    distinction granted to such alone as had honourably discharged their offices;
                    for those who failed in this respect forfeited their privilege, and in case they
                    had been guilty of any great crime, their images were broken in pieces.</p>
                <p>The Jews absolutely condemned all images, and did not suffer any statues or
                    figures to be placed in their houses, much less in their synagogues or places of
                    worship.</p>
                <p>The use and adoration of images are subjects which have long been controverted in
                    the world. It appears, from the practice of the primitive church, recorded by
                    the earlier fathers, that Christians, during the first three centuries after
                    Christ, and the greater part of the fourth, neither worshipped images nor used
                    them in worship. However, the greater part of the Roman Catholic divines
                    maintain that the use and worship of images are as ancient as the Christian
                    religion itself; and to prove this, they allege a decree, said to have been made
                    in a council held by the apostles at Antioch, commanding the faithful, that they
                    might not err about the object of their worship, to make images of Christ, and
                    worship them. (Baron, <hi rend="italic">ad Ann.</hi> 102.) But no notice is
                    taken of this decree till seven hundred years after the apostolic times, when
                    the dispute about images had commenced. The first instance which occurs in any
                    credible author, of images amongst Christians, is that recorded by Tertullian
                    <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pudicitia,</hi> c. 10), of certain
                    cups or chalices, as Bellarmine pretends, on which was represented the parable
                    of the good shepherd carrying the lost sheep on his shoulders. But this instance
                    only proves that the church at that time did not think emblematical figures
                    unlawful ornaments of cups or chalices. Another instance is taken from Eusebius
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl,</hi> lib. vii. cap. 18), who says, that in his
                    time there were to be seen two brass statues in the city of Paneas or Caesarea
                    Philippi; the one of a woman on her knees, with her arms stretched out; the
                    other of a man over against her, with his hand extended to receive her. These
                    statues were said to be the images of our Saviour and of the woman whom he cured
                    of an issue of blood. From the foot of the statue representing our Saviour, says
                    the historian, sprung up an exotic plant, which, as soon as it grew to touch the
                    border of his garment, was said to cure all sorts of distempers. Eusebius,
                    however, vouches for none of these things; nay, he supposes that the woman who
                    erected this statue of our Saviour was a pagan, and ascribes it to a pagan
                    custom. The primitive Christians abstained from the worship of images, not, as
                    the Romanists pretend, from tenderness to heathen idolaters, but because they
                    thought it unlawful in itself to make any images of the Deity. (Justin Mart. <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> 1, and <hi rend="italic">Protr.</hi> p. 46; Aug.

                    202.) Some of the fathers, as Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen, were
                    of opinion that, by the second commandment, the arts of painting and engraving
                    were rendered unlawful to a Christian. The custom of admitting pictures of
                    saints and martyrs into the churches was rare in the latter end of the fourth
                    century; but it became common in the fifth, and in the following century the
                    custom of thus adorning churches became almost universal, both in the east and
                    the west.</p>
                <p>The Lutherans censure the Calvinists for breaking the images in the churches of
                    the Catholics, looking on it as a kind of sacrilege; and yet they condemn the
                    Romanists as idolaters.</p>
                <p>The Mahommedans have a perfect aversion to images, which has led them to destroy
                    most of the beautiful monuments of antiquity, both sacred and profane, at
                    Constantinople.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Image,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> signifies a
                    lively representation of any thing in discourse. Images, in discourse, are,
                    according to Longinus, any thoughts proper to produce expressions, which present
                    a kind of picture to the mind. But, in the more limited sense, images are such
                    expressions as fall from us when, by a kind of enthusiasm, or an extraordinary
                    emotion of the soul, we seem to see the things of which we speak, and present
                    them before the eyes of those who hear us.</p>
