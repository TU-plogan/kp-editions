                <p><label type="entry">IVORY</label> is the name given to the tusks of the elephant,
                    and of the walrus or sea-horse. Each male elephant arrived at maturity has two
                    tusks. These are extremely diversified in size, which depends principally on the
                    age of the animal; they are hollow at their insertion into the jaw and for a
                    considerable space therefrom, and always taper to an obtuse extremity. The
                    colour externally is yellowish, brownish, and sometimes dark, but internally it
                    is a cream white. The best tusks are large, straight, and light coloured,
                    without flaws; not very hollow in the stump, but, on the contrary, solid and
                    thick. The most esteemed are obtained from Africa, being of a closer texture,
                    and less liable to become yellow, than those imported from the East Indies. The
                    tusks of the sea-horse afford the hardest and whitest of all ivory. They are
                    usually short, and very much curved; the thick end is hollow, as in the tusk of
                    the elephant; a glossy enamel of extreme hardness covers the cortical part; and
                    they vary in weight from three or four pounds to thirty. The horn or tooth of
                    the narwhal, one of the cetaceous tribe, also consists of ivory, which is as
                    hard as that of the elephant, and susceptible of a fine polish. The largest size
                    is ten feet in length, and some inches thick at the lower extremity, forming a
                    slender cone of a twisted or spiral figure. But its texture is in several
                    respects different from that of other ivory; and there is a prejudice against
                    the ordinary use of it amongst those who work in that material.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times, the people of all the Asiatic countries, where the
                    elephant is found, have had the art of taming the animal, and applying it to
                    useful purposes; but no such art has ever been possessed by any African nation.
                    Nor has this apparently been owing to any difference between the Asiatic and
                    African elephant in point of docility; the real cause is probably to be found in
                    the inferior intelligence and sagacity of the African people. Alexander the
                    Great is believed to have been the first European who employed elephants in war.
                    With regard to those made use of by the Carthaginians, it has been supposed,
                    though with little probability, that they were mostly, if not wholly, imported
                    from India, and that they were managed by Indian conductors, some of whom were
                    captured by the Romans in the great victory gained by Metellus over Asdrubal.
                    But, in the first place, the name of Indian, as used by the Romans, was so
                    extremely vague, that no safe conclusion can be drawn from it; nor, even if the
                    conductors were of that people, does it follow that the elephants had been
                    brought from India. And, secondly, it is not reasonable to suppose that an
                    active and enterprising people, like the Carthaginians, would have imported from
                    a distant country, and at an enormous expense, an animal which, they must have
                    known, was to be found in equal vigour and perfection in their own. On this
                    subject. however, we beg to refer the reader to some learned and valuable notes
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Ancient Universal History</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 529,
                    8vo); and also to Buffon’s article on the elephant, one of the most masterly
                    pieces of composition to be found in his admirable work.</p>
                <p>Ivory is applied to a variety of purposes in the arts. In England, the chief
                    consumption of that commodity is in the manufacture of handles for knives; but
                    it is also extensively used in the manufacture of musical and mathematical
                    instruments, chess-pieces, billiard-balls, thin plates for miniatures, toys, and
                    small works of vertù. Articles in ivory, however, are said to be manufactured to
                    agreater extent, and with much more success, at Dieppe, than at any other place
                    in Europe. But the art of working in this <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944185"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4185-0491"/>beautiful material is far better understood by the
                    Chinese than by any other nation. No European artist has hitherto succeeded in
                    cutting concentric balls after the manner of this people; nor have their boxes,
                    chess-pieces, and other articles manufactured in ivory, been approached, far
                    less rivalled, by any similar productions that are to be met with in other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Ivory, in the rough state, is a very considerable article of commerce. The
                    importation of elephants’ tusks into Great Britain, for twelve years from 1788
                    to 1799 inclusively, amounted to 18,914 cwts. or, on an average, to 1576 cwts.
                    annually. Since that period, however, the trade has much increased. The imports
                    in 1831 and 1832 were, at an average, 4130 cwts., of which 2950 cwts. were
                    retained for home consumption. But as the medium weight of a tusk is about sixty
                    lbs. it follows that the yearly imports of 1831 and 1832 must be taken at 7709
                    tusks, and that, to obtain these, 3854 male elephants must have been destroyed.
                    But, supposing the tusks could only be obtained by killing the animal, the
                    destruction would really be a good deal greater, and must probably have amounted
                    to 4500 or 5000 elephants. Occasionally, however, tusks are accidentally broken,
                    one lost in this way being replaced by a new one; and a good many are also
                    obtained from elephants which have died a natural death. Still it is obvious
                    that the supply from these sources cannot be very large; and if to the quantity
                    of ivory required for Great Britain be added that required for the other
                    countries of Europe, as well as for America and Asia, the slaughter of elephants
                    must, after every deduction, be immense; nor can it fail to excite surprise that
                    the breed of this magnificent animal, and consequently the supply of tusks, has
                    not been more diminished. The western and eastern coasts of Africa, the Cape of
                    Good Hope, Ceylon, India, and the countries to the eastward of the Straits of
                    Malacca, are the great marts whence supplies of ivory are obtained. The imports
                    into Great Britain from Western Africa in 1831 amounted to 2575 cwts. whilst the
                    Cape of Good Hope only furnished 198 cwts. During the same year, the imports
                    from India, Ceylon, and other eastern countries, amounted to 2173 cwts∙ The
                    price per cwt. duty (L.l per cwt.) included, of elephants’ tusks in the London
                    market, in December 1833, was as follows :—</p>
