                <p><label type="entry">ITALY</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> extensive and interesting portion of Europe did
                    not receive the name it has long borne till the extension of the Roman empire.
                    The origin of that name has been derived by different persons from various
                    sources. Timaeus and Varro have deduced it from a Greek word, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ιταλοί,</hi> which signifies an <hi rend="italic">ox,</hi> because it contains
                    a vast extent of pasture land, peculiarly adapted to that animal. Thucydides and
                    Dionysius of Halicarnassus derive the name from a king Italus. In early periods
                    it was sometimes called Saturnia, from the name of a deity, Saturn, in the
                    heathen mythology. It was sometimes called (Eno-tria, from a Sabine chief named
                    Oenotrius; and frequently Ausonia, from Auson, a son <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Ulysses, who is said to have established a tribe in the centre of the peninsula.
                    All of these more ancient names seem, however, to have referred only to
                    particular districts, which, when the Roman power had subjected them all,
                    assumed, with the other parts subsequently united to them, the general name it
                    still continues to bear. The Greeks at all times applied to it the name
                    Hesperia, on account of its being to the westward from their country; and the
                    Teutones or Germans called it Waelschland, because the parts nearest to them
                    were inhabited by a people called Galles, changed into Walles; and in their
                    present language the name of Waelschland is still retained by the common
                    people.</p>
                <p> The history of Italy before the rise of the Roman power is, like that of all
                    rude nations, involved in obscurity, or clouded with indistinctness; through
                    which the indefatigable Niebuhr, with a profusion of learning, has endeavoured
                    to grope his way. Before Rome began to be powerful, Italy was peopled by
                    inhabitants who had made some advances towards civilization. In the northern
                    part the Gauls were rude and fierce, and they the longest resisted the
                    encroaching power; whilst lower down, on the Arno and the Tiber, there was a
                    number of smaller tribes, such as the Etruscans, the Samnites, and the Latins,
                    who, in a kind of confederacy, though sometimes at variance with one another,
                    long sought, and ultimately in vain, to defend their freedom against the rising
                    and aspiring city. In the southern parts were colonies of emigrants from Greece,
                    with but little union, and frequently engaged in hostilities amongst themselves.
                    When and by what means all these tribes became finally subjected to Rome,
                    belongs to the history of that empire; for the history of the conquered is
                    swallowed up in that of the conquerors.</p>
                <p>The fate of Italy was that of Rome till the dissolution of that colossal power.
                    When the seat of empire was removed to Constantinople, Italy, though accounted a
                    portion of the western empire, was treated as a dependent province, and
                    continued with only the semblance of power, which power was finally wrested from
                    all dependence on Byzantium by an adventurous Gothic warrior, who, about the
                    year 476 of the Christian era, founded the kingdom of Italy.</p>
                <p>Odoacer had raised himself, by his intrigues amongst the mercenary guards, to the
                    command of those troops, who from inactivity had become restless and mutinous.
                    Augustulus, the last emperor of the West, was unable to resist the power of his
                    disaffected troops, and withdrew to Pavia. That city was besieged, captured, and
                    ravaged, and Augustulus retired to obscurity, when Odoacer proclaimed himself
                    king of Italy. He exercised the power with dignity, and, as regarded Augustulus,
                    with clemency, by assigning him a liberal establishment, during the few years
                    that remained of his life, in the retreat he had selected in Campania. Italy was
                    in a wretched state, and Odoacer used as much prudence and humanity as could
                    have been exercised by a rude conqueror, to improve the condition and the
                    institutions of the country; but the licentious troops who had been the means of
                    his obtaining it could not be kept in obedience by a power so created, and
                    disorders became universal. When Odoacer had reigned fourteen years, Theodoric,
                    king of the Ostrogoths, at the instigation of the Emperor Zeno, who reigned in
                    Byzantium, invaded the newly-founded kingdom; defeated and assassinated Odoacer;
                    and, in 493, added the whole of Italy to his dominions, which thus extended from
                    the Alps to Sicily. The only part not subjected was some islands in the lagunes
                    of the Adriatic Sea, inhabited by fishermen and salt-makers, who had first found
                    a refuge in these from the ravages of Attila, and had there secured freedom, and
                    by their union, and by the capability of defending themselves, laid the
                    foundation of what subsequently became the republic of Venice. In the favoured
                    climate of Italy, and under the government of Theodoric, the Goths multiplied
                    rapidly; and they were almost the sole masters of the soil, and of the slaves
                    who cultivated it. By his external policy he had acquired the confidence of the
                    other Gothic tribes, even in the remote regions that border on the Baltic Sea,
                    and had introduced strong and regular forms of government into Rhaetia, Noricum,
                    Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Though the jealousy of the emperor at Byzantium induced
                    him to invade the territory commanded by Theodoric, and to employ both a large
                    fleet and a powerful army, his attempts were repelled by sea and by land, and
                    his forces were dispersed or dispirited, and retired from the contest.</p>
                <p>Theodoric was not less successful in another attack from the west by King Clovis,
                    the leader of the Franks, who were checked in the midst of a career which had
                    commenced with brilliant success.</p>
                <p>Ravenna was the seat of the government of this prince, though he occasionally
                    resided at Verona. He once visited Rome, where he was received with rapture by
                    the populace, and with the highest marks of respect by the senators. During the
                    latter and peaceful portion of his reign he endeavoured to amalgamate his
                    Italian and Gothic subjects; but his success was much obstructed by the
                    religious controversy between the orthodox and the Arians, though, whilst
                    adhering to the latter sect, he tolerated and even honoured many <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the other profession. But a union was in some measure
                    effected between the conquerors and the conquered, and civilization was advanced
                    during this long reign, although at the sacrifice of the manly simplicity of the
                    former to the corruption and luxurious indulgences of the latter.</p>
                <p>Theodoric died in the palace he had built at Ravenna, in 526, after a reign of
                    thirty-three years, having by his will divided his dominions between two
                    grandsons, bequeathing Italy to Athalaric, then a boy of twelve years of age.
                    The youthful sovereign was left under the pupillage of his mother Amalasontha,
                    from which he was early withdrawn by the flatterers who surrounded him. His
                    mother then entered into intrigues with the Emperor Justinian, tending to
                    deliver up Italy to its ancient dependence on the court of Byzantium. Her son,
                    as he advanced in age, entered on the most dissolute courses, by which his life
                    was terminated in the sixteenth year of his age. His mother, who assumed the
                    power, was speedily assassinated by a husband she had chosen to be a sharer of
                    the throne.</p>
                <p>The imperial court was eager to take advantage of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943847" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3847-0465"/>unsettled state of Italy to
                    reduce it again under subjection. Belisarius, the most renowned of the generals,
                    was despatched, but with an inconsiderable force. Hostilities raged with great
                    fury, and after a variety of changes in the aspect of affairs, the imperial
                    commander had so weakened the Goths, and so engaged the confidence and
                    assistance of the Italian inhabitants, that the prospect of complete subjugation
                    presented itself. This was, however, clouded by the dissensions which broke out
                    amongst the officers in command of the several divisions of the army of
                    Justinian in 538. At that time the chief command was conferred on Narses, a
                    eunuch, whose conduct at that period, whatever military merit he afterwards
                    displayed, tended greatly to the injury of his sovereign’s party.</p>
                <p>Narses was indeed soon recalled, and Belisarius reinstated in the supreme
                    command; but in the midst of discord the Goths had been permitted to breathe, an
                    important season was lost, Milan had been destroyed, and the northern provinces
                    of Italy were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks. Under Belisarius the
                    events of the war underwent a favourable change; he captured the strongly
                    fortified city of Ravenna, and returned with numerous captives to Constantinople
                    to receive the applause of the people and a splendid triumph, the last reward of
                    his valour and his humanity.</p>
                <p>The removal of Belisarius from Italy revived the spirits of the remaining Goths,
                    and the feeble efforts of the successive generals of Justinian were insufficient
                    to crush the civil war. The handful of the barbarians, scarcely amounting to
                    five thousand, and in possession of no other strong place than Pavia, chose
                    Totila for their chief, and proclaimed him king of Italy, in the year 54∣1.</p>
                <p>His progress was rapid, and almost without interruption, from the north of Italy
                    to Naples. He captured that city, and returned to Rome, which he besieged; and
                    though Belisarius, who had been recalled from the wars of Persia, attempted to
                    relieve it, he was unable to do so; and the citizens, compelled by famine,
                    allowed the Goths to occupy the capital of the western empire in the year 546.
                    After an useless occupation of Rome when it had been abandoned by Totila,
                    Belisarius was recalled to Constantinople, and the command once more conferred
                    upon Narses, who was furnished with troops, stores, and money, with a profusion
                    widely different from the parsimony exercised towards his predecessor. He
                    advanced with his forces by the head of the Adriatic Sea, and in a tremendous
                    battle encountered the Goths under Totila, whom he totally defeated, whilst that
                    chief was killed in the conflict. After his death, those who had escaped elected
                    Tejas as their king; but he too became the victim of his ambition, was soon
                    subdued by Narses, and with him terminated, in 553, the Gothic kingdom of Italy,
                    by the capture of the last of their fortified places.</p>
                <p>Italy, after these events, became once more a province of the Roman empire, of
                    which Ravenna formed the capital, and in which the representatives of the
                    emperor, the exarchs, fixed their residence. Narses, the first of them, was
                    removed by the jealousy of the Byzantine court; and his successors neglected the
                    defence of the Alpine passes, by which the Longobards, or Lombards, a German
                    race, entered the country. They are supposed to have been of Scandinavian
                    origin, and to have gained a settlement between the Oder and the Elbe in the
                    reign of Augustus. I hey gradually descended towards the south, and approached
                    the Danube. At the solicitation of Justinian, they passed that river, to reduce,
                    in pursuance of a treaty, the cities of Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia;
                    but the spirit of rapine soon tempted them beyond these limits, and at length,
                    under Alboin, in 568, they penetrated into Italy.</p>
                <p>Before the Lombards entered Italy, they were established on the frontiers of the
                    Roman empire, and had for neighbours two other barbarous tribes, the Avars and
                    the Gepidae, who were sometimes hostile towards each other, though commonly at
                    peace, demanding and receiving what they deemed tribute, but what the
                    imperialists in their weak state denominated presents. The Avars and the
                    Lombards, at the instigation or with the connivance of the Emperor Justin, the
                    successor of Justinian, jointly attacked the Gepidae. The bravest of them fell
                    in battle; their king Cunimund was slain, and his daughter Rosamund became the
                    captive of Alboin, the chief of the Lombards, and by marriage shared that throne
                    which had before been occupied by the daughter of Clovis, the king of the
                    Franks.</p>
                <p>The ambition of Alboin was excited rather than satisfied by the conquest of the
                    Gepidae, and the submission of the Avars to his authority; and he turned his
                    eyes from the Danube to the richer banks of the Po and the Tiber. Fifteen years
                    before, his subjects, as the confederates of Narses, had visited Italy; the
                    mountains, the rivers, and the highways, were familiar to their memory. The
                    report of their success, and the views of the spoil, kindled in the rising
                    generation the flame of emulation and of enterprise. Their hopes were encouraged
                    by the spirit and eloquence of their leader. No sooner had Alboin, or Alboinus,
                    erected his standard, than the native strength of the Lombards was multiplied by
                    the adventurous youth of Germany and Scythia. The robust peasantry of Noricum
                    and Pannonia resumed the manners of barbarians; and the names of the Gepidae, as
                    well as of the Bulgarians, the Sarmatians, and the Sueves, are now to be found
                    in the provinces of Italy. It has been said that Narses the eunuch, to resent an
                    affront offered him by the Empress Sophia, the wife of Justin, had instigated
                    Alboin to the attempt, and counselled him to form an alliance with the Huns
                    before he commenced his operations.</p>
                <p>The whole nation of the Lombards, accompanied by their allies, and attended by
                    their wives, their children, their cattle, and their most valuable effects,
                    began their march in April 568. They had no opposition to encounter as they
                    passed through the Venetian country, and the city of Aquileia opened its gates,
                    most of the inhabitants having abandoned their homes at the approach of the
                    formidable invaders. Alboin passed the winter in Friuli, with his troops
                    quartered around him, which city he erected into a dukedom, and appointed his
                    nephew Gisulphus to govern and watch over the territory. In the succeeding year
                    the conqueror advanced and occupied Trevigio, Oder-zo, Vicenza, Verona, and
                    Trent, leaving in each city a garrison, and intrusting the whole to one of his
                    officers, with the title of duke during his command. Padua and some other cities
                    were passed by, either because they did not intercept his progress, or because
                    they were too strongly garrisoned. In the third campaign Alboin passed into
                    Northern Liguria, and possessed himself of Brescia, Bergamo, Lodi, and Como,
                    with little opposition, the inhabitants having escaped to the mountains. Milan,
                    then the capital of Liguria, was captured after a short siege, the principal
                    people, with their bishop, Honoratus, having fled to Genoa. In Milan the
                    ceremony of the inauguration was solemnly performed. Alboin was lifted on a
                    shield in the midst of his troops, received the emblems of royalty then in use,
                    and was proclaimed king of Italy.</p>
                <p>From Milan Alboin sent out expeditions, which reduced Piacenza, Parma, and
                    Modena, and the other inland cities in Aemilia and Tuscany. At Pavia he met an
                    obstinate resistance, but, after a siege which endured more than three years,
                    that city at length surrendered; and being strongly fortified, it was fixed as
                    his place of residence, and long continued to be the capital of the Lombard
                    kingdom. Whilst Alboin was in Pavia taking the steps necessary to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943860" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3860-0466"/>defend the dominions he had
                    acquired, and to reconcile his new subjects to his rule, he was murdered at the
                    instigation of his wife, in the palace at Pavia, in the year 575. The queen,
                    with her paramour, made an attempt to obtain the command of the Lombards; but
                    not succeeding in their purpose, they fled to the Roman garrison at Ravenna,
                    where both perished most miserably. Clephis, a relation of Alboin, having been
                    raised to the throne, extended the Lombard power to the gates of Rome; but he
                    conducted himself with such cruelty, that he was killed by his own people, after
                    a reign of less than a year. His actions produced a dislike to monarchical
                    power, and for ten years no king was chosen. The dukes who had been created
                    among the chiefs of the Lombards acted in their respective territories as
                    independent but allied sovereigns. Under this kind of government their power
                    continued to extend, and that of the emperor gradually retreated before it. The
                    want of a central authority was, however, soon discovered; and, in 586,
                    Autharis, the son of Clephis, was chosen as king, and, by his valour and
                    prudence, established the throne so securely, that it continued to flourish
                    through the two succeeding centuries. It is not necessary to enter into a minute
                    history of the several kings of Lombardy who ascended the throne of that
                    country. A kind of aristocratic monarchy was created, composed of thirty
                    principalities, the chiefs of which were distinguished by the titles of dukes,
                    counts, or barons, which, with the revenues of the land, were held as fiefs
                    under the kings, and became gradually hereditary. The islands of the Adriatic
                    were formed into a republic, and the inhabitants, by electing, in 697, their
                    first doge or duke, formed an independent and central government. The exarch
                    appointed by the government at Constantinople held authority at the city of
                    Ravenna, and had under his power Romagna, the Pentapolis, or five maritime
                    cities of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigaglia, and Ancona, and almost the whole
                    sea-shores of Lower Italy, where Amalfi and Gaeta had their own dukes of the
                    Greek nation. The island of Sicily, and the capital, Rome, in which a patrician
                    ruled in the name of the emperor, formed also parts of the imperial
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>Constantly pressed upon by the Lombards, the power and influence of
                    Constantinople gradually declined; and its fall was hastened by the Emperor Leo,
                    called the Isaurian, whose zeal in the destruction of images embittered the
                    clergy of the orthodox church in Italy. The inhabitants of cities forcibly
                    expelled the imperial authorities, and elected a senate, with consuls, as in the
                    time of the Roman republic. In Rome itself a certain power was acknowledged in
                    the bishop, which, on account of the sanctity of his character, was of a
                    paternal nature; at first it was exercised in ecclesiastical affairs, but by
                    degrees extended to civil matters, and in process of time arrived at temporal
                    sovereignty. The popes, who were anxious to defend their territory against the
                    Lombards, when the Byzantine court had neglected or abandoned them, applied for
                    assistance to the Franks.</p>
                <p>It may not be improper here to remark, that the original Lombard invaders,
                    composed as they were of various tribes, comprised different religions, some of
                    them still adhering to the ancient heathenism, either of the Greek or the Gothic
                    description; whilst others had embraced the Christian religion, but with the
                    heretical tenets of Arianism. These tribes, with little attention or little
                    adherence to any doctrinal points, had gradually been led to embrace the
                    profession of the Roman Catholic church. Luitprand, who ascended the throne of
                    Lombardy in 711, was the last of that nation to abandon his heresies, which he
                    did in the presence of Pope Gregory at Rome in 729; upon which the pontiff made
                    a public renunciation of his allegiance to the imperial court, and withdrew all
                    claim of obedience from it. Gregory was, however, indisposed to form an alliance
                    with Luitprand, whose vicinity to the capital of his diocese he viewed with
                    suspicion. When the emperor was making preparations to invade Italy, in order to
                    enforce his decrees for the destruction of images, the pope addressed himself to
                    the Frankish monarch, then one of the most powerful princes of w estern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The Franks were at that time governed by the celebrated Charles Martel, who had
                    highly distinguished himself in war, and was considered as the best commander of
                    his time. Gregory despatched an embassy to his residence with numerous presents
                    of holy relics. It was received with respectful distinction, and a treaty was
                    speedily concluded, by which Charles engaged to march with an army into Italy in
                    defence of Rome and of the church, in casé any attack should be made by the
                    emperor or the king of Lombardy. The Romans, on their part, were to acknowledge
                    Charles as their protector, and to confer upon him the dignity of the
                    consulship.</p>
                <p>Leo the Isaurian was succeeded by his son Constantine surnamed Copronymus, who
                    carried his rage against images to a greater extent than his predecessor, and
                    forbade the worship of the saints and of the Virgin Mary. This occasioned new
                    disturbances in Italy, and made the Romans more zealous than before to separate
                    themselves from their dependence on Constantinople. Zachary, who had succeeded
                    to the chair of St Peter, urged on Luitprand the restoration of the four cities,
                    and also the district of Sabina, which had been seized upon thirty years before;
                    and in compliance with the representation, they were thus added to the sacred
                    patrimony. Luitprand died in 743, after a reign of thirty-two years. His son
                    Rachis, who succeeded him, was anxious to extend his dominions, and invaded the
                    territory ceded to the holy see by his father, when Pope Zachary visited him,
                    and, by his representation of the punishment hereafter to be inflicted on those
                    who violated the rights of the church, so operated upon his mind, that he not
                    only restored the towns and territory he had seized, but took the habit of a
                    monk, and entered into the monastery of Monte Cassino, where he passed the
                    remainder of his days, honoured as a saint by the other monks of the
                    fraternity.</p>
                <p>Astulphus succeeded his father on the Lombard throne in 751. The exarchate of
                    Ravenna and the duchy of Rome excited his love for conquest. The city, the
                    capital of the first, was surrendered with little difficulty. He advanced
                    towards Rome, and, when arrived at Narni, sent an embassy to the pope,
                    announcing his determination to enter that city, to seize the wealth of the
                    Romans, and to impose a tax of a golden solidus on every one who would not swear
                    allegiance to the Lombard throne. Stephen, who then filled the papal chair,
                    attempted by negotiation to avert the threatened storm; but failing to appease
                    Astulphus, in imitation of his predecessor, he had recourse to the assistance of
                    France. Pepin, the son of Charles Martel, now filled the throne of that kingdom,
                    and professed unlimited obedience to the holy see. Stephen, by the consent, or
                    at least connivance, of Astulphus, whose forces were encamped round the city of
                    Rome, made a journey to France, and Pepin immediately, accompanied by the pope,
                    passed the Alps with a large army, and advanced into Italy. Astulphus could not
                    raise a sufficient force to repulse his assailants, and, after some slight
                    reverses, retired to Pavia. In that city he was besieged, and compelled to sue
                    for peace. This was granted, upon the condition that he should give up, not to
                    the emperor, but to the pope, the several cities he had captured in the
                    exarchate and the dukedom, and deliver hostages for the performance of the
                    conditions agreed on. Pepin with his forces returned to France; and the pope
                    proceeded with exultation to the south, in the expectation of being placed in
                    possession of the cities and territories which Astulphus had stipulated to
                    deliver up, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943873" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3873-0467"
                    />and which Pepin had guaranteed to the holy see. The Lombard king, however, as
                    soon as the storm had passed over, broke into the dukedom and besieged Rome. The
                    pope again had recourse to Pcpin, who readily advanced. Astulphus, after an
                    unavailing siege of three months, abandoned Rome, and once more took refuge in
                    the strong fortifications of Pavia. During this second siege, which Pepin
                    speedily commenced, an embassy from the Emperor Constantine Copronymus arrived
                    at his camp, to remonstrate against the donation of the exarchate to the pope;
                    and offered to repay the expenses of the war to France, if the territories were
                    delivered over to the power of the emperor. Pcpin replied to the envoys, that
                    “as he had a right to those territories by the sword, and had thought proper to
                    bestow them on the pope, nothing should induce him to alter his resolution.” By
                    a vigorous prosecution of the war, Pepin obtained a peace; and for the pope the
                    city of Commachio, in addition to what had been before ceded to him. From this
                    period, 756, the pontiffs assumed the language as well as the power of
                    sovereigns, no longer using for the dates of their rescripts the year of the
                    reign of the emperor, but that of their own pontificates.</p>
                <p>Astulphus, soon after executing the treaty concluded at Pavia, met an untimely
                    death, the manner of which, however, has been variously described. During the
                    succeeding twenty years the Lombards languished in a state of weakness and
                    decay, but interrupted by a disputed succession, which ended in the elevation of
                    Desiderius to the vacant throne. A double marriage was arranged between two
                    daughters of this Lombard king and Carloman and Charles (usually called
                    Charlemagne), the sons of Pepin. Charles soon divorced his wife, under the
                    pretence of barrenness; and Carloman died, leaving two sons, the grandsons of
                    Desiderius, who detained them in the hope that they might be made use of to
                    produce disturbances in France. Thus family jealousy was one amongst many
                    grounds of quarrel. Desiderius was induced to attack the dominions granted to
                    the pope; and, at the invitation of the pontiff, Charlemagne advanced with a
                    large army. Desiderius, like his father, took refuge in Pavia; and after the
                    capture of Verona, and a visit to Rome, Charlemagne drew up his forces, a part
                    of which had blockaded it, around that city. The defence was brave and
                    protracted; but by famine, and by the plague, which raged within the walls, the
                    city was at length compelled to surrender. Desiderius being thus made prisoner,
                    and sent with his family to France, all the other cities submitted to
                    Charlemagne in 774. That monarch claimed the kingdom of the Lombards by right of
                    conquest, and caused himself to be crowned king, with an iron crown, by the
                    hands of the Archbishop of Milan, in the presence of his army, at a place called
                    Modastia, about twelve miles from that city.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the kingdom of Lombardy, after it had existed two hundred and six
                    years. Though the Lombard kings were at first rude and barbarous, yet, when they
                    had embraced the Christian religion, they ruled with great equity and mildness.
                    “Under their government,” says Paulus Diaconus, “no violence was committed, no
                    one unjustly dispossessed of his property, none oppressed with taxes; theft,
                    robberies, murder, and adultery, were seldom heard of, and every one went
                    whither he pleased. They were the onlyτ&gt;ower in Italy capable of defeating
                    the ambitious views of the bishops of Rome, and hence arose the inveterate
                    hatred which the popes bore to them; but their many wholesome laws, which are
                    still extant, are at the same time convincing proofs of their justice, humanity,
                    and wisdom, and a full confutation, as Grotius observes, of the many calumnies
                    with which the popes and their partisans have endeavoured to asperse them.”</p>
                <p>The conduct of Charlemagne to his newly-acquired kingdom appears to have been
                    wise and liberal. He sanctioned the laws by which the districts had been
                    governed, whether Roman or Lombard; but to the latter he made a few additions.
                    The emperor was left in quiet possession of the dnkedom of Naples, and of the
                    other places in Italy that he held. He allowed to the Dukes of Spoleto, Friuli,
                    and Benevento, the same power and authority as they had exercised under the
                    Lombard kings; and the smaller dukes were continued in their dignities, but were
                    compelled to take annually the oaths of allegiance to him; and, unless they
                    violated it, the dignity was made hereditary in their families. Having thus
                    settled the affairs of Italy, he returned to France, having, in 781, appointed
                    his son Pcpin his viceroy.</p>
                <p>A seditious controversy in Rome, respecting the election of a pope, induced Leo
                    III. who had been raised to that dignity, to pass the Alps and apply for
                    protection to Charlemagne, against the Roman populace. The conqueror of Italy,
                    in consequence of this, repaired to Rome, where, on Christmas day 800, during
                    the celebration of divine rites, Leo suddenly placed a valuable crown on his
                    head, and the church resounded with the acclamations of the people, “Long life
                    and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God, the great and
                    pacific emperor of the Romans.” The title thus conferred by the pretended sudden
                    impulse of a pope, on a conqueror who denied all participation in the project,
                    has been retained by his German successors, till it was abandoned in the present
                    century, out of compliment to revolutionary France.</p>
                <p>During the life of Charlemagne, whilst his son Pepin was acting as viceroy,
                    Venice, which had grown up to be a consolidated and warlike power, disavowed the
                    title conferred by the pope, and commenced hostilities against his Italian
                    dominions. The Saracens, a new power, availed themselves of the circumstances,
                    and attacked the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, where they obtained much
                    plunder, and made many of the inhabitants captives. Pepin equipped an army and a
                    fleet to reduce Venice to submission; but having failed in the attempt, and lost
                    most of his vessels among the shoals and rocks of the islands, chagrin at the
                    reverses he sustained caused his death, which took place soon afterwards at
                    Milan. A natural son of Pepin, named Bernard, was nominated by Charlemagne as
                    his viceroy in Italy.</p>
                <p>Charlemagne died in 813, and was succeeded by his son Louis. Louis and Bernard
                    met at Aix-la-Chapelle, and appeared to have arranged the mode of ruling the
                    extensive dominions of their departed ancestor; but the ambition of Bernard led
                    him to attack his uncle, and to dispute his succession. Louis, however, was
                    enabled to baffle his aspiring nephew, who was defeated, captured, and condemned
                    to the loss of sight, under which operation he expired, in the fifth year of his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>Italy remained as a portion of the Frankish monarchy till the treaty of Verdun in
                    843, when it was delivered over, with the imperial title, and with the addition
                    of the country of Lorraine, to Lotharius I. the eldest son of Louis. He
                    bequeathed his dominion to Louis II. in 850, who appears to have been the best
                    of the princes of the Carlovignian race. He died, after a prosperous but rather
                    a turbulent reign, in 875. The election of a pope, Benedict III. his rejection
                    by Louis, and the ultimate submission of the monarch to its legality, were
                    sources of vexation, though not of actual hostility. In the latter years of his
                    reign, the Saracens, instigated by the emperor, invaded the south of Italy; but
                    having been defeated near Capua, they were expelled the country. Three years
                    afterwards they again resumed their attacks, and besieged Salerno; but meeting
                    with a severe repulse, they again departed, leaving Italy at peace at the time
                    of the death of the monarch.</p>
                <p>His death seemed the signal for discord, from the various<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192943886" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3886-0468"/> claimants in the imperial
                    family to the Italian dominions. Charles the Bald of France first took
                    possession; but dying in 877, Carloman, king of Bavaria, seized the inheritance;
                    and he was followed in 880 by his brother Charles the Fat, king of Suabia, who,
                    for the last time, united under one sovereign the whole of the Frankish
                    monarchy. During seven years Italy was the theatre of lawless violence, in which
                    the nobles required an Italian prince, and the pope was anxious to have a
                    foreigner placed on the throne; whilst the Saracens, availing themselves of the
                    disturbances, extorted money from the pope as the price of peace, and still
                    continued their depredations. Berengar duke of Friuli, and Guido duke of
                    Spoleto, with the Marquis of Ivrea, were rivals for the throne; but Guido was,
                    in 894, crowned as emperor and king, and his son Lambert nominated as his
                    successor in these dignities. Arnulf, the German king of the Carlovignian race,
                    urged and succeeded in his pretensions, and was crowned in 896; but, like those
                    who succeeded him, he was unable to exercise any considerable power except
                    whilst he continued to reside among his subjects.</p>
                <p>After the death of Lambert in 898, and of Arnulf in 899, Louis, king of Lower
                    Burgundy, appeared as the rival of Berengar I., but without effect; and the same
                    fate befell another claimant, Rudolph of Upper Burgundy; in spite of the
                    pretensions of both, the possession of the throne was at length, in 915, in the
                    hands of Berengar, who was solemnly crowned. The power in the hands of the
                    feudal vassals of the throne was so much weakened by the recent dissensions,
                    that it became almost impossible to repress the plundering inroads which the
                    Saracens were continually making on his dominions. This monarch was murdered in
                    924, when Rudolph of Upper Burgundy was induced to transfer his pretensions to
                    the throne to Hugo, count of Provence. Hugo endavoured, by the exercise of the
                    most bloody tyranny, to gain the unsteady dominion of Italy; but his nephew
                    Berengar, marquis of Ivrea, having escaped some snares that were laid for him,
                    fled for refuge to Otho the Great, in Germany, collected there a number of
                    fugitives, turned towards Italy, and in 945 succeeded in compelling Hugo to
                    abdicate the throne, and transfer it to his son Lotharius, who was less the
                    object of general aversion than himself, and who, upon his accession, appointed
                    Berengar his first minister of state.</p>
                <p>The death of Lotharius occurred in 950, and was supposed to have been the result
                    of poison administered by Berengar, who was desirous to force the beautiful wife
                    of the former to unite with his son. To avoid this match, and to escape from the
                    consequences of rejecting it, she fled for safety to the city of Canosa, against
                    which her persecutor commenced a siege. She then applied for assistance to King
                    Otho. He with great expedition passed the Alps, liberated the lady, defeated
                    Berengar, captured Pavia, and having seated himself on the throne of Italy,
                    espoused the fair Adelheid in 951. Berengar made himself useful to the new
                    sovereign by his early submission, and by his delivering up the Friouls, the
                    keys of Italy, to the brother of Otho; and thence his offers of service were
                    accepted, and he was appointed to rule the country in the name of Otho. After
                    ten years, complaints reached the throne from the great vassals in Italy, when
                    Otho returned there, dismissed Berengar from his station, led him as a prisoner
                    to Bamberg in Germany, and having united Italy with his German dominions, was
                    crowned with the iron crown at Milan in the year 961. Otho certainly granted the
                    best lands as feuds to his German nobles; but he conferred great privileges on
                    the cities ofltaly,and on these were grounded free constitutions, which,
                    however, soon converted the country into a theatre of anarchy. During the tenth
                    century, the liberality of the Frankish kings, who had served their purpose, so
                    corrupted the church, and so weakened the royal authority, that it effectively
                    undermined it; whilst the clergy and the people elected the popes accore.ing to
                    the dictation of the consuls and of the inferior patricians. Thus it happened
                    that, in the first half of the tenth century, two eminent intriguing females
                    disposed of the holy see. Theodora, in 914, raised her son by her lover Pope
                    John X., to the chair of St Peter, which he filled under the name of John XI.
                    The brother of the last, Alberich of Camerino, and his son Octavian, were
                    absolute masters of Rome; and the latter was consecrated pope in 956, at the age
                    of twenty years. Otho, when crowned at Rome in 962, annulled the election, and
                    appointed Leo VH1. in his stead; but the people, jealous of this exercise of
                    power, elected Benedict V. The popes, instead of governing Rome, were thus
                    themselves dependent on the leaders of the populace.</p>
                <p>The republics of Gaeta and Amalfi, in the Neapolitan part of Italy, still
                    maintained their independence against the Lombard dukedom of Benevento. This was
                    more easily defended, from a division having been made of the territory of the
                    dukedom, which diminished its power, and because they had a common enemy to
                    contend with in the Saracens, who had by each party been invited to afford them
                    assistance in their quarrels, but who had fixed themselves in Apulia, and there
                    constructed powerful fortifications. The Emperor Louis II. and King Macedo, by
                    their united forces, had so broken the power of the Mussulmans in 866, that the
                    latter could no longer maintain themselves in Lower Italy; and thus enabled the
                    Greeks to form establishments on the territory previously occupied by the
                    Saracens. They founded a province, called the Thema of Lombardy, which was ruled
                    by a chief residing in Bari, and which maintained its independence during more
                    than a hundred years.</p>
                <p>Otho the Great was succeeded, in 973, by his son Otho II. Under his reign
                    Crescentius, then consul in Rome, on the pretence of restoring the ancient
                    constitution, attempted to secure to himself the sole power of that city; whilst
                    Otho was occupied in carrying on some plans of conquest in Lower Italy, and
                    suffered the vicious popes, Boniface VII. and John XV. to exercise supreme
                    authority. But, in 983, Otho III. succeeded his father, and elevated his cousin
                    Gregory V. to the papal throne, when C4escentius, with the assistance of the
                    populace, was enabled to drive him from the city, and to fill his station with a
                    Greek pope, John XVI.; and he attempted also to lead back the Romans to an
                    apparent subjection to the Greek emperor. Otho soon replaced Pope Gregory in the
                    papal chair by force, and besieged Crescentius in the Castle of St Angelo, where
                    he was at length, with twelve others of his associates, made prisoner, and,
                    along with them, suffered decapitation in 998. Though compelled to take the
                    oaths of allegiance, the submission of the city was reluctant, and the
                    disposition to throw it off was only repressed by force of arms.</p>
                <p>The death of Otho III. in 1002 was deemed by the Italians a dissolution of their
                    connection with the German emperors, and Hardouin, marquis of Ivrea, was crowned
                    king of Italy in Pavia; upon which the jealousy of the Milanese, the habitual
                    rivals and enemies of Pavia, induced the citizens of that place to declare Henry
                    II. of Germany as king also. The immediate consequence was a civil war, in which
                    each city and district took a greater or a less part, and all suffered most
                    severely. Henry was indeed, in 1004, acknowledged by the assembly of nobles
                    collected in Pavia; but, in the tumult which arose on the occasion, a great part
                    of the city was destroyed by fire.</p>
                <p>After the death of Hardouin in 1015, Henry was acknowledged as king by the whole
                    of Lombardy; as was <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943899"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-3899-0469"/>also, after his death, his son Conrad II. who was,
                    however, known in Italy as Italus or Italicus I. A general assembly was held
                    near Piacenza, at which all the power of the feudatories was declared to be
                    hereditary by an irreversible law, and zealous attempts were made to obtain
                    peace and security to all the states. These efforts were ineffectual, from the
                    rage between the growing cities and their bishops, as well as the hatred between
                    the clergy and the nobles, and between those bodies and the inferior
                    inhabitants. In republican Rome, where the family of Crescentius still directed
                    the voices of the public, neither Henry, nor Conrad, nor the pope, could enforce
                    obedience. When Henry III. the son of Conrad, came to Italy in 1046, he found no
                    less than three popes in Rome. These he displaced, and selected, by his sole
                    power, Clement II. who was placed in the chair of St Peter; and regularly
                    afterwards raised to the spiritual dignities respectable German ecclesiastics.
                    This reform, although apparently wise at the time, as giving dignity to the
                    pontiffs, was afterwards found in practice to have tended to corrupt them.</p>
                <p>During the long minority of Henry IV. after the death of his father, Hildebrand,
                    a monk, afterwards Pope Gregory VII. took the lead in opposition to the temporal
                    power, and increased that of the ecclesiastical to an alarming extent. This
                    increase of clerical power was much promoted by the transactions of the Normans.
                    As early as the year 1016, some warriors from Normandy settled in Apulia and
                    Calabria, and having early formed alliances with the Lombards, the republics, or
                    the Greeks, as best served their purpose, against the Saracens, they became,
                    through their warlike habits, a very powerful party. Leo IX. made several
                    attempts to draw them away; but these all failed, and ended in his own captivity
                    and submission. Nicholas II. on the other hand, formed alliances with the Norman
                    leaders, and in 1059 endowed Robert Guiscard with the feudal rights of all the
                    lands he had conquered in Lower Italy. Afterwards, the popes, in the contentions
                    with the imperial power, trusted chiefly to the aid they could draw from their
                    faithful confederates, the newly-created Dukes of Apulia and Calabria, to whom
                    were afterwards added the chiefs of the Normans in the island of Sicily. Whilst,
                    in the south of Italy, the small states thus became larger, in the north the
                    great states were broken up into several of small extent and power. The Lombard
                    states founded their subsequent greatness, and Venice, Genoa, and Pisa had
                    already become rich and powerful. The Pisans, who, in 980, were in alliance with
                    Otho II. and performed great services against the Greeks, and against the
                    Saracens in Lower Italy, united with the Genoese, now a seafaring and warlike
                    people, to attack the unbelievers in Sardinia, and twice, in 1017 and 1050,
                    conquered those intruders, and finally divided the lands, in large districts,
                    amongst the most eminent of the native inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Gregory VIL, usually called Gregory the Great, was at the head of the church,
                    using all the exertions and influence of his station to extend its power. He
                    laid claims to authority over Spain as a fief of the church, and required of
                    that kingdom all the conquests which had been made from the Moors. Sardinia was
                    demanded of the conquerors, and France was under his authority. He made attempts
                    to exercise his power in Hungary, and even in Russia; and extorted from England
                    the tax known by the name of Peter’s pence,'which long continued to be paid. In
                    Italy, where knowledge had begun to dawn, there were many opposed to the vast
                    extension of the papal power; but they were outnumbered by others, who feared
                    more the government of a German prince. In most of the other parts of Europe the
                    regular priests had so much influence, that the monstrous pretensions of the
                    pontiff were submitted to with little or no reluctance. It was not so, however,
                    in Germany. The policy of Gregory had enjoined on the priests the observance of
                    celibacy, and the German clergy were reluctant to put away their wives. They
                    opposed the pope’s decrees, and joined with the emperor in resisting them. The
                    German bishops in council pronounced the deposition of the pope; and the pontiff
                    issued his excommunications against them and their emperor. A war thus broke out
                    between Henry of Suabia and Pope Gregory, though Clement III. had been created
                    pope by the Germans. Gregory and his army was defeated, and he retired to the
                    Castle of Angelo, where he was long besieged, and at length, being released by
                    Robert the Norman, removed to Salerno, where he died in the year 1085. Two popes
                    were chosen in succession by the cardinals, viz. Victor III. and Urban II.;
                    whilst the antipope Clement, with his conclave, sometimes in Rome, at other
                    times driven from it, never ceased to fulminate his excommunications. Urban
                    maintained the contest with Clement, and in fact triumphed over him. His success
                    was owing in a great measure to the part he took in favour of the Crusades,
                    which about that period began to excite the attention and rouse the passions of
                    all Europe to achieve the conquest of the Holy Land. The enthusiasm of the
                    period enabled Urban to drive Clement from the city of Rome, and to take
                    possession of the chair of St Peter, in which dignity he terminated his life in
                    the year 1099. Paschal II. was fixed by the cardinals at Rome m the papal chair;
                    and though the party of Clement on his death elected another antipope, it did
                    not weaken the secure hold on the dignity to which Paschal had been elevated.
                    The son of Henry IV. was encouraged by the pope to rebel against him, as one
                    who, being excommunicated, could not convey to his successor any right. The
                    father was made prisoner by the son, and Henry V. was then crowned emperor and
                    king.</p>
                <p>Henry V., though, until he obtained the throne, the devoted defender of the papal
                    claims, after his accession became their antagonist, and thus gained the support
                    of his German nobles. After suppressing commotions in other parts of his
                    dominions, he crossed the Alps with an army of eighty thousand men; passed
                    through Italy to Rome without serious opposition; and there massacred many of
                    the citizens, shut up the pope, the cardinals, and the nobility in prison, and
                    held them confined till he had obtained from the pontiff the full investiture of
                    all his dominions. The pope then crowned him as emperor, and honoured him at his
                    departure with every mark of respect. Henry had scarcely reached his patrimonial
                    dominions when he found a general flame kindled around him. The Lateran council
                    disavowed all that his holiness had done, upon the notorious ground that it had
                    been extorted by force. The French clergy had acquiesced in the excommunication,
                    and those of Germany rejected the bull of investiture; whilst a rebellion,
                    excited by Duke Lothario, broke out in Saxony. By the aid of the Duke of
                    Stauffen-Suabia, Henry was enabled to lull the domestic threatening storm, and
                    again with an army marched to Italy, and seized upon Rome, whilst the pope fled
                    to Apulia. He was once more crowned, the ceremony being performed by the
                    Archbishop of Braga, in Portugal, on the assumption that the former coronation
                    had been invalid, from the perjury of the pope who had performed the ceremony.
                    At the conclusion of his reign Henry V. had nearly lost his influence in Rome^
                    so that he had, at least tacitly, given up all concern in the election of a
                    pope, when Calixtus was chosen by one party, and Honorius II. by another, to
                    fill that dignity. Shortly afterwards he died at Utrecht in May 1125.</p>
                <p>During the reigns of these German princes many of the cities of Italy had risen
                    to considerable wealth, power, and splendour, and, from the emperors being often
                    absent with their armies in the other parts of their dominions, had assumed to
                    themselves almost all the rights of sovereignty.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943912" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3912-0470"/>
                <p>These cities forced the others of less extent near to them into an alliance, by
                    which they obtained the aid of their population whenever they had occasion to
                    have recourse to arms. The two cities of Milan and Pavia, in the north of Italy,
                    were the chiefs of rival associations. Disputes between Milan and Cremona gave
                    occasion to the first hostilities between the former of those cities and Pavia,
                    in 1129, to which a contest between two rivals for the crown of Italy, Lothario
                    II. and Conrad of ITohen-stauffen, gave a different direction, and created two
                    parties, the Guelphs, the adherents of the popes, and the Ghibelines, the
                    supporters of the German emperors. These two parties, which long divided Italy,
                    derive their origin from a family which in the eleventh century held extensive
                    possessions in the north of Italy, amongst the mountains between St Gothard and
                    the Brenner, and bore the name of Welf. They descended into the plains of
                    Germany, and obtaining settlements in some of its finest provinces in the south
                    of that country, this enabled them in process of time to become the founders of
                    both the royal and ducal houses of Guelph; the first seated on the throne of
                    Great Britain, and the second enjoying the duchy of Brunswick.</p>
                <p>This family quarrelled among themselves, one branch bearing the name of Welf,
                    changed by the Italians into Guelph, and the other Waiblingen, changed into
                    Ghibe^ line; and they had, before their intermeddling in the Italian wars,
                    fought a bloody battle at Winsberg in 1140. The state of Italy favoured the
                    creation of parties, to which the chiefs of the two branches of this German
                    family attached themselves, and continued their animosity during more than one
                    hundred years.</p>
                <p>In Rome were violent schisms between the partisans of rival popes; and this again
                    gave rise to that spirit of independence which that city had constantly
                    nourished. It was especially excited by the preaching of Arnold of Brescia, an
                    eloquent monk, the pupil of Abelard, who declaimed with great energy against the
                    luxury of the clergy, and in favour of that liberty which Rome had in ancient
                    times enjoyed. Though banished in the year 1146, he returned again from Zurich,
                    where he had taken refuge, and, under Pope Adrian IV. was condemned and executed
                    in 1155. In the mean time the two great cities had strengthened themselves.
                    Milan had in her alliance the cities of Tortona, Crema, Bergamo, Brescia,
                    Placentia, and Parma. Pavia was at the head of Cremona and Novara. Verona,
                    Padua, Vicenza, Treviso, and Mantua, who were nearly equal in power, maintained
                    each its independence. Turin was at the head of the towns of Piedmont, and
                    disputed the authority of the Counts of Savoy. The great feudatories were the
                    Marquis of Montserrat and the Prince of Asti. To the south of the Po the city of
                    Bologna had acquired great power, and exercised influence over Modena and Reggio
                    on one side, and Ferrara, Ravenna, Faenza, Forli, and Rimini on the other.
                    Florence had risen to superiority in Tuscany by the destruction of Fiesole, and
                    had as allies the cities of Pistoja, Arrezzo, San Minato, Volterra, Lucca,
                    Cortona, Perugia, and Sienna.</p>
                <p>Such was the state of affairs in Italy when the diet of the empire of Germany,
                    assembled at Frankfort in the year 1152, bestowed the crown of that kingdom on
                    Frederick duke of Bavaria, of the house of Hohenstauffen, better known by the
                    name of Barbarossa, the nephew of Conrad, his predecessor in that dignity. The
                    new emperor is recorded by the authorities of his time to have been brave, just,
                    and no Lad dieted to cruelty, yet his reign inflicted the most severe
                    visitations on Italy. The cities were zealous to defend the rights of
                    self-government which they had obtained, and, though filled with factions,
                    resolved to maintain them. They were surrounded with Strong walls, impregnable
                    against the arts of attack then practised; and they were well peopled with men,
                    patient, brave, and abstemious, when a siege demanded the exercise of such
                    qualities. The open country and the smaller towns, from which the numerous
                    fortified cities drew their sustenance, suffered severely whenever an army
                    traversed that country; and, to produce a greater pressure on the cities, the
                    rude soldiery of that time not only destroyed the provisions they could not
                    consume but cut down the growing crops before they were fit to be harvested, or
                    set them on fire, with the houses and the barns of the cultivators. Barbarossa
                    viewed the whole of Italy as his subjects, and treated those who opposed him as
                    rebels and traitors; and as the Ghibelines, who were the weaker party, adhered
                    to him, his chief operations were directed against the Guelphs, of whom Milan
                    was the main support and the centre of union.</p>
                <p>Six times did the emperor cross the Alps with a numerous German army to reduce
                    the country to obedience, and each time his attempts were frustrated. In 1154,
                    in conjunction with the city of Pavia, he defeated the Milanese army, but could
                    not take the city; yet he destroyed Tortona, and was then crowned, both in Pavia
                    with the iron crown of Lombardy, and at Rome with the golden crown of the
                    empire, though the ceremony was performed in the suburb, admission within the
                    walls of the latter city being refused. After plundering Spoleto, sickness and
                    desertion so thinned his ranks, that he led back the remnant of his troops, and
                    repassed the Alps by way of Trent and the Tyrol. The most savage destruction was
                    perpetrated in the retreat; but the cities were unassailed, and rejoiced in
                    their freedom, though they did little injury to the retiring army <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. In the interval that followed, a civil war was
                    carried on by the two parties, at the head of which were Milan and Pavia; but in
                    this the latter, the weaker of the two confederates, suffered the most, whilst
                    by the former the citizens of Tortona were received with sympathy, their houses
                    rebuilt, and their fortifications restored.</p>
                <p>Barbarossa entered Italy again in 1158, with the vassals who crowded to him from
                    all parts of Germany. At Brescia, the terror of his name induced that city to
                    renounce the alliance with Milan, which refused to receive the emperor. By the
                    aid of the militia of Cremona and Pavia he was enabled to besiege Milan; but his
                    engines being insufficient to beat down the walls, he resolved to starve it into
                    surrender, and intercepted all provisions and destroyed the growing crops. In
                    this situation of distress, Blandrate, an independent noble, known as a
                    protector of Lombardy, with some others of the same rank, assumed the office of
                    mediator, and obtained favourable terms. The city agreed to pay a tribute, and
                    to restore the rights of the emperor, on condition that they should elect their
                    consuls, and not be bound to open their gates to the emperor. Tortona and Crema
                    were both included in this pacification, which was signed on the 7th of
                    September 1158. A few weeks afterwards, a diet of the kingdom of Italy having
                    been convoked at Roncaglia, fixed much wider bounds to the regal rights than the
                    Milanese would admit, upon which they again took up arms and prepared to defend
                    themselves. Another diet was called, which met at Bologna in the spring of 1159,
                    and by whose decision Milan was declared to be under the ban of the empire. As
                    that city was too strong to be captured, the first attempt of the emperor was
                    directed against the allied city of Crema, which was compelled to surrender,
                    after a siege of six months, in January 1160.</p>
                <p>The German troops were exhausted by the severe duty of the siege, and their term
                    of service having expired, many of them withdrew; but Frederick, with the
                    Italian Ghibeline cities of Pavia, Cremona, and Novara, carried on the war by
                    devastating the country of the Guelphs, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943925"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-3925-0471"/>excluding all supplies from Milan. In June 1161, a
                    new army reached the theatre of war in Italy, when the emperor resolved to
                    reduce what he called his rebellious city. The defence of Milan was hopeless,
                    but firmly maintained, when a fire, which destroyed the chief magazine of
                    provisions, induced the inhabitants to surrender at discretion in March 1162.
                    Frederick, though proud and severe, was not cruel, and never put to death by the
                    hands of the executioner either enemies or rebels when vanquished. He ordered
                    the militia of the Ghibeline cities to raze the walls, and so to destroy the
                    buildings, that not one stone should be left on another. The poorer inhabitants
                    were placed in villages at some distance from the place; and many sought
                    hospitality in other cities, where their perseverance was recorded with
                    applause, and where they spread the love of freedom and hatred of tyranny. The
                    spirit of independence so rapidly increased that it was soon communicated to the
                    Ghibeline cities; and the effect of it was to produce a confederacy of a most
                    extended nature. Frederick had entered Italy in 1163, attended only by his
                    splendid train of nobles, but without an army, under the impression that he
                    could at pleasure call out the militia of the Ghibeline cities. He directed his
                    steps towards Rome, where, on account of a contest for the papal chair,
                    occasioned by the death of Adrian IV., he thought his presence necessary. Whilst
                    in the south, a union was formed in the Veronese, which he deemed injurious to
                    his prerogatives; and he hastened to call out the militia of the Ghibeline
                    cities of Pavia, Cremona, Lodi, and Como, to lead them against Verona; but they
                    were indisposed to the service, upon which he returned to Germany to collect an
                    army, on whose exertions he might depend.</p>
                <p>In October 1176 Frederick descended from the Grisons with his newly-collected
                    army. His military operations were ineffectual; and whilst he advanced to Rome
                    and to Ancona, the confederation of the cities of the Guelphs and the Ghibelincs
                    was cemented, and assumed the name of the League of Lombardy. Frederick had been
                    repulsed at Ancona, whilst he had been victorious at Rome; but his victory
                    proved useless. His army was attacked by disease, which swept away great
                    numbers; and with the remnant he could scarcely protect himself from the
                    increasing influence of the League, whose authority had already restored Milan,
                    and built the new city of Alessandria, at the confluence of the rivers Tanaro
                    and Bormida. In March 1168, the emperor, with but a very few troops, was enabled
                    to effect his retreat from his Italian subjects, by the road of Mount Cenis, and
                    soon prepared a new German force, which was to be employed in coercing them.</p>
                <p>In the efforts to lead the Germans again into Italy, he was baffled by their
                    reluctance, and remained, as far as regarded Italy, in a state of repose during
                    five years. He sent, indeed, his warlike chancellor, Christian, archbishop of
                    Mentz, to raise his party in Tuscany, the only district in which there existed
                    any portion of attachment to the Ghibeline cause.</p>
                <p>In October 1174, Frederick again entered Italy at the head of a powerful army,
                    but was detained four months by the siege of the newly-built town of
                    Alessandria; and the sickness among his troops, occasioned by the severity of
                    the winter, so weakened him, that having abandoned the siege in April 1175, he
                    was too weak to attack the forces of the League, and thus induced to enter on a
                    negotiation. Much time was spent, but no plan of conciliation was adopted; and
                    Frederick again sent into Germany for an army, which arrived in the spring of
                    1176 at Como, whither he was enabled secretly to join them; but he could get
                    very little aid from the few cities of the Ghibeline party. He advanced to the
                    neighbourhood of Milan, and at Lignano attacked the forces of the League. Though
                    at first he met with success, yet the issue of the battle was so decisively
                    against him, that his camp was pillaged, his army dispersed, and himself
                    rendered a fugitive; but finally he escaped to Pavia, to contradict the report
                    of his death, which had prevailed during several days. Negotiations followed
                    this defeat. The pope and the Venetians acted as mediators, and in 1177 a truce
                    for six years was concluded. During its continuance the political power of the
                    League was strengthened and consolidated; whilst, on the other hand, the emperor
                    had learned the lesson, untaught to his predecessors, of submitting to
                    restrictions imposed by subjects on their sovereign. The truce was followed by
                    the treaty of Constance in 1183, which secured the privileges of the cities, and
                    recognised the prerogatives of the monarch, with certain necessary
                    restrictions.</p>
                <p>Barbarossa partook of the religious enthusiasm which infected all Europe, and,
                    after the peace of Constance, repaired to the Holy Land, where, in 1190, he died
                    of an apoplectic attack.</p>
                <p>Though the peace of 1183 gave political freedom to the cities, yet this not being
                    followed by any confederation, they each thought only of strengthening their
                    defences, and of intriguing for power and supremacy. A party spirit was thus
                    kindled, which spread and continued during the whole period that the emperors of
                    Germany of the house of Hohenstauffen continued to exercise the shadow of
                    sovereignty. The cities were soon divided again into Guelphs and Ghibelines, but
                    had changed their party principles, the Ghibelines being the defenders of the
                    papal power, and the Guclphs the assailants thereof. The party feeling within
                    each of the cities was strong and active. In those where the Guelphs had the
                    government, a large minority constantly opposed them; and the same was the case
                    where the opposite faction had the upper hand. Noble and other families were
                    engaged in long feuds with each other, which endured through generations, and
                    were constantly occasioning open murders or private assassinations. The history
                    of these cities is filled with narratives that exhibit human nature in forms
                    most revolting to our best feelings.</p>
                <p>A single, though far from a solitary, instance of the prevalent feudal
                    proceedings, may not be without its use in showing the effects of such a state
                    of society as existed in these cities. A noble Guelph, named Buondelmonte, of
                    the upper vale of the Arno, had demanded the hand of a young lady of the
                    Ghibeline house of Amidei; and his proposals having been accepted, preparations
                    were made for the marriage. But a lady of another family, the Donati, stopped
                    the lover as he passed her door; and bringing him into the apartment where her
                    females were at work, raised the veil of her daughter, whose beauty was most
                    captivating. “Here,” said she, “is the wife I had reserved for thee. Like thee,
                    she is a Guelph; whilst thou takest one from the enemies of thy church and
                    race.” Buondelmonte, dazzled and enamoured, instantly accepted the proffered
                    hand. The Amidei considered this inconstancy as a deep affront; and all the
                    noble families of Florence of the Ghibeline faction, about twenty-four in
                    number, met, and agreed that he should atone with his life for this offence.
                    Buondelmonte was attacked on the morning of Easter Sunday, as he passed the
                    bridge on horseback, and was there killed. Forty-two families of the Guelphic
                    faction then met, and swore to avenge the insult; and thus blood was shed to
                    atone for blood. Every day some new murder or some open battle alarmed the
                    citizens of Florence, during the space of thirty-three years. These two parties
                    stood opposed to each other within the walls of the same city; and although
                    sometimes in appearance reconciled, yet every little accident renewed their
                    animosity, and they again had recourse to deadly warfare.</p>
                <p>The nobility of Italy, who possessed extensive feudal estates in the intervals
                    between the cities, and some in contact with them, were bound by their tenures
                    to take part with the emperor in the hostilities he had carried on <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192943938" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3938-0472"/> against the
                    cities. By this they had been much impoverished and in debt; and their creditors
                    were for the most part the inhabitants of the cities, to whom the estates were
                    hypothecated. They were a high-spirited race, had by practice acquired great
                    skill in arms, and were acuter and abler political intriguers than the
                    magistrates of the cities. Some of the nobles, who had castles sufficiently
                    strong, lands sufficiently extensive, and vassals sufficiently numerous, to
                    defend themselves, became attached to the Ghibeline party. Those of them whose
                    castles were weak from their situation, or near to cities too populous to be
                    ruled by them, had been admitted to become citizens of such places, had assisted
                    them in war, had obtained a considerable share in their government, and were for
                    the most part compelled by their interest to become adherents of the Guelphic
                    faction. The plains of Italy were thus deprived of all the independent nobility,
                    who had become citizens of some of the free republics; but every chain of
                    mountains was thickly set with castles, held by those who, whilst they
                    maintained their own independence, professed to owe and to acknowledge
                    allegiance to the emperors. As war was their sole occupation, they were often
                    gladly received by the republics, which stood much in need of able captains. It
                    seems that the independent nobles who became connected with the cities as
                    commanders of the forces were not always, though most commonly, of the same
                    faction; for the Ghibeline family of Visconti, which held most extensive fiefs,
                    associated itself with the Gnelphic republic of Milan. These nobles, however,
                    when connected with the cities, soon acquired extensive influence, and became
                    finally founders of families who obtained hereditary, and, some of them,
                    sovereign power. Of these the house of Este, allied to the Guelphs of Saxony and
                    of Bavaria, who had strong castles on the Euganian Hills, joined the republic of
                    Ferrara. The family of Ezzel or Eccelino, whose fiefs and castles were at the
                    foot of the Tyrolean range, and who were devoted to the Ghibeline party, formed
                    connections with the republics of Verona and Vicenza. On the northern side of
                    the Apennines, the fortresses of several Ghibeline nobles excited and maintained
                    revolutions in Placencia, Parma, Reggio, and Modena; whilst on the southern side
                    of those hills were the castles of other Ghibeline nobles, in turn citizens or
                    enemies of the republics of Arezzo, Florence, Pistoja, and Lucca. In the lower
                    valleys of the Po, as well as in the upper vale of the Arno, the castles of the
                    Guelphic nobles supplied leaders to the republics in their vicinity.</p>
                <p>The factious and ferocious state of society here briefly sketched continued
                    during the whole of the reign of the family of Hohenstauffen; but it is only
                    justice to observe, that in the latter years of that period the art of painting
                    first made its appearance in Italy, and that the first dawn of the revival of
                    literature became visible in the horizon, by the improvement made in the
                    language, by the discovery of magnifying glasses and of the magnet, by the
                    establishment of the university of Bologna, and by some writers of talent, to
                    whom the literature and civilization of all Europe became deeply indebted.</p>
                <p>During the nominal reign of the German family, no one of the individuals who
                    succeeded to the title after the death of Barbarossa is deserving of notice,
                    excepting his grandson, Frederick II., who attained the dignity before he had
                    arrived at the age of eighteen. During his reign, Pope Innocent III. attained
                    the pontifical chair; a man of rare talent, great learning, strict morals, and
                    adequate energy. Though the founder of the mendicant orders of Franciscans and
                    Dominicans, and of the fearful power of the inquisition, and though the
                    instigator of the crusades against the Albigenses in France, all his acts
                    originated in the view he took of the moral effect of the increase of the
                    ecclesiastical power, and of its concentration in the head of the church. He
                    made efforts in Rome to establish civil liberty, by forming a representative
                    senate, to whom all power but the judicial was intrusted; but he issued his
                    commands to all the princes of Europe in stronger tones than those of Gregory
                    the Great, which, if obeyed, would have deprived them of all political
                    liberty.</p>
                <p>Frederick carried on wars, in spite of the pope’s anathema, with great success.
                    In 1237 he defeated, at Corte-nuovo, his opponents, who lost 10,000 men; and his
                    subsequent activity gained all Upper Italy to his party, except the four cities
                    of Milan, Brescia, Placentia, and Bologna. But Gregory IX., who had succeeded
                    Innocent on the papal throne, induced the maritime republics of Venice and Genoa
                    to rescue the Guelphs from destruction. This gave a turn to affairs, though Pisa
                    still held fast to the emperor and the Ghibelines. A general council, summoned
                    by the pope, pronounced his excommunication, and his party forsook him by
                    degrees. The mendicant orders everywhere excited conspiracies against him; he
                    became suspicious of every one around him, and was at length obliged to concede
                    every thing to the pope; and, through the mediation of St Louis of France, he
                    proposed, as the condition of his re-admission to the church, that he should go
                    to the Holy Land and join the crusaders, engaging never to return. Whilst
                    waiting the effect of his proposals at his castle of Florentino in Sicily, where
                    he still ruled, he was seized with a dysentery, and died in December 1250.</p>
                <p>After the death of Frederick, and the triumph of Pope Innocent IV., much
                    confusion ensued, in which all freedom was extinguished. The pontiff was
                    deceived in the expectation of general submission which he had formed. He was,
                    during a progress, in some places received with coldness, and in others with
                    disdain. The populace were in a state not to be restrained; the demagogues who
                    directed could not rule them till they had assumed military and despotic power.
                    In this progress the most unheard-of cruelties were perpetrated. In the single
                    city of Padua there were eight prisons always full, notwithstanding the
                    incessant toil of the executioner to empty them; and two of these prisons
                    contained three hundred prisoners each. The Eccelinos became for a time absolute
                    masters of the north of Italy, and were succeeded by the family of Romano, and
                    they by Marten della Torre. The cities of Mantua and Ferrara fell into the power
                    of DΕste, and Verona into that of Mastino della Scala. Palavicino became lord of
                    Cremona, and in process of time, when the disorders had attained their greatest
                    height, of Milan, Brescia, Alessandria, and Tortona. The whole of Italy, with
                    the exception’of Tuscany and the maritime cities, had learned that the rule of
                    an individual was far better than that of a democracy, and quietly submitted
                    themselves to a military commander.</p>
                <p>During the period in which the emperors of Germany of the Suabian or
                    Hohenstauffen race were the kings of Italy, the maritime cities of Venice,
                    Genoa, and Pisa, had grown up to be powerful republican states, and were only by
                    slight ties bound to the common sovereigns of Italy. The nobility who had been
                    admitted to the rights of citizenship were the senators; and some member of
                    their families was commonly chosen as a ruler, with the title of doge or duke.
                    They were strict aristocracies, preserved in that form by laws which, whilst
                    they gave security to their privileges, secured in like manner the rights and
                    possessions of each individual. Under this state of security they naturally
                    became wealthy, and their progress was accelerated by favourable circumstances.
                    The Crusades, which animated the whole west of Europe, created a demand for
                    shipping to convey troops and stores to and fron? the Holy Land; and thus a
                    mercantile navy was called into being, which could at any time be easily <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192943951" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3951-0473"/> converted into a
                    military navy. It was in this way that Venice was enabled to take, and for a
                    time to retain, the city of Constantinople itself. The commerce of the East had
                    also greatly contribüted to increase the wealth, and consequently the power, of
                    these free cities. The chiefs of the Crusades, who returned from these
                    expeditions, brought with them from Asia a taste for its luxuries; and for these
                    the maritime cities became the storehouses, supplying the countries in the
                    western part of Europe.</p>
                <p>After the death of Pope Alexander IV. in 1261, his successor, Urban IV., among
                    several princes who sought the government of Italy, selected Charles of Anjou,
                    brother of St Louis of France, appointed him king of Naples, a senator of Rome,
                    papal vicar of Tuscany, and finally king of Italy. This gave a new direction to
                    the two parties, the Guelphs and the Ghibelines, which still distracted the
                    country. One of them was considered as the friend, and the other as the enemy,
                    of the French aspirant. Besides these parties, there were also the republics;
                    and besides them, contests between the nobles and the people, in most of which
                    the latter were, in the beginning at least, the conquerors. Charles invaded
                    Naples, and defeated Manfred, the king, in 1265, and thus gave the superiority
                    to the Guelphs, which he further increased by placing a garrison in Florence,
                    and excluding from the councils the whole of the nobles, and all others of the
                    Ghibeline party. He was for a short time alarmed by an invasion from Germany
                    under Conrad, the grandson of the last Suabian emperor. This prince was only
                    sixteen years of age when he arrived at Verona at the head of 10,000 cavalry,
                    where he was joined by all the Ghibeline commanders who had distinguished
                    themselves under his ancestor, and aided by the efforts of the Ghibeline cities,
                    Pisa and Sienna. The citizens of Rome were so disposed to favour him, that on
                    his advance they opened their gates and promised assistance. But all this zeal
                    in his favour was of no avail. He passed the Abbruzzi Mountains, and at the foot
                    of them fought a desperate battle in August 1268. It terminated in the total
                    defeat of the Germans. Conrad, with the chiefs, were made prisoners, and, after
                    a mock trial, were condemned and beheaded at Naples on the 26th of October 1268.
                    After these executions, an uninterrupted exhibition of similar spectacles filled
                    the two Sicilies, and some other parts of Italy, with such horror and dismay,
                    that Charles of Anjou reigned triumphantly, and soon acquired the mastery over
                    the republican cities.</p>
                <p>Gregory X., who ascended the papal throne in 1272, saw the impolicy of his
                    predecessors, who had given themselves a French master. He endeavoured to raise
                    the Ghibeline party so as to counterbalance the Guelphs; and engaged Pisa,
                    Venice, and Genoa, to co-operate with him in choosing a chief. The election was
                    made the following year, when Rodolph of Habsburg, the founder of the house of
                    Austria, was declared emperor. Martin IV., who was made pope in 1280, undid the
                    work of his predecessor, and persecuted the Ghibelines with great fury. But in
                    the mean time the popes had secured to the holy see the temporal power over the
                    ecclesiastical territories. During this period hostilities took place between
                    the maritime republics. The Genoese had assisted Michael Palaeologus in his
                    successful efforts to retake Constantinople from the Venetians, and had received
                    for their reward the island of Chios. Near to Meloria, in a sea-fight, the
                    Genoese had nearly annihilated the fleet of the Pisans; and in another battle,
                    near Curzola, they had gained the command of the sea by their defeat of the
                    Venetians.</p>
                <p>Charles was preparing an armament in all the ports of Naples and of Sicily, with
                    the intention of contending in Greece for the eastern empire. This induced him
                    to levy taxes of great amount with excessive rigour, and the judges endeavoured
                    to prevent resistance by striking terror into all those who declined or even
                    delayed the required payments. John de Procida, the friend and confidant of
                    Frederick and of the deposed Manfred, a native of Salcrno, visited secretly the
                    cities of both Sicilies, to re-animate the zeal of the Ghibelines, and to rouse
                    their hatred towards Charles and the French. He had also obtained promises from
                    Greece and from Spain. It was not necessary, however, to have recourse to
                    foreign aid, for a sudden and popular explosion took place in Palermo. It was
                    excited by a French soldier, who behaved rudely to a betrothed lady, as she was
                    on her way with her affianced husband to a church to receive the nuptial
                    benediction. The indignation of her family was on the instant communicated to
                    the populace. The bells of the churches were ringing for vespers; the people
                    answered by the cry, “To arms; death to the French.” The French were furiously
                    attacked in every quarter. Those who attempted to defend themselves were soon
                    overpowered; others, who endeavoured to pass for Italians, were known by the
                    pronunciation of the two words <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ceci”</hi> and “<hi rend="italic">cieri,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    &gt;!</hi> which they were forced to utter, and on mis-pronunciation were
                    instantly put to death. In a few hours more than four thousand persons thus
                    perished in Palermo, and every other town in Sicily followed the bloody example.
                    Thus the Sicilian vespers overthrew the dominion of Charles and of the Guelphs;
                    separated that island from the kingdom of Naples; and transferred the crown of
                    the former to Peter of Aragon, the son-in-law of Manfred, who was considered as
                    the heir of the house of Hohenstauffen. The massacre occurred on the 30th of
                    March 1282.</p>
                <p>Florence had, by 1282, been led to a democratic state by the attainder of the
                    nobles as a body, and, by its judicious regulations, had greatly strengthened
                    the Guelphic party; but some disputes, which had originated in the neighbouring
                    insignificant town of Pistoja, were extended to Florence, and in a short time
                    divided the whole of Tuscany into two factions of Guelphs, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bianchi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Neri,</hi> or the Whites
                    and the Blacks, whose mutual animosity and hostility were continued till 1300,
                    when, by the intrigues of Pope Boniface VII., and the instrumentality of Charles
                    de Valois, the Bianchi were plundered and expelled the country, upon which a
                    part of them joined the Ghibeline faction. In Lombardy the dying cause of
                    freedom still continued to exist, and was at length rekindled; and the people,
                    wearied out with the feuds of their nobles, between 1302 and 1306 drove them
                    out. At this period, by the management of Philip le Bel, a Frenchman, Clement V.
                    was chosen pope, and removed the seat of the papal throne to Avignon, where it
                    continued till 1377. This gave room for the display of the spirit of freedom in
                    Rome, and in all the territory of the church. The authority and almost the name
                    of the emperor of Germany had been neglected in Italy during sixty years, whilst
                    their minds were wholly occupied with internal disputes. At length, in 1308, the
                    diet of Germany advanced Henry of Luxembourg to the imperial dignity, after
                    three other princes had occupied that station. Henry VII. had little power to
                    enforce obedience in Germany, and foresaw symptoms of opposition, which he
                    wished to divert by flattering the vanity of conflicting parties, and uniting
                    them in projects for extending his authority over the several parts of Italy.
                    Henry crossed Mount Cenis, and appeared in Italy in 1310, accompanied by a few
                    cavalry, not amounting to two thousand, composed chiefly of Belgians, Germans,
                    and some Savoyards. At Turin he was waited on by many of the nobles of Lombardy
                    and Piedmont, who at least professed obedience; and even the cities, in
                    confusion and distress as they all were from their internal contentions, gave
                    indications of a strong desire for tranquillity under their constitutional
                    chiefs. Henry professed impartiality between all parties, and his conduct
                    corresponded with his prof essions; but he <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943964"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-3964-0474"/>wanted money, and it was issued out to him with
                    great parsimony by all but the citizens of Pisa, who were extremely liberal, and
                    increased his force with a guard of six hundred bowmen, who accompanied him to
                    Rome, where he received the golden crown of the emperor from the pope’s legate,
                    without the walls, as the citizens refused admission to him and his troops, but
                    had admitted a garrison of Neapolitans. The term for which his foreign troops
                    had enlisted had expired on his coronation, and they mostly left his service;
                    but the Ghibelines and Bianchi of central Italy gathered round him, and formed a
                    respectable force. He made some ineffectual efforts to conquer the democracy of
                    Florence, who had taken a garrison of mercenaries into their pay. He then,
                    reinforced by the Pisans, marched towards Rome to contend with Robert, king of
                    Sicily, who maintained an ill-disciplined force in that city, and expected
                    reinforcements from the Guelphs of Tuscany. On the road, not far from Sienna, on
                    St Bartholomew’s day 1313, he received the communion from the hands of a
                    doŗninican monk, and expired a few hours afterwards, with strong suspicions of
                    having been poisoned.</p>
                <p>When Henry died, disputes arose at the diet at Frankfort respecting his successor
                    in the empire; but they seemed to have had little effect on the condition of
                    Italy. In a few years most of the republican cities in the middle of Italy had
                    fallen under the government of some distinguished military family, whilst
                    Tuscany alone maintained a share of liberty, by selecting Robert, king of
                    Naples, as its protector. The Ghibeline city of Pisa round a master in Uguccione
                    della Faggiuola in 1314; and, after his expulsion in 1316, in Castruccio
                    Castracani. Padua fell to the house of the Carraras. Alessandria, Tortona, and
                    Cremona, became submissive under the Visconti of Milan. Mantua fell to the share
                    of Gonza in 1328. In Ferrara the family of the Este established their hereditary
                    power; and Ravenna became the patrimony of the Polentas, who had long held power
                    there. In the other cities the same tyranny was established, but, from
                    generation to generation, so uncertain in its administration as to increase the
                    evils it created. These small princes adhered to Robert of Naples, whose greedy
                    lust of power obtained the means of indulgence by Clement V. having appointed
                    him vicargeneral of Italy, designing thereby to hold the balance of parties in
                    his own hands. Louis of Bavaria made his appearance in Italy in 1327, in order
                    to put down both Anjou and the Guelphs. He was supported by the Ghibelines; but,
                    by want of firmness, and a breach of his professions, so estranged them, whilst,
                    on the other hand, the wickedness of Pope John XXII., who supported the Guelphs,
                    had so cooled their zeal in his favour, that the two parties who had so long
                    opposed each other, uniting in the cause of common freedom, were drawn much
                    closer together.</p>
                <p>At this period that estimable royal adventurer, John, king of Bohemia, the son of
                    the Emperor Henry VII., made his appearance in Italy; and having been invited by
                    the citizens of Brescia, and favoured by the pope, he was announced as the
                    mediator and pacificator of the kingdom. He arrived in 1330. But his purposes
                    were frustrated by the opposition of Tuscany, where a dread of the government of
                    a single person was generally entertained. His fickle disposition made him soon
                    abandon his objects, and he quitted Italy in 1333.</p>
                <p>After his departure, Mastino della Scala, who had been one of his supporters, and
                    who was lord of the half of Lombardy, and of the territory of Lucca, began to
                    threaten the independence of Italy; but he was opposed by a league, headed by
                    Florence, which led to hostilities; but they were soon terminated, and the
                    freedom of Florence was thereby secured. The necessities of Mastino induced him
                    to sell his city of Lucca to the Florentines, upon which the Pisans rose and
                    took that city for themselves. After this transaction, the Florentines,
                    disgusted with those who had caused the loss of Lucca, selected as their chief a
                    military adventurer, who, in the Crusades, had obtained the title of the Duke of
                    Athens; but, owing to his severity, they soon dismissed him. I <hi
                    rend="subscript"> n</hi> Rome, torn by aristocratic factions, Cola Rienze was
                    chosen tribune of the people, in order to restore the laws and tranquillity; but
                    after seven months he was obliged to give way before the power of the nobles, in
                    1347. After a banishment of seven years, in 1354 Cardinal Albornoz was recalled;
                    but his rule was short, having been killed in an insurrection instigated by the
                    nobles. The Genoese tired out with everlasting quarrels between the Guelphic
                    families of Spinola and Doria, and the Ghibeline families of Grimaldi and
                    Fiesche, drove them all out of their city, and elected their own first doge or
                    duke. In Pisa the Ghibelines were divided into two violent parties, those of
                    Bergolini and of Raspanti, when, after much contention, the latter succeeded in
                    expelling the former, in 1348. At this period Italy suffered from a dreadful
                    famine, which, in 1347, swept away, by absolute starvation, vast numbers of the
                    inhabitants; and in the following year a pestilence of a most mortal nature
                    spread over every part; and such was the suffering produced by these
                    visitations, that it was calculated that two thirds of the whole population were
                    destroyed by them. Another tremendous scourge followed, and was longer endured.
                    After each peace, bands of dismissed soldiers were formed under chiefs, called
                    <hi rend="italic">condottieri,</hi> who carried on war on their own account,
                    burning some towns, ransoming others, and plundering everywhere. They were
                    mostly Germans, who had been called in by the Viscontis and Della Scalas. A Duke
                    Werner, a Count Lado, and a Friar Morale, led bands of these robbers, who
                    devastated Italy from Montserrat to the extremity of Naples, between 1348 and
                    1354. Meantime another war had broken out between the maritime republics of
                    Genoa and Venice. The Venetians formed alliances with the Greek emperor and with
                    Peter of Aragon. Formidable fleets were collected, one commanded by the Genoese
                    admiral, Paganino Doria, and the other by the Venetian, Nicoo Pisani. A battle
                    was fought between them on the 13th of February 1352, which proved indecisive;
                    but in a second, fought in the following August, the Genoese were defeated with
                    great loss. In two years success changed sides; and after a defeat of the
                    Venetians in November 1354, a truce was agreed to, which terminated in a peace
                    in the month of May following.</p>
                <p>The family of Visconti had raised themselves to great power in the centre of
                    Italy. John of that name had influence in Genoa, intrigued in Venice, and
                    threatened to destroy the independence of Tuscany. He died in 1354; and his
                    power and pretensions, being divided between his three nephews, became weaker,
                    and received a check by the appearance of Charles IV., who again returned to
                    Italy in 1355, where he was enabled to new-model the cities of Pisa and Sienna,
                    and so far to overcome Tuscany, though but for a short period, as to compel even
                    Florence to adopt the title of an imperial city. With but little real power he
                    opposed the Visconti; but ended in obtaining money from them, as he did from
                    most parts of Italy, in his progress through the country. In 1363, he liberated
                    the city of Lucca from the dominion which the Pisans had obtained over it. About
                    the same period Pope Innocent VI., by his legate, between 1365 and 1375,
                    obtained absolute power over the cities of the papal dominions; but lost much of
                    it again, from the discontent excited by the tyranny of the legate, and by the
                    interference of Florence in favour of their freedom. Robert of Geneva, who was
                    elected as pope, and took the name of Clement VII., established his court at
                    Naples in 1378, under the protection of Queen Joan. He was opposed by another
                    pope.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943977" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3977-0475"/>
                <p>namely, Urban VI. The church was thus divided between two popes and two colleges
                    of cardinals, and the temporal power of the holy see was weakened. Several of
                    the cities had been enfranchised by the Florentines; but those of Romagna, with
                    some others, fell under the yoke of petty tyrants.</p>
                <p>The continuance of the thirst for dominion of the Visconti in the centre of
                    Italy, where they had rendered themselves masters of Genoa and Bologna, excited
                    a general combination against them, at the head of which was Florence; and the
                    old parties of Guelphs and Ghibelines were forgotten in this new and threatening
                    crisis. In Florence the Guelphs were divided into two parties, the Ricci and the
                    Albizzi. After great tumults, Michael de Lando, of low origin, but a brave and
                    generous man, produced tranquillity in 1378. The party of the Ricci, which had
                    thus been for a moment defeated, was essentially aristocratic, and numbered
                    amongst it the members of the family of Medici, whose names are then for the
                    first time to be met with in Italian history. This party soon afterwards, in
                    another tumult, banished Lando, and those who had supported his nomination, and
                    then constituted the former aristocracy more firmly than it had before
                    existed.</p>
                <p>In the other republics the same progress was made. The leaders of the democracy,
                    or their heirs, created themselves tribunes of the people, and became a fresh
                    aristocracy, with the power of transmitting it to their families. At Genoa, a
                    civil war was carried on for a long time between the two strongest parties, but
                    ended in. their conferring the sovereignty, in 1396, on Charles VI., king of
                    France. &lt;</p>
                <p>In Lombardy, Gian Galeazzo, of a French family, had seated himself on the throne
                    of Milan, and having rendered himself master of the smaller cities in that
                    district, alarmed Sienna, Pisa, Bologna, and other considerable places. Being
                    restrained, by the opposition offered by Florence, from attacking them at that
                    time, he succeeded in a few years, and conquered most of them; and ultimately
                    brought Tuscany itself into a dangerous position, from which it was relieved by
                    a pestilence, which, amongst many thousands whom it swept away, carried off also
                    the object of its dread, Gian Galeazzo, in 1402. This event gave a
                    breathing-time to that part of Italy; and, during the minority of the son of
                    Gian, many of the places he had taken were retaken. Milan fell into a state of
                    anarchy, and the Venetians availed themselves of it to conquer Padua and Verona,
                    whilst, on the other side, the Florentines captured Pisa; and Gian Maria, a
                    youth, was only supported on the tottering throne of Milan by the arms of the
                    hired mercenaries. His tyranny and cruelty is painted in the blackest colours by
                    all the writers of his age; and he at length fell a victim to the indignation of
                    some of the nobles, by whom he was assassinated, in May 1412.</p>
                <p>In 1409, a new but transitory danger threatened the republic of Florence, by the
                    invasion of Ladislau, king of Naples, which was no sooner repressed than the
                    power of the Visconti became predominant. The Duke Philip Maria of that family,
                    with the assistance of his celebrated general, Carmagnola, between 1414 and
                    1420, conquered all the states which had belonged to the family in Lombardy; and
                    Genoa submitted to him in 1421. Venice and Florence then made a league in 1425,
                    and General Carmagnola, having turned to these parties, conquered the whole of
                    the territories on the river Adda, and secured them by the peace of Ferrara in
                    1428. The condottiero Braccio Montone contrived to make himself master of the
                    city of Perugia, and of the whole of Umbria, and extended his power to Rome
                    itself; whilst the Petrucci, in 1430, firmly established their power in
                    Sienna.</p>
                <p>After the weakening of Milan by the Florentines and Venetians, and owing to the
                    constant disturbances raised in Naples by the party of Anjou against Alfonso of
                    Aragon, there was no longer any dangerous preponderating power in Italy. There
                    existed, however, constant hostility between the armed military bands, in two
                    divisions, according to their usual practice. One of these was led by Braccio
                    Montone, and the other by Sforza Attendolo. Francis Sforza was enabled to make
                    himself, after the death of Visconti, master of the whole territory of Milan, in
                    1450. The Venetians, greedy of extended territory, made an alliance with some of
                    the smaller states; Sforza made a counter-treaty with Florence, which, under the
                    change of circumstances, providently changed its policy. At this period the
                    house of Medici, by its wealth and its prudence, began to attract notice and to
                    gain importance in Florence. The power of Milan, where Sforza ruled; of Venice,
                    which possessed the half of Lombardy; of Florence, which was wisely directed by
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici; and of Naples, that was not in a state to venture on
                    offensive war; formed, towards the end of the fifteenth century, the political
                    balance of Italy, and, in spite of manifold feuds, gave confidence to each power
                    that its independence was secure.</p>
                <p>In 1494, Charles VIII., king of France, advanced towards Italy, designing to
                    conquer Naples; and LudovicoSforza came forward, first to support, but
                    afterwards to oppose him, whilst the pope, Alexander VIII., in order to elevate
                    his son Caesar Borgia, courted the French alliance. The opposition to Charles
                    was feeble, but the cruelties and the rapine which he caused or permitted filled
                    Italy with disgust. LudovicoSforza collected an army in the north, which induced
                    Charles to leave one half of his forces to retain the possession of Naples,
                    which he had gained. He was impeded in his retreat, and lost in it the greater
                    part of his army before he could enter his own kingdom. That portion of his
                    force which he had left in Naples was at length obliged to capitulate at Atilla
                    in July 1496; so that, after two years of war of the most ravaging description,
                    France did not gain the least footing. Louis XII., who had succeeded to Charles
                    VIII. in April 1498, made pretensions to the government of Milan. He was opposed
                    only by LudovicoSforza, because Venice, who would have joined Ludovico was
                    engaged in an alarming war with the Turks; and Florence, from which the Medicis
                    had been banished, was ruled by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> seditious faction,
                    intent upon subjecting Pisa to their authority. Pope Alexander, who had opposed
                    Charles, formed an alliance with Louis, on condition that his relation Caesar
                    Borgia should be made Duke of Valentinois in France, and of Romagna in Italy.
                    Frederick king of Naples, though aware that he must be ultimately the victim of
                    France, was too much occupied in restoring tranquillity at home to take any
                    active measures to protect Italy.</p>
                <p>Louis, favoured by the position of affairs, passed the Alps with a powerful army
                    in August 1499. He took some small towns by assault, and put the garrisons and
                    most of the inhabitants to the sword; a ferocious proceeding, which produced
                    universal terror, so that Sforza could make no opposition, but dispersed the
                    army he had collected, and withdrew with his family and treasures into Germany.
                    There he found protection with the Emperor Maximilian. The cities of the north
                    of Italy opened with trembling anxiety their gates to the troops of the French
                    king, and he was installed as Duke of Milan in that capital, whilst Genoa, which
                    had been an ally of Sforza, made terms with France. After this hasty
                    subjugation, Louis returned to Lyons. The insolence of the French, their
                    violation of all national institutions, their contempt of Italian manners, the
                    accumulation of taxes, and the irregularity of their administration, rendered
                    the yoke insupportable. Ludovicosoon became acquainted with the ferment which
                    prevailed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192943990" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3990-0476"/>and
                    the eager wishes of his subjects to see him again at their head. He was on the
                    Swiss frontier, and hastily collected a small force. With this he entered
                    Lombardy in February 1500, having only five hundred horse and eight thousand
                    infantry. Como, Milan, Parma, and Pavia, opened their gates to receive him; and
                    after a short siege Novara capitulated. But Louis was active, and his general,
                    Tremouille, advanced to suppress this rebellion with an army in which were ten
                    thousand Swiss. Hired troops of the cantons were in both armies. When they met,
                    these troops had parleys between themselves, and the part in Ludovicos army
                    agreed with those in the army of Tremouille to murder their Italian
                    fellow-soldiers, and to leave the service in which they had entered. This was
                    executed. LudovicoSforza was delivered up and sent to France, where he died
                    after ten years’ imprisonment; and the Swiss returned home with the wages of
                    perfidy and the curses of Lombardy, whilst the French continued masters of the
                    country till 1512.</p>
                <p>The French then attempted to gain Naples, and a most infamous treaty was
                    concluded with Ferdinand the Catholic, of Spain, who had engaged to defend that
                    kingdom, by which that unfortunate country was subdued; and in the division of
                    it quarrels broke out between the French and Spaniards, in consequence of which,
                    after a battle had been gained by Gonzalvo, the general of the latter, the
                    French were in 1503 completely driven out, and the kingdom of Naples became an
                    appendage of the Spanish crown.</p>
                <p>By the death of Pope Alexander VI., and the accession of Julius II., the
                    pretensions of Caesar Borgia vanished, as the new pontiff was more zealous to
                    strengthen the holy see than to advance the son of his predecessor. With this
                    view he formed a treaty with the kings of France and Spain, called the League of
                    Cambray, in 1508, the object of which was to check the engrossing measures of
                    the Venetian republic; but it having failed in that respect, by the cunning of
                    the Venetians, his holiness, in 1509, entered into a treaty with the Venetians
                    themselves, in which the king of Spain and the Swiss cantons were comprehended,
                    the purpose of which was to drive the French out of Italy; but this project was
                    abandoned by the pope, from the dread that the council of French and German
                    prelates assembled at Pisa would be induced to declare his election to the
                    popedom invalid, and dismiss him from the dignity. In the mean time Maximilian
                    of Germany and the king of France had concocted an alliance at Blois, by which
                    it was agreed to divide between them the whole of the dominions of Venice on the
                    continent; and, in consequence of it, hostilities commenced in 1509. The cities
                    surrendered to the French, the Germans, or the Spaniards, all of whom exercised
                    the most abominable cruelties. The pope, in the midst of the conquests of the
                    great powers, became alarmed, and, with the cunning of an Italian, attempted to
                    free Italy from their ravages, by inflaming the emperor against the French, by
                    forming a league with Venice, and by calling in the aid of the mercenary Swiss.
                    The pope raised an army, commanded by the Duke of Urbino; and though it was
                    defeated in 1511, he succeeded in íòrming a league, to which the prefix of Holy
                    was given, on account of his being at the head of it, with the kings of Spain
                    and of England, and which also comprehended the Swiss and the Venetians.</p>
                <p>A powerful Spanish army from Naples, in 1512, advanced to assist the pope,
                    commanded by Raymond de Cordova. He was gladly received by the people, but
                    opposed by the most experienced of the French generals, Gaston de Foix, with
                    whom he fought a most murderous battle near Ravenna, on the 11th of April 1512;
                    and though the French were victorious, yet the loss of Gaston, who fell in the
                    action, was more than a compensation for the defeat which the Spaniards had
                    sustained. Maximilian suddenly betrayed his allies, recalled the German troops
                    from the French service, and gave a passage through his territory to the Swiss
                    to join the Venetian army. Ferdinand of Spain and Henry V11I. of England
                    simultaneously attacked France, who was thus obliged to recall her troops from
                    Italy, and abandon the country to the power of the Holy League. The liberties of
                    Italy were then annihilated. Florence, with Tuscany, a country rich and
                    factious, but not warlike, after being plundered by the Spaniards without pity
                    or remorse, was delivered over to the banished but now restored Medicis, where
                    Giovanni de’ Medici, afterwards Pope Leo X., with some other members of that
                    family, reimbursed themselves for their long proscription, by the abundant
                    wealth they employed their power to extort.</p>
                <p>Charles of Ghent, commonly called Charles V., already king of Spain, on the death
                    of his grandfather Maximilian, was raised to the imperial throne in 1519.
                    Charles, and Francis the king of France, had abundant subjects of contest; but
                    Italy was doomed to become the theatre for their decision. Francis, in 1523,
                    sent an army under Bonnivet to invade Lombardy and take possession of Milan. The
                    city had time to collect stores and complete its defences, owing to the
                    supineness of the French general, and thus was preserved from capture till the
                    emperor could furnish an army of sufficient strength to meet Bonnivet in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>In the next year the imperial army received such reinforcements that Bonnivet
                    thought himself unable to resist it, and resolved to withdraw his troops. On the
                    retreat he was wounded, and the command devolved on the Chevalier Bayard, who
                    was killed in the battle; after which the remnant of the French escaped to their
                    own country, leaving Lombardy in the power of the imperialists. Charles was so
                    elated by the success of his arms in Italy that he resolved on invading the
                    patrimonial dominions of Francis, and accordingly Pescara led his army into
                    Provence, and began the siege of Marseilles; but the attempt proved
                    unsuccessful, and its repulse encouraged Francis once more to make an attempt to
                    retrieve the reverses he had suffered in Italy. The French passed the Alps by
                    Mount Cenis, and the rapidity of their movements enabled them to enter Milan,
                    which was unprepared for the attack; but the imperial general secured and
                    garrisoned the citadel, which in some measure commanded it. Francis then laid
                    siege to Pavia, which was strongly fortified, and garrisoned by six thousand
                    veterans. The siege occupied several months, and thus gave time for Charles to
                    collect his troops. Francis was resolved to fight, though urged by his generals
                    to avoid a battle. On the 24th of February 1525, the two armies engaged; the
                    contest was obstinate, and the issue long doubtful; but after dreadful carnage,
                    the imperialists were victorious, Francis himself was taken prisoner, and with
                    him Henry king of Navarre, and a few only of the body guard escaped. The French
                    in Milan retired, and, in fourteen days after the battle, not a soldier of the
                    nation remained in Italy.</p>
                <p>After this last French attempt on Italy, which had, like all that preceded, only
                    shown that a temporary ascendency could be obtained by that nation, but could
                    never be retained, the preponderating influence was securely held by the Emperor
                    Charles V. Most of the reigning houses disappeared, and their successors were
                    appointed either avowedly or secretly by him. When the male line of the Marquis
                    of Montserrat became extinct, Charles, in 1536, gave his dominions to Gonzaga of
                    Mantua; and Maximilian II. in 1573, created it a dukedom. The Florentines made
                    an attempt, after murdering the Duke Alexander in 15/3, to regain their
                    independence; but their efforts were unavailing, and Cosmo de’ NIedici was
                    raised to supreme <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944003"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4003-0477"/>power by the influence of Charles. Parma and
                    Placentia had been seized upon by Pope Julius II. for the holy see; but Paul
                    III. in 1545 erected those states into a dukedom for his bastard Peter Aloes
                    Farnese, whose son Octavio, in 1556, was invested by the emperor. Genoa, which,
                    since 1499, had submitted to France, found a deliverer from that power in the
                    person of Andreas Doria, who established a firm aristocracy, which overcame the
                    conspiracy that Fiesco had projected to destroy it. Charles, in 1553, had
                    conveyed Milan, and also the kingdom of Naples, to his son Charles. At the peace
                    of Château-Cambresis, in 1559, Philip II., and Henry II. of France, renounced
                    their pretensions to Piedmont, which was given to the legitimate heir, the brave
                    Spanish general Emanuel Philip, duke of Savoy. In 1597, the legitimate line of
                    the house of Este became extinct, upon which Caesar d’Este, a natural son of the
                    last prince, obtained Modena and Reggio by an enfeofment from the empire; and
                    Ferrara was conveyed to him as a feudatory of the papal throne.</p>
                <p>The end of the sixteenth century was a period of peace in Italy, and of such
                    prosperity as could be expected after it had lost the foreign trade which had
                    proVed so lucrative, and which had been so long enjoyed by the discovery of the
                    way to India by the Cape of Good Hope. In the next century only some
                    insignificant changes of territory took place. Some reverses in Germany induced
                    the Emperor Ferdinand II. in 1631, when the family of Gonzaga became extinct, to
                    grant Mantua and Montserrat to Charles de Nevers, a protege of France, whose
                    descendants retained it till the war of the succession in Spain. In the peace of
                    Chierasco in 1631, the cunning of Richelieu obtained Pignerol and Casale, which
                    might serve as means of facilitating an irruption into Italy; but, in 1637, he
                    was obliged to give up the latter fortress. The peace of Italy was not disturbed
                    by any of the operations of Louis XIV. of France, and seems to have been durably
                    secured by its neutrality being made one of the stipulations of the treaty of
                    Turin in 1696.</p>
                <p>The effects of the war of succession in Spain were extended to Italy. Austria
                    conquered Milan and Montserrat, and the Duke of Mantua was expelled on account
                    of his crimes. Montserrat was ceded to Savoy, and the two other cities retained
                    by the house of Austria. The peace of Utrecht, in 1714, conferred Sardinia and
                    Naples on the emperor, and Sicily on the house of Savoy; afterwards the two
                    powers exchanged the islands, and the house of Savoy, thus gaining Sardinia,
                    assumed the title of kings of that island.</p>
                <p>The family of the Farnese became extinct in 1731, when the Infant Charles of
                    Spain received the investiture of Parma and Placentia. In the war respecting the
                    Polish succession, which broke out in 1733, Emanuel of Savoy, now king of
                    Sardinia, formed an alliance with France and Spain. By this he was enabled to
                    take possession of the duchy of Milan; but at the peace of Vienna, in 1738, he
                    was compelled to restore it to Austria, being allowed to retain only Novara and
                    Tortona. The Spanish infant, who had become king of the Two Sicilies, delivered
                    up Parma and Placentia to the house of Austria. The family of the Medicis had
                    enjoyed the title of Dukes of Tuscany with great tranquillity; but the last
                    member of it dying in 1737, Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine, by the
                    preliminaries of the Vienna treaty, was invested with the sovereignty; and, in
                    1745, it was settled as the possession of the second son of the
                    Lorraine-Austrian family. In the war of the Austrian succession, in 1745, the
                    Spaniards conquered Milan, but were driven out by Charles Emanuel; for which
                    service Maria Theresa conceded to him the districts of Vige-vanasco and Bobbia,
                    and some portions of Anghiera and of Pavia. Massa and Carrara fell by hereditary
                    succession to the Duke of Modena in 1743. Parma and Placentia were taken
                    possession of by the Spanish infant Don Philip, who soon lost it again; but, at
                    the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, he once more received it, and continued to
                    hold it as an hereditary possession. Thus, at nearly the termination of the
                    century, in 1792, the houses of Lorraine, Spain, and Savoy, were the rulers of
                    all Italy except the states of the church, the duchy of Modena, and the
                    republican cities, in which the decrepitude of old age was making rapid
                    advances.</p>
                <p>As the narrative of the events by which Italy fell under the dominion of
                    Bonaparte is communicated in this work under the head <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >France,</hi> it is only necessary to refer the reader to that article. When
                    quiet possession of the peninsula had been gained in 1797, republicanism was in
                    the ascendant at Paris, and the Cisalpine republic was formed. Lombardy was
                    extended by adding to it a portion of the papal territory. Genoa formed another
                    republic, called the Ligurian; and Venice, which had submitted without
                    opposition, also adopted a republican form, though it was soon afterwards
                    transferred to Austria by the treaty of Campo-Formio. Naples also was, in 1799,
                    formed into a republic, under the denomination of the Parthenopaean. Amidst the
                    greatest oppression and the most wanton cruelty, this state of affairs continued
                    till their conqueror became first consul, when the Cisalpine republic was
                    new-modelled after the pattern of France, and converted into the Italian
                    republic, with Bonaparte as its president. In 1805, when the military regime was
                    completed in France, and Bonaparte had become its emperor, the same kind of
                    monarchy was forced upon Italy, and he was crowned at Milan on the 26th of May,
                    with the iron crown of Lombardy. About the same time Naples was converted into a
                    kingdom for his brother Joseph, who, however, was soon compelled to abandon it,
                    in 1808, for the throne of Spain, and was succeeded by General Murat. For one of
                    his sisters, who had married Paschal Baccio-chi, Parma and Piombino were formed
                    into a kingdom, to be called that of Etruria; but it was soon destroyed, and
                    converted into a province of France. Though Naples was subdued, the legitimate
                    monarch took refuge in Sicily, and was enabled to maintain himself by the
                    assistance of the English navy and army. Whilst Murat reigned as king in Naples,
                    and Eugene Beauharnois as viceroy in Milan, they were both summoned, with all
                    the forces they could collect, to join the grand army for the subjugation of
                    Russia. After the retreat from Moscow, both returned to their dominions with the
                    remnant of their forces. Eugene maintained the fidelity for which he had
                    engaged; but Murat, offended with Bonaparte, formed an alliance with the
                    confederated monarchs of Europe. After the abdication of the imperial throne,
                    Eugene withdrew, and the states in the north of Italy soon returned to the
                    government of their ancient rulers.</p>
                <p>On the return of Bonaparte from Elba in 1815, Murat took up arms, as he affirmed,
                    for the independence of Italy. With the Neapolitan troops he advanced towards
                    the north, and entered Bologna; but was soon driven from thence, and afterwards
                    defeated near Tolentino, upon which there was an end of his kingdom. The capital
                    was entered by the Austrian general Nugent, and Murat fled to France, whilst his
                    wife and familyfound a refuge in Austria. Ferdinand returned from Sic.ilyto the
                    capital of his continental kingdom, and was received with delight by the
                    inhabitants. Murat made a feeble attempt to recover his kingdom; but having
                    collected a small body of troops in Corsica, and landed with them on the coast
                    of Calabria, he was made prisoner, tried by a military tribunal, and shot. By
                    the final treaty of Vienna, the following arrangements regarding Italy were
                    agreed to, and still remain. The king of Sardinia received back all his
                    dominions, according to the boundaries existing in 1792, with some few changes
                    in the limits on the side towards Geneva. To these were added the city of Genoa,
                    and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944016" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4016-0478"
                    />territory attached to it in former times when it was a duchy. The emperor of
                    Austria united with his hereditary monarchy the newly-erected kingdom of
                    Venetian Lombardy, in which was included the districts of the Valteline, Bormio,
                    and Chiavenna, parts of the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Istria was not included
                    in the Austrian kingdom of Illyria. As the boundary between the popedom and
                    Parma, the valley of the Po was fixed upon. The house of Este was again declared
                    sovereign over Modena, Reggio, Mirandola, Massa, and Carrara. The Empress Maria
                    Louisa received the state of Parma as a sovereignty for her life, after which it
                    was to fall to the Duchess <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Lucca and her heirs, who
                    were to give up a territory in Bohemia to the Duke of Reichstadt, the son of
                    Napoleon and Maria Louisa, who has since died. Prince Ferdinand of Austria
                    received Tuscany, with the title of Grand Duke, as before his dismission, and
                    the district of Piombino; and also the sovereignty of the isle of Elba, but
                    reserving in that island the rights of Prince Buoncompagni Ludovisi. The Infanta
                    Maria Louisa received Lucca as a sovereign dukedom, and with it a yearly pension
                    of 500,000 francs, till the decease of the Empress Maria Louisa. The pope was
                    fully reinstated in all his dominions, with the exception of a few small
                    portions on the left bank of the Po; but Austria reserved the right of
                    recruiting in Ferrara and Commachio. Ferdinand of Naples was again acknowledged
                    as king of both Sicilies, and the republic of San Marino and the Prince of
                    Monaco were guaranteed in the full enjoyment of their ancient rights.</p>
                <p>The restoration of the old governments was not followed by the immediate return
                    of tranquillity, and much less of contentment. A large army had suddenly changed
                    its colours, and the officers serving in it feared that a change of masters
                    might be unfavourable to their professional advancement. There was, or soon
                    arose, a disposition to speculate on forms of government, to which Italy had
                    always a strong tendency; and though it had been repressed by the military and
                    inquisitorial power in the hands of Bonaparte, it was only stifled, and, when
                    that power was destroyed, spread with great rapidity. This naturally engendered
                    republican feelings; and the idea of uniting the whole of Italy into one large
                    republic, to be administered solely by natives, was too flattering to the vanity
                    of a people accustomed to view all foreigners as barbarians, not to meet with
                    numerous adherents. The proselytes were chiefly found amongst those least
                    capable of calculating the capability or the consequences of their projects. The
                    spirit of change was deeply imbibed by the active part of the people, and
                    especially those of immature age; the students in the colleges, the inferior
                    officers in the civil and military departments, and the younger members of some
                    of the noble families who were reduced to poverty by the exactions which had
                    been practised by their late masters. In the recollection of what Italy had been
                    fifteen centuries before, when she ruled the world, they overlooked many
                    centuries during which she had since been subjected to Goths, Lombards, Germans,
                    Normans, and Spaniards, and at intervals to the French. They never adverted to
                    the condition <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that most numerous class of all, the
                    peasantry, who had formed the armies of Caesar and of Pompey, when independent
                    in mind and powerful in body, but had since become the most ignorant,
                    thoughtless, superstitious, and degraded of all the serfs of Europe. Though
                    there were abundance of revolutionary projectors, and extensive conspiracies
                    formed, yet the hands that were to execute the purposes of such leaders
                    completely failed when collected together, if opposed by only a mere handful of
                    disciplined troops. This had been seen when Murat led a large army proclaiming
                    the independence of Italy, and promising to deliver it from all its transalpine
                    intruders. The same spectacle was exhibited in both the attempts at revolution
                    which were made in Naples and in Piedmont.</p>
                <p>In Austrian Lombardy the same tendencies to revolution existed as in the other
                    parts of the peninsula; but they were checked by the vigilance of the police,
                    and by an armed force, which, as they spoke a different language from the
                    conspirators, was not to be infected by the general mania of the natives. In the
                    other parts of Italy, where the army was composed of natives, the prevalence of
                    revolutionary views was easily communicated, and perhaps nowhere prevailed more
                    generally than amongst all ranks of the officers. This was especially the case
                    in Naples, where the army that had been created by Murat, and officered by him,
                    was placed by the restored king under the command of the Austrian general
                    Nugent, to the great mortification of all in the service. The French military
                    regime was exchanged for that of Austria; the taxes upon land were increased;
                    and, by an agreement with the pope, many of the abolished monasteries were
                    re-established. These arrangements gave force to the speculative opinions which
                    prevailed of a republican kind, and originated many secret societies, the most
                    extensive of which was that of the <hi rend="italic">Carbonari,</hi> which, if
                    we may trust to the oaths and declaration as published by their enemies, was of
                    the most atrociously murderous and diabolical kind.</p>
                <p>Although the societies of the Carbonari had been opposed by another society,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Calderari,</hi> adhering to the royal party, and
                    employed by the police, it was said that they counted amongst their members, and
                    those who favoured their proceedings, more than six hundred thousand
                    individuals, including all the provinces of the kingdom. This vast combination,
                    though to a certain degree known to exist, and to be numerous, made no public
                    demonstrations of its force till a revolution had broken out in Spain. The
                    excitation produced by that event spread throughout Italy, but the strongest
                    effect was experienced at Naples. On the 2d of July 1820, Michael Morelli, a
                    lieutenant of cavalry, and Luis Minichini, a priest, excited some troops
                    quartered at Nola, by some violent harangues, to cry aloud, “God, the King, and
                    the Constitution.” They were soon joined by an officer of the guards with about
                    twenty men, and the next day marched to Avellino, the capital of the province,
                    where one of the conspirators had already declared the insurrection, and gained
                    over more troops, when the united bodies advanced to Montefort, and took up a
                    position, which they surrounded with intrenchments. Some troops were sent by the
                    government, under General Campana, to reduce them to submission; but these
                    troops discovered no disposition to act. Another general, Carascosa, with more
                    soldiers, was pushed on; but they also refused to fight their brothers. On the
                    5th, General Pepe, at the head of a regiment of dragoons, proceeded from Naples
                    and joined the insurgents, and was then declared their chief. Messengers were
                    sent from the army to the king with petitions, requesting him to grant a
                    constitution. He had no troops that could be relied on, and promised to present
                    them with the plan of a constitution in eight days, and in the mean time
                    dismissed his ministers, and replaced them by some of the leaders of the troops.
                    This did not satisfy the impatient insurgents, and they demanded that within
                    twenty-four hours the Spanish constitution should be adopted. The king appointed
                    his son viceroy, and he assented to the proposition in his father’s name.</p>
                <p>The Spanish constitution thus proclaimed, was that of the Cortes of 1812 in
                    Cadiz, of which no one in Naples had any knowledge, nor could even a copy of it
                    be found in the city at the time of its adoption, as a fundamental law of the
                    regenerated kingdom. In ten days, without a drop of blood being shed, a military
                    revolt placed the revolutionists in the possession of the full power of the
                    kingdom. An <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944029" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4029-0479"
                    />insurrection almost immediately broke out in Sicily, which, acting on the same
                    principles, required independence; and the populace having broken loose,
                    committed many disorders, such as breaking open the prisons, robbing the rich,
                    murdering several persons of rank, and amongst these Prince Catholico, and
                    assassinating others; so that on the 17th of July, three days after the events
                    in Naples were known, fifteen hundred persons were killed and wounded in the
                    city of Palermo, and confusion prevailed in every other part of the island.
                    General Pepe was sent with a body of troops to restore tranquillity. He found
                    the cities in a state of horrid confusion, some taking the part of the
                    Neapolitans, and others insisting on independence. This state of misery
                    continued till the whole insurrection in Naples was quelled.</p>
                <p>Whilst Sicily was thus suffering the worst of horrors, the revolution in the
                    continental part of the kingdom proceeded with less confusion. An assembly was
                    convened, and adopted the Spanish constitution with some few trifling
                    alterations. Though suggestions were made by some of the members, that some
                    conditions taken from the English or French constitutions, or from some of those
                    states in Germany which had recently received constitutions, would be desirable,
                    they were scarcely attended to, and none of them acquiesced in. A great military
                    force was decreed, to consist of fifty-two thousand regular troops, two hundred
                    and nineteen thousand moveable national guards, and four hundred thousand local
                    national guards, besides ten thousand gens-d’armes and coast-guards. The spirit
                    of the regular troops could not be relied on, as many of the best of the
                    officers had resigned their commissions. In a very short time the treasury was
                    exhausted, though it had been left in a prosperous state; and it became
                    necessary to borrow money from a Parisian banker, who advanced 1,500,000 ducats
                    at a high rate of interest. The expenditure had increased at the rate of
                    4,084,000 ducats, whilst the income had diminished at the rate of 2,916,000
                    ducats, annually.</p>
                <p>In these new hands every branch of the administration had become confounded, and
                    embarrassed each other; the courts of justice decided nothing, the number of
                    criminals increased, and trade was stagnant. These circumstances existed at
                    Naples when the congress at Troppau, consisting of the emperors of Russia and
                    Austria, and the king of Prussia, with their ministers, and the ambassadors from
                    the other powers of Europe, had assembled, and in November had decided on a
                    military interference in the affairs of Naples. Austria at this time had marched
                    an army of eighty thousand men into her Italian provinces, under the command of
                    General Frimont. Great Britain and France had each placed a naval squadron in
                    the Bay of Naples, which were appointed to watch over the safety of the king and
                    the royal family. These preparations excited the feelings of the several parties
                    in the capital, producing on one hand suspicion and distrust, and on the other
                    hope and joy. The king of France had offered to mediate between the parties, and
                    suggested that the king should have the veto, the choice of his ministers, and
                    the power of dissolving the assembly; but such propositions received no
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The three combined monarchs had on the 20th of November written a letter to
                    Ferdinand, inviting him to meet them at Laybach; and the king of France had
                    urged him to take this step. He resolved on doing so, and announced his
                    resolution to the parliament on the 9th of December, and required that, during
                    his absence, no changes in the constitution should be made. This communication
                    produced much violent debate, and the answer given was a resolution, “that any
                    proposition to alter the Spanish constitution being contrary to the oaths of the
                    king and the parliament, they consent to his majesty undertaking the journey, on
                    the condition that he will take the proper means to secure the acknowledgment of
                    that constitution.” To this resolution the royal reply was, that his majesty had
                    never entertained any designs to change the constitution; but that, to avoid a
                    war, it was advisable, by the king’s mediation at Laybach, to obtain the
                    sanction of the congress to what had been done, and that no further changes
                    should be made during his absence. The parliament persisted in their resolution,
                    and the king, on the 10th of December, declared that his mediation should have
                    no other object than to maintain in its integrity that Spanish constitution that
                    had been already sworn to, and to avert a war. The crown prince was then
                    appointed regent; the king and his consort embarked in an English ship of the
                    line on the 13th of December, landed at Leghorn on the 19th, and thence
                    proceeded through Florence to Laybach.</p>
                <p>The prince regent seems to have given way to the im petuosity of the parliament,
                    to have passed some very revolutionary laws against the nobles of Sicily, and
                    prepared as well as they could to arrange an army, which then was composed of
                    fifty-four thousand troops of the line, and sixty thousand militia and
                    volunteers; and they all appeared very energetic in the cause they had
                    espoused.</p>
                <p>When the king arrived at Laybach he was soon made acquainted with the decision of
                    the congress, not to acknowledge as legal any transactions which had passed in
                    Naples since the 5th July; and that the power of suppressing what was deemed a
                    military revolt should be intrusted to the emperor of Austria. This resolution
                    was made known by the king to his son, who acted as regent in Naples. At the
                    same time the ambassadors of the combined powers made known, through the
                    secretary of state for foreign affairs, to the prince regent, that an Austrian
                    army was ready to enter the kingdom and to occupy it; and that if that was
                    insufficient, a Russian army would also receive orders to join their force. The
                    regent replied that he should make this known to the people, from whom he should
                    not separate himself, because in all that had occurred great moderation had been
                    shown, and the greatest respect displayed towards the royal family. The regent
                    replied to the king, that as he could not believe the communication from his
                    majesty to be a voluntary act, he should adhere in every way to the people, and
                    share all dangers with them; upon which the ambassadors of the allied powers
                    withdrew from Naples.</p>
                <p>Preparations were now made for defence, and a proposal, that for the present the
                    constitution should be suspended, and the regent declared dictator, was
                    negatived. General William Pepe called to arms the whole of the people, arranged
                    under ancient names, such as the legion of Brutus, of the Samnites, and others,
                    and added them to the regulars, thus mustering a hundred and fifty thousand men,
                    but many badly armed and clothed, and worse disciplined. The plans for defence
                    were well arranged had the troops been well composed. The Austrians advanced,
                    the first encounter happened on the 5th of March, and by the 10th a general
                    dispersion of the whole army had taken place. It is not necessary to relate the
                    several movements of the two armies. Many of the Neapolitans were killed in
                    their flight; but the Austrians assert that they lost in all the combats not
                    more than seventy men. The Neapolitan troops of the line soon joined themselves
                    to the Austrian army, and the volunteers and militia returned to their homes.
                    The Carbonari talked loudly of carrying on a guerilla war amongst the mountains,
                    but it produced no effect. Naples, with the fortresses of Gaeta and Pescara,
                    capitulated on the 23d of March; the lodges of the Carbonari were dissolved, the
                    leaders, including the two generals, Pepe and Carascosa, obtained passports to
                    foreign countries; and the last sparks of the revolution were speedily
                    extinguished.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944042" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4042-0480"/>
                <p>The king had arrived at Florence, whence he arranged a provisional government,
                    which speedily abolished the whole of the republican institutions, and restored
                    such as had previously existed. The troops of the line were disarmed and
                    disbanded, and the volunteers stripped of their arms and accoutrements. The
                    police was established on its ancient footing; and some of the leaders of the
                    revolt were prosecuted, of whom a few were executed after trials before the
                    restored tribunals. A detachment of the Austrian army passed over to Sicily, and
                    in a short time restored tranquillity in that island, after having disarmed a
                    few parties of guerillas that infested the mountainous parts of it, whilst those
                    who had commanded them fled into Spain. The restored government conducted the
                    prosecutions with great mildness. Forty-three of the most conspicuous persons
                    were brought to trial, of whom thirty were condemned to death, but only two of
                    them, Morelli and Gilvati, were executed. On the 22d of September an amnesty was
                    issued, from which only eleven persons were excepted, viz. General Pepe, the
                    monk Minichini,' Concilio, Carascosa, Rossarol, and six others, all of whom had
                    taken refuge in England. Thus, in little more than fifteen months, the Carbonari
                    insurrection was completely defeated, and the people returned to their usual
                    habits, occupations, and gratifications.</p>
                <p>The revolution which broke out in Piedmont whilst that in Naples was in
                    operation, originated in the same causes, but varied in its progress, because it
                    was more especially of a military character, and headed by persons of more
                    weight, as well in the civil as in the military departments. The chief leaders
                    of the insurrection were the Marquis Carlo de St Marzano, son of the minister
                    for foreign affairs, Colonel Provano de Collegno of the artillery, the Counts St
                    Michael and Santa Rosa, officers of the staff, Captain Count de Lissio, and some
                    others, forming a confederacy to which they had given the name of the Italian
                    League. They had resolved to select as their chief Prince Carignan, the heir
                    apparent, who, they asserted, felt great zeal since the revolution at Naples,
                    and was the best qualified to become the prince or king of New Italy. According
                    to their representation, he had, on the 6th of March, acted with them, on the
                    7th he had declined proceeding, and on the 8th he had again consented to the
                    revolution. On the 10th of March the revolt began in the regiments at Fossano,
                    Tortona, and Alessandria, where the officers had gained over the men by
                    spreading rumours that the Austrians had resolved to disband the Sardinian army,
                    and to garrison the fortresses with their own troops. In vain the king
                    contradicted the rumour; the insurrection increased, and a council of the
                    officers, of which Ansalti was president, issued a declaration in the name of
                    the Kingdom of Italy. From Alessandria the infection spread to Turin, where the
                    general cry was “Long live the king and the Spanish constitution.” The people in
                    the capital remained quiet, and a part of the garrison was marched against the
                    insurgents.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of March the king issued a proclamation commanding tranquillity and
                    obedience, affirming that the garrisons of foreign troops should never be
                    admitted; but on the same day the officers, with some of the students, seized on
                    the citadel of Turin, by which the populace became excited, and in crowds
                    exclaimed for the Spanish constitution and for war with the Austrians. Upon this
                    the king, who had assented to the resolutions of the congress of Laybach, could
                    not yield to the popular cry, and resolved to abdicate the throne; and on the
                    13th he did so, appointing, in the absence of his brother Felix, who was the
                    next in succession, but at Modena, Prince Albert Carignan as regent. The whole
                    of the ministers were then dismissed, the state prisoners liberated, and the
                    Carbonari were everywhere triumphant, except at Nice, to which city the king had
                    removed. The new regent found himself compelled to obey those whom he had
                    expected to lead, and declared for the Spanish constitution, but with a reserve
                    in behalf of the king’s consenting to it. He then appointed new ministers, a
                    council or junta, and promised to convene a parliament.</p>
                <p>In Novara and some other places a dislike of the Spanish constitution was
                    displayed; and in the whole of Savoy an aversion to the revolution prevailed.
                    Amongst those who had favoured the revolution great differences arose. Many, and
                    those the most thoughtful, preferred the constitution of France with two
                    legislative bodies, to that of Spain with a single one. On the other hand, the
                    revolution found many partisans in Lombardy; and many of the young men from
                    Milan and Pavia hastened to join the revolted troops at Alessandria, which was
                    the central point. Prince Felix at Modena refused the crown, declared the
                    abdication to have been forced, and consequently illegal, and placed Count
                    Galieri della Torre as commander in Novara, to take the command of the loyal
                    troops and suppress the rebellion. This event tended greatly to damp the spirits
                    of the revolutionary party; they still, however, remained triumphant in Turin,
                    where the ambassador from Austria was dismissed, and preparations made to
                    assemble a force and invade Lombardy under the command of Count Santa Rosa. But
                    on the night of the 23d of March, on which the resolution had been taken by the
                    council, the prince regent fled to Novara, thence to the Austrian headquarters,
                    and then to Modena; but, being refused admittance to Prince Felix, he took up a
                    short residence at Florence, and afterwards served in the French army which
                    restored royalty in Spain in 1823.</p>
                <p>. The revolutionists continued to encourage their party by assurances of speedy
                    assistance from France, and of great accessions by the revolting of the Austrian
                    troops; but the news of the defeat and dispersion of the Neapolitan insurgents
                    among the Abbruzzi Mountains, which arrived at this period, inclined the
                    Piedmontese to attempt a treaty, by which an amnesty should be granted, and
                    stipulations made against the entry of any foreign troops. This, however, proved
                    ineffectual, for the troops at Novara, under Della Torre, outnumbered any the
                    insurgents could collect; and in Turin many abhorred the new system, and it was
                    their desire that, without foreign troops, the revolt should be suppressed; but
                    Felix at Modena had applied to the Austrian commander, and Count Bubna at the
                    head of five thousand men joined forces with Della Torre, at two o’clock in the
                    morning of the 8th of April at Novara. The, troops of the insurgents appeared
                    before that city at daybreak, and a battle ensued. They fought bravely, but were
                    at length defeated. The native troops advanced to Turin, and the insurgent
                    fortresses surrendered to the Austrians. The junta at Turin dissolved itself,
                    and on the 10th the citadel was delivered up to Della Torre. The king renewed
                    his abdication, and his brother Felix assumed the title of king. His power was
                    now as unrestricted as that of his brother had been, and he instituted a
                    tribunal for the investigation of crimes, and punishing the offenders; but most
                    of them had escaped, many by way of Genoa to Spain, and others through
                    Switzerland to France. It was shown before the tribunal that many of those who
                    were arrested had acted by orders from Prince Carignan at the time he was the
                    legal regent of the kingdom, and upon this ground they were unanimously
                    acquitted. The property of sixty-five persons who had escaped was declared to be
                    in a state of sequestration. Twenty-one others were declared guilty of high
                    treason and condemned to death; and the same number were doomed to the gallies,
                    with the confiscation of their goods. Of all these, only thirteen were
                    apprehended, amongst whom were two who had been condemned to death. Only one,
                    however, was executed; <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944055"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4055-0481"/>he was a captain of cavalry, named Garelli. The
                    other, in his flight by sea, had been driven on shore and captured; and showing
                    that he did not return by design, he was only banished for life.</p>
                <p>This mild administration of the judicial tribunal, with a general amnesty, and
                    rigid decrees to prevent any secret societies being formed, soon restored
                    tranquillity; and the absence of so many leaders of revolution seems to have
                    extirpated the roots of that spirit which, for a short period, had threatened a
                    most fearful civil war. As the revolt in Spain in the year 1821 had been one of
                    the exciting causes of the insurrections in Naples and Piedmont, so it appeared
                    that the revolution in France which seated Philip of Orleans on the throne of
                    that kingdom was the proximate causes of the disturbances which broke out in
                    Italy in 1831.</p>
                <p>The complaints in Italy were general, and the remedy sought varied according to
                    the opinions in the several states; but there was one opinion in which all who
                    were dissatisfied united, namely, that the only cure for the evils they
                    complained of was to be found in a general government, which should unite under
                    one legislative body, composed wholly of Italians, the interests of all the
                    states into which the country is at present divided. The feeling towards the
                    ultramontane barbarians, for such they had been taught to consider the rest of
                    the European nations, was by far the strongest and the most universally
                    diffused, and an appeal to that feeling was a certain way to form combinations
                    with the avowed object of expelling them.</p>
                <p>If some secret societies had existed in Italy before, they increased in number
                    and became more apparent after the transactions in Paris; and the most eager
                    hopes were held out by those who took the lead in such societies, that if they
                    came to an open rupture with their sovereigns, they might rely on effectual
                    assistance from the newly-established power in France.</p>
                <p>The combinations formed, though watched by the police, continued to increase till
                    they were thought by their leaders to be sufficiently powerful to act with
                    effect. The first disturbance began at Modena, on the 3d of February 1831. It
                    was led by one Minotti, and consisted chiefly of young men. The troops were
                    called out, and some fighting in the streets took place, in which the insurgents
                    had the worst, and retreated to Minotti’s house, where they were shut up; and
                    cannon being brought, they surrendered with their leader, and were made
                    prisoners. Thus all appeared again tranquil; but two days afterwards
                    intelligence arrived from Bologna that the insurgents in that city had been
                    successful, and that its influence extended to Reggio. A new and much more
                    formidable revolt then broke out. It gained strength, so that the Duke of Modena
                    deemed it wise to withdraw from his capital, escorted by his troops, and
                    accompanied by his prisoners, Minotti and his companions, and to take refuge in
                    Mantua, where was a strong garrison of Austrian troops. He left at his departure
                    a council of regency, which the people soon dissolved, and then nominated a
                    provisional government, upon which the populace plundered the palace, destroyed
                    the custom-houses on the frontiers, and committed other disorders.</p>
                <p>At Bologna, a city of sixty thousand inhabitants, there was only a small garrison
                    of papal troops, not exceeding six hundred innumber. On the 4th of February an
                    insurrection took place, chiefly composed of young men, many of them the
                    students of the university. They assembled round the palace of the cardinal
                    legate, who was absent, and required of the pro-legate the resignation of his
                    authority, and that it should be delivered over to a provisional government. He
                    at first refused, then hesitated, and at length complied. The soldiers received
                    and obeyed orders from the newly-appointed council; but their commander, with
                    the pro-legate, withdrew to Florence. The temporal power of the pope was
                    abolished by a decree of the provisional government, and a national guard on the
                    French model was ordered to be formed. This success at Bologna spread the spirit
                    of revolt through all the delegations from that city to Ancona; and the latter
                    city capitulated, with its citadel, to a slight force of the insurgents which
                    appeared before it. A great part of the papal territory was thus under the
                    insurrectionary power. Their force indeed entered the Apennines, intending to
                    advance to the city of Rome itself; but being disappointed in the expectations
                    they had formed of some revolutionary movements in that city, they abstained
                    from any attempt on it.</p>
                <p>In Parma the transactions nearly resembled those in Modena. The duchess was
                    compelled to withdraw, and, escorted by her troops, found an asylum at Piacenza,
                    when her subjects also formed a provisional government.</p>
                <p>Strong expectations had been indulged by the insurgents of similar movements in
                    the other parts of Italy, and especially in Piedmont and Tuscany; but no
                    symptoms of it were manifested in them, and the whole of Lombardy under the
                    Austrian power remained in a state of anxious tranquillity. Austria had drawn a
                    large force from her hereditary dominions, which had reached the Italian
                    provinces, and was said to amount to a hundred thousand men, well disciplined
                    and well appointed. Had the revolutionary bodies, who began to assume some
                    regular order, been in possession of even common prudence, they would have
                    avoided any step which could have provoked or justified Austria in interfering
                    in their affairs, which, knowing the tendency of the Austrian court, they might
                    have been convinced, would be pleased with a pretext for undertaking active
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Instead of temporising or disguising their views, no sooner was the provisional
                    government assembled, than, vain of their newly-acquired power, they issued a
                    proclamation inviting the Lombards to join them in their federation. “Brave
                    patriots of Lombardy,” said they, “follow the example of France, imitate the
                    example of Italy, burst asunder the chains with which the holy alliance hath
                    fettered you. You are the slaves of foreigners, who enrich themselves by
                    despoiling you, and by rendering yon daily more miserable. On the day of your
                    rising, forty thousand of our patriots will march to assist you in crushing the
                    Austrians. Let there be no delay, for there is danger in hesitation. Display
                    your courage, fellow-countrymen, and despotism will flee from our lands.”
                    Similar addresses were issued to the subjects of the king of Naples and of the
                    king of Sardinia; but they had suffered too much by the transactions of the year
                    1821 to be easily excited; and besides, those who might have proved the most
                    active leaders had been banished, and were dispersed in various countries. Under
                    the mild and paternal government of the Duke of Tuscany, whatever dispositions
                    might exist, or whatever sympathy might be felt for the neighbouring insurgents,
                    no manifestations were displayed, but tranquillity was universally enjoyed.</p>
                <p>France, at the period when Philip was hardly seated on the throne, had declared
                    that she would not permit Austria to interfere in Italy; but at a subsequent
                    period, when the. new monarch had become firmly fixed in power, an explanation
                    was given, stating, that the declaration did not bind him to take any measures
                    to prevent such interference. The Italians who had revolted were, however,
                    buoyed up with the expectation of assistance from France, and the provisional
                    governments spread the delusion long after it was known that the expectation was
                    vain.</p>
                <p>France was not at that time in a condition to take any effectual part. Her army
                    was not formed, nor her financial credit established, till after the fate of
                    Italy was decided. She could only come in contact with the insurgents by forcing
                    a passage through Switzerland; and, having sueceeded<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944068" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4068-0482"/> in that, she would have to
                    encounter the well-appointed armies of the emperor of Austria or of the king of
                    Sardinia, or of both united. The negotiation between Austria and France seems to
                    have terminated in an understanding that the former power might make use of its
                    troops to suppress the several insurrectionary parties in Italy, but not
                    permanently to occupy the several countries in which they prevailed.</p>
                <p>The troops of Austria did not suspend their operations on account of the
                    negotiations with France. The Po was passed immediately after the promulgation
                    of the address inviting the Lombards to insurrection. One division of the army
                    advanced to Modena without opposition. The duke returned to his capital, and was
                    reinstated in his power. His conduct towards the insurgents was mild; some of
                    them were brought to trial, and a few convicted, but Minotti was the only one
                    who suffered death. Another division marched to Parma; the inhabitants
                    submitted; the duchess returned to her palace, and granted a free pardon to all
                    persons connected with the revolt, excepting those who had occupied seats in the
                    civic congress; and they suffered no infliction except that of being declared
                    incapable of filling any office in the public service during the next three
                    years.</p>
                <p>In Bologna, to which the Austrians advanced, some efforts were made for the
                    defence of that place, the seat of the provisional government; but they were so
                    inadequate that the army entered without any opposition, and speedily all the
                    other cities and towns surrendered except Ancona, where the members of the
                    temporary government had fled for refuge. In their flight they had taken
                    Cardinal Benvenuto, and carried him with them as a hostage or a prisoner. As the
                    Austrians advanced towards Ancona, and no prospect of escape for the
                    revolutionary leaders presented itself, the leaders of the insurgents pressed
                    the cardinal to enter into a treaty, by which an indemnity should be given to
                    all political offenders on condition of surrendering the city and the citadel.
                    He at first refused to enter into any negotiation; but at length, under a
                    protest that he had no power to do so, he signed a treaty to the effect
                    proposed, and the city immediately submitted to its former sovereign. The same
                    submission must have been made in twenty-four hours to the Austrians, and the
                    pope refused to ratify the cardinal’s stipulations.</p>
                <p>Legal proceedings were then instituted against all such of the insurgents as had
                    signed the act of the provisional government which had declared the abolition of
                    the temporal power of the pope, broken their oaths of military obedience, or
                    published irreligious or seditious writings. Several were tried and condemned to
                    different degrees of punishment, but not a single life was sacrificed. It was
                    said that this mitigation of punishment was adopted at the suggestion of the
                    French ambassador at the court of Rome. That minister could not, however, feel
                    much satisfaction at an apologetical paper put forth by the provisional
                    government immediately before its dissolution at Ancona. In that manifesto they
                    stated, “that a principle proclaimed by a great nation, which had solemnly
                    promised not to permit its violation by any European power, and the declaration
                    of guarantee given by a minister of that nation, had induced them to give their
                    assistance to the movements of the people in the several provinces/’</p>
                <p>Within six weeks from their commencement, all the disturbances in Italy were
                    quieted, and the Austrian troops had been withdrawn to their own territory. In
                    the papal dominions, however, there was much confusion, owing principally to the
                    undefined limits of the power of different constituted authorities. These had
                    caused partial revolts, and the miserable papal troops were incapable of
                    suppressing them. His holiness applied to Austria for some troops, which entered
                    his aominions, and enforced submission. This movement had been notified to the
                    French ambassa- ' dor, whose answer left no apprehension on the part of that
                    power; and therefore great surprise was excited when, about a month after, a
                    French fleet, with an army on board, appeared before Ancona, and by a fraudulent
                    attempt succeeded in seizing upon that city with its citadel, driving out the
                    pope’s troops, and exercising many excesses towards the inhabitants. This
                    transaction occurred in February 1831. It led to some detailed negotiations,
                    which at last were settled by a treaty on the 16th of April. By it the French
                    were to remain in Ancona, but no reinforcements were to be sent to them. The
                    general who had made the capture was to be recalled. The troops were not to go
                    beyond the walls of the city, they were to be maintained wholly at the expense
                    of France, they were to interfere in no internal affairs, and were to depart as
                    soon as the pope should have no longer occasion for the assistance of any
                    Austrian forces. In this equivocal situation, the French troops at present
                    occupy one of the best ports in the Adriatic Sea. It is not the business of a
                    work of this kind to enter into speculations on the motives which for the last
                    four years have influenced the king of the French in his conduct regarding
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>Having thus sketched, with as much detail as the limits of this work will allow,
                    the history of Italy from the time when the dissolution of the Roman empire took
                    place t&lt;? the present period, we must remark, that in compressing the events
                    of fourteen centuries into <hi rend="italic">a few</hi> sheets, it has been
                    scarcely possible to dó more than produce a chronicle rather than a complete
                    history, and therefore the dates of the greater events only have been given, so
                    as to be useful for the purpose of reference. The causes which led to these
                    events, the characters of the great actors in them, and the effects produced by
                    them, would have opened a wide field, which might have been explored with
                    delight, but which would have encroached too much on the subjects required to be
                    treated in this work.</p>
                <p>We have, however, here pointed out the origin of the several states which now
                    compose the land of Italy, and at what time and by what means they had attained
                    their rank as sovereignties. The actual condition of these sovereignties will be
                    found in their alphabetical order in this work; but the notices of the preceding
                    pages on the history of Italy will be found sufficient to enable us to dispense
                    with the minute historical details of each of the states that now exist.</p>
                <p>We now proceed, therefore, to take a view of Italy as a whole, and to describe
                    those physical circumstances common to it in that view.</p>
                <p>Italy is bounded on the north-east by the Austrian provinces of Illyria and
                    Tyrol, on the north-west by the cantons of Switzerland, and on the west, in a
                    small part, by the kingdom of France. The southern part, however, which in shape
                    resembles <hi rend="italic">a</hi> boot, is surrounded by the sea, having on the
                    north-east the Adriatic, on the south-east the Ionian Sea, and on the south and
                    west the Mediterranean. Its sea-coasts are for the most part protected by lofty
                    acclivities. On the north-east shore, however, an estuary is created by the
                    mouths of the river Po, which form a kind of delta of swampy and marshy land,
                    whose insalubrious atmosphere acts as a powerful protection against any maritime
                    attacks.</p>
                <p>The extent and population of the several states which compose the whole of Italy
                    is shown by the following table, which includes the great islands of Sardinia
                    and Sicily, and the smaller islands on the coast, but does not comprehend
                    Corsica, which, though inhabited by an Italian race, forms at present a portion
                    of the kingdom of France.</p>

                <p>Thus Italy may be considered about the extent of Great Britain and Ireland, but
                    as containing nearly three millions fewer inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is much diversified by lofty mountains. The most
                    stupendous mass of these elevations, which forms the northern boundary, has been
                    most fully described in this work in its proper place, under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alps.</hi> The second range of mountains, the Apennines, runs
                    nearly through the whole of Italy. These commence in the maritime Alps with
                    Mount Appio, between Tende and Coni, at the southern point of Piedmont, in
                    latitude 44. 12. north, where the pass of the Bochetta is formed. At first they
                    take a direction to the northeast, and then trend to the south-east, and at
                    length to the south-west, when they are lost in the Mediterranean Sea at Cape
                    Passaro in Sicily, in latitude 36. 35. In Upper Italy the Apennines run along
                    near the shore, and the foot of them is washed by the waves of the sea in the
                    territory of Lucca, where they form the Gulf of Genoa. In Tuscany also they
                    nearly touch the coast till they enter the papal dominions, when they run along
                    the centre of the peninsula, and encompass the Abbruzzis and Molise, and pass
                    through Basilicata and the two Calabrias, to the most southern part of
                    Continental Italy. They pass under the straits to Sicily, where they spread over
                    the eastern coast of that island, and are joined with the gigantic Mount Aetna,
                    after which they vanish under the sea. The Apennines are covered with woods
                    quite to their summits. Amongst the trees chestnuts especially abound, and the
                    fruit of them is used by the natives as a most valuable substitute for corn
                    during a great part of the year.</p>
                <p>The Apennines in no case attain the elevation of the Alps, and have only a few
                    very lofty rocky points, the highest of which are Gran Sasso, near Aquila, in
                    the province of Abbruzzo, which is 8255 feet above the level of the sea; and
                    Velino, which is 7870 feet. In winter the range is covered with snow, and it is
                    somewhat late, especially on the northern sides, before it melts. The mountains
                    thus furnish to the inhabitants an abundant supply of that indispensable luxury
                    in a warm climate, ice.</p>
                <p>A great uniformity is observable in the composition of these mountains, which
                    consists chiefly of calcareous stones, though in the extreme north and south
                    parts there are many variations, but in the centre there are no rocks of primary
                    formation. They in many parts abound in tufla; but the main range exhibits no
                    specimens of volcanic matter, which are only to be seen on the south-eastern
                    coast of Italy; Vesuvius, the extinct volcanoes ofNemi and of Albano, and the
                    lava stream of Borghetto, not belonging to the Apennine range.</p>
                <p>In their long progress through the greater portion of Italy these mountains send
                    forth some remarkable shoots or spurs. To those on the west belong the
                    Montagnolo and Montagnata, in the neighbourhood of Siena; the mountain Lora,
                    near to Rome; and the rocky chain of Sorrento, which extends to Capri, in the
                    Terra di Lavoro. On the east are the inferior ranges of the march of Ancona and
                    of the district of Urbino, and especially the branch which projects between
                    Acerenza and Venosa, and proceeds to Leccese, where it is lost in the sea, under
                    which it probably proceeds, till it emerges from the water, and then continues
                    to proceed through the Grecian ranges of Corfu and Arnauth.</p>
                <p>Besides the Apennines, there are other mountains, which, though not far removed
                    from them, yet manifestly do not belong to, and have no apparent connection with
                    them. The most remarkable of these are the mountains of Sorriano and of
                    Fogliano, near Viterbo; Sante Oreste, near Civita Casteliana; Monte Cave,
                    between Frascati and Velletri; and the Volture in Puglia; all on the western
                    side of the main range. Besides these, are the volcanoes, either active or now
                    extinct, viz. Vesuvius. Capo de Monte, San Elmo, Camaldoli, Pausilippo,
                    Solfatara, and Monte Nuovo. The most remarkable capes or promontories which
                    surround the shores of the peninsula are, Martini delle Melle, Manara, and
                    Mesco, on the coast of Genoa; Piombino and San Stefano, on the shore of Tuscany;
                    Linara, Anzo, and Circello, in the territory of the church; Licosa, Palinuro,
                    Felta, Surero, Zambrone, Vaticano, Armi, Sarta, Spartevento, Stilo, Nizzuto,
                    Colonne, Saracino, Roseto, Volta, San Vito, Tureo, Assinella, and Acquabella, on
                    the shores of Naples. To these may be added the following in the island of
                    Sicily, which are of great importance to all the navigators of the Mediterranean
                    Sea, viz. Peloro, San Croce, Passaro, Scaramis, Gra-nitula, Fero Voco, St Vito,
                    Dell’ Ursa, Gallo, Zassarano, Orlando, Carara, and Melazzo.</p>
                <p>The northern division of Italy is copiously supplied with streams of water from
                    those capacious reservoirs formed at the foot of the mountain ranges of the
                    Alps. Those lakes are composed of water, partly arising from springs, but
                    chiefly from the melted snow and ice of the lofty summits around them. These
                    lakes are never frozen in the winter, but run in continual streams, and thus
                    serve the constant purpose of irrigation as well as of internal navigation, till
                    they disappear in the rivers which proceed to the sea.</p>
                <p>The largest of these lakes, called Lago di Maggiore, or Lago di Lucarno, begins
                    in the Swiss canton of Ticino, but soon enters Italy, and then, between the
                    dominions of Sardinia and Austria, extends to Sesto. It is nearly fifty miles in
                    length, and varies in breadth from five to eight miles. It is shallower than
                    most of the other lakes, being in the middle not more than twenty-five feet
                    deep. It is 750 feet above the level of the sea, and is fed by the river Ticino
                    and twenty-six brooks. It contains in it the celebrated Borromean Islands, for a
                    description of which see this work (vol. v. p. 16). Its water issues forth by
                    the river, which retains the same name as at its entrance till it joins the Po.
                    The Lago di Lugano is partly also in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944094"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4094-0484"/>the Swiss territory, and is of less considerable
                    extent, but of great depth. It is about twenty-four miles in length, and from
                    two and a half to six in breadth. Its surface is 870 feet above the level of the
                    Mediterranean Sea. It receives the water of forty-three brooks or rivulets, and
                    discharges it partly by the river Tresa into Lago Maggiore, and partly by means
                    of an artificial canal into the small lake of Piano, a little to the
                    eastward.</p>
                <p>The lake of Como, celebrated for the romantic beauty of its borders, is wholly in
                    Italy. It is about thirty-five miles in length, and in no part exceeds three
                    miles in breadth, but it is of very great depth. It is formed by the river Adda
                    and 195 smaller streams. It issues forth by the river, which bears the same name
                    as at its entrance, but with an increased volume of water, and serves to
                    fructify a great extent of land. At Bellagio it divides into two branches, one
                    of which terminates at the city of its own name, and the other at Lecco. Lago
                    d’Iseo is about twenty miles long and six broad; it is chiefly supplied by the
                    streams of the Oglio, which issues from it again and runs to the Po. Lago d’Idro
                    is small, being only seven miles in length, and through it the river Chiese
                    passes before it joins the Oglio. Lago di Garda is the most extensive of all the
                    lakes of Italy, covering a space of 315 square miles, or 201,600 English acres.
                    It receives the water of the Sarta, and its only issue is at Peschiera, into the
                    Mincio. It is of sufficient depth to carry vessels <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    greatest draft of water. These vast reservoirs are of unspeakable advantage,
                    both to the internal connection of one part of the country with the other, and
                    to the several occupations of agriculture. As the slope of the land is regular
                    and gentle from these lakes to the river Po, nature has thereby formed the means
                    of distributing, with comparatively little cost of labour, the water over an
                    extensive portion of the land, and in that due proportion which the nature of
                    the soil or the description of the crop may require. In many parts streams of
                    water are made to pass rapidly over the fields that require it, and what is not
                    absorbed by the earth is received again into canals, and, at lower elevations,
                    again passed in a similar manner over other fields, till the surplus fluid at
                    length reaches the river Po.</p>
                <p>As these modes of disposing water to the greatest advantage are almost peculiar
                    to Upper Italy, and by their extension have been productive of the most
                    beneficial effects on the fruitfulness of the soil, as well as on the internal
                    communication, a sketch of their commencement and early progress can scarcely be
                    destitute of interest.</p>
                <p>After the decline of the power of the German emperors of the Saxon race, who had
                    succeeded to Charlemagne, several free states were formed, of which Milan became
                    one of the most flourishing; but war having been kindled amongst these states,
                    most of the others combined with the Emperor Frederick I. against Milan, and, in
                    1162, captured and almost destroyed the city, laying waste the fields; but,
                    during the continuance of hostilities, a change of fortune favourable to Milan,
                    and the gaining of a battle, led to a peace in 1176. The energy and industry
                    which this free state had displayed in war became equally manifest in peace. The
                    canal then, as now, called Naviglio Grande, was begun to be constructed in 1178,
                    or rather perhaps restored, for it is probable that the citizens of Pavia,
                    eighty years before, had dug the canal, which had been partly filled up and
                    rendered altogether useless during the continuance of hostilities.</p>
                <p>The canal was at first only carried to Abbiategrasso, but the benefit was found
                    to be so great, that, in the year 1220, the canal of Muzza was added to it. In
                    1269 the canal of Vettabbia was extended and lengthened. It had been originally
                    constructed in 1037, but, as is stated by Giuleni <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">/Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">di Milano,</hi> vol. iv.), was long
                    neglected. In 1350 the canal of Treviglio, or Fosso Bergamasco, was begun; and,
                    in 1460, the Duke Francesco Sforza first planned that of Artesana. These, though
                    in some degree designed for the purposes of navigation, were chiefly planned and
                    regulated to administer to irrigation. Navigation was only permitted two days in
                    the week, and the other five days the water was used to enrich the land. It
                    seems very probable that advantage to the soil from irrigation was known prior
                    to any of the dates here stated as the commencement of these canals. That some
                    progress was made as early as the year 1138, appears from a contract made in
                    that year by the monks of Chiaravalle and Vicooldone, in which are the following
                    conditions: “<hi rend="italic">Ut monasterium possit</hi><hi rend="italic">ex

                    >Johannis.</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">'</hi> A similar contract of the following
                    year, and several of subsequent dates, are still in existence. The whole water
                    of the Vettabbia belonged to those monks, having been granted to them by a
                    charter of the Emperor Frederick II.; and the fame of their skill in the
                    management of water was so great, that the chief of Milan, Napoleone della
                    Torre, intrusted to their care the construction of works for draining the
                    environs of that city, whilst Rinaldo, archbishop of Co-logene, employed them in
                    improving the marshes in his dominions. These ecclesiastics confined their
                    attention and labours exclusively to irrigation, and did nothing for navigation;
                    but they were the first to introduce the practice, since become so extensive, of
                    selling their water by the hour, the day, or the week, and are said to have
                    gained to their convent 60,000 partiche, or about 10,000 acres, of the best
                    meadow-land in Italy.</p>
                <p>Progress in the conducting of water must have been made in Italy centuries before
                    the subject had attracted attention in the other parts of Europe. The learned
                    Frisi, in his work <hi rend="italic">(fiTuova Raccolta d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">autori che trattono del mote della
                    aqua),</hi> speaking of the canal of Muzza already noticed, says that it was
                    planned with the most perfect skill, and formed a masterpiece of art. The canal
                    of Martesana is still seen with surprise. It receives its water from the Vaprio
                    and the Adda; is carried between stone walls five Italian miles, on a level
                    twenty-five feet above the bed of the Adda, parallel to it, in order to preserve
                    the level; and distributes its water to the fields, which it could not otherwise
                    reach without great labour and expense.</p>
                <p>The subsequent progress of the management of water, and its beneficial
                    application to agriculture, belongs more properly to the description of
                    Lombardy, where it will, under that head, be found, than to the more general
                    subject of Italy; but the early state of that art belongs to the history of the
                    first dawn of a useful practice in the peninsula taken as a whole.</p>
                <p>The north of Italy, as may be gathered from the description of the lakes, abounds
                    in rivers. The principal of these is the Po, which conveys to the sea the water
                    of most <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the other streams. It originates in Mount
                    Piso, in the Alps, and takes an eastern direction through the great valley of
                    Lombardy, till it enters the Adriatic. The whole length of its course is about
                    330 miles, but for the first eighty miles it is scarcely more than a brook. The
                    rich plain that is watered by it and by its tributary streams is 330 miles in
                    length and 170 in breadth, and consists of the greatest extent of highly fertile
                    land that exists in Europe. The course of the stream is very rapid, the water
                    running at the rate of more than four miles an hour. A vast quantity of mud and
                    other substances is brought down by this great force of the water to the lower
                    part of the river, and being there deposited, tends to raise the bottom; and
                    though the effect is in some degree <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944107"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4107-0485"/>mitigated by throwing up the substances on the
                    banks, and thereby forming strong dykes or embankments, the bottom of the river
                    has in many parts become higher than the land on both sides of it.</p>
                <p>Though much labour and expense are applied to preserve the embankments, yet, when
                    the snow and ice on the Alps melt suddenly, great inundations are experienced.
                    The chief tributary streams which contribute to form die mass of water of the Po
                    fall into it on the left bank. These are the Agogna in the dominions of
                    Sardinia; the Ticino, the boundary between Sardinia and Austria; and the Adda,
                    the Oglio, and the Mincio, in Austrian Lombardy. The water which increases the
                    Po by its right banks are the streams of the Tanaro, the Trebbia, the Oreglio,
                    the Arda, the Taro, the Parma, the Ena, and the Secchia. The next considerable
                    river of northern Italy is the Adige or Etsch, which comes out of the Tyrol,
                    passes Trent and Verona, and enters the Adriatic a little to the north of the
                    mouths of the Po. It does not in summer discharge much water, and is only
                    navigable a short distance higher than Verona.</p>
                <p>Central Italy does not abound in rivers, and most of them are of short courses.
                    The most considerable is the Arno, which rises in the Apennines, at the foot of
                    Mount Falterone, runs through Tuscany, and enters the sea near Pisa. It is
                    navigable for small craft, but the chief interest it excites arises from the
                    rich and beautiful valley which is watered by it in its passage to the sea. The
                    rivers which rise in the Apennines and run to the eastward, are for the most
                    part mountain streams or torrents, occasionally dry, and, except when the ice
                    and snow melt, contributing but in a small degree to augment the waters of the
                    Adriatic.</p>
                <p>The south of Italy contains few rivers deserving the notice they have received.
                    The Tiber, in the papal state, descends from the Apennines, not far from the
                    source of die Arno, and continues a course of nearly 150 miles, in which it
                    passes Rome, and enters the sea about fifteen below that city. It is turbid,
                    rapid, and deep; but at Rome does not exceed a hundred yards in breadth, and is
                    only navigable from the sea to that city. The only other river in that territory
                    is the Pescara, which runs into the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>The Neapolitan dominions, though abounding in brooks and rivulets, which are
                    valuable to the agriculturist,., and with mountain streams, sometimes swelled
                    into torrents, and at other times nearly destitute of water, has few streams of
                    any length. The most important of them is the Ofanto, running eastward to the
                    Gulf of Manfredonia, the Basiento, the Salandretto, the Agri, and some others;
                    all of which empty themselves into the Gulf of Taranto. Those which run to the
                    westward are the Garigliano, emptying itself into the Bay of Gaeta, the
                    Volur-no, and the Silaro. None of these are navigable, and their mouths are for
                    the most part surrounded with swamps, which generate malaria, and are highly
                    injurious to human life.</p>
                <p>In a country extending from north to south through ten degrees of latitude, there
                    must be a great difference of climate from the position alone; but besides that,
                    the climate of Italy is influenced by the proximity of lofty mountains in some
                    of its divisions, and by the influence of the air from the sea, which almost
                    surrounds the other parts. If we follow the classification of Saussure, we may
                    divide the climate of Italy into four regions. The first extends from latitude
                    46. 28. to 43. 30., and thus comprehends the whole of the Austrian and Sardinian
                    dominions, and the other territories to the north of the Apennines, with the
                    legations of Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagna. In this region the quicksilver in
                    Reaumur’s thermometer descends to 10 degrees below zero; the lagunes at the
                    mouths of the rivers are frozen; and sometimes in January and February the snow
                    remains from ten to fourteen days on the ground. Delicate plants do not grow
                    except in sheltered situations; but the mulberry trees flourish, and rice is
                    grown. The slight night-frosts appear in November, and some years as late as
                    April. Even in summer a benumbing cold is brought down from the Alps, by a
                    violent storm of northerly wind. The second region extends from 43.30. to 4L 30.
                    comprehending Tuscany, Lucca, the papal states, the Abbruzzis, and the whole of
                    the western shore to the south of the Apennines, though some part of the latter
                    does extend as far north as 44., but, from being sheltered by the mountains, has
                    a climate similar to the southern part. This is the appropriate climate for the
                    growth of the orange, the lemon, and the olive; but, even in this region, the
                    snow is occasionally to be seen on the fields. The third region extends from 4L
                    30. to 39., and comprehends the greater part of the continental dominions of the
                    kingdom of Naples. Here snow is rarely seen, and never remains; and the
                    quicksilver seldom falls below three degrees, and all plants of the agrumenous
                    tribe flourish in the open air. The fourth region extends from 39. to 35. 50.,
                    and comprehends the southern part of Calabria, and the island of Sicily. The
                    quicksilver rarely falls below zero, and snow and ice are unknown except on the
                    summits of the mountains of Aetna and Sila. The tropical fruits come to
                    perfection in the open air, the sugar-cane flourishes, the cotton plant ripens,
                    the date trees are seen in the gardens, and the enclosures of the fields arc
                    formed by aloes. It will be obvious that this classification cannot be
                    universally applied, and principally attaches to the flat land of Italy. Thus
                    the positions on the sides of high mountains, the vicinity of the sea, and the
                    volcanic nature of the soil, all have an influence which must cause many local
                    variations in any classifications, and form exceptions to what is generally
                    correct. The tops of the Alps in Savoy and Piedmont are covered with perpetual
                    snow. The Apennines are commonly clothed with it from the middle of October till
                    the beginning of April; and on the highest mountains of Abbruzzo, the Majella
                    and the Velino, it remains from September till May. The northern part of Italy,
                    including Tuscany and the papal states, does not generally present that charming
                    aspect which people from the north picture to themselves of the garden of
                    Europe; and they are only introduced into that region on proceeding to the east
                    from Maufredonia, or to the west from Terracina. There the winter is scarcely
                    colder than our September; vegetation proceeds without interruption; and the air
                    is filled with the most aromatic odours.</p>
                <p>The climate of Italy, represented, as it frequently is, in the most glowing
                    colours, is not without great and serious annoyances and inconveniences. There
                    prevails from May to September a burning heat; the sun, with its perpendicular
                    rays, threatens to destroy every vegetable; this burning atmosphere produces a
                    brown landscape, unrefreshed by a drop of rain; when the air of the cooling sea
                    breezes is scarcely perceptible, or is so changed as to bring with it from the
                    shores of Africa only a thick, damp steam, whilst a subterranean heat glows
                    perpetually under the volcanic soil, and periodically sends forth noxious
                    vapours injurious to the health of men and of beasts, and which have tended to
                    produce depopulation in many extensive districts. To these evils may be added
                    the annoyance produced by numerous swarms of insects, which fill the air, visit
                    the dwellings, and are a constant source of vexation. The vast lagunes at the
                    mouths of the great river, the Pontine Marshes, with similar swamps on the
                    sea-coast, and in many other parts, tend to generate miasmata, that shorten
                    human life, and are among the causes that the proportion of deaths to the whole
                    number of inhabitants is greater in Italy than in any other division of
                    Europe.</p>

                    facs="nls:192944120" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4120-0486"/>ed of Gauls, Germans, and
                    Arabians, who at various but distant periods have immigrated into the peninsula,
                    and mingled with the few aborigines, whose language they have expelled; and from
                    it has been framed a speech, which by cultivation has attained a peculiar
                    character, and become, notwithstanding its variety of dialects, a common bond of
                    union. The language used by the best writers is nearly the same in every part of
                    Italy; but that of the lower classes is so very different in the several
                    divisions of the country, that those born in one can scarcely understand the
                    conversation of the natives of the other. All the educated classes can
                    comprehend and enjoy the writings of Dante, Petrarch, Boccacio, Tasso, and
                    Ariosto composed in the Tuscan dialect.</p>
                <p>In Italy the inhabitants universally adhere to the Roman Catholic church; or, if
                    any differ from it, the number must be very inconsiderable, as there are no
                    public celebrations of any other religious rites but such as are prescribed by
                    that communion, except that the Jews in Venetian Lombardy, in Leghorn, in Rome,
                    and in Ancona, have permission, but under some rigid restrictions, to establish
                    synagogues. The foreign Protestants also may celebrate their rites in their own
                    language, under the sanction of the ambassador or consul of their nation. The
                    established clergy are very numerous, and said to amount to 500,000 persons, or
                    one in forty of the whole population. The number of sees, which formerly
                    exceeded that of the bishoprics in the rest of Christendom, has been greatly
                    reduced, as well as the greater part of the monasteries, which once deluged the
                    cities and large towns. The churches, however, still possess great riches, and
                    are everywhere sumptuous in their decorations and ornaments, containing much of
                    what is most magnificent and glorious in art, or most refined in taste,
                    elegance, and beauty. The exterior of the churches is very imposing, and the
                    ceremonies are performed with the greatest degree of pomp and solemnity.</p>
                <p>The higher clergy possess great power, and all of them enjoy immunity for their
                    persons and goods, and in most cases are freed from taxation. The secular
                    priests are under the superintendence of the bishops, and the monasteries under
                    the chiefs of their several orders. Though the extent of the influence and power
                    of the church, and its universality, are the same as in Spain and in Portugal,
                    its exciting cause and its associations are very different. In those countries
                    the religion is a species of chivalry, originating in the idea of the conquests
                    achieved over the Moorish Mahommedans, and combined with all the traditions on
                    that subject; but in Italy it is chiefly to be traced to the progress made in
                    the fine arts. It is associated with painting and statuary, with music and with
                    architecture, and, as in Spain, has little connection with the moral feelings of
                    integrity, chastity, temperance, industry, and the domestic relations. These
                    virtues, where they exist, owe but little to the institutions of the church, of
                    which they are unshaken though but feeble adherents. Confession and absolution
                    are the substitutes for those virtues, and little beyond the value of those
                    substitutes is inculcated in religious instruction.</p>
                <p>In no part of Europe is the education of the humbler classes so neglected as in
                    Italy, taken as a whole; for though some advances have recently been made in
                    Lombardy and in Tuscany, and will probably continue, yet nothing is thought of
                    or projected in the other territories, on the subject. The instruction of the
                    poor is wholly in the hands of the ecclesiastics, and nothing can be worse
                    conducted. It is a wonder to find a countryman that can read, and a handicraft
                    workman in the towns that can write his own name is equally singular. The
                    institutions for the higher kinds of education are also far behind those in the
                    other countries of Europe. Amongst these are the colleges and lyceums, where the
                    instruction is partial, and neither calculated to impress with taste, nor to
                    excite freedom and extension of thought. The studies are directed to logic and
                    some classics; but the sciences are neglected, as are the languages of other
                    countries, their customs, their intelligence, and their modes of thinking and
                    reasoning. Mathematics are scarcely known, but casuistry is sedulously
                    inculcated. The <hi rend="italic">Collegia Ambrosiana</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collegia Erera</hi> in Milan form exceptions to the description
                    here given, but in everything but classical literature they are far from being
                    well conducted.</p>
                <p>The universities where education is completed are sufficiently numerous, and
                    mostly of ancient date in their foundation. They are, Salerno, founded in the
                    year 1100; Bologna, in 1119; Naples, in 1224; Padua, in 1228; Rome, in 1248;
                    Perugia, in 1307; Pisa, in 1329; Siena, in 1330; Pavia, in 1361; Turin, in 1400;
                    Parma, in 1422; Florence, in 1443; Catania, in 1445; Cagliari, in 1764; and
                    Genoa, renewed and extended in 1783; to which mav be added that of Modena,
                    which, after long neglect, has recently been re-established.</p>
                <p>The dates of these institutions may serve to show the probable course of study
                    originally introduced, when the works of the schoolmen and the casuists entirely
                    engrossed the public mind. Some few improvements may have been ingrafted on
                    these foundations, but they have been of little efficacy in exciting to study,
                    or in forming a considerable proportion of enlightened scholars.</p>
                <p>In almost every one of the cities of Italy there have been long-established
                    literary and scientific societies, which have cherished and encouraged learning
                    among their respective members. These were begun in the fifteenth century, and
                    have multiplied and increased ever since. They have contributed, since the
                    restoration of learning, to its preservation, and have been in a great degree
                    the means of bringing the talents and industry of the scholars into public
                    notice. They are too numerous to be even named here. One of the earliest, as
                    well as the most celebrated, is the <hi rend="italic">Academia della Crusea</hi>
                    of Florence, which still exists, and had for its object the perfecting of the
                    language, by which great renown has been gained. The most flourishing of these
                    societies in the present day are the Imperial Institution of Milan, and the
                    Academy of Sciences at Turin. The institutions for the promotion of the fine
                    arts are numerous; they are in connection with schools, in which painting,
                    sculpture, and architecture, are taught by competent masters. The most useful of
                    these are at Florence, at Rome, and at Bologna.</p>
                <p>Italy abounds in collections of books, and especially of manuscripts of great
                    antiquity, and of high value. Tire libraries in general are, however, very
                    deficient in works of modern literature and of science. The most distinguished
                    of the libraries are that of the Vatican in Rome, the Ambrosian at Milan, that
                    of St Mark in Venice, and those of the Magliabechi and the Medici at Florence.
                    There are in every part of Italy museums of great value, and most of them are
                    arranged in the most perfect manner. All of them are with the greatest
                    liberality thrown open to the public, and are thereby made the common property
                    of all nations. Each palace of the men of eminent rank, and each public
                    building, is a cabinet of art; and each city boasts of its antiques or of its
                    modern works of art. The most distinguished of the museums are those of Florence
                    and of Naples. Picture galleries are to be found everywhere, and present to the
                    inspector of them many of the finest specimens of that delightful art. The
                    churches, too, are most abundantly graced, as well by their architecture as by
                    the exquisite pieces which exhibit the skill of the painters or the sculptors.
                    The greatest loss that Italy had to lament was the removal of the best works of
                    art by the French invaders; but, fortunate <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944133"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4133-0487"/>ly for the country, the events of 1814 and 1815
                    led to their being again restored to the several places which had been robbed of
                    them. There are botanic gardens attached to most of the universities, and
                    several in the vicinity of the larger cities; and there are astronomical
                    observatories in Bologna, in Padua, in Milan, in Florence, and in Palermo.</p>
                <p>The clergy have already been noticed; and in viewing the inhabitants of Italy
                    generally, it is proper to advert to the class next to that body in rank, but
                    superior to them in number. The nobility consists of a vast number of families,
                    each member of which continues through all their generations to retain their
                    titles, even though they may be destitute of wealth. In most of the dominions
                    they have little or no influence as a body on the measures of the governments.
                    In the papal states, in Sicily, in Sardinia, some patrician power exists, and
                    some feudal rights are exercised, and in Genoa a shadow of their ancient dignity
                    is retained; but in the other parts not even a shadow of power is to be found
                    amongst them. They have the barren titles of prince, duke, viscount, marquis, or
                    count. Many of them possess extensive landed estates, which are for the most
                    part majorats, or strictly entailed on the eldest son, and many of these are
                    said to be at present deeply mortgaged. As no provision is thus made for the
                    junior members of such families, they commonly enter the church or the army, and
                    sometimes, though rarely, obtain offices in the civil service of the government.
                    Of late some of the nobility have directed their attention to agriculture; but
                    none of them, except in Venice and in Genoa, have applied themselves to
                    commerce. From the condition of this class, it is usual to find amongst them the
                    whole of the family residing in the palace of the head of it, with their wives
                    and children, if they have any. As money rent is not commonly paid for the
                    estates, but the produce of these divided between the proprietors and their
                    occupiers, the necessaries for the support of such families reach them directly;
                    and, except for purposes of show or of luxury, very little money is necessary.
                    Although some members of the noble families have devoted themselves to the
                    promotion of literature, of science, or of the fine arts, yet the great body
                    live in the silent enjoyment of their rank and property, or, when mixing in
                    society, do so in those crowded but economical assemblies, where they can, with
                    little interruption from plebeian intruders, enjoy the patrician feeling of
                    their dignity. In such families, the foreigners that may be introduced to them
                    do not receive, or in general expect to receive, any hospitable attentions; nor
                    indeed is hospitality one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> those good qualities by
                    which Italians are distinguished in any of the ranks of life.</p>
                <p>It is generally reported that the morals of this class have been gradually
                    improving of late years, and that the practice of each married lady having her
                    favourite lover or cicisbeo, after the birth of her first child, is rapidly
                    disappearing. In regard also to gambling, it is said to have been practised to a
                    less ruinous extent of late years than in former periods. One of the greatest,
                    or at least most usual, gratifications of the people of this rank, is a box at
                    the opera, where they most commonly attend in the evening, and where, enclosed
                    by curtains, they can receive the visits of their friends, without interrupting
                    the pleasures they derive from the representation and the music.</p>
                <p>The burghers in the cities have now none of the power which they enjoyed in the
                    many cities which were once denominated free. The municipal power is
                    concentrated in the hands of the several governments; and, where corporations do
                    still exist, they have no other right than that of presenting humble
                    representations or suggestions on inferior and local subjects. The more affluent
                    inhabitants of the cities, comprehending those of the legal profession, the
                    bankers, the merchants, and the superior artists, amongst whom may be included
                    the possessors of the smallest landed estates, are not numerous; but they mix
                    more with strangers than the nobles, and have fewer national prejudices. They
                    appear to know that all born beyond the Alps are not necessarily barbarians or
                    semibarbarians, and amongst them foreigners may find the best associates.</p>
                <p>The lower class of the town population are in bad repute, both as to morals and
                    instruction. They are represented as more acute than honest, and are reported to
                    be only capable of being restrained from violations of life and property by the
                    activity of a very vigilant police.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the faults of the Italian nation, one good quality is obvious;
                    their ready assistance to suffering humanity. All the cities are filled with
                    charitable institutions, wherein infants, the helpless aged, the diseased, and
                    the destitute, find refuge and relief; but it must be acknowledged, that no
                    country has more need of such institutions, for in none are there to be found so
                    great a number of beggars, nor so numerous a body as, in all the cities, take
                    little care for any thing beyond the passing day or even hour.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the population of Italy is, however, to be seen in the
                    country, devoted to the pursuits of agriculture. A few, a very few of them, are
                    in circumstances of moderate affluence; a few more maybe represented as in a
                    state of comparative ease, enjoying a bare sufficiency to support life; but the
                    great body, to whom all others bear a slight proportion, are in the most
                    wretched condition. They are the occupiers of small portions of land, some of
                    them not exceeding an acre in extent, and most of them less than four acres,
                    where, in miserable hovels, barely sheltered, they labour in the fields, and
                    subsist themselves and their families on half the produce of the land, the other
                    half being delivered to the proprietor at the time of harvest as his rent. Their
                    food, simple as it is, is far from being sufficient to keep them in a healthy
                    state. They taste neither bread nor animal food. Their chief subsistence is
                    called polenta, made from Indian corn, which is merely pounded and then boiled,
                    no expense on account of the miller or the baker being incurred. This kind of
                    meal, made to the consistence of hasty pudding, would certainly be an aliment
                    sufficient to support life when the quantity could be adequately supplied; but,
                    with the utmost parsimony during the whole year, the termination of it, as the
                    next harvest approaches, often finds them utterly destitute, and with no other
                    resource but beggary or starvation. This is the condition of the larger class of
                    human beings in the north and middle of Italy; whilst in the south the lazzaroni
                    of Naples are living proofs of the wretched condition of great numbers in that
                    more fertile soil and more temperate climate.</p>
                <p>The Italians as a nation, excepting, however, those of the lowest class, are a
                    fine race of men. The men are well formed, rather slim than stout, but strong
                    and agile, with a complexion, either from nature or from exposure to the sun, of
                    a dark hue, with expressive countenances and dark sparkling eyes, and for the
                    most part with black hair. Their gait is grave but not solemn, and their whole
                    appearance is expressive of self-respect. The women have mostly narrow
                    foreheads, black or dark-brown hair, large, brilliant, and expressive eyes, a
                    beautiful nose, which, with the forehead, forms the elegant Roman profile; a
                    small mouth, with lips rather swelling; a clear, white complexion, with slight
                    red tinges showing through it, and a delicate but well-formed figure. But the
                    lower classes, owing to their early marriages, their subsisting wholly on
                    vegetable food, and the hard labour they <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944146"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4146-0488"/>endure, exposed to a burning sun, have their
                    beauty checked before it has attained maturity, and rarely display any
                    attractions.</p>
                <p>A hasty or an unobservant traveller, in passing through Italy, may well be
                    charmed with the scenery of the country, the magnificence of the cities, the
                    clearness of the sky, and the mildness of the climate. He will see only what is
                    admirable and exciting. The prospects on descending from the Alps, adorned as
                    they are by lofty precipices, with their tops buried in snow, and their sides
                    discovering waterfalls descending into the beautiful lakes below, are all of a
                    kind to gratify the sense, as are also the odours exhaled from flowers; and the
                    fruit-trees regale another sense at the bottom. On the plains, too, the beauty
                    of the fields, surrounded with mulberry trees, haying vines in elegant festoons,
                    with their pendant fruit, trained from one tree to the next, the centre of the
                    enclosure exhibiting heavy crops of corn, pulse, or culinary vegetables, all
                    conspire to increase the delight. The excellence of the roads, the post-horses,
                    and the inns, contribute their share to heighten the enjoyment. The appearance,
                    too, of the cities, with their magnificent public edifices and their spacious
                    private dwellings, though the streets may be narrow and crooked, presents a
                    picture eminently calculated to convey to the beholder that feeling of pleasure
                    which novelty usually creates in the mind. We have enjoyed these gratifications
                    to the fullest extent; but, in the description here given, we have felt it a
                    duty to look beyond the delightful surface, to view the interior of the land,
                    the state of the several classes of society that inhabit it, and to communicate
                    to the reader the most accurate view that could be produced after much careful
                    investigation. If it be more dark and gloomy than it has been commonly drawn, it
                    will not be found, by those who, like the writer, have examined and
                    discriminated, to be unfaithful in the delineation.</p>
                <p>In every country agriculture is the chief branch of industry, and this is
                    eminently the case in Italy; but, from the formation of the land, and still more
                    from its extending through ten degrees of latitude, it becomes difficult to take
                    a general view of the state of cultivation. The cultivation of Savoy or Lombardy
                    differs from that of Calabria as much as that of Massachusetts does from that of
                    Carolina. In this work, therefore, the details of rural economy will be found
                    under the heads of the several dominions into which Italy is divided; and in
                    this place will only be noticed those results of agriculture which yield food,
                    drink, or clothing to its inhabitants, or which form the basis of manufacturing
                    industry, or the rudiments of foreign commerce. The cerealia form, as elsewhere
                    in Europe, the chief aliment of the inhabitants; in Italy, however, the lower
                    classes, who are the most numerous, subsist much on maize, which requires little
                    preparation to render it fit for food. In some of the southern parts wheat is
                    made use of by the same class, not in the form of bread, but in that of
                    macaroni, which is manipulated with greater facility. It is made from a hard
                    wheat commonly produced from the soil, or, in times of scarcity, imported from
                    the countries on the Black Sea or the Sea of Azoph. Wheat and maize are, on the
                    average of years, about equal to the consumption, but little or none can be
                    spared for exportation; and in many of the ports are depots of foreign wheat
                    kept to meet the variations of seasons, or to be used as articles of commerce
                    with other countries.</p>
                <p>As Italy produces abundance of wine, and consequently needs neither beer nor
                    corn-spirits, no barley is needed for these drinks, and scarcely any is
                    cultivated. Oats are but little grown, but abundance of beans of various kinds
                    is produced. Rye, the common bread-corn of the far greater portion of Europe, is
                    only raised in a few spots in the very northernmost parts of Italy, where it is
                    made into bread for the poor; whilst those of the higher classes there, as well
                    as throughout the whole peninsula in the cities make use of wheaten bread. Rice
                    grows in many parts, in fact wherever there is a sufficiency of water to insure
                    a good produce, at such a distance from towns as not to be injurious to the
                    health of the inhabitants. It is a part of almost every meal in families in easy
                    circumstances, but is scarcely used by the families who are in circumstances
                    that require the practice of great parsimony. A great variety of lupines are
                    used as food, especially in the soups. In some parts of the mountainous regions
                    chestnuts are a substitute for corn as long as they last. Fruits are plentifully
                    used, particularly melons and cucumbers, as food; whilst the cheapness of'
                    onions, garlic, tornatos or love-apples, and capsicums, render them valuable as
                    condiments. It is singular that that useful vegetable the potato, which in the
                    other parts of Europe has been so much extended of late years, has been but
                    partially introduced into Italy; and, where it is cultivated, it occupies a very
                    small proportion of the soil. Lettuces, asparagus, endive, artichokes, and
                    several kinds of turnips and of carrots, are everywhere grown.</p>
                <p>Animal food is far from being extensively used. The oxen yield in some parts
                    excellent, in others very indifferent, meat. The mutton is neither good nor
                    abundant. Swine furnish a plentiful supply during the winter months, but are
                    chiefly to be seen as bacon or hams, and above all prepared as sausages, the
                    fame of which latter has reached unto England under the name of the city
                    Bologna, where they were early and extensively prepared. The large dairy farms
                    in Lombardy, in which the cheese known by the name of Parmesan is made, furnish
                    the most and the best swine’s flesh.</p>
                <p>The fisheries contribute largely to the supply of food in Italy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, though, from the number of fasts still countenanced
                    by the Catholic church, not sufficient for the consumption; and the deficiency
                    is procured by commerce with the English, French, and Americans, who convey to
                    the sea-ports the salted cod-fish from the banks of Newfoundland. Their own
                    fisheries on the coast give much occupation; the most considerable are those for
                    the tunny, a very large fish, and for the anchovy, a very small one. These are
                    conducted upon a large scale by joint-stock companies, composed of almost the
                    whole of the inhabitants of the parts of the coast where they are carried on.
                    The lakes and the rivers also yield some, though not a great proportion, of that
                    kind of food which ecclesiastical restrictions render indispensable.</p>
                <p>The sugar-cane is cultivated in the south of Italy, and some is grown
                    spontaneously; but it is found, that in point of strength, as well as of cost,
                    the sugar made from it does not succeed in a competition with that substance
                    when imported from the West Indies.</p>
                <p>The products of agriculture are sufficient for the clothing of all its
                    inhabitants; for though wool is neither good nor plentiful, yet hemp and flax
                    are grown everywhere, are man <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ufactured at home,
                    and, from the nature of the climate, linen can be substituted for woollen dress
                    during most of the months of the year. Some raw wool is, however, imported to
                    supply the manufactures, and some cloths both from England and France, together
                    with (in Lombardy) those from the other Austrian provinces, especially from
                    Bohemia. Some cotton is grown on the southern divisions of Italy, but not
                    sufficient to furnish materials for their very insignificant institutions of
                    that manufacture.</p>
                <p>The chief product of Italian agriculture is the silk. It is produced in every
                    part, and much of it is converted into articles of dress or of furniture, where
                    it is collected; but the chief production of it is in the dominions of the king
                    of Sardinia, or of the emperor of Austria, whence the looms <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944159" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4159-0489"/>of England, Prussia, Austria,
                    Russia, and Germany, are supplied. The value of this commodity exceeds that of
                    all the other productions of Italy which are exported to foreign countries. It
                    is still making, as it has made during the last eighteen years, a rapid advance;
                    and the great increase which has taken place in the propagation of mulberry
                    trees promises, as they arrive at maturity, to increase the quantity of raw silk
                    to an extent which could not have been calculated upon twenty years ago. An
                    enlargement on this important article of commerce would be out of place in this
                    general account of Italy; and for further information on the subject the reader
                    is referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Piedmont</hi> in this work.</p>
                <p>An article of great importance, produced from the soil of Italy, which is used
                    partly as food, partly employed in home manufactures, and extensively exported
                    as an article of foreign commerce, is the oil of the olive tree. It is used as a
                    substitute for butter in the south, is much appropriated to the manufacture of
                    many kinds of soap, and is exported to England for the use of our various
                    fabrics, chiefly those of wool, and as a luxury at our tables. The planting and
                    watching costs but little labour or expense, and in a few years the income more
                    than recompenses for the labour. The best olive oil is produced near Genoa, in
                    Lucca, in Tuscany, and in Calabria; but it is plentiful throughout the whole of
                    Italy, except in Lombardy and in Piedmont.</p>
                <p>The wines of Italy are not very highly valued in other countries, and almost the
                    whole that is produced is consumed at home. In the northern parts there is a
                    degree of acidity unfavourable to the taste, and scarcely any of them are or can
                    be preserved beyond one year. The vines are not so much grown in vineyards, as
                    in the hedge-rows; and this, it is thought, injures the quality of the wine. In
                    the southern parts the wines arc of a more fiery quality, but are not much
                    esteemed by foreigners. The names of them will be found under the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tuscany, Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Papal
                    Dominions.</hi> The grapes are in some of the southern states dried into
                    raisins, as an article of foreign commerce; but the whole is an insignificant
                    branch of trade.</p>
                <p>The minerals of Italy are of small amount; and though mines of gold, silver, and
                    copper were once wrought, all of them are now extinct. It yields at present some
                    alum in the Papal Dominions and the Neapolitan territory, some vitriol and
                    antimony in Parma, and sulphur in the kingdom of Naples. In many parts marble is
                    extracted, but the best is near Verona and Carrara; and alabaster is found in
                    many of the mountains. The salt is furnished on the seashore, and some of it
                    from saline springs, and is adequate to the consumption.</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of Italy, and the internal trade, as well as the
                    manufacturing industry, are various in the different states, and are or will be
                    noticed in their appropriate places in this work. It need only be said here,
                    that the roads being good in Italy, the intercourse between the several states
                    is kept up with great facility; and that the interchange of the commodities of
                    one district with those of another is profitable to those trading classes
                    generally who devote themselves to the occupation. <hi rend="smallcaps"
