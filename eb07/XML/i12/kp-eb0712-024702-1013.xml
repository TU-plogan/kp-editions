                <p><label type="entry">ILLINOIS</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    is bounded on the north by the territory of Huron; on the east by Lake Michigan
                    and the state of Indiana; on the south by the Ohio river, which separates it
                    from Kentucky; and on the west by the Mississippi, which separates it from the
                    state and territory of Missouri. It lies between lat. 37° and 42° 30' north, and
                    long. 87° 20' and 91° 20' west, being about 380 miles in length from north to
                    south, and 210 miles in width from east to west, and comprehending an area of
                    58,900 square miles. Next to Louisiana and Delaware, this is considered as the
                    most level state in the Union. There are a few hills, and some elevations that
                    might be designated mountains; but by far the greater portion of the state
                    consists of beautiful and fertile prairies, finely diversified with wood. These
                    prairies or meadows, which are sometimes of vast extent, are distinguished by
                    the names of wet and dry, alluvial and rolling. The wet prairies contain peat,
                    logs of wood, and exhibit other indications of their having once been morasse^
                    in which wood grew. The origin of many of the rivers is to be traced to these
                    prairies. Those of an alluvial nature are high and dry, of a rich black loam,
                    which is exceedingly fertile; and they are covered with a coarse kind of grass,
                    which grows to an enormous size. 1he high and rolling prairies are sometimes
                    chequered with groves of sparse trees. Their soil is in general only of second
                    rate quality, and they abound in springs. Grape vines are abundant; und they
                    furnish an inexhaustible summer range for cattle. From the exceeding flatness of
                    some of the plains, and their consequent want of inclination, the rain that
                    falls is not carried off, but allowed to remain and stagnate, so that such
                    situations are very unhealthy. Grand Prairie is the largest tract of land of
                    this description. The first stratum of soil is a black, friable, and sandy loam,
                    from two to five feet in thickness. The next is a red clay mixed with fine sand,
                    and from five to ten feet in thickness. The third is a hard blue clay, of a
                    beautiful appearance and greasy feel, mixed with pebbles, and, when exposed to
                    the air, capable of emitting a fetid odour. This soil is of the first quality,
                    and here the springs are found. Strawberries are raised in immense quantities,
                    and of the very finest quality. Timber, however, is scarce, and good water is
                    likewise deficient.</p>
                <p>Between Carlisle and St Louis a tract of country fifty miles in extent, woods,
                    streams, hills, limestone ledges, and a rolling country, present themselves. The
                    hills here abound in stone coal, and limestone is also plentiful. A range of
                    hills commences at the bluffs which bound the “American bottom,” near Kaskaskia,
                    and stretches north-eastwardly through the state towards Lake Michigan. Another
                    k ne-stone bluff breaks off almost at right angles to this chain, and stretches
                    along the margin of the American bottom to the point nearly opposite the
                    Missouri. This bluff has in many places a regular front of perpendicular
                    limestone, not unfrequently 300 feet in height. There are other chains of
                    bluffs, which are marked by the same grand natural features. The American bottom
                    commences not far below Kaskaskia, and stretches eighty miles along the shores
                    of the Mississippi. It is from three to six miles in width, and forms two belts,
                    the one, which borders the Mississippi, having a heavy timbered bottom, and the
                    other, which reaches the foot of the perpendicular bluffs, being prairie of the
                    richest quality. For above one hundred years crops of maize have been raised on
                    some parts of this tract, without the slightest exhaustion of soil having become
                    apparent. Vegetation here flourishes most luxuriantly; but there is a
                    counterbalance in the unhealthiness of the climate, particularly during autumn.
                    On either bank of the Illinois, almost from its mouth to its source, there is a
                    similar bottom, with bluffs and chains of hills similar to the preceding. The
                    military bounty tract, which is distributed amongst the soldiers of the late
                    war, commences in the neighbourhood of Lower Alton. It comprehends the northwest
                    corner of the state, about 170 miles long and sixty broad, and is situated
                    between the rivers Mississippi and Illinois. This district of country has great
                    advantages; the t&gt;oil is rich and extremely fertile, and much of the prairie
                    ground is eminently beautiful; but the situation is unhealthy. Not only in this
                    state, but over all the western territory, the lands seem to be distributed in
                    bodies, either of rich or sterile, or of level or broken lands. On Rock River,
                    the Illinois, the Kaskaskia, Embarras, between the Big and Little Wabash, on the
                    Parassaw, the Macoupin, the Sangamon, and on all the other considerable streams
                    of this state, there are very large tracts of first-rate land. The Grand
                    Prairie, the Mound Prairie, the prairie upon which the marine settlement is
                    fixed, and that occupied by a society of Christians from New England, are all
                    exceedingly rich. The Sangamon district of country, in particular, presents a
                    happy proportion of timbered and prairie lands, and a soil of great fertility,
                    whilst accounts from various quarters concur in representing it as more healthy
                    than any other part of the state. The prevailing trees are, the locust, black
                    walnut, and pecean; and there is a vast summer range for cattle. Iron and copper
                    ore, salt springs, gypsum, and stone coal, are abundant; and the whole district
                    is now divided into a number of populous counties, and is thickly settled by
                    thriving farmers. Along the course of the Kaskaskia or Okau, tracts of land
                    equally extensive and fine are stretched. This river has a long course through
                    the central parts of the state, and a country beautifully di <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941026" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1026-0248"/>versified with hill, vale,
                    prairie, and forest. On its banks is Kaskaskia, formerly the seat of government;
                    and Vandalia, at present the metropolis. A late traveller (Stuart, <hi
                    rend="italic">Three Years in North America,</hi> vol. ii. p. 379) thus speaks of
                    Illinois: “The general description of the state of Illinois is, that it contains
                    58,900 square miles; is the fourth state in point of extent in the union, only
                    inferior in this respect to Virginia, Georgia, and Missouri, with a general
                    level, not varying above sixty feet; and that it consists, with little
                    interruption, of one vast prairie of admirable soil, extending from the
                    Mississippi to Lake Michigan. It is the richest country in point of soil in the
                    world. The French called it the terrestrial paradise.”</p>
                <p>Count Marbois thus writes 'of this country generally: “At the junction of the
                    Mississippi and Missouri, the lands lying towards the north-west are of
                    admirable fertility. Emigration already inclines there; and these districts,
                    though very remote from the sea, will one day be as well peopled as any other
                    country in the world. The Mississippi, the Missouri, the Arkansas, and the Red
                    River, and their tributaries, water 200,000 square leagues within the space of
                    country called the basin of the Mississippi. This internal navigation, prepared
                    by nature, has already been wonderfully extended and improved by canals,
                    excavated by the labour of man; and steam-boats descend and ascend against wind
                    and tide, brave the most rapid currents with more speed, and with more
                    convenience, than the finest roads in Europe can be travelled. Wood and coal,
                    indispensable agents in this navigation, abound on the shores of the rivers; and
                    the steam-engine has put an end to the difíiculty of communication, heretofore
                    one of the greatest obstacles that were ever opposed to the improvement of
                    colonies.”</p>
                <p>Illinois is particularly fortunate, not only in the number, but in the
                    navigability, of its rivers. For a great distance on its northern extent it has
                    the waters of Lake Michigan, and the boatable streams that are therein
                    discharged; and by this means a communication is opened with the northern fronts
                    of Indiana and Ohio, with New York and Canada. On the north-west is Rock River,
                    a long, beautiful, and boatable tributary of the Mississippi. Its whole western
                    front is washed by the latter river, and its northern by the Ohio. On the east
                    is the Wabash, which has a course of about 130 miles, the greater part of it
                    being navigable; and through its centre winds in one direction the Illinois,
                    which connects the Mississippi with Lake Michigan by the Plein and Kankakee,
                    whilst in another direction the Kaskaskia traverses the state for a distance of
                    between 200 and 300 miles. At present the state is supposed to include 4000
                    miles of boatable waters within its limits. The Illinois, which gives name to
                    the state, may be considered as the most important river in North America,
                    having its whole course within one state. It is formed by the junction of two
                    other rivers in the north-west part of Indiana, and, passing into Illinois,
                    pursues generally a south-westerly direction, and flows into the Mississippi
                    twenty-one miles above the Missouri. It is upwards of 400 yards wide at its
                    mouth, is about 400 miles long, and is of easy navigation. Its current, which is
                    very gentle, is unbroken by falls or rapids, and it passes through a fine
                    country.</p>
                <p>In this state there are prodigious lead mines, as well as those of coal and lime.
                    There is also building stone in the bounty tract. Specimens of native malleable
                    copper have been found, weighing from one to three pounds. On the Saline River,
                    a branch of the Ohio, are salt springs, from which salt is manufactured at a
                    cheap rate. About 300,000 bushels of this article are annually made. The lead
                    mines are situated at Galena, on Fever River, near the north-west corner of the
                    state. The working of them commenced in 1821, andjn 1824 there were made 175,220
                    lbs. of lead. In the year 1829 the produce had amounted to 13,343,150 lbs.</p>
                <p>The prevailing forest tree in Illinois is oak, of which thirteen or fourteen
                    different species are enumerated. Throughout the territory there are also found
                    honey locust, black walnut, mulberry, plum, sugar maple, black locust, elm,
                    bass-wood, beech, buck-eye, hack-berry, coffeenut, sycamore, spice-wood,
                    sassafras, black and white haws, crab-apple, wild cherry, cucumber, and pawpaw.
                    White pine is found on the head branches of the Illinois. The chief produce of
                    the state is Indian corn, wheat, and the other agricultural productions of North
                    America. From the extent and fertility of the soil, those articles which it is
                    best adapted for are raised in far greater quantities than are requisite for the
                    home consumption of the state. The immense prairies afford abundance of food for
                    cattle, and grazing is extensively carried on. Great numbers of fine cattle and
                    horses are regularly sent to New Orleans. Most of the clothing of the people is
                    of domestic manufacture. The climate of Illinois does not materially differ from
                    that of the same latitudes in the Atlantic states. The low and wet lands in the
                    southern part are unhealthy, and the cold of winter is in some parts exceedingly
                    severe. Amongst the diseases which afflict this state is one called the <hi
                    rend="italic">milk sickness,</hi> with which cows are seized, particularly in
                    autumn, when the first severe frost begins. It is supposed to be occasioned by
                    the eating of a luxuriant poisonous vine, to which the animals are compelled at
                    this season of the year to have recourse for sustenance. Milk taken in any
                    quantity seems to produce the same disease in other animals, and even in men,
                    and it very often proves fatal.</p>
                <p>We shall now describe a few of the principal towns of this state. Vandalia, the
                    political metropolis, is pleasantly situated on a high bank of the Kaskaskia
                    river, in the centre of a rich and thriving country. Although only founded a few
                    years since, it contains many handsome brick buildings; and respectable houses
                    for the accommodation of the government and the courts have also been erected.
                    Edwardsville, on Cahokia Creek, twenty miles north-east from St Louis, is a
                    county town of some consequence, and was, until within a few years, the seat of
                    government. Belleville is in the centre of Turkey Hill settlement, eighteen
                    miles south-east of St Louis, and a few miles east of the American bottom. It is
                    a flourishing village, in the midst of a compact settlement, and most excellent
                    lands. Alton is a new village, a little above the mouth of the Missouri. Its
                    position is favourable, the situation is healthy, and it promises to become a
                    considerable town. Carlisle is situated on the western bank of the Kaskaskia, on
                    the great road from Cincinnati to St Louis. Boats of burthen can ascend the
                    river to this place when the water is favourable. Cahokia is situated in the
                    American, bottom, on a creek of the same name, a few miles below St Louis. It is
                    one of the most ancient villages in the county, is of considerable extent, and
                    chiefly inhabited by French. There is another French village of about the same
                    size, called Prairie du Rocher. It is situated near a most beautiful limestone
                    bluff, twelve miles above Kaskaskia. Kaskaskia is situated on an extensive
                    plain, not far from the commencement of the American bottom, eleven miles from
                    the mouth of the river on which it stands, and six miles from the nearest point
                    of the Mississippi. This town was one of the first establishments made by the.
                    French in the valley of the Mississippi, and is a place of higher antiquity than
                    Philadelphia. It was once of greater importance than it is at present, the
                    inhabitants, which were formerly 7000 in number, being now reduced to 1000. It
                    is beautifully situated in the centre of a gently sloping basin, on a fine
                    navigable stream, and in the midst of a country proverbial for its fertility. It
                    is the seat of <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941039" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1039-0249"
                    />justice for the county to which it belongs, and has a bank, a printing-office,
                    a Catholic church, and a land-office. At about three hundred miles west from
                    Vandalia stands Galena, which owes its origin to the rich lead mines in the
                    vicinity. It contains forty-two stores and warehouses, between 200 and 300
                    dwelling-houses, and 1000 inhabitants. There is here a weekly journal, and the
                    usual concomitants of a county seat. About 10,000,000 pounds of lead are
                    annually exported from this place. The population in the vicinity is estimated
                    at 10,000. Shawnectown is situated on the Ohio, nine miles below the mouth of
                    the Wabash. The great United States Saline, situated twelve miles from this
                    town, contributes to give it consequence. It is the seat of justice for its
                    county, and has a bank with a large capital, and a land-office. Besides these,
                    there are a number of towns or villages, which, however, do not require
                    particular notice.</p>
                <p>The territory of Illinois was formed into a state and admitted into the Union in
                    1818. By the constitution no more slaves can be admitted into the state. The
                    legislative power is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and a
                    house of representatives. The senators are chosen for periods of four years, and
                    the representatives biennially. The executive power is vested in a governor, who
                    is chosen for four years, and is ineligible for the succeeding four years. There
                    is a supreme court established by the constitution, and there are inferior
                    courts established by the general assembly. The judges who are appointed by the
                    assembly hold their places during good behaviour, but can be removed by the
                    governor on an address of two thirds of each branch of the general assembly.
                    Schools are supported by a grant of land amounting to a thirty-sixth part of
                    each township; and three per cent, of the net proceeds of the United States’
                    lands sold within the state is appropriated for the encouragement of learning,
                    of which a sixth part is required to be bestowed on a college or university. A
                    further provision has been made for a university, by the grant of two townships
                    of land by the United States. Illinois college, situated at Jacksonville, was
                    founded in 1829, and has a fund of 13,000 dollars.</p>
                <p>Though this state is in general favourable for the construction of roads, yet the
                    low and clayey prairies are exceptions. Rivers furnish the most convenient means
                    of transport, and various canals, which will make up for any deficiency, are in
                    contemplation. It is also proposed to extend the national road from Indianapolis
                    to Vandalia, and thence to St Louis. The history of this state forms part of
                    that of Louisiana, under which head it will be given. With regard to the native
                    Indians, they have by different treaties ceded the greater part of their
                    territorial claims to lands; and those who still roam at large are rarely seen,
                    excepting on the skirts of the state, in the character of hunters, or of
                    vagrants. This state is divided into forty-eight counties, and the census of
                    1830 gives the population as follows: Whites, 155,176; slaves, 746; making the
                    total 157,575. The number of inhabitants has been tripled in ten years. <hi
