                    >vertebrated animals with red blood, breathing through the medium of water by

                    is the result of observation; it is a product of analysis, or what is termed in
                    physics an empyrical formula; but its accuracy is demonstrable by the inverse
                    method, for, when once duly perceived, we may in a great measure deduce from it
                    a knowledge of the entire nature of the beings to which it is applied. Being
                    vertebrated, they must be possessed of an internal skeleton; of a brain and
                    spinal marrow, enclosed in a vertebral column; of muscles exterior to the bones;
                    of four extremities only; and of the organs of the first four senses, situate in
                    the cavities of the head; with other relations not necessary to be here
                    named.</p>
                <p>The greater portion of the surface of the earth is covered by the waters of the
                    translucent sea; and wherever continents and the larger islands protrude their
                    rocky bulk, we find them coursed by flowing rivers, or intersected by lakes and
                    marshes. These present in their aggregate an enormous mass of waters,, and
                    afford protection and nourishment to myriads of living creatures, probably
                    superior in number, and in no way inferior in beauty, to those which inhabit the
                    earth. On land, the matter susceptible of life is mainly employed in the
                    construction and continuance of vegetable species; from these herbivorous
                    animals draw their nourishment; and this being animalized by assimilation,
                    becomes an appropriate food for the carnivorous kinds, which scarcely amount to
                    more than one half of the terrestrial creatures of all classes. But in the
                    liquid element, and more especially among the saline waters of the ocean, where
                    the vegetable kingdom is so much more restricted, almost all organized
                    substances are pervaded by animal life, and each lives at the expense of some
                    smaller or feebler foe. There we meet not only with the greatest and most
                    wonderful variety of forms, but also with the extremes in respect to size,—from
                    the myriads of microscopic monads, which, but for artificial means, must have
                    remained for ever invisible and unknown, to the ponderous whale, which surpasses
                    by twenty times the bulk of the largest elephant. There, too, we may discover
                    the majority of those magnificent combinations of organic structure, on the
                    relations of which naturalists have established the distinction of classes, or
                    great primary groups,—in other words, the sea may be said to contain
                    representatives of each; for, even among birds, those aerial creatures which
                    usually inhabit so light an element, we find species so constructed as to dwell
                    almost for ever on its waves. The mammiſerous class is still more fully
                    represented in the numerous tribes of seals, morses, manaties, and whales, all
                    of which require a moist abode, and some of which immediately perish when
                    deprived of it. Most reptiles are aquatic, many insects are so, more
                    particularly in their larva state; and almost all the Mollusea, the Annelides,
                    the Crustacea, and Zoophytes,—four great classes, which on terra firma are few
                    and far between,—exist in countless numbers in the waters of the ocean. Hence
                    that ancient dictum recorded by Pliny, “Quicquid nascatur in parte naturae ulla,
                    et in mari esse; praeterque multa quae nusquam alibi.”</p>
                <p>But amongst all the teeming wonders which vivify the vast expanse and liquid
                    depth of waters, none so predominate, or are so truly characteristic, as the
                    subjects of our present treatise; nor are any more worthy of our devoted
                    consideration, whether we regard the beauty or eccentricity of their forms, the
                    metallic splendour of their colours, or the innumerable benefits which, through
                    the foresight of Providence, they confer upon the human race. We therefore deem
                    it incumbent upon us to exhibit an ample view of the present condition of
                    Systematic Ichthyology; but before doing so, we shall endeavour to add to the
                    interest of the subject by a few general observations.</p>
                <p>We may state, in the first place, that we here intentionally refrain from any
                    bibliographical inquiry, or historical exposition of the progress of
                    Ichthyology. If such were complete, or even ample, it would occupy too much of
                    that space which we deem more usefully devoted to the actual condition of our
                    subject-matter. We more willingly set that department aside, when we consider
                    how perfectly it has been presented by Baron Cuvier.<note anchored="true"

                    Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">des Poissons.</hi> We deem ourselves fortunate
                    beyond our predecessors in ency-clopaedic labour, in having as a guide in so
                    difficult a subject as that on which the reader is about to enter, the first
                    nine volumes of Baron Cuvier’s signal publication. We should act unwisely were
                    we to present a crude compendium of the works of foreign and British writers,
                    such as has hitherto sufficed for publications similar to that in which we are
                    now engaged. We prefer adhering throughout to Cuvier’s system of arrangement, as
                    one which, without doubt, is entitled to supersede all others hitherto proposed.
                    We shall also avail ourselves, wherever our doing so seems likely to instruct
                    the reader, of whatever general or miscellaneous information is scattered
                    through his work, presenting it in a form and sequence the most advantageous to
                    those unacquainted with the voluminous original; and adding, especially in
                    relation to our native species, whatever we find of interest in recent authors,
                    among whom, as elucidators of “British Fishes,” Messrs Couch and Yarrell stand
                    pre-eminent. We beg to make this general acknowledgment of the infinite
                    advantage we have derived from Baron Cuvier’s labours, in the formation of the
                    present treatise, in reference both to our introductory and systematic
                    portions.</p></note> We shall, however, briefly allude to what may be regarded
                    as the principal epocha in the progress of Ichthyological Science. During many
                    remote ages it consisted, in common with all the kindred branches of human
                    knowledge, of nothing more than a few partial and disjointed observations.
                    Aristotle, about 350 years before the Christian era, made some progress towards
                    connecting these together as a body of doctrine; but still it was a feeble body,
                    reposing upon truths (perceived indeed with surprising skill when we consider
                    the scanty data) as yet obscurely known and vaguely expressed, owing to the
                    entire absence of all proper standards for the distinction of species. For more
                    than eighteen hundred years ensuing, those who wrote on natural history can
                    scarcely be regarded in any other light than as either copiers or commentators
                    of Aristotle; but about the middle of the sixteenth century, Belon, Rondelet,
                    and Salviani, the true founders of modern Ichthyology, made their appearance (we
                    mean as authors), by a singular coincidence, almost precisely at the same
                    time,—the first in 1553, the second from 1554 to 1555, and the third from 1554
                    to 1558. Differing from their compiling predecessors, they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939778" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9778-0152"/>saw and examined for
                    themselves, and made drawings from nature, if not with the elegant accuracy of
                    modern days, at least with a recognisable exactness. Yet, true to the genius of
                    their time, they continued to attach much more importance to the ascertainment
                    of the names which the species bore in the classical pages of antiquity, than to
                    the composition of their history, as it were afresh, by the light of nature and
                    their own knowledge. Nevertheless they rectified as well as extended the
                    observations of Aristotle, and laid a positive base or new foundation of the
                    subject, by figures and descriptions of a certain number of well-determined
                    species. About the close of the seventeenth century, Willughby, and his
                    illustrious friend John Ray, gave for die first time a history of fishes, in
                    which the species were not only clearly described from nature, but distributed
                    in accordance with characters drawn solely from their structure, and in which we
                    are no longer unnecessarily burdened with inapplicable passages from either
                    Greek or Roman writers. Finally, about the middle of the eighteenth century,
                    Artedi and Linnaeus completed what the others had commenced, by establishing
                    well-defined generic groups, consisting of ascertained species precisely
                    characterised. From that period it may be said that no radical defect existed,
                    nor any obstacle in the way of a gradual perfecting of the system, which could
                    not be overcome by zeal, accuracy, and perseverance. Nevertheless it is to the
                    genius of Baron Cuvier that we owe the gigantic stride which has been made in
                    our own more immediate days. Prior to 1815, the methods of almost all the modern
                    systematic writers were little else than modifications, variously disguised, of
                    the Linnaean system,—that is, with alterations, generally for the worse, of the
                    nomenclature of the illustrious Swede. They darkened knowledge by a multiplicity
                    of vain words ;—and when any principle of classification was brought forward,—if
                    new, then it was untrue to nature,—if true to that beautiful abstraction, then
                    it was already familiar as household words. But forty years assiduously devoted
                    to Ichthyology,—that is, to a deep study of all preceding authors, to a constant
                    ascertainment of whatever could be gathered of the habits of fishes, and to the
                    formation of an unrivalled museum of comparative anatomy, where both their
                    outward and internal forms were perfectly displayed,—convinced the great French
                    naturalist that many heterogeneous groups still formed portions of our
                    ichthyological system, and that a salutary reformation might consequently be
                    effected in numerous minor details.</p>
                <p>It was obvious, from an attentive consideration of the subject, that the
                    differences of both external and interior organs, by which fishes might be
                    distinctly characterised, were not less numerous than decided; and⅛ that in
                    truth there were few classes of created beings among which it was more easy to
                    recognise the existence of natural groups. But with a view to dispose of the
                    genera and families in a becoming order, it was necessary to seize upon a small
                    number of important characters, from which might result certain great divisions,
                    not likely to break up natural relations, and yet sufficiently precise and
                    perceptible to leave no doubt as to the place of each species. This was a
                    principal desideratum, and one which the industry and perseverance, not less
                    than the genius and high attainments, of Cuvier, have gone so far to
                    satisfy.</p>
                <p>The numerous characters held in common by the chondropterygian or cartilaginous
                    fishes were too remarkable to have escaped detection by those who loved and
                    sought for the light of system. Thus all Ichthyologists have agreed in the
                    formation for these fishes of a separate order; but the Baron has observed, that
                    almost all have likewise injured the justness of their ordinal division, by a
                    combination of certain species which resembled the true cartilaginous kinds
                    merely in the softness of their skeleton. Thus the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lophius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclopterus,</hi> except in that softness,
                    do not differ in any respect from the ordinary osseous fishes, and therefore
                    ought not to be withdrawn from them. But there are others which, in addition to
                    the softness of their bones, present peculiar characters in their tegumentary
                    system, in their teeth, and especially in the disposition of the skeleton of the
                    head, which render their immediate union with either of the great groups of
                    osseous or cartilaginous fishes a matter of greater doubt and difficulty. Such,
                    for example, are the genera <hi rend="italic">Tetrodon, Diodon, Ostracion,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Balistes.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Syngnathi,</hi> or
                    pipe-fish, likewise present, in their peculiar branchiae, distinctive characters
                    of great importance. The remarkable external aspect of these different genera
                    had long induced the majority of naturalists to separate them from the others;
                    but it so' happened also that the same majority were by no means fortunate in
                    discovering the true characters of separation. Thus Artedi not only re-united
                    them to the <hi rend="italic">Eophii</hi> and lump-fish, in the order of
                    branchiostegous fishes, but he established that entire order on a false
                    supposition—to wit, that they possessed no rays in their branchial membrane <hi

                    their being possessed at once of lungs and gills. Gmelin re-established the two
                    orders of Artedi, but still attributing to the Branchiostegi the absence of
                    rays. Gouan characterised them merely by the incompleteness of their
                    branchiae,—a vague expression, and indeed contestable in almost all the genera.
                    Pennant combined them with the Chondropterygii, under the common name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cartilaginous,</hi> a term adopted by Μ. Lacépède; but which
                    Cuvier has shown, in relation to the actual contents of the group, to be
                    improper. The great French anatomist has observed that the appellation is by no
                    means applicable, either in a positive or a negative sense. It cannot in any way
                    be maintained that the skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">Balistes</hi> is
                    cartilaginous; and among the number of species which Pennant and his followers
                    leave among the osseous fishes, there are several, for example, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptocephali,</hi> in which we can scarcely perceive the vestige
                    of a skeleton.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Baron Cuvier’s great object thus became, to disentangle, as it were, those
                    anomalous groups, or at least to separate all such as seemed to differ
                    sufficiently from the type of ordinary fishes to authorize such separation. His
                    next object was the discovery of precise characters, capable of being clearly
                    expressed in words. This examination soon convinced him that such genera as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lophius, Cyclopterus, Centriscus, Mormyrus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrorhynchus,</hi> had been erroneously withdrawn from the great
                    group of ordinary <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939791"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9791-0153"/>fishes, from which in fact they essentially
                    differed in nothing. But he satisfied himself that the singular genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Syngnathus,</hi> of which the form and economy are so remarkable,
                    were distinctively characterised by their branchiae, in the form of tufts (hence
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">lophobranchial</hi> fishes), concealed beneath an
                    opercle which permits the water to escape only by a small opening towards the
                    nape of the neck; and that the genera <hi rend="italic">Diodon, Tetrodon,
                    Ostracion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Balistes,</hi> independently of the
                    singularity of their general form, and the incompleteness of their skeleton,
                    have the jaws, and in general all the bones of the head, somewhat differently
                    arranged from the corresponding parts in the generality of fishes, the upper jaw
                    and the palatine bones being articulated with each other, and with the vomer, by
                    immoveable sutures—a structure which leaves them much less freedom in the
                    opening of their mouths, and is also the cause (in connection with the tightness
                    of the tegumentary envelope which lastens down the branchial apparatus) of so
                    many naturalists having failed to perceive that the genera in question were
                    furnished with rays and opercula like other species.</p>
                <p>But these groups once separated, there remained nine tenths of the whole class of
                    fishes, among which the first great distinctive division which presents itself
                    is, into such as have soft fins, or of which the rays are branched and
                    articulated, and into such as have spiny fins, of which a portion of the rays
                    consist of pointed bones without branches or articulation,—two primary
                    divisions, corresponding to the great groups named respectively <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygn</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Acanthopterygii</hi> by Artedi. Even this principle of classification is not
                    universally prevalent; for, in its practical application, we are obliged to keep
                    out of view the first rays of the dorsal and pectoral fins in certain species of
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Silurus,</hi>
                    in which these rays exhibit strong and solid spines, although we still class
                    them with the Malacopterygii, or soft-finned division.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These spines, however, as Cuvier remarks, are
                    formed, in the two genera above named, by the agglutination of a multitude of
                    smaller parts, of which the articulations, though not obvious, are
                    perceptible.</p></note> In like manner, there are, among the other great
                    division, corresponding exceptions to the acanthopterygian character, as in the
                    blennies and certain Labridae, of which the spines are so small, so feeble, or
                    so few in number, as almost to escape detection. However, if the principle
                    referred to is not quite precise in relation to these slight anomalies, it is on
                    the whole well founded, and certainly does not force us to separate numerous
                    species which nature has approximated.</p>
                <p>The same cannot be asserted of those distinctions which naturalists have sought
                    to establish on other principles, nor of those on which so many of the secondary
                    divisions have been founded. Thus the general form of the body, and the absence
                    of the ventral fins, the characters assumed by Ray, anterior to those deduced
                    from the spines, force a heterogeneous grouping of the eels, the gobies, the
                    Syngnathi, the Xiphias, and the moon-fish. Linnaeus was the first (in the tenth
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae),</hi>
                    while neglecting the distinction of the spiny rays, to imagine the division of
                    ordinary fishes into <hi rend="italic">apodal, jugular, thoracic,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">abdominal,</hi> according to the absence or position of the
                    ventral fins; and in so doing obliged himself to place the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Xiphias,</hi><hi rend="italic">Trichiurus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Stromateus</hi> with the eels and <hi rend="italic">Gymnoti,</hi>

                    exhibited in the various works ofGouan, Lacépède, Dumeril, Risso, Rafinesque,

                <p>FISHES.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>V e may here
                    premise, that in the ensuing sections several interesting and important
                    particulars in the structure and physiology of fishes are very slightly, or even
                    not at all, touched upon, in consequence of their having been already detailed
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Comparative Anatomv</hi> of this work. (See
                    vol. iii. p. 1, &amp;c.) We deemed it more advisable that the reader should be
                    made to incur the slight inconvenience of referring occasionally to a separate
                    treatise, than that the present publication should be burdened by a repetition
                    of the same subject.</p></note></p>
                <p>The form and structure of fishes are as admirably adapted for rapid movement
                    through the water, as are those of birds for that aerial motion called flight.
                    Suspended in a liquid element of almost equal specific gravity with themselves.
                    external organs resembling those of birds in size would have been
                    disproportioned and unnecessary; but the air-bladder (the functions of which, by
                    no means entirely understood, have never been satisfactorily explained in all
                    their bearings) is known to possess the power of contraction and dilatation, the
                    exercise of which is followed by a corresponding descent or ascent of the
                    animal’s body. Thus a small, central, and inconspicuous organ effects, in the
                    easiest and most simple manner, the same object which even the soaring eagle or
                    giant condor can only attain by great exertion of the wings, and after laborious
                    and frequently repeated gyrations. We shall ere long, however, have occasion to
                    observe, that the air-bladder, although essential to the economy of such species
                    as possess it, is by no means indispensable to the class of fishes, as in many
                    tribes it is entirely wanting.</p>
                <p>Fishes being without a neck, and the part called the tail for the most part
                    equalling at its origin the portion of the trunk from which it springs, the
                    prevailing shape is somewhat uniform, diminishing gradually towards either end.
                    Doubtless, however, a vast variety of form is exhibited in a class which is now
                    calculated to contain from six to eight thousand collected species. Of these
                    forms a sufficiently accurate idea may be acquired by inspecting the numerous
                    plates which accompany the present treatise, and we shall therefore not attempt
                    any further verbal illustration of the subject, although we shall add a few
                    notices regarding the general aspect and character of the principal external
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The mouth of fishes either opens from beneath, as in the rays, or at the
                    extremity of the muzzle, as in the majority of the class, or from the upper
                    surface, as in <hi rend="italic">Uranoscopus.</hi> It also varies greatly in its
                    relative dimensions, from the minute perforation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centriscus,</hi> to the vast expansion of the angler fish.</p>
                <p>Exteriorly only two of the organs of the senses are visible, the orifices of the
                    nostrils and the eyes. The former may be simple, as in the rays and sharks, or
                    double, as in the generality of osseous fishes; and they differ in their
                    position in relation to the jaws, the eyes, or the extremity of the muzzle. The
                    eyes vary extremely in respect to size in the different species, and even
                    sometimes disappear entirely beneath the skin; and they also differ greatly in
                    their position, being usually placed laterally, one on each side of the head,
                    although in <hi rend="italic">Uranoscopus</hi> (as the name implies) they look
                    upwards, and in most of the flat fishes they both occupy the same side.</p>
                <p>In regard to those important organs, the branchiae or gills, a single family
                    alone, the chondropterygian fishes, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939804"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9804-0154"/>are characterised by having their exterior margin
                    fixed to the skin, with as many openings for the issue of the water as there are
                    intervals between the branchiae themselves; but all other fishes have the
                    external margin of the branchiae free, and the water which enters the mouth
                    escapes by the opening of the gill-covers.</p>
                <p>A certain number of the fins are vertical, and serve the fish somewhat in the
                    same way as a vessel is served by her helm and keel. Of these, some, called <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> arc attached to the back, others, beneath the tail,
                    are named <hi rend="italic">anal,</hi> while a fine expansion, which usually
                    terminates the body, is known as the <hi rend="italic">caudal</hi> fin. All
                    these are <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> fins, and vary in different tribes,
                    either in number, or dimensions, or the nature of the rays by which they are
                    supported, and which are sometimes spiny, sometimes branched and composed of
                    numerous articulations. The other fins are disposed in pairs, and represent the
                    four external members of the higher classes, such as quadrupeds and birds. Those
                    which correspond to the fore-legs of quadrupeds and the wings of birds are named
                    the <hi rend="italic">pectoral</hi> fins, and are always attached behind the
                    gills; those again which are regarded as the analogues of the hinder extremities
                    of the other classes are named the <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi> fins, and have
                    a considerable range of position in different species, from as far forward as
                    beneath the throat, to the origin of the tail. Like the vertical fins, they also
                    vary in size, and in the number and structure of their rays; and one or even
                    both pairs are occasionally wanting, as in eels, which have no ventral fins, and
                    Murenae, which have neither ventral nor pectoral fins. Indeed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apterichti</hi> have no fins at all.</p>
                <p>Those fishes arc named <hi rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygian,</hi> of which all
                    the rays of the fins are articulated, and of a softer structure; while such as
                    are characterised by having at least a portion of their rays hard, simple, and
                    in the form of spines, are included under the general title of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acanthoptery-gian</hi> fishes.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be here noted, however, that certain
                    malacopterygian kinds, such as carps and siluri, have the articulations of some
                    of the rays soldered together, in such a manner as to appear simply
                    spinous.</p></note> These great divisions apply solely to the osseous species.
                    We have already mentioned that the cartilaginous kinds are distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Chondroptery giax,</hi> while two lesser groups, in
                    some respects intermediate between these and the preceding, fall under the
                    orders <hi rend="smallcaps">Lophobranchii</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Plectognathi</hi> of Baron Cuvier.</p>
                <p>The differences hitherto alluded to are connected with intimate structure—with
                    the skeleton or bony frame-work of the fisht There are of course others of a
                    slighter or more superficial character. The jaws may be armed with teeth of all
                    sorts, and these weapons sometimes occupy all parts of the mouth, and are found
                    occasionally even in the throat. The lips are frequently furnished with a kind
                    of fleshy beard or barbies, which differ greatly in number, size, and substance.
                    Some have long fleshy isolated filaments hanging to the body, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Scorpaena;</hi> and occasionally one or more of the rays is to
                    a*certain extent detachable from the fin, and susceptible of independent
                    movement.</p>
                <p>The nature of the surface or external tegument of fishes also varies greatly.
                    Some may be called naked, while others are scaly, spinous, or plated, in whole
                    or in part. If to these considerations we add the infinitely varied character of
                    colour in all its admirable distributions, and the differences in size and
                    weight observable in fishes, we shall be able to form a general idea of the
                    external aspect of this great and important class.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">sect.</hi> III. THE OSTEOLOGY OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>In regard to the texture of the bones of fishes, their skeletons are either <hi
                    rend="italic">bony, fibro-cartilaginous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">truly
                    car</hi><hi rend="italic">tilaginous.</hi> Those distinguished by the last-named
                    charac∙ ter are the chondropterygian groups, such as the sturgeons, sharks, and
                    rays, all of which exhibit throughout the whole of their frame-work, in their
                    branchiae (the external border of which is fixed to the skin, and through which
                    the water is allowed to escape only by narrow openings), and in other important
                    parts of their organization, distinctive characters, which obviously separate
                    them from all other fishes. They are in fact destitute of true bones, their
                    harder parts consisting only of a homogeneous and semitransparent cartilage,
                    which is merely covered on the surface in certain genera by a layer of small,
                    opake, calcareous granules, closely set together. In the lampreys even this
                    envelope is wanting, while among the <hi rend="italic">Ammoccetes</hi> the
                    skeleton continues in an actually membranous condition. The sturgeons and
                    Chimerae partake in some measure of the lamprey character in relation to the
                    softness of their spines, but the first-named genus is possessed of many true
                    bones of the head and shoulder.</p>
                <p>Other fishes differ in their osteological character chiefly in the hardness of
                    their skeleton, and it is without reason that the· fibro-cartilaginous kinds
                    have been associated by some authors with the Chondropterygii. The calcareous
                    matter, that is, the phosphate of lime, is deposited in layers and fibres in the
                    cartilage which forms the basis of their bones, precisely in the same manner as
                    among the hard-boned species, but less abundantly; and the texture of the bone
                    never becomes so hard and homogeneous as among the osseous kinds. Thus in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetrodon Mola</hi> we perceive, as it were, only scattered fibres
                    amid the membranes, and in <hi rend="italic">Lophius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >piscatorius</hi> they are nearly as soft. The other Tetrodons and Diodons, the
                    Balistes and the Ostracions, have denser bones; and in some species these parts
                    can scarcely be distinguished from those of the osseous fishes. It is certain
                    also that the bony frame-work of the fibro-cartilaginous kinds is constructed on
                    the same plan as that of the truly osseous species, and not in accordance with
                    those of the Chondropterygii; and it is in opposition to the known truth of
                    nature that both Artedi and Linnaeus have denied them the possession of opercula
                    and branchiostegous rays. The <hi rend="italic">Balistes</hi> have even
                    ribs,—their only osteological difference consisting in the granulation of their
                    jaws; while the <hi rend="italic">Syngnathi</hi> have regular bony jaws,
                    although they want the ribs and branchiostegous rays.</p>
                <p>The majority of osseous fishes have bones fully harder than those of other
                    animals, and it is quite a gratuitous assumption to suppose that the observed
                    longevity of certain species arises from the softer consistence of those parts.
                    Certain fish bones, in fact, exhibit neither pores nor fibres, and appear almost
                    vitreous to the eye. But neither the osseous nor the cartilaginous kinds have
                    either epiphyses to the bones, or medullary canal within them; but there are
                    some, such as the trouts, in which the tissue of the bones is more or less
                    penetrated by an oilyjuice; while in others, such as the Dory, the internal
                    portion continues cartilaginous, while the surface is completely ossified.
                    Finally, in certain species, while the general skeleton is very hard, particular
                    portions of it are cartilaginous. Such are the bones which constitute the head
                    of the pike.</p>
                <p>When viewed in relation to their general structure, the bones of fishes, like
                    those of other vertebrated animals, are composed of an organic base penetrated
                    by earthy matter. The latter consists of phosphate of lime and of magnesia, with
                    oxide of iron, supposed to be united to phosphoric acid. There is also a certain
                    portion <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939817" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9817-0155"/>of
                    subcarbonate of lime. The animal matter is of two kinds :—the one, of an
                    azotised nature, forms the base of the cartilage; the other is fatty, in the
                    form of a pervading oil. The cartilage of fish bones differs from that of
                    mammiferae and birds, in as far as it yields no gelatine when subjected to the
                    process of boiling. The oil is composed chiefly of oleine, impregnated with an
                    odorous principle and a yellow colouring matter. The oil itself is easily
                    convertible into soap, and then produces oleic acid, glycerine, and a minute
                    portion of margaric acid.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of osseous fishes consists of the head; of the respiratory
                    apparatus, having always a large bony development; of the trunk, including body
                    and tail; and of members, that is, the pectoral and ventral fins. The vertical
                    fins, viz. those of the back, anus, and tail, may likewise be viewed as
                    belonging to the trunk.</p>
                <p>The head, possessing many more moveable parts than that of the Mammalia, is
                    subdivisible into a great many regions, such as the cranium, the maxillae, the
                    bones beneath the cranium and behind the jaws, and which aid in their movement
                    and suspension; the bones of the opercles, which open and shut the overtures of
                    the branchiae; the bones, almost exterior, which surround the nostrils, the eye,
                    and the temples, or which cover a portion of the cheek.</p>
                <p>In the majority of fishes the inter-maxillary bone forms the edge of the upper
                    jaw, and has behind it the maxillary, commonly called the mystax, or labial
                    bone. A palatine arch, composed of the palatine, of the two pterygoid processes,
                    of the jugal, tympanic, and squamous bones, constitutes, as among birds and
                    snakes, a kind of interior jaw, and provides posteriorly an articulation to the
                    lower jaw, which has usually two bones on each side. In the Chondropterygii,
                    however, these various pieces are greatly reduced in number.</p>
                <p>Besides the apparatus of the branchial arches, the hyoid bone carries on each
                    side certain rays which support the branchial membrane; a kind of lid or
                    clapper, composed of three bony pieces, the opercle, the sub-opercle, and the
                    inter-opercle, unites with that membrane to close the great opening of the
                    gills; it articulates with the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tympani,</hi> and plays on the piece called the pre-opercle. But, like the
                    parts before mentioned, this apparatus is likewise wantingin many of the
                    Chondropterygii.</p>
                <p>The trunk is composed of the vertebrae of the back and tail (for we can scarcely
                    say that there is any neck, and the sacrum is wanting); of ribs; of the
                    interspinal bones, which give support to the dorsal and anal fins; and of the
                    rays of those fins, and of the caudal. These rays, whether branched and
                    articulated, or simply spinous, may be always divided lengthways into
                    halves.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae of fishes are characterised by the conical hollow on each of their
                    faces. Double hollow cones are thus formed in the interval between two
                    vertebrae, filled by a soft membranous and gelatinous substance, which passes
                    from one void to another by means of an opening through each vertebra, and forms
                    as it were a gelatinous chaplet through the whole. They have, as in other
                    animals, an annular portion in their superior part, for the passage of the
                    spinal marrow.</p>
                <p>Fish rarely possess a sternum properly so called, and when it does exist, it is
                    formed of almost external pieces, which unite the inferior extremities of the
                    ribs.</p>
                <p>The anterior members, commonly called the pectoral fins, consist of the shoulder,
                    an osseous semicircle composed of several bones suspended above from the cranium
                    or the spine, and joined beneath to the corresponding portion of the other side.
                    We can here also distinguish certain bones analogous to the two pieces of the
                    omoplate of reptiles, to the humerus, and to the bones of the lore-arm; and
                    further back there is usually a small projection, composed of two pieces, which
                    have been supposed to represent the coracoid bone, and even the clavicle. What
                    is more assured is, that the two bones which Cuvier compares to the cubitus and
                    radius, bear on their margin a range of little bones, which seem to represent
                    those of the carpus, and which themselves support the rays of the pectoral fin,
                    excepting the first of the latter, which articulates directly with the radial
                    bone.</p>
                <p>The posterior members, much more variable in their position than the
                    corresponding limbs of the Mammalia, and of which the external and moveable
                    portions are named the ventral fins, project sometimes in advance of, sometimes
                    beneath, and sometimes behind, the anterior or pectoral members. They are
                    composed of four bones, of which the largest, which are likewise the most
                    constant, being always placed in advance of the anus and of the generative
                    system, may be regarded as a sort of pubis, and bear upon a portion of their
                    posterior margin the rays of the fin, without any smaller intermediate bones
                    which can be compared either to the femur, the tibia, the peroneum, or tarsal
                    bones. The rays of both the pectoral and ventral fins are likewise divisible
                    lengthwise into halves, like those of the vertical fins before mentioned. These
                    rays, with the exception of the external ventral one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthopterygii</hi> (which is spinous), are almost always articulated.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">Chondropterygii,</hi> such as sharks and
                    skates, is composed of pieces consisting of no fibrous tissue characteristic of
                    bone. The interior continues in a cartilaginous state, and the surface alone
                    becomes indurated by the accumulation of small calcareous granules, which
                    produce externally a <hi rend="italic">stippled</hi> aspect. The form of the
                    cranium is similar to that of other fishes, but nevertheless consists of only
                    one enclosure, without sutures. The face is very simple, with only two bones in
                    the palato-temporal arch ;—the first descending from the cranium, at the
                    articulation of the jaws,—the other representing the upper jaw, and bearing the
                    teeth. The maxillary and inter-maxillary bones are merely rudimentary. The under
                    jaw has also but one bone (the articular) on each side, bearing the teeth; of
                    the others only a single vestige is discoverable, concealed beneath the skin of
                    the lip. The opercular apparatus is wanting, but the hyoidean and branchial
                    structure is very conformable with the same parts in osseous fishes. Sharks
                    have, moreover, opposite to the external attachment of each branchia, a slender
                    bone, which may be regarded as the genuine vestige of a rib. The branchial
                    system is situate further back than in osseous fishes, and hence the humeral
                    girdle is also more posterior. The spinal ribs, if they exist, are usually very
                    small, except in the sturgeons. In that genus, indeed, the branchial system is
                    in some respects intermediate between the cartilaginous and osseous fishes.
                    Several bones of the head and shoulder are as hard as stone, yet the spine is
                    almost as soft as that of lampreys.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    suspends it on the temporal bone, and hence the opercular shutters can neither
                    open nor close without a corresponding movement of the hyoidean branches. <hi

                    CCXCVΠ. figs. 2, 4, and 5.) This bone is placed as in other vertebrated classes,
                    but is always suspended to the temporal bones. It is composed of two branches,
                    each consisting office pieces, viz. the styloid, 29, by which it is suspended to
                    the temporal; two large lateral pieces, 37 and 38, placed one behind the other,
                    and forming tlie principal portion of the branch (the posterior, 38, being that
                    which attaches to the inter-operculum); lastly, two small pieces, 39 and 40,
                    placed one above the other at the anterior extremity of the branch, and serving
                    to unite it with the corresponding portion of the other side. Anterior to this
                    junction is the lingual bone, 41, and behind it, in the angle formed by the
                    meeting of the two branches, and beneath the branchiae, is a single piece,
                    usually vertical, 42 (fig. 5), which represents the tail of the. hyoid bone, so
                    well known in birds and lizards. It is this piece which, uniting with the syin.
                    physes of the humerais, forms what is called the <hi rend="italic">isthmus,</hi>
                    which separates the two branchial openings from below. Thus in its totality the
                    hyoid bone of fishes is composed of twelve bones.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic"
                    >rays,</hi> 43, which support the branchiostegous membrane, adhere by moveable

                    portions already mentioned (37, 38) of the hyoid bone. They vary in form and
                    number, some species having three, others thirty. The perch, which forms the
                    subject of our illustration, has seven branchial rays; and that number is the
                    most common among the acanthopterygian fishes.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bones
                    which support the</hi><hi rend="italic">branchiae.</hi> As fishes cannot respire
                    except by making the water which they have taken into the mouth flow out by the
                    openings behind the lateral part of the head, it thus passes between the
                    branchiae, those well-known comb-like organs, usually four in number on each
                    side, composed of a great quantity of thin, narrow, forked laminae, of a
                    membranous or cartilaginous nature, and placed in files. These four pair of
                    branchiae are supported by four pair of arches, adhering by their inferior
                    extremities to the two sides of a chain of small intermediate bones, which is
                    itself attached to the angle formed by the anterior portions of the hyoid bone,
                    and above the <hi rend="italic">tail</hi> of the latter. These arches ascend in
                    a curve, and are attached at their other extremity beneath the cranium, but by
                    means only of cellulosity, or of ligaments. The intermediate chain of bones just
                    alluded to forms, in a certain sense, a continuation of the lingual bone. There
                    are usually three: the first, 53 (see chiefly fig. 4), is attached at the base
                    of the angle formed by the two branches of the hyoid bone; the second, 54,
                    affords attachment to the first pair of arches; and the third, 55, affords the
                    like attachment to the second pair, while the third pair adheres to its
                    extremity; the fourth pair of arches is connected with the angle of the third
                    pair. Each arch is composed of two parts, moveable on each other, and the
                    interior portion of the first three pair itself consists of two pieces, 57 and
                    58; in the last pair there is only a single piece, 60. The upper portion of the
                    arches, 61, is simple, except in the first pair, which is usually suspended from
                    the cranium by a small stylus, 59. The inner face of these arches is furnished
                    with small plates or cones of osseous lamina, usually armed with teeth variously
                    disposed according to the species. The most general uses of this armature are to
                    arrest the progress of such substances as the fish is swallowing,—to prevent
                    their escaping with the respired water, or their producing inconvenience amid
                    the interstices of the branchiae. It may be likened in its functions to the
                    epiglottis of quadrupeds, or the dentations of the margins of the larynx*of
                    birds. Besides the interior range of conical plates, the perch possesses an
                    external row of slender pointed teeth, resembling those of a garden rake, upon
                    its first pair of arches, see 63.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Pharyngeal bones.</hi>
                    At the entrance to the oesophagus, and immediately below the branchial
                    apparatus, are placed the pharyngeal bones, which produce a second mastication,
                    often more powerful than the first; for this purpose they are armed with teeth
                    of very variable form and number, according to the species. These bones are
                    usually two inferior, 56, and six superior, 62.</p><p><hi rend="italic"

                    understood by an inspection of Plate CCXCVII. fig. 1, Nos. 67, 68, 69, with the

                    rend="italic">Vertical fins.</hi> These are supported by rays composed of an
                    internal portion, named the interspinal, 74, which serves as a sustaining root,
                    by penetrating the flesh among the great lateral muscles, and an external
                    portion, which exhibits the rays <hi rend="italic">properly so called,</hi> as
                    seen at 75. We sometimes find an interspinal bone which bears no rays, 76. A
                    certain number of these vertical rays are pointed bones, and are then named
                    spines, or spiny rays; others are bony or solid only towards their base, their
                    remainder being formed of a multitude of small articulations, and frequently
                    ramified into lesser branches, themselves still further divided; in these states
                    they are named articulated, soft, or branched rays. Those of the tail, 7B are
                    always soft and articulated; although, towards the root, both above and below,
                    78, they gradually diminish till only the solid portion of the base remains. In
                    a great number of fishes the vertebra at which the abdomen terminates and the
                    caudal part begins, and even that which follows it, 83, 83, have a great
                    inferior spinous process, to which is joined a more or less voluminous bone, 79,
                    extending behind the anus, and thus forming the posterior boundary of the
                    abdominal cavity.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> does not exist in all
                    fishes. When present, it consists of a series of single bones of various
                    configuration, according to the genera, and at these the ribs
                    terminate.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bones of the shoulder and arm.</hi> In
                    osseous fishes, we find on each side, immediately behind the orifice of the
                    gills, a suite of bones, forming a kind of frame, on which the opercle rests
                    when closed. These bones, usually attached to the head from above, and uniting
                    together below, form an osseous belt, surrounding that part of the body. Their
                    inferior symphysis unites by ligaments to the tail of the hyoid bone (formerly
                    mentioned, 42), and forms with it the <hi rend="italic">isthmus,</hi> which
                    separates the external openings of the gills from each other beneath, just as
                    the cranium separates them above. This cincture, when complete, is composed on
                    each side of three bones, which represent the shoulder and the arm, to which
                    adheres, posteriorly, a group of two or three others, occupying the place of the
                    fore arm, and bearing the pectoral fin, which may be considered as the hand;
                    lastly, there is almost always suspended a style, composed of one or two bones,
                    which Cuvier regards as the analogue of the coracoidian bone. The highest of
                    these first three bones, 46, is usually forked, and attached by its two crests
                    to the lateral crests of the cranium. It is visible externally at the top of the
                    branchial opening, resembling a scale, larger than the others, and is sometimes
                    toothed on its edges. The second, 47, continues along the margin of the
                    branchial opening. The third, 48, always the largest, completes the cincture, by
                    uniting with its counterpart beneath the throat. To the inner surface of the
                    last-mentioned bone adheres a fourth, 51, and fifth, 52, placed one above the
                    other. The free side of these bones bears the pectoral fin, but by means of an
                    intermediate range of four or five small bones, 53. These bonelets may be
                    supposed to represent the carpal series; and if so, then the two others, 51 and
                    52. will be the cubitus and radius. The third <pb corresp="kp-eb0712-9843-0157"
                    xml:id="pbn7157"/>bone of the cincture, which supports the two last named, will
                    then necessarily represent the humerus, and the first and second (46—7) the
                    shoulder blade. There still remains to be mentioned a species of style, almost
                    always composed of two pieces, 49 and 50.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Carpal

                    flat bones, 53, compared to the carpus. Their function is to support the rays of
                    the pectoral fin, 53, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> however numerous these may be,
                    with the exception of the first, which articulates directly with the radius or

                    by processes and projecting plates. Its posterior side affords attachment to the
                    rays of the ventral fins. In eels and others, in which the ventral fins are
                    wanting, the bone is also absent.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The rays of the

                    their bases become solid, and there the articulation is scarcely if at all

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The spinal column, composed of numerous articulations united by cartilages which
                    permit of certain movements, curves with great facility from side to side; but
                    the vertical motion is much more restricted, chiefly in consequence of the
                    projection of the upper and under spiny processes of the vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The great organ of movement in all fishes is the tail. The muscles by which it is
                    brought into play extend in lengthened masses on either side of the vertebral
                    column. The body being supported chiefly by the swimming bladder (which,
                    however, is absent in several species), is propelled<pb corresp="pbn7157"
                    facs="nls:192939843" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9843-0157"/> forwards by the rapid
                    flexure of the extremity acting laterally upon the resistance offered by the
                    water. Generally speaking, neither the pectoral nor the ventral fins are of any
                    material use during swift progressive motion; they rather serve to balance the
                    body, or to aid its gentler movements while in a state of comparative repose. In
                    <hi rend="italic">flying fishes,</hi> as they are called, the pectoral fins are
                    of such great length and expansion as to support the animal in the air; and the
                    strength of muscular action might probably suffice even for a longer flight, but
                    for the necessity of constant moisture for the purposes of respiration. The
                    drying of the gills in an individual of this class is·attended by results
                    analogous to those produced by submersion in the case of a land animal ;—and a
                    flying fish is obliged to descend to respire, in like manner as a swimming
                    quadruped, or disguised mammiferous animal (as we may term a whale), is under
                    the necessity of ascending for the same purpose.</p>
                <p>The head of fishes exercises but a slight movement independent of the rest of the
                    body; but the jaws, hyoid bone, palato-temporal and branchial arches, and
                    pharyn-gial and opercular bones, are very free in their motions. The muscles of
                    fishes, like those of other vertebrated animals, are composed of fleshy fibres
                    more or less coloured, and of tendinous fibres of a white or silvery colour.
                    With the exception, however, of certain special muscles which are sometimes of a
                    deep red, the flesh of fishes is much paler than that of quadrupeds, and still
                    more so than that of birds. In some species it is even entirely white.</p>
                <p>SECT. V THE NERVOÜS SYSTEM AND SENSES OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>The sensitive system of fishes, like that of the higher classes, is composed of
                    the external senses, of a central medullary apparatus, and of nerves of
                    communication. As in the classes alluded to, the central portion of the nervous
                    system, that is, the brain and spinal marrow, occupies the cavity of the cranium
                    and vertebral column.</p>
                <p>As fishes respire through the intervention of water alone, that is, as they can
                    scarcely avail themselves, in rendering their blood <hi rend="italic"
                    >arterial,</hi> of any thing more than the small portion of oxygen contained in
                    the air which is suspended in the water, their blood is necessarily cold, and
                    their general energy, and the activity of their senses and movements, are less
                    than among Mammalia and birds. Their brain also, though of similar composition,
                    is proportionally much smaller; and the external organs of the senses do not
                    seem of such a nature as to be capable of impressing or conveying towards it any
                    vivid excitement. Indeed the most striking characteristic of the brain of fishes
                    is its extreme smallness, when compared either with the total size of the body,
                    with the mass of nerves which proceed from it, or with the cavity of the cranium
                    in which it is contained. In the burbot, or <hi rend="italic">Gadus lota,</hi>
                    the weight of the brain to that of the spinal marrow is estimated by Carus to be
                    as 8 to 12, and to that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the whole body as 1 to 720. It
                    was previously known that the brain of the pike weighed in proportion to that of
                    the whole body as 1 to 1305. Now, in many small birds, the brain, viewed in
                    relation to the rest of the body, is equal to a twentieth part. In the
                    generality of fishes, the spinal marrow extends along the whole of the caudal
                    vertebrae; and it is thus that it preponderates over the brain. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lophius</hi><hi rend="italic">piscatorius,</hi> however, and a few
                    other species, form remarkable exceptions to this rule, as in them the spinal
                    marrow disappears before it reaches the eighth vertebra; but in the greater
                    proportion of cases it may be said that the spinal cord in this class terminates
                    by a single thread in the last caudal vertebra.<note anchored="true"

                    cachée par les nerfs, qui naissent beaucoup plus haut qu’ils ne sortent.” It is
                    certain, however, from Cuvier s recent statement, that the supposed character is

                    the cranium; and the interval between the pia-mater which envelopes the brain
                    itself, and the dura-mater, which lines the interior of the skull, is occupied
                    only by a loose cellulosity, frequently impregnated by an oil, or sometimes, as
                    in the sturgeon and thunny, by a rather compact grease. It has also been
                    remarked, that this void between the cranium and the brain is much less in young
                    subjects than in adults; from which it may be inferred, that the brain does not
                    increase in an equal proportion with the rest of the body. Cuvier, in fact, has
                    found its dimensions nearly the same in different individuals, of which the
                    general size of the one was double that of the other.</p>
                <p>When compared with that of quadrupeds, the brain of fishes has been said to
                    possess an embryonic character, and to have its greatest development in the
                    cerebellum, the seat of the appetites. Of all vertebrated animals, fish in fact
                    exhibit the smallest apparent signs of sensibility. Having no elastic air to act
                    upon, they are necessarily mute, or nearly so; and all the sensations which the
                    delightful faculty of voice has called into being among the higher tribes, are
                    to them unknown. Their glazed immoveable eyes, their fixed and bony faces, their
                    bodies and members moving altogether, if they move at all, admit of little play
                    in their physiognomy, and of scarcely any expression to their emotions. Their
                    ears, surrounded en every side by the bones of the cranium, destitute of
                    external conch, without any internal cochlea, and composed merely of some sacks
                    and membranous canals, scarcely suffice for the perception of the loudest
                    sounds. Even their sight may be supposed to find but little exercise in those
                    profound depths where so many of the inhabitants of ocean dwell, although the
                    largeness of the visual organs in many species probably in some measure makes
                    amends for this deficiency of light. But even in those species the eye cannot
                    change its direction; still less can it alter its focus, so as to accommodate
                    the vision to a varying distance; for the iris neither dilates nor contracts,
                    and the pupil remains for ever the same in all degrees of light. No tear
                    moistens its glazed surface, no eyelid clears or protects it, and it <pb

                    offers but <hi rend="italic">a</hi> dull and feeble representative of that
                    beautiful and most expressive organ, so full of life and animation in the higher
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>The position, direction, and dimensions of the eyes of fishes vary greatly. In
                    some they have an upward aspect, and are often very close upon each other; in
                    others they are lateral, and so wide apart as to be even directed slightly
                    downwards. But of all anomalies, one of the most extraordinary which their
                    position presents, is that of the <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectes</hi> (such as
                    turbot, flounders, soles, &amp;c.), in which the two eyes are placed, as it
                    were, the one above the other, and both upon the same side of the head. In
                    certain species of the eels and <hi rend="italic">Siluri,</hi> they are so small
                    as to be scarcely visible; while in other groups, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pria-</hi><hi rend="italic">canthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">'Pomatomus,</hi>
                    they surpass in proportional diameter whatever is known of the same organs in
                    the higher classes. It may be said in general that the eye of fishes is large,
                    and that its pupil especially is broad and open; a character probably connected
                    with the necessity of collecting whatever devious rays of light may penetrate
                    the obscure depth of waters. Fishes have no true eyelids. The skin always passes
                    over the eye, to which it is slightly adherent; and it is for the most part
                    sufficiently transparent for the passage of the solar rays. In some species,
                    such as eels, it passes over without the slightest fold or duplication; while in
                    a few, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Gastrobranchus coecus</hi> of Bloch,
                    it continues quite opake, so as entirely to conceaľ the eye. In others, as the
                    well-known mackerel and herring, it forms an adipose fold both before and
                    behind; but these folds are fixed, and being unprovided with muscles, have no
                    mobility. Sharks have one, somewhat more moveable, on the inferior margin of the
                    orbit. The globe of the eye itself is very slightly moveable, although, like
                    that of man, it is furnished with six muscles. Perhaps the most singular eye
                    presented by the class of fishes is that of <hi rend="italic">Anableps,</hi>
                    which has two corneae, separated by an opake line, and two pupils pierced in the
                    same iris, so that one might deem it double; but there is only one retina, and a
                    single vitreous and crystalline humour. In accordance with the general structure
                    of the eyes of fishes (which we shall not further detaiD, the nearly spherical
                    form of the crystalline humour, the immobility of the pupil, and the difficulty
                    with which it changes the length of its axis, we can scarcely doubt that the
                    vision of this class is comparatively imperfect. Images must be but feebly
                    painted in their retina, and their visual perceptions must be indistinct and
                    dull. At the same time it is evident that they perceive their prey from a
                    considerable distance; and the angler, who knows either how rapidly they seize
                    or how cautiously they avoid his lure, and with what discrimination they
                    sometimes prefer one colour or kind of artificial fly to another, must be
                    impressed with the belief that the power of vision, at least of certain species,
                    is by no means devoid of clearness and precision.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">organ of hearing</hi> in fishes consists of little more
                    than the labyrinth, and that a much less complicated one than the corresponding
                    part in either quadrupeds or birds. They have no external ear, unless we may
                    bestow that name on a small cavity, sometimes slightly spiral, which we find in
                    the rays. It is however always covered by the skin, and is not perceptible among
                    the osseous fishes. A few of the latter, such as the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoleprus,</hi> and certain <hi rend="italic">Mormyri,</hi> have merely
                    openings in the cranium closed by the skin, by means of which the vibrations of
                    the element by which they are surrounded may be conducted to the labyrinth. In
                    some other species, as <hi rend="italic">Myripristis,</hi> the cranium is open
                    beneath, and its orifice is closed by a membranous partition, to which the
                    swimming bladder adheres; but these communications are very different from that
                    which takes place by means of the tympanum, and still more by means of the
                    Eustachian tube in other classes.</p>
                <p>Both these parts, as well as the bones, are in fact wanting in the class of
                    fishes. Those who find in the bones of the operculum the four bones of the ear
                    of man suddenly and prodigiously developed, hazard such a notion merely on the
                    assumption that the bony pieces are the same in number in all crania; but it
                    must be borne in mind, that neither the form, nor the relations, nor the
                    functions of these bones, nor their nerves nor muscles, support such a
                    comparison. The ear of fishes, then, is much less complete than that of
                    quadrupeds, birds, or even of the majority of reptiles. There is no doubt that
                    they possess the sense of hearing; but it is merely a general sense of sound,
                    and is in all probability incompetent to perceive any variety or range of
                    intonation. In truth, the simple fact of fishes being as a class entirely mute,
                    is of itself a logical ground for believing that their pereeption of sound is
                    extremely dull.</p>
                <p>. A few lines may now be devoted to the consideration of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sense of smell.</hi> The nostrils of fishes are not so placed as to be
                    traversed either by air or water, in connection with the act of respiration.
                    They consist merely of two openings, situate near the extremity of the muzzle,
                    and lined by the pituitary membrane, which is raised in extremely regular folds.
                    In the ordinary fishes, the bones which Cuvier regards as the nasal serve as the
                    arch or covering; while the vomer, the maxillary, and inter-maxillary contribute
                    to sustain the sides, the first sub-orbitary forming the inferior portion. The
                    shape of the nostrils is sometimes oblong, sometimes round or oval. They are
                    placed either at the end of the muzzle or on its sides; sometimes on its
                    superior face, and even occasionally, as in skates and sharks, on its under
                    surface near the angle of the mouth. In the lamprey they are approximate on the
                    top of the head, and open by one common orifice. In the great majority of
                    fishes, perhaps in all the osseous kinds, each nostril opens by two orifices,
                    the one posterior to the other, and in some cases at a considerable distance.
                    These are what are called double nostrils; an inaccurate term, in as far as each
                    pair of holes leads only to a single cavity. The margins of the anterior orifice
                    are often tubular, as in the eel, and sometimes a single side of the tubular
                    margin is prolonged into a tentacular appendage, as in several Siluri. In the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Lophius</hi> the nostrils are borne upon a little
                    pedicle, so as somewhat to resemble mushrooms. Various other modifications are
                    observable in different genera, although not necessary to be here narrated. It
                    does not appear, at least in the osseous fishes, that the envelope of the
                    nostrils possesses mobility, or that the orifices are furnished with muscles by
                    means of which they can be opened and shut.</p>
                <p>It is certain, however, that fishes possess the faculty of perceiving odours;
                    that various scents attract or repel them; and there is no reason to doubt that
                    the seat of that perception lies in the nostrils. It maybe reasonably
                    conjectured that its strength depends mainly on the degree of development
                    produced by the number and extent of the interior folds.</p>
                <p>In regard to the <hi rend="italic">sense of taste</hi> in fishes, it is evident
                    that as, with few exceptions, they swallow their food rapidly and without
                    mastication, their perception of that faculty must be in noways acute. The same
                    may be inferred from the fact of their tongue being almost immoveable, often
                    entirely osseous, or beset with teeth or dental plates, and from its receiving
                    very slender nerves, and these but few in number. Even those species of which
                    the jaws are so armed as to enable them to cut and bruize their aliments, cannot
                    long retain the latter in their mouths, on account of the position and the play
                    of the respiratory organs. No salivary glands discharge their moisture on the
                    organs of taste. The tongue itself is not seldom entirely wanting; and even when
                    it exists in its most distinct and apparently fleshy state, it consists merely
                    of a ligament <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939869" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9869-0159"
                    />ous or cellular substance, applied on front of the lingual bone. It is never
                    furnished with muscles capable of producing any movement of extension or
                    retraction, as in quadrupeds.</p>
                <p>Fishes cannot be said to be more highly favoured in respect to the <hi
                    rend="italic">organs of touch</hi> than those of taste. The faculty is greatly
                    deadened over the general surface by the coating of scales, and in the
                    particular members by the inflexibility of the rays. It is chiefly confined to
                    the lips, and even these parts in many species are themselves as hard and
                    insensible as bone. Certain soft and delicate appendages called <hi
                    rend="italic">barbies,</hi> possessed by many species, such as the cod and
                    loach, are supposed to enjoy a more delicate perception of the sense of touch.
                    It is by means of the <hi rend="italic">dermis</hi> that that peculiar matter,
                    so remarkable for its silvery metallic lustre, and which bestows so much of
                    brilliancy upon the class, is secreted beneath the scales. It is composed of
                    small polished plates resembling burnished silver, and capable of being removed
                    by washing, either from the skin itself, or from the inferior surface of the
                    scales. It is this substance that is used in the formation of false pearls. It
                    is also secreted by many species in the thickness of the peritoneum, and in the
                    envelopes supplied by that part to particular viscera, especially the swimming
                    bladder. The scales of the majority of fishes are <hi rend="italic"
                    >imbricated,</hi> that is, placed partially over each other, like the tiles or
                    slates of the roof of a house. They are not equally distributed, nor of the same
                    form or consistence, over the general surface of the body. The head is
                    frequently destitute of scales, and those of the lateral line of the body are
                    distinguished from the others by one or more small tubes by which they are
                    perforated, and by other peculiarities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat. des Poissons,</hi> t. i.
                    chap. vi.</p></note></p>
                <p>It thus appears that the external senses of fishes convey to them few lively or
                    distinct impressions; and by whatever scenes in nature they arc surrounded,
                    their perceptions are probably indistinct and dull. Their sexual emotions, cold
                    as their blood, indicate only individual wants. Few species pair, or enjoy any
                    connubial gratification, for the males seek the eggs rather than the females
                    which deposit them, and neither sex ever recognises its offspring. At least the
                    exceptions to these generalities are extremely few, and the prevailing economy
                    of fishes may be said in all these respects to be exactly the reverse of that of
                    birds. These gay creatures of the sky have the power of surveying distinctly at
                    a glance an immeasurable extent of horizon; their acute perception of hearing
                    appreciates all sounds, and every intonation; and their glad voices are
                    exquisitely skilled in their production. Though their bills be hard, and their
                    bodies covered by down and feathers, they are by no means deficient in the sense
                    of touch. They enjoy all the delights of conjugal and parental affection, and
                    perform their incumbent duties with devotedness and courage; they cherish and
                    defend their offspring, and will sometimes die in that defence; and of all the
                    wonderful labours of instinctive art, none is so beautiful as the formation of
                    their mossy dwellings. With what deep and continuous affection does the female
                    brood over her cherished treasures! how unwearied is the gallant male in his
                    tender assiduities, and in the rich outpouring of that varied song by which he
                    seeks to soothe her sedentary task! The same principle of attachment and
                    discrimination is even made available in a state of domestication by the skill
                    of all-engrossing man. A bird acquires a knowledge of its master, and submits to
                    and obeys that master’s will; and the proud falcon, which in its natural
                    state</p>
                <p>Doth dally with the wind, and scorn the sun, will wheel in airy circles over a
                    well-trained dog, or stoop its boldest flight at some familiar urchin’s call.
                    Other species will even imitate man’s noblest faculty, the power of speech,—and
                    it is thus with somewhat doubtful feelings that we deny to them the gift of
                    reason.</p>
                <p>But the silent dweller in the deep knows few attachments, expresses no language,
                    cherishes no affections. Constructing no dwelling, he merely shelters himself
                    from danger among the cavernous rocks of the ocean, or beneath the murky shade
                    of the overhanging banks of rivers; and the cravings of hunger seem alone to
                    exercise a frequent or influential action over his monotonous movements. We must
                    not, however, suppose that the life of fishes is not one of enjoyment, for we
                    know that the great Creator “careth for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his creatures
                    ;” and it ought perhaps rather to be said that we cannot appreciate the nature
                    of their feelings, than that they are in any way fore-doomed to a negation of
                    pleasure. Assuredly, however, the hand of nature has been most prodigal in
                    bestowing on their external aspect every variety of adornment. Their special
                    forms arc infinite, their proportions often most elegant, their colours lively
                    and diversified, and nothing seems wanting in them to excite the admiration of
                    mankind. Indeed it almost appears as if this prodigality of beauty was intended
                    solely for such an end. The brightness of metallic splendour, the sparkling
                    brilliancy of precious gems, the milder effulgence of the hues of flowers, all
                    combine to signalise fishes as among the most beautiful objects of creation.
                    When newly withdrawn from their native element, or still gliding submerged in
                    its liquid coolness, their colours, fixed or iridescent, are seen mingling in
                    streaks or bands, or broader flashes, always elegant and symmetrical; sometimes
                    richly contrasted, sometimes gradually softened into each other; and in all
                    cases harmonizing with a chaste fulness of effect, which Titian or Rubens might
                    envy, but could never equal. For what reason, then, it has been asked, has all
                    this adornment been so lavishly bestowed on creatures which can scarcely
                    perceive each other amid the dim and perpetual twilight of the deep? Shakspeare
                    has already said that there are “more things in <hi rend="italic">heaven</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">earth</hi> than are dream’t of in our philosophy and we
                    fear it is no answer to the foregoing question to add, that the same observation
                    applies with even greater truth to the “<hi rend="italic">waters beneath the
                    earth”</hi></p>
                <p>SECT. VI THE NUTRITION, MANDUCATION, AND DEGLUTI</p>
                <p>TION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>The nutritive functions of fishes follow the same order of progression as those
                    of the other vertebrated classes; they seize and in some measure divide their
                    food with their teeth; they digest it in the stomach, from whence it passes into
                    the intestinal canal, where it receives a supply of bile from the liver, and
                    frequently a liquid similar to that of the pancreas; the nutritive juices
                    absorbed by vessels analogous to lacteals, and probably taken up in part also
                    directly by the veins, are mingled with the venous blood which is flowing
                    towards the heart, from whence it is pushed to the branchiae, in which, coming
                    into contact with the water, it is converted into arterial blood, and then
                    proceeds to the nourishment of the whole body. As in other animals, also,
                    certain properties are carried off from the blood by transpiration, the
                    secreting power of the kidneys, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Fishes in general arc extremely voracious, and the rule of “eat or be eaten”
                    applies to them with unusual force. They are almost constantly engaged in the
                    pursuit and capture of their prey; their degree of power in these respects
                    depending of course on the dimensions of the mouth <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939882" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9882-0160"/>and throat, and the strength
                    of the teeth and jaws. If the teeth are sharp and hooked, they are capable of
                    securing the slenderest and most agile animals; if they are broad and strong,
                    they are able to bruise the hardest aliment; if they are feeble or entirely
                    wanting, they are only serviceable in procuring some inert or unresisting prey.
                    Fishes indeed show but little choice in the selection of their food, and their
                    digestive powers are so strong and rapid as to suffice to dissolve very speedily
                    all kinds of animal substances. They greedily swallow other fishes,
                    notwithstanding the sharp spines or bony ridges with which they may be armed;
                    they attack and devour crabs and shell-fish, gulping them entire if they cannot
                    otherwise attain their object; they do not object occasionally to swallow the
                    young even of their own species, and the more powerful kinds carry their warfare
                    into other kingdoms of nature, and revel on rats, reptiles, and young ducklings,
                    to say nothing of the ferocious shark, which not seldom makes a meal even of the
                    lord of the creation. The species which live chiefly on vegetable substances are
                    few in number.</p>
                <p>The growth of fishes depends greatly on the nature and supply of food, and
                    different individuals of the same species exhibit a great disparity in their
                    respective dimensions. They grow less rapidly in small ponds or shallow streams,
                    than in large lakes and deep rivers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The writer of this treatise kept a minnow little more than
                    half an inch long in a glass tumbler for a period of two years, during which
                    time there was no perceptible increase in its dimensions. Had it continued in
                    its native stream, subjected to the fattening influence of a continuous flow of
                    water, and a consequent increase in the quantity and variety of its natural
                    food, its cubic dimensions would probably have been twenty times greater; yet it
                    must have attained, prior to the lapse of a couple of years, to the usual period
                    of the adult state.</p></note> The growth itself seems to continue for a great
                    length of time, and we can scarcely set bounds to, certainly we know not with
                    precision, the utmost range of the specific size of fishes. Even among species
                    in no way remarkable for their dimensions, we ever and anon meet with ancient
                    individuals, favourably situated, which vastly exceed the ordinary weight and
                    measurement of their kind.</p>
                <p>The teeth of fishes are sometimes spread over all the bones which envelope the
                    cavities of the mouth and pharynx; on the maxillary, inter-maxillary, and
                    palatine bones; on the vomer, the tongue, the branchial arches, and pharyngeal
                    bones. In certain genera they exist on all those parts; while in others they are
                    wanting on some, or are even entirely absent on all. The denominations of the
                    teeth are derived from their position, that is, from the bones to which they are
                    attached, and are consequently as numerous as the varieties of their situation.
                    Their forms are not less varied than their stations, and give rise to terms
                    still more numerous. The majority are conical or hooked, more or less acute.
                    When these hooks are in considerable number, and disposed in several rows, or in
                    quincunx, they are compared to those sharp points which beset the instruments
                    called <hi rend="italic">cards,</hi> used in the working of wool or cotton. It
                    is to this form and distribution that we allude in the descriptive portion of

                    they are likened to smooth velvet; when feeble and elongated, they are said to
                    be brushy or hair-like. Lastly, those kinds of teeth are sometimes so extremely
                    small and short as to be reduced to mere asperities, sensible rather to touch
                    than sight. The whole are simple, and spring from an equally simple pulpy
                    germ.</p>
                <p>In the majority of osseous fishes, besides the lips, which, even when fleshy,
                    having no peculiar muscles, can exert but little strength in retaining the
                    aliments, there is generally in the inside of each jaw, behind the anterior
                    teeth, a kind of membranous fold or valvule, formed by a replication of the
                    interior skin, and directed backwards, of which the effect is to hinder the
                    alimentary substances, and especially the water gulped during respiration, from
                    escaping again by the mouth. This structure, as formerly supposed, does not
                    constitute a character restricted to the genus <hi rend="italic">Zeus,</hi> but
                    exists in an infinity of fishes. The food seized by the teeth of the maxillae,
                    and detained by the valve just mentioned, is carried still farther back by the
                    teeth of the palate and tongue when these exist, and is at the same time
                    prevented by the dentations of the branchial arches from penetrating between the
                    intervals of the branchiae, where it might injure the delicate organs of
                    respiration. The movements of the maxillae and tongue can thus send the food
                    only in the direction of the pharynx, where it undergoes additional action on
                    the part of the teeth of the pharyngeal bones, which triturate or carry it
                    backwards into the oesophagus. The last-named part is clothed by a layer of
                    strong, close-set, muscular fibres, sometimes forming various bundles, the
                    contractions of which push the alimentary matter into the stomach, thus
                    completing the act of deglutition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>SECT. VII.—THE <hi rend="smallcaps">circulation</hi> OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>Fishes, in common with -warm-blooded animals, are provided with a complete
                    circulation for the body, and with another equally complete for the organs of
                    respiration, and with a particular abdominal circulation terminating at the
                    liver by means of the vena porta; but their peculiar character consists in this,
                    that the branchial circulation alone is provided at its base with a muscular
                    apparatus or heart, corresponding to the right auricle and ventricle of the
                    higher classes, while nothing of the kind exists at the base of the circulating
                    system of the body; in other words, the left auricle and ventricle are entirely
                    wanting—the branchial veins changing into arteries without any muscular
                    envelope.</p>
                <p>The muscular apparatus of their circulation is composed of the auricle, the
                    ventricle, and the bulb of the pulmonary artery, and the auricle itself is
                    preceded by a large sinus, in which all the veins of the body terminate; a
                    structure which gives rise to four cavities separated by restrictions, into
                    which the blood must flow in its progress from the body to the branehiae. Their
                    size is small in proportion to the dimensions of the body, and does not increase
                    in the same ratio with the growth of the individual. Three of these receptacles,
                    the auricle, the heart, and the bulb, are lodged in a pericardium, which is
                    itself placed beneath the pharyngeal bones, between the inferior parts of the
                    branchial arches, and for the most part protected externally by the humeral
                    bones. The great venous sinus is not placed in the pericardium, but between the
                    posterior partition of that cavity and the membrane which represents the
                    diaphragm, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939895" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9895-0161"/>and
                    which is merely the anterior portion of the peritoneum strengthened by
                    aponeurotic fibres. This sinus is extended transversely, and receives by several
                    different trunks the veins of the liver, of the generative organs, of the
                    kidneys, of the fins, branchiae, and throat, and finally those of the head,
                    which themselves partly pass by a sinus at the back of the cranium. The
                    first-mentioned sinus sends the whole of this blood by a single orifice of its
                    anterior convexity into the auricle, which receives it through the opening of
                    its anterior portion. Two thin membranous valvules protect this communication,
                    and are turned towards the auricle. The latter organ is placed in the
                    pericardium, in front of the great sinus, and above the ventricle, that is, on
                    its dorsal aspect. It presents very various and often remarkable configurations.
                    In osseous fishes it is usually of a tetrahedral form,—in the cartilaginous
                    kinds more frequently rounded and depressed. It is situate beneath the auricle,
                    the cavity being so turned as to be almost vertical next that organ, and
                    horizontal towards the bulb. Its coats are extremely robust, and furnished
                    internally with powerful fleshy columns, its substance being composed of two
                    different layers. But it is in the bulb of the branchial artery that we find the
                    most vigorous fibres, usually disposed in a circular form. The prolongation of
                    this bulb issues from the pericardium, and becomes the branchial artery,
                    advancing forward beneath the single chain of small bones which unites the
                    arches of the branchiae. The branchial artery soon divides, and in such a manner
                    as to send a branch to each branchia. These branches pass along a hollow groove
                    on the convexity of each branchial arch, and more external than the vein which
                    follows the same track, but in an opposite direction. To the arch are attached a
                    great number of leaflets, parallel to each other, usually terminated in a forked
                    point, and sometimes deeply divided. The principal branch which passes along the
                    groove of the arch gives a smaller branch to each of the leaflets; and this
                    branch, after being twice bifurcated, furnishes an infinity of lesser
                    branchlets, which meander over the surface of each leaflet, till they are
                    finally converted into extremely minute veins. These little vessels meet on each
                    side in a branchial vein, which proceeds along the internal margin of the
                    lateral lobe of the leaflet, and the two veins open into the trunk of the great
                    vein of the branchia.</p>
                <p>On passing out of the dorsal side of the branchia, the branchial veins assume the
                    structure and functions of arteries; even before their arrival at this point,
                    the anterior have already sent several branches to different portions of the
                    head; and it is necessary to remark, that the heart and several parts situate in
                    the chest receive their blood from a branchial vein, by means of an offset
                    issuing from near its source, and consequently anterior to its exit from the
                    branchiae. Nevertheless, it is only by the re-union of the trunks proceeding
                    from the four branchiae that the great artery is formed which carries the blood
                    to the viscera and all the parts of the trunk, and which is by consequence the
                    representative of the aorta of the Mammalia,—but of an aorta which possesses
                    neither auricle nor ventricle at its base. Thus, according to Cuvier’s views,
                    the left cavities of the heart of quadrupeds do not exist in fishes, but are
                    replaced by a simple vascular apparatus, situate above the branchiae, in like
                    manner as the right cavities are placed beneath them.</p>
                <p>SECT. VIII.—THE RESPIRATION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>It is thus by an almost infinite subdivision of the vessels over the surface of
                    the branchiae or gills, that the blood of fishes becomes subjected to the
                    influence of an ambient fluid. This fluid is of course water, which is made to
                    flow incessantly between the branchiae by the movement of the jaws, and of the
                    opercular and hyoidean apparatus. This mode of respiration is equally necessary
                    to fishes, as the direct respiration of air is to other animals; but the action
                    of water on the blood is much more feeble than that of air. It appears that it
                    is neither the water itself, nor the oxygen contained in it, which effects the
                    respiration, but the small portion of air which is held in solution or mingled
                    with the water. If this is expelled by ebullition, fishes cannot live; and many
                    species are obliged to rise frequently to the surface for the purpose of
                    breathing atmospheric air. It is easy to suffocate various kinds, by keeping
                    them beneath the surface, enclosed in a gauze net. In the respiration of fishes,
                    as in that of other animals, both the atmospheric air and that contained in the
                    water give out their oxygen. The absorption of the latter, however, is very
                    trifling among these aquatics, for it has been calculated that a man consumes
                    fifty thousand times more than is required by a tench. When fishes are deprived
                    of water, they perish not so much for want of oxygen, as because their branchiae
                    become dry, and their blood can no longer circulate with freedom. Hence the
                    species of which the branchial orifice is small, as the eel, or those which
                    possess receptacles for moisture, like <hi rend="italic">Anabas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Opliicephalus,</hi> long survive exposure; while such as have
                    their gills greatly cleft and open, as the herring, expire almost instantly when
                    withdrawn from their moist abode.</p>
                <p>SECT. IX.—THE SWIMMING BLADDER OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable and characteristic organs of fishes is the swimming
                    bladder, commonly so called. In many genera it has no opening or external
                    communication, and the air which it contains must therefore be the result of
                    secretion. It is composed of an extremely fine internal tunic, and of another of
                    a thicker texture and peculiar fibrous structure, remarkable for producing the
                    finest kind of isinglass. It is enclosed within the general coating with which
                    the peritoneum invests the other viscera. It is sometimes simple, as in perch,
                    sometimes furnished with more or less numerous appendages, as in some of the
                    haddock tribe, or branched, as in certain <hi rend="italic">Sciaenoe.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For representations of
                    various forms of the swimming bladder of fishes, see Plate CCXCVII. figs. 3, 6,
                    7, 8∙</p></note> Occasionally we find it divided, as it were, into two parts, by
                    a restriction, as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> many of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Salmonidoe,</hi> and others. The <hi rend="italic">Catastomoe</hi>
                    have it even divided into three. It is chiefly among the abdominal fishes that
                    we find it communicating by a tube or tunnel with the intestinal canal, and
                    either directly with the oesophagus, as in <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> or
                    with the base of the stomach, as in the herring. That of the sturgeon opens into
                    the former portion by means of a large orifice. The contents of the swimming
                    bladder arc usually found to be azote, mingled with some fractional parts of
                    oxygen or carbonic acid. A difference of opinion, however, seems to exist
                    regarding the proportion of oxygen, which is estimated as much greater both by
                    Configliachi and Biot. Some physiologists appear to have regarded the swimming
                    bladder as a true lung, which both admitted and returned the external air; but
                    in many species the air-duct which connects the bladder with the gullet is
                    entirely wanting; and in many others which remain constantly at prodigious
                    depths, the quantity of oxygen gas in the swimming bladder is greater than in
                    those the abode of which is near the surface. Indeed the oxygen is said to
                    increase in quantity in proportion to the depth at which the species dwells.
                    Carus considers it probable that the vessel in question performs a part
                    analogous <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939908" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9908-0162"/>to
                    that of the expiratory functions of the lungs in the higher classes, by not only
                    separating excrementitious azote and superabundant oxygen from the blood, but
                    even discharging those elements in such species as have this particular viscus
                    provided with an air-duct.</p>
                <p>The more obvious use, however, of this organ seems to be to maintain the fish in
                    equilibrium, or to lighten or increase its relative weight, so as to cause an
                    ascension or a sinking, in proportion as the bladder· is compressed or expanded.
                    This is probably effected by the contraction or dilatation of the ribs. At all
                    events, it is certain, that when the air-bladder bursts, the fish remains at the
                    bottom, usually turning up its belly, and exhibiting other irregularities in its
                    locomotion. Another curious effect is observable in regard to fishes -which have
                    been suddenly brought from a great depth by means of a long fishing line, and
                    which having no time either to compress or partially empty the organ in
                    question, the air which it contains being no longer pressed by the heavy weight
                    of water, either expands so as to burst the bladder, or by its dilatation forces
                    the stomach and oesophagus into the fish’s mouth. When the air-bladder is
                    pierced artificially, the fish almost immediately turns upon its back, and sinks
                    to the bottom.</p>
                <p>We have already alluded to the physiological opinion which regards this organ as
                    an auxiliary to the respiratory system, and have likewise adverted to the
                    argument against that opinion, deduced from the fact of its being imperforate in
                    many species, and entirely wanting in others. We may add, that Weber<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aure et Auditu,</hi> &amp;c.</p></note> has pointed out a
                    remarkable connection between the swimming bladder and the organs of hearing. It
                    would appear that the former in several instances subserves the latter as a
                    membrana tympani; but its primary, or at least most important purpose, seems to
                    be to regulate the ascending or descending movements. Though of the highest
                    importance in the structure of such species as possess it (and these are by far
                    the greater number), yet the swimming bladder is not indispensable in the
                    general economy of the class of fishes. In several genera (e. <hi rend="italic"
                    >g. Pleu-τonectesj</hi> it is entirely wanting, and the species in such cases
                    generally remain at the bottom, and, swimming obliquely on one side, propel
                    themselves forward by a nearly vertical motion of the tail. In such cases both
                    eyes are on the same side, and the whole structure of the fish, especially the
                    skeleton of the head, presents an unsymmetrical aspect of a very extraordinary
                    kind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In several insects
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Blattα</hi> we have observed a want of symmetry
                    both in the size and markings of the elvtra. We do not mean an accidental
                    variation of one side, but an evidently pre-ordained disparity of form and
                    colour.</p></note> In many cartilaginous fishes, such as rays (commonly called
                    skates), the absence of the swimming bladder seems compensated by the enormous
                    size of the pectoral fins, which, of all the external organs, are probably the
                    most efficient in raising the body, as the caudal extremity is the power chiefly
                    employed during an onward course. The lamprey, which has neither swimming
                    bladder nor pectoral fins, dwells in the mud. Flat fishes being unprovided with
                    swimming bladders, are supposed for that reason to raise themselves with
                    difficulty to the surface; and they do not appear to strike the water laterally
                    like other fishes, but swim rather after the manner of the Cetacea, by a motion
                    alternately up and down. In all the other animals of this class the chief organ
                    of progressive motion is the tail, or prolongation of the body, terminated by a
                    caudal fin, the position of which, unlike that of the great aquatic mammalia
                    called whales, is vertical. The reason of the difference is obviously this: A
                    true fish, possessing the power of extracting air from water by means of its
                    gills, does not (except at rare intervals) require to mount to the surface for
                    the performance of the vital act of respiration; but all cetaceous animals being
                    furnished with lungs, which cannot perform their functions except through an
                    immediate communication with the atmosphere, require their bodies to be
                    terminated by a horizontal expansion, the action of which is the most efficient
                    for an ascending course.</p>
                <p>It is, however, difficult to account for the fact that so considerable an organ
                    as the swimming bladder should have been denied to so many species, not only of
                    the more indolent kinds, which dwell composedly at the bottom of the waters, but
                    to many others which yield to none of their class in the ease and velocity of
                    their movements. Its presence or absence does not even accord with the other
                    conditions of organization; for while it is wanting in the common mackerel, it
                    is found to occur in a closely allied species, the <hi rend="italic">Scomber
                    pneumatophorus</hi> of Laroche.</p>
                <p>Another singular peculiarity connected with the organization of certain fishes
                    maybe also shortly noticed in this place, we mean the power of conveying
                    electrical shocks. In Torpedos, the apparatus consists of membranous tubes
                    filled with mucous matter, divided by transverse chambers closely set together,
                    like the cells of honeycomb, and disposed in two groups placed on each side of
                    the head. They receive enormous branches of nerves from the fifth and eighth
                    pair. In the <hi rend="italic">Gymnotus</hi> this extraordinary structure
                    occupies the under surface of the body throughout its entire extent, and to a
                    considerable thickness. It is composed of parallel plates separated by thin
                    layers of mucilage. The effect of this natural galvanic pile will be detailed in
                    the course of the systematic portion of this article, when we shall have
                    occasion to mention the electric fishes in their proper place.</p>
                <p>SECT. X.—THE GENERAT POSITION AND RELATIONS OF FISHES, CONSIDERED AS A GREAT
                    CLASS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.</p>
                <p>It results not less from this general exposition of the structure of our present
                    class, than from all observation of special organization, that fishes form a
                    class of animals distinct from every other, and destined by the totality of
                    their conformation to live, move, and have their being in the waters. The liquid
                    element forms their proper place in the creation; there they had their origin,
                    there they must remain till the final consummation of all things,—and it is
                    either through slight and superficial approximations, or by vain metaphysical
                    speculation, that any modern writer could regard them as proceeding from an
                    exalted or more perfect development of the molluscous tribes. Equally unfounded
                    is of course that other and corresponding opinion, which, in the spirit of the
                    same philosophy, looks upon fishes as forming an elementary stage, or foetal
                    condition, of the other vertebrated classes. It is true that the Mollusea, in
                    common with fishes, respire by means of branchiae; they equally possess a
                    nervous and circulating system, an intestinal canal and a liver; “and nobody,”
                    says Cuvier, with a justifiable pride, “knows these things better than I, who
                    was the first to make known with any degree of completeness the anatomy and
                    zoological relations of the molluscous tribes.” As animal life, he
                    continues,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Nat. des Ροissοηs,</hi> t. i. p. 544.</p></note> has
                    received but a limited number of organs, it necessarily happens that some of
                    these organs are common to several classes. But where is in other respects the
                    resemblance? The skeleton of these animals, and their entire system of
                    locomotion, are they comparable in the least of their parts? And even euch
                    organs as are <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939921" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9921-0163"
                    />common alike to the Mollusea and to fishes, can they be brought into relation
                    with those connections which the latter exhibit with the other vertebrated
                    classes? By what passage does nature conduct us from the one to the other? It is
                    certainly by no means difficult, while disregarding numerous disagreements, so
                    to compose a definition as to embrace only those points which they possess in
                    common; but that definition assuredly will always repose upon a pure abstraction
                    of the mind, a definition simply nominal, an assemblage of vain words, which can
                    never be represented by a harmonious and existing plan, notwithstanding whatever
                    extraneous details may be collected or conceived in support of such visionary
                    views. By a like procedure, there is in truth no two things, however remote or
                    dissimilar, which may not be so allied; for, whatever their disresemblance,
                    there will always be some particular point or other in which they may be found
                    to agree. But when we look to the characters in which objects differ, we shall
                    find reason to view the subject in another light. The heart itself in those
                    Mollusea which have only one, is placed in a contrary mode from that of fishes;
                    it is at the junction of the branchial veins and arteries of the body that that
                    organ is attached; in several the members are placed upon the head, in others
                    the generative system is lateral, and’frequently the respiratory organs are
                    placed above those of digestion, and extend more or less over the dorsal
                    surface. Perhaps all that can be said regarding any positive or important
                    relationship between Mollusea and fishes is, that both classes are possessed of
                    branch iae.</p>
                <p>It may indeed be observed, that whenever we proceed from these purely verbal or
                    metaphysical formula, we find ourselves lost among the most inadmissible
                    comparisons. According to one theorist, the shells of bivalves represent the
                    opercula of fishes; according to another, the buckler of the cuttle-fish is a
                    true fibrous bone; according to a third, the large scales of the sturgeon, and
                    the spines of the diodons, arc to be regarded as an external skeleton. Others
                    search for the desired analogies among the Crustacea, of which the margins of
                    the thorax represent the opercula. Beneath these margins the branchiae actually
                    occur, but if we continue the comparison, all is changed. The medullary cord is
                    towards the abdomen, the heart towards the back, and the latter organ, as among
                    the Mollusea, receives the blood from the branchiae, but does not send it
                    thither. Finally, some observers, apparently despairing of their transcendental
                    cause, perceive the rays or spiny apophyses of vertebrated animals in the legs
                    of the Crustacea, forgetting that, were it so, an obvious degradation rather
                    than amelioration of organic structure must have befallen the class of
                    fishes.</p>
                <p>The affinity of fishes to other classes of vertebrated animals is much better
                    founded. At least we here find the commencement of sensible relations in the
                    number of organic systems, and in their mutual connections; but we are still far
                    from discovering a progressive and continuous course. We cannot in this place
                    report the conclusive reasoning of Baron Cuvier regarding the distinctions of
                    these classes. We shall merely state his conclusion to be, that if there is a
                    resemblance between the organs of fishes and those of the other great groups of
                    the animal kingdom, it is only in so far as the functions of such organs are
                    similar; that if we assert either that fishes are Mollusea or an ameliorated or
                    higher grade, or that they represent a commencing or foetal state of reptiles,
                    we can do so. only in an abstract or metaphysical acceptation, and that even
                    with that restriction we by no means convey an accurate notion of their organic
                    structure; that we cannot regard them either as links of an imaginary chain of
                    successive forms (of which none could serve as the germ of another, since none
                    is capable of a solitary or isolated existence), nor of that other chain, not
                    less fanciful, of simultaneous and transitionary forms, which has no reality but
                    in the imagination of certain naturalists, more poetical than observant. They
                    pertain in truth, and solely, to the actual chain of co-existent beings,—of
                    beings necessary to each other, and which by their mutual action maintain the
                    resplendent order and harmony of created things.</p>

                <p>SECT. XI.—THE CLASSIFICATION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>The class of fishes is of all others the most difficult to divide into orders,
                    according to fixed and perceptible characters. We shall here give a brief view
                    of Baron Cuvier’s arrangement, the details of which we shall afterwards exhibit
                    in our systematic view.</p>
                <p>Fishes are divisible, in the first place, into two great and distinct series,
                    viz. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes properly so called,</hi> embracing the great
                    majority of species; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chondropterygian</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cartilaginous Fishes,</hi> such as sharks and rays.</p>
                <p>The general character of the latter series consists in the absence of the bones
                    of the upper jaw, the place of which is supplied by those of the palate. Their
                    entire structure also exhibits sundry analogies, to be afterwards described.
                    Cartilaginous fishes are further divisible into three principal orders.</p>
                <p>Isŕ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclostomi,</hi> the jaws of which are soldered into an
                    immoveable ring, and the branchiae open by means of numerous holes. Example, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lamprey.</hi><hi rend="italic">2d.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Selacmi,</hi> which possess the branchiae of the Cyclostomi, but not their
                    jaws. Example, <hi rend="italic">Sharks.</hi><hi rend="italic">2&gt;d.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sturiones,</hi> of which the branchial opening is in the usual
                    fissure-like form, and furnished with an opercle. Example. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sturgeons.</hi></p>
                <p>The other great series, or that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ordinary Fishes,</hi>
                    presents a first subdivision into those in which the maxillary bone and the
                    palatine arch are fixed to the cranium. They constitute Cuvier’s order <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Plectognatni,</hi> which comprises two families, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gymnodontes</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Sclerodermi.</hi>
                    Examples, the genera <hi rend="italic">Diodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ostracion.</hi></p>
                <p>The next subdivision of the ordinary fishes contains certain species with perfect
                    jaws, but the branchiae of which, instead of being comb-shaped, resemble a
                    series of small tufts. They constitute an order called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lophobranchii,</hi> which comprises the two genera <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Syngnathus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pegasus</hi> of Linn. Example, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pipe-fish.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the ordinary fishes there then remains an immense assemblage, to the general
                    classification of which no other characters can be applied than those of the
                    external organs of motion. After a long and laborious research, Baron Cuvier
                    became satisfied that the least objectionable of these characters is still that
                    long ago employed by Ray and Artedi, drawn from the nature of the first rays of
                    the dorsal and anal fins. Thus the great body of the ordinary fishes is divided
                    into <hi rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygn,</hi> in which all the rays arc soft,
                    with the occasional exception of the first of the dorsal, or of the pectorals;
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Acan-thopterygh,</hi> in which the first portion of the
                    dorsal, or the first dorsal if there are two fins of that kind, is always
                    supported by spinous rays, and where some similar spines are also found in the
                    anal fin, and at least one in each of the ventrals.</p>
                <p>Of these two last-mentioned groups, the former, or <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192939934" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9934-0164"/>Malacopterygn, may be
                    conveniently subdivided according to the position of the ventral fins, whether
                    situate behind the abdomen, suspended to the apparatus of the shoulder, or
                    entirely wanting. This view furnishes us with three great orders, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygii</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Abdominales</hi> (such
                    as pike, salmon, and herring), the Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sub-brachiati</hi>
                    (such as cod, haddock, and flat fish), and the Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Apodes</hi> (such as eels).</p>
                <p>But such a basis of subdivision is altogether inapplicable to the remaining group
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ordinary fishes, viz. the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Acan-thofterygii,</hi> which at present can only be placed together in a
                    certain series of natural families. Fortunately, several of these families are
                    possessed of characters almost as precise as those which could be assigned to
                    genuine orders. It is, however, impossible to assign to the families of fish the
                    same marked gradation so perceptible among those of the Mammalia. Thus the
                    Chondropterygians are related to serpents on the one hand by the organs of the
                    senses, and in certain cases even by the generative system; while, on the other,
                    they bear an alliance to the Mollusea and worms in the occasional imperfection
                    of their skeleton.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding with our systematic exposition of the minor divisions, we shall
                    present our readers with a sketch of Baron Cuvier’s views regarding the general
                    character and relations of certain groups. After forty years devoted to the
                    study of Ichthyology, that great observer became convinced that no
                    acanthopterygian species ought to be mingled in classification with the fishes
                    of other families, as attempted by many of his predecessors; and he also came to
                    the conclusion that the acanthopterygian order, which comprises about three
                    fourths of the entire class, contains the characteristic type, and is the most
                    accordant and homogeneous, even amid all the variations which it undergoes.</p>
                <p>The acanthopterygian character prevails over all the others, and these ought to
                    be employed only as subservient to it, and never in opposition; but the extreme
                    constancy of the general plan, and the predominating influence of the regulating
                    character, render it a matter of greater difficulty to apply precise and
                    perceptible characters of a subordinate nature. It is thus that the various
                    families of the acanthopterygian order pass so insensibly from one to another,
                    that we are often at a loss to define the transition. The family of Percidae,
                    for example, which is essentially distinguished from that of the Sciaenidae by
                    its palatinal teeth, comprises a group of some extent, and extremely natural in
                    its construction, which yet contains a portion of species possessed of those
                    teeth, while the other portion is without them. The same thing happens in the
                    family with mailed cheeks (joues cuirassées), the majority of which are allied
                    to the perches,—the others to the Sciaenidae. The sciaenoid genera themselves
                    approach in part to the Chaetodontes in the scales which in several instances
                    more or less cover their vertical fins, and yet it is necessary to assimilate
                    them still more closely to the Sparidae, by reason, in many other instances, of
                    the entire absence of those scales.</p>
                <p>The malacopterygian families are distinguished by stronger and more obvious
                    differences, and several of them are not only natural, but subjected to fixed
                    limits, so that each, in its separation from the other, preserves within itself
                    a great resemblance in details. This precision is so sensible, that the majority
                    of natural families established by Cuvier in this part of the class had been
                    already signalised by Artedi as generic groups. His <hi rend="italic">Siluri,
                    Cyprini, Salmones,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clupeoe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esoces,</hi> may remain unbroken, and there is even no inconvenience in
                    distributing them according to the position of the ventral fins, because in
                    those genera the character in question, however trivial in itself, is constant;
                    but it is clearly impossible to preserve the distinction of jugular, thoracic,
                    and abdominal fishes, in the mode established by Linnaeus. It is, as Cuvier
                    observes, of small consequence, in fact, whether the ventrals manifest
                    themselves externally a little before or a little behind the pectorals, or
                    immediately beneath them; but the circumstance of importance, as connected with
                    the structure of the fish, is to ascertain whether the pelvis be attached to the
                    bones of the shoulder, or whether it is simply suspended in the muscles of the
                    abdomen. To designate the fish belonging to the former category, the-name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sub-braxhians</hi> has been bestowed by Cuvier, and that without
                    any reference to the external position of the ventrals,—that circumstance being
                    dependent on the greater or less extent of the bones of the pelvis. To those of
                    the second category he leaves the older name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abdominals.</hi> Lastly, the term <hi rend="italic">Apodes</hi> naturally
                    designates the Malacopterygians destitute of ventral fins.</p>
                <p>Cuvier’s systematic exposition of fishes commences with the Acanthopterygians,
                    which constitute in reality only a single family of vast extent. He then places
                    in succession the various families of Malacopterygians, in the order in which
                    they seem allied to the preceding great division; but he guards the student from
                    inferring that these relations follow only in a single line or series. If the
                    abdominal Malacopterygians may be so arranged, and may even be made to commence
                    with those which possess some spiny rays, they are not followed in so natural a
                    succession by either the apodal or sub∙brachian tribes. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gaãi,</hi> for example, are as nearly related as any of the Abdominals to
                    certain species of the acanthopterygian order, and 'there would be no reason for
                    placing them after the Abdominals if the question were mooted respecting the
                    station they should hold in nature. If they are actually arranged subsequent to
                    the latter in our systems, it is because the exposition of facts in a book
                    necessarily requires a successive order.</p>
                <p>The spirit of the same observation is applicable to the rest of the fishes ;—to
                    those of which the upper jaw is fixed <hi rend="italic">(Pleetognathi),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> to such as have tufted branchiae <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lophobranchii),</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and, above all, to the great and
                    important series of Chondropterygians, which terminate the class. It is indeed
                    chiefly among those last mentioned that we perceive the futility of whatever
                    system seeks to arrange the objects of creation in a single line. Several of the
                    genera alluded to, the rays and sharks, for example, may be said to rise above
                    the rank of ordinary fishes by the complicated nature of some of their organs of
                    sense, and by that of the generative system, which is more fully developed in
                    some particulars than even that of birds ;— while other genera of the same
                    series, and at which we arrive by graduated transitions, such as the Lampreys
                    and Ammocaetes, become so simplified in their structure, that they have even
                    been regarded as affording a connecting link between the class of fishes and
                    that of the articulated worms. The genus <hi rend="italic">Ammocaetes</hi>
                    certainly possesses no skeleton, and its muscular apparatus is attached solely
                    to tendinous or membranous supports.</p>
                <p>Let it not therefore be imagined, says Cuvier, that because one genus or family
                    is placed anterior to another, it is for that reason to be regarded as more
                    perfect, or superior to those that follow. He alone will indulge in that fond
                    fancy, who pursues the chimerical project of ranging beings in a single
                    series,—a project, be it remembered, now renounced by philosophy. The further we
                    advance into the penetralia of the temple of nature, the more we shall feel
                    convinced that a falser notion was never entertained in relation to natural
                    history. Genuine systems view each being not as intermediate merely to two
                    others, but as central among many ;—they show the wonderful radiations that link
                    it more or less immediately with the vast web of organic life; and it is by such
                    extended views alone that <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939947"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-9947-0165"/>we shall acquire ideas worthy of nature and of
                    nature’s God. It is therefore not so much in the position which a being occupies
                    in our published systems, which are necessarily linear or consecutive, that we
                    are to seek for those multifarious relations, or for the actual degree of
                    organisation,—but in accurate descriptions of structure afforded by those who
                    possess the use of their eyes and pen. It is not, however, to be in any way
                    maintained that no direct classification is possible, or that species should not
                    be formed into groups, and embraced by definitions. These approximations are on
                    the contrary so real, that the natural understanding of man has ever inclined
                    towards them, and in all ages and countries the vulgar as well as the learned
                    have formed their genera. It is in truth one of the great objects of science to
                    render the various groups into which, for our own convenience, we must arrange
                    the objects of creation, as natural in themselves, and as nearly related to
                    their neighbours, as is consistent with the necessity of placing them in our
                    descriptive systems in a single fixed position,—a position, be it remembered, in
                    which their numerous and mixed relations can neither be philosophically
                    exhibited nor fully expressed.</p>
                <p>We here terminate our introductory chapter, or general exposition of the class of
                    fishes, and shall now proceed to a detailed enumeration of the characters of the
                    principal genera, adding, as occasion requires, a succinct description and
                    history of the most interesting or important species. We give in a note below a

                <p>FIRST GREAT SERIES OF THE CLASS OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>ORDINARY OR OSSEOUS FISHES.</p>
                <p>ORDER I.—ACANTHOPTERYGII.</p>
                <p>These, as already mentioned, form much the most numerous division of the class.
                    They are distinguished by the spines, which occupy the place of the first rays
                    of the dorsal fin, or which alone sustain the anterior dorsal when there are
                    two. Sometimes, instead of an anterior dorsal, there are only a few free spines.
                    The first rays of their anal fin are also spinous, and there is generally one of
                    a similar nature to each of the ventrals. The Acanthopterygians bear so many
                    relations to each other,—their several natural families exhibit so many
                    variations in the apparent characters which one might suppose capable of
                    indicating orders or other subdivisions,—that it has been found impossible to
                    divide them, otherwise than by those natural families themselves, which are thus
                    left without any higher combinations.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I.—PERCIDAE.</p>
                <p>So named because well typified by the common perch. Their bodies are of an oblong
                    form, covered with scales, which are generally hard and rough; the opercle
                    andpre-opercle, and frequently both, have the margins toothed or <pb break="no"

                    of the vomer, and almost always the palatine bones, are furnished with
                    teeth.</p>
                <p>The species of this family are extremely numerous, especially in the tropical
                    seas. Their flesh is in general wholesome, and of an agreeable flavour. By far
                    the greater number have their ventral fins attached beneath the pectoral, and
                    thus form a first division, -named <hi rend="smallcaps">Thoracic

                    deposits her ova, united together by a viscid matter, in lengthened strings, a
                    peculiarity noted by Aristotle. The number of these eggs sometimes amounts to

                    of Cuvier and his able coadjutor Μ. Valenciennes. It attains the length of five
                    or six feet, and sometimes weighs a hundred pounds. The flesh is white, tender,
                    and well tasted. It is frequent, according to Risso, near Nice, where it
                    delights in rocky bottoms, and is occasionally captured at the vast depth of

                    it conceals itself on the ebbing of the tide, and is there collected by the
                    natives with their hands. The females deposit their eggs in little hollows in
                    the sand, and offer, it is said, an exception to the ordinary instinct of

                <p>The species occur in the Indian Seas, and are held in high esteem for the

                    Another species, called <hi rend="italic">Soring</hi> by Russell (the <hi

                    and is of a fulvous colour. It is regarded as one of the best fishes in

                <p>The genera of this group, besides possessing eight branchial rays, are
                    distinguished by this further peculiarity, otherwise unexampled among the
                    acanthopterygian tribes, that they possess, besides the spine, seven soft rays,
                    or even more, to each of the ventral fins. Many of the species are remarkable
                    for their beauty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Holocentrum,</hi> Artedi. Scales brilliant and
                    dentated; opercle dentated and spinous; pre-opercle not only dentated, but
                    furnished at its angle with a strong spine directed backwards.</p>
                <p>The species of this genus are widely distributed, occurring in the warmer
                    portions of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Few species are more
                    remarkable, either for the magnificence of their integuments, or the strength of
                    their spines. The lustre of their scales equals that of a mirror, and is
                    rendered still more brilliant by bands of red and spots of brown variously
                    distributed. They bear a close resemblance to each other. That which we have
                    selected as an illustration (Plate CCXCVlH. fig. 8) is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.</hi><hi rend="italic">hastatum</hi> of Cuvier, which exists in the Royal
                    Museum of Paris. Its native country is unknown, although it is presumed to have
                    been brought from the African coast, and seems identical with specimens more
                    recently collected by MM. Quoy and Gaymard at the Cape de Verd Islands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Myripristis, Cuv.</hi> Resembles the preceding in
                    splendour, form, and scales; but the pre-opercle has a double dentated margin,
                    and wants the spine at the angle.</p>
                <p>This genus is remarkable for its swimming bladder being divided into two
                    portions, of which the anterior is bilobed and attached to the cranium in two
                    places, where it is merely covered by a membrane, and which correspond to the
                    cavities of the ears.</p>
                <p>The genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Beryx</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Trachichtys</hi> are nearly allied to the preceding. The latter was originally
                    characterised, and somewhat vaguely, by Dr Shaw, from a specimen received from
                    the New Holland seas.</p>
                <p>All the percoid fishes to which we have hitherto alluded are characterised by
                    having their ventral fins inserted beneath the pectorals. But in several genera
                    these important organs are otherwise placed. Thus, in the ensuing group, their
                    position is in advance of the pectorals, that is, upon the throat. They are
                    hence called <hi rend="smallcaps">Jugular Percidae.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Genus Trachinus,</hi> Linn. Head compressed; eyesap-proximate; mouth oblique;
                    first dorsal very short, the second very long; pectorals large; opercle
                    furnished with a strong spine.</p>
                <p>Several of the species occur in the European seas, and two species, known in our
                    own country as the greater and lesser weevers (<hi rend="italic">T. major</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">draco),</hi> occur occasionally on the English coasts.
                    They remain concealed in the sand, and the wounds inflicted by their spines are
                    not only painful, but dangerous.</p>
                <p>“That the greater weever,” observes Mr Yarrell, <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi>
                    prefers deep water, that it lives constantly near the bottom, that it is
                    tenacious of life when caught, and that its flesh is excellent, are four points
                    that have been already noticed; but this subject, in reference to fishes
                    generally, may be farther illustrated. It may be considered as a law, that those
                    fish that swim near the surface of the water have a high standard of
                    respiration, a low degree of muscular irritability, great necessity for oxygen,
                    die soon, almost immediately, when taken out of water, and have flesh prone to
                    rapid decomposition. On the contrary, those fish that live near the bottom of
                    the water have a low standard of respiration, a high degree of muscular
                    irritability, and less necessity for oxygen; they sustain life long after they
                    are taken out of the water, and their flesh remains good for several days. The
                    carp, the tench, the various flat fish, and the eel, are seen gaping and
                    writhing on the stalls of the fishmongers for hours in succession; but no one
                    sees any symptom of motion in the mackerel, the salmon, the trout, or the
                    herring, unless present at the capture. These four last named, and many others
                    of the same habits, to be eaten in the greatest perfection, should be prepared
                    for table the same day they are caught;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The chub swims near the top of the water, and is caught with

                    take this rule with you—that a chub newly taken and newly dressed is so much
                    better than a chub of a day’s keeping after he is dead, that I can compare him
                    to nothing so fitly as to cherries newly gathered from a tree, and others that
                    have been bruised and lain a day or two in water.”</p></note> but the turbot,
                    delicate as it is, may be kept till the second day with advantage, and even
                    longer without injury; and fishmongers generally are well aware of the
                    circumstance, that fish from deep water have the muscle more dense in structure,
                    —in their language, more firm to the touch,—that they are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192940025" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0025-0171"/>of finer flavour, and will
                    keep longer, than fish drawn from shallow water. .... .</p>
                <p>“The law referred to has its origin in the principles of organization; and though
                    it would be difficult for the anatomist to demonstrate those deviations in
                    structure between the trout and the tench which give rise to these distinctions
                    and their effects, it is only necessary to make the point of comparison wider to
                    be assured of the fact.</p>
                <p>“Between a fish with a true bony skeleton, the highest in organization among
                    fishes, and the lamprey, the lowest, the differences are most obvious. If we for
                    a moment consider the lamprey, which is the lowest in organization of the
                    vertebrated animals, with only a rudimentary vertebral column, as the supposed
                    centre of zoological structure, and look from thence up and down the scale of
                    organization, we on the extreme on one side arrive at man, to whom division of
                    his substance would be destruction; but on the other we come to the polype, the
                    division of which gives rise to new animals, each possessing attributes, not
                    only equal to each other, but equal also to the animal of which they previously
                    formed but a small part.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    is separated from the second, which is soft and long. Such is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cl. scaber,</hi> a Mediterranean species, not unſrequently used as food,
                    although of a most ugly and repelling aspect. In others the dorsal is single,

                    to the coast of Coromandel. It dwells in the sand, and the Indian fishers
                    allege, what is no doubt a gross exaggeration, that it sometimes penetrates to a
                    depth of twenty feet.</p>
                <p>In the third principal division of the percoid family the ventral fins are
                    inserted behind the pectorals. They are hence named <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The species are allied to the Percidae in general by the close set teeth upon
                    their jaws, vomer, and palate; but they possess the arched or convex snout, and
                    the scaly· vertical fins, which distinguish so many of the Sciaenidae. Their two
                    dorsals are distant; their pre-opercle dentated, and their mouths greatly cleft.
                    They appear to inhabit the seas of all warm countries. <hi rend="italic">P.

                    >mango</hi><hi rend="italic">fish</hi> of India, so called from its fine yellow
                    colour. According to Russel and Hamilton Buchanan, it is the most delicious of
                    all the species eaten in Bengal. It is fished for all the year round, at the
                    mouths of rivers, where the waters are saline. It ascends to some distance about
                    spawning time in spring, but not beyond the influence of the tide. When in prime
                    condition, the mango-fish, though only a few inches long, sells so high as a
                    rupee. The eggs are also much esteemed. The colours of this species, like those
                    of other fishes, seem to vary greatly, probably in relation to the condition of
                    individuals, or the season of the year. Μ. Dussumier describes it as of a citron
                    yellow, with the fins and filaments of a beautiful orange. Buchanan states that
                    the greater number are silvery, with reflections of gold and purple, and a
                    greenish tint upon the back; the fins being then yellow, and the upper parts
                    spotted with black. The same author names the silvery mango-fish <hi
                    rend="italic">P. risua,</hi> and the yellow ones <hi rend="italic">P.
                    aureus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he hesitates to make them distinct
                    species, and rather opines that the fine colour is the result of season, and
                    that it continues only during spawning time. This view of the subject is well
                    confirmed by the fact, that the high-coloured specimens sent to Europe by Μ.
                    Dussumier were full either of roe or milt, and is moreover in exact conformity
                    with the observations of all practical anglers and Ichthyologists in relation to
                    the species of our own country. We here figure (Plate CCXCVIII. fig. 11) a
                    recently-discovered species, received by Baron Cuvier from Senegal. It is named
                    <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrifidis,</hi> having only four
                    free rays on the pectoral fins.</p>

                    distant dorsals; head oblong, with the lower jaw forming a projecting point

                    <hi rend="italic">Lucii marini,</hi> on account of their strong and pointed
                    teeth. The Mediterranean species (S. <hi rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> Cuv.; <hi

                    S. <hi rend="italic">ρicuda,</hi> from the coast of Brazil, is extremely
                    similar. This fish, though used as an article of food, is occasionally
                    poisonous. Μ. Poey alleges that the malady produced by eating it is sometimes
                    mortal; but he adds that it is easy to distinguish the dangerous individuals
                    beforehand, by a peculiar blackness at the base of their teeth. Another species
                    (N. <hi rend="italic">barracuda,</hi> Cuv.; <hi rend="italic">Esox
                    barracud,</hi> Shaw), which likewise occurs along the Brazilian shores, and
                    among the Antilles, is said to be extremely formidable, on account of its
                    ferocious habits. It is among the number of those marine monsters of which
                    Rochefort speaks in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Antilles,</hi> as greedy of human flesh. He states it to attain the length of
                    seven or eight feet, and that it darts with fury upon any man whom it perceives

                <p>The wounds of its teeth are said to be mortal. Dutertre attributes to it the same

                    slightest effect in producing intimidation; on the contrary, such signs of
                    dislike only excite it to a greater readiness to seize upon its victim. It must
                    be a most disagreeable creature.</p>

                    distant from each other; a pair of barbles or appendages depending from the
                    symphysis of the lower jaw.</p>
                <p>This genus, although allied to the Percidae by several anatomical and external
                    details, is yet characterised by so many peculiarities of organization, that it
                    might almost be regarded as forming of itself a special family. Cuvier, however,
                    has placed it <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la suite</hi> of the
                    Percidae, and we shall therefore follow that great authority in this as in the
                    other portions of our ichthyological system. The genus Mullus is now divided
                    into two.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mullus</hi> proper. Branchiae with three rays; opercle
                    spineless; no teeth to the upper jaw; two large plates of small teeth <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">pave</hi> on the vomer; no swimming
                    bladder.</p>
                <p>To this sub-genus belongs the famous red mullet (JZ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >barbatus'),</hi> Plate CCXCVIII. fig. 12, which, by reason both of its great
                    personal beauty, and the exquisite flavour of its flesh, has for so many ages
                    ministered to the degenerate and heartless luxury of man. It is very frequent in
                    the Mediterranean, and also occurs occasionally along the outer and more
                    northern coasts of Europe. It is brought occasionally to the London markets
                    during the mackerel season; but it is doubtful whether Müller is not in error in
                    assigning to it so northern a locality as Denmark. “The great and rich among the
                    Romans were in the habit, according to Varro, of preserving the red mullet in
                    artificial waters, as one of the most convincing proofs of their individual
                    wealth. Cicero has ridiculed the senseless ostentation with which they exhibited
                    fine specimens of this fish, domiciliated in their own ponds; but Seneca and
                    Pliny have rendered their countrymen odious in the eyes of posterity, and of
                    other nations, by relating the cruelty with which, in their disgusting orgies,
                    they revelled over the dying mullet, while the bright red colour of its healthy
                    state passed through various shades of purple, violet, blue, and white, as life
                    gradually receded, till the convulsions of death put an end to the <hi
                    rend="italic">pleasing</hi> spectacle. They had these devoted fish enclosed in
                    water in vessels with sides of crystal, over a slow fire, on their tables, and
                    derived a fiend-like pleasure from the lingering sufferings of their victims as
                    the increasing heat of the water gradually destroyed them, before the final
                    operation of boiling had rendered them fit to gratify the refined taste of
                    civilization. One cannot indeed read these revolting histories of old time
                    without a blush at certain modern practices far too analogous with them: the
                    sense of taste may, in the cases alluded to, be alone consulted; but the
                    difference is nothing to the suffering animal, whether its torments gratify one
                    or more of the evil passions of its tormentors. The skinning of eels, and the
                    boiling of live Crustacea, would be as disgusting as the gradual boiling of a
                    mullet, did not, in this as in many other cases, the practice of evil destroy
                    the feeling of its iniquity. So extravagant was the folly of the Romans with
                    regard to this fish, that they often gave for them immense prices. Martial
                    mentions one of four pounds weight, which had cost 1300 sesterces; and it is
                    said that the Emperor Tiberius sold one weighing nearly five pounds for 4000
                    sesterces. Asinius Celer, one of the consuls, is reported by Pliny to have paid
                    8000; and, according to Suetonius, 30,000 sesterces had been given for three
                    mullets.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Griffith’s <hi

                <p>The surmulet, or striped mullet <hi rend="italic">(Μ. Surmuletus,</hi> Linn.), is
                    larger than the preceding, and measures about a foot in length. It is much more
                    common as a British species than the preceding, being of frequent occurrence
                    along the extended line of our southern coast, from Cornwall to Sussex; but
                    becoming rarer as we proceed from thence northward by the eastern coast. It has
                    been regarded as migratory, yet it appears in the shops of the London
                    fish-mongers throughout the year, though in much greater plenty during May and
                    June, at which time their colours are most vivid, and the fish, as food, is in
                    the best condition. The striped red mullet spawns in spring, and the young are
                    five inches long by the end of October.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    coasts. It occurs not far to the south of New York, and has been found in much
                    greater numbers along the southernmost coasts of South America.<note

                    this species the larger specimens of mullet mentioned by the ancients are
                    referrible. Pliny indeed states expressly that the large mullets were found

                <p>The species of this sub-genus are native to the seas of India and America. That
                    which we have selected for illustration (Plate CCXCVIII. fig. 13) is the <hi

                    Gaymard, and when opened its stomach was found filled with small Crustacea.</p>
                <p>We here terminate the family of <hi rend="smallcaps">Percidae,</hi> or perchlike
                    fishes, and proceed to</p>
                <p>FAMILY II—BUCCAE LORICATAE, or MAILED CHEEKS.</p>
                <p>There are a certain set of fishes which, in the totality of their structure,
                    certainly approach the preceding family of the perches; but on which the
                    singular aspect of their variously-armed heads bestows so peculiar a
                    physiognomy, that they have always been classed together in special genera. As
                    examples, we may mention the gurnards, father-lashers, and river bull-heads,
                    belonging to <hi rend="italic">Trigla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cottus.</hi>
                    The common character of all these fishes consists in the sub-orbital bone being
                    more or less extended over the cheek, and articulating behind with the
                    pre-opercle. The genus <hi rend="italic">Uranoscopus</hi> alone of the preceding
                    family exhibits some affinity to this form of structure; but still in that case,
                    the sub-orbital, though very broad, is connected posteriorly, not with the
                    opercle, but with the temporal bones. It is then from this peculiar extension
                    and attachment of one or both of the suborbitals that the family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">mailed cheeks</hi> derives its name.</p>
                <p>In the Linnaean system these fishes formed three genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigła, Cottus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scorpaena,</hi> groups which have
                    been considerably subdivided by Cuvier, who has moreover<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192940051" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0051-0173"/> added to them a certain
                    portion of the genus <hi rend="italic">Gaste-TOsteus,</hi> or stickle-back
                    tribe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Trigla,</hi> Linn. Here the family character is
                    strongly marked. An enormous sub-orbital covers the entire cheek, and even
                    articulates by means of an immovable suture with the pre-opercle, which in this
                    way possesses no separate movement; the sides of the head are nearly vertical,
                    producing a form approaching that of a cube or of a parallelopiped, and the
                    bones are hard and granulated; the back bears two distinct dorsals, and beneath
                    the pectorals are three free rays; in the interior we find about a dozen caeca,
                    and a broad bilobed swimming bladder.</p>
                <p>This extensive genus has been subdivided by modern writers.</p>

                <p>The common Dactylopterus, or flying fish of the Mediterranean <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trigla</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans,</hi> Linn.), is a species too
                    remarkable for its functions, so opposite to those of its class m general, not
                    to have attracted from an early period the attention of mankind. It is extremely
                    common in the Mediterranean, and has been mentioned by all the authors who have
                    treated of the fishes of that inland sea. lhe ardour with which it is pursued by
                    the dolphins and bonitos, the sudden effort which it makes to escape these
                    predaceous creatures by vaulting into the air, the new and probably unthought of
                    dangers which there await it from gulls and other aquatic birds, render it an
                    object of the highest interest to the unaccustomed landsman, somewhat wearied
                    with the monotony of a sailor’s life. “It is by the extension of the pectoral
                    rays and membrane that the fish is enabled to raise itself from its proper
                    element to the regions of the air, though this is by no means a continual
                    flight, for the utmost it can do is to describe an arch over the surface of the
                    water extending to a distance of about 120 feet, and sufficiently elevated for
                    the fish sometimes to fall on the deck of a large vessel. This power of flight
                    or momentary suspension would be much greater if the pectoral membrane could
                    preserve its humidity longer: this is soon evaporated in the heat of the
                    tropics; and the membrane, as it becomes dry, loses its buoyant power, and the
                    fish falls. They are sometimes so numerous as to afford much pleasure to the
                    spectator by their repeated flights; and at particular times, especially on the
                    approach of rough weather, in the night, numbers of them may be seen, by the
                    phosphoric light they emit, marking their arched passages in apparent streams of
                    fire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Griffith’s <hi

                <p>It is singular that the species to which we now allude <hi rend="italic"
                    >(D.</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans),</hi> though so frequent in the
                    Mediterranean, should be almost entirely unknown along the oceanic coasts of
                    Europe. Still more singular is it, in relation to that exclusion, that it should
                    at the same time be found across the Atlantic, and spreading not only along all
                    the central and southern shores of the New World, but extending even as far
                    north as the chilly waters of Newfoundland. The great Gulf Stream may however
                    prove influential in the northern distribution of many western species.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this notice by observing, that the fish in question measures
                    about a foot in length; it is brown above, reddish below, with blackish fins,
                    variously spotted with blue. Its most formidable weapon of offence consists of
                    the long and pointed spine of the opercle, which it can raise and render almost
                    perpendicular to its body. With this organ it is easy to conceive that it may
                    produce serious, or even dangerous wounds; and we therefore wonder the less that
                    a poet like Oppian should have declared them mortal.</p>

                    dark-coloured fish, four or five inches in length, and frequent in most of the
                    streams of Europe and the north of Asia. It usually lies concealed beneath
                    stones, from whence it darts with great rapidity upon its prey. It is said to be
                    extremely prolific; and the female, when with spawn, becomes so greatly
                    enlarged, that her ovaries protrude like mammae. The bullhead, like the salmon,
                    has a reddish hue when boiled. It affords a good and wholesome food, much sought
                    after by the mountain tribes of several countries; yet Pallas assures<pb

                <p>These are small fishes of a repulsive aspect, to be almost inferred from the

                    incapable of aiding the fish in leaving its native element. Mr Bennet was
                    assured by the fishermen of Ceylon, where the species is very common, that they
                    had never seen it fly.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Apistus, Cuv.,</hi> resembles <hi rend="italic"

                    pectorals are all branched. The distinguishing character, however, consists in
                    the strong spine of the sub-orbitals, which on being projected from the cheek
                    becomes a dangerous weapon; the more so, as in a state of repose it is scarcely
                    perceptible. In fact, their generic name is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μίΐϋτος,</hi><hi rend="italic">perfidious.</hi> Μ. Ehrenberg has made us
                    acquainted with a species from the Red Sea, which greatly resembles the Indian
                    <hi rend="italic">Woorah-minoo</hi> described by Russel. It measures about four
                    inches in length, and is of a reddish colour on the back, and whitish on the

                    the sea was agitated, several fell into his vessel. As it is the only flying
                    fish of the Red Sea, and is extremely abundant along those desert coasts over
                    which the Israelites so long wandered, he has conjectured that the food

                <p>The fantastic shape and almost monstrous aspect of these fishes are alone
                    sufficient to distinguish them from every other genus. It is scarcely possible
                    by words alone to convey an idea of their extraordinary forms. They inhabit the
                    Indian seas, and one of the most remarkable is <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filamentorum,</hi> a species from the Isle of France, discovered

                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Synanceia</hi> of Bloch and Schneider is quite as

                    Scorpaenae in ugliness. Their heads are rough, tuberculated, but not compressed,
                    and frequently enveloped in a loose and fungous skin; their pectoral rays are
                    all branched, their dorsals entire; they have no teeth either on the vomer or
                    palatines.</p>
                <p>N. <hi rend="italic">horrida,</hi> as the title implies, exhibits by no meansan
                    inviting aspect. It is named <hi rend="italic">Ihan-swangi,</hi> or sorcerer
                    fish, by the Malays. &gt;S ’. <hi rend="italic">brachio</hi> of Cuv. is the
                    species called fi-fi, or <hi rend="italic">hideous,</hi> by the Negroes of the
                    Isle of France, who hold it in great abhorrence. In fact, nothing can be
                    conceived more frightful. At first sight, no one would consider it a fish, but
                    rather as a mass or unformed lump of corrupted jelly. “Totum corpus,” says
                    Gommerson, “muco squalidum et quasi ulcerosum.” Its head and members seem
                    enveloped in a sack of thick, soft, spongy skin, warty and wrinkled like that of
                    a leper, and irregularly blotted over with various tints of brown and grey.
                    Sometimes it appears entirely black; but it is always gluey and disgusting to
                    the touch. The little eyes are scarcely discernible in the large cavernous head.
                    This species is said to possess great tenacity of life, and survives for a long
                    time out of the water. The skin, in fact, forms a little ring like that of <hi

                    opercle, through which the fish can respire at pleasure, leaving the remainder
                    of the cover closed, and the branchiae consequently unexposed to desiccation.
                    The inhabitants of the Isle of France regard it rather as a reptile than a fish;
                    and they fear what they call its sting (that is, the wound inflicted by its
                    spines) more than that of snakes or scorpions.</p>

                    in the angle of which some small soft rays lie concealed; head large and mailed;
                    front gibbous; mouth large; small and close-set teeth in the jaws and palatines,
                    but none upon the vomer; eight branchial rays.</p>
                <p>Of this remarkable genus there is only a single species known, a small fish of a
                    silvery whiteness, measuring about six inches in length. It inhabits the seas of
                    Japan. See Plate CCXCIX. fig. 8.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Gasterosteus, Cuv.</hi> Cheeks mailed, but the head
                    neither spined nor tuberculated, as in the preceding genera. The special
                    characters consist in the freedom of the dorsal spines, which do not form a fin,
                    and in the pelvis being united to larger humerais than usual, thus furnishing
                    the abdomen with a kind of bony cuirass. The ventrals, placed posterior to the
                    pectorals, are reduced almost to a single· spine. There are only three branchial
                    rays.</p>
                <p>The species are small fishes familiarly known under the name of Stickle-backs
                    (Scotice, <hi rend="italic">Eenticles),</hi> extremely common in all the fresh
                    waters of Europe. Gesner indeed asserted that they did not occur in Switzerland;
                    but the contrary has been long since ascertained. Our most common species is 6

                    CCXCIX. fig. 9), under which name, however, it is supposed that more than a
                    single kind ha’s been confounded. It is an active and greedy little fish,
                    extremely destructive of the fry of other species, and consequently injurious in
                    ponds where these are sought to be preserved. Mr Henry Baker informs us that it
                    will spring not less than a foot perpendicularly out of the water, and to a much
                    greater distance in an oblique direction, when it desires to overcome any
                    opposing obstacle. “It is scarcely to be conceived,” he adds, “what damage these
                    little fish do, and how greatly detrimental they are to the increase of all the
                    fish in general among whicĥ they live; for it is with the utmost industry,
                    sagacity, and greediness that they seek out and destroy all the young fry that
                    come in their way, which are pursued with the utmost eagerness, and swallowed
                    down without distinction, provided they are not too large; and in proof of this,
                    I must assert that a bannstic-kle which I kept for some time, did, on the 4th of
                    May, devour, in five hours’ time, seventy-four young dace, which were about a
                    quarter of an inch long, and of the thickness of a horse-hair. Two days after it
                    swallowed sixty-two; and would, I am persuaded, have eat as many every day,
                    could I have procured them for it.” The stickle-back sometimes swarms in
                    prodigious numbers. Pennant states, that at Spalding, in Lincolnshire, there are
                    once in seven years amazing shoals, which appear in the Welland, coming up the
                    river in the form of a vast column. This concourse is supposed to arise from the
                    multitudes which have been washed out of the fens by the floods of several
                    years, and which collect in deep holes, till, overcharged with numbers, they are
                    obliged to attempt a change of place. The quantity may perhaps be conceived from
                    the tact, that a man employed in collecting them gained for a considerable time
                    four shillings a day by selling them at the rate of a halfpenny a bushel. <hi

                <p>.We shall here conclude our exposition of the family with mailed cheeks.</p>
                <p>FAMILY III—SCIAENIDAE.</p>
                <p>This family is closely related to the Percidae, and exhibits almost all the same
                    combinations of external characters, especially the dentations of the
                    pre-opercle, and the opercular spines; but the Sciaenidae have never any teeth
                    either on the vomer or palatines; the bones of the face and cranium are
                    generally cavernous, and the muzzle more or less gibbous; a form rarely observed
                    among the Percidae. The vertical fins are frequently somewhat scaly.</p>
                <p>Even in its interior organization our present family bears a considerable
                    resemblance to the perches; but there are greater variations, and especially a
                    more complicated structure of the swimming bladder. In several species that
                    organ is furnished with a multitude of branched appendages (See Plate CCXCVII.
                    figs. 6, 7, 8); and although we cannot trace in it any connection with the
                    exterior, yet when we consider that many of the Sciaenidae are more remarkable
                    even than the gurnards for the production of extraordinary sounds, it is
                    difficult to believe that the peculiar structure of the swimming bladder is not
                    in some way connected with their utterance. The Sciaenidae are almost as
                    numerous as the perches; they are characterised in a great measure by similar
                    habits, and present the same advantages to the human race. They almost all
                    afford excellent eating; of several, indeed, the flavour is exquisite; and a few
                    are of great size. The famous <hi rend="italic">maigre,</hi> for example (*S <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. <hi rend="italic">aquila,</hi> Cuv.), commonly
                    weighs about sixty pounds, and sometimes attains to the length of six feet.</p>

                    Cuv.</hi> Head gibbous, supported by cavernous bones; two dorsals, or one deeply
                    emarginate, with its softer portion much longer than the spinous; a short anal
                    fin; a dentated pre-opercle; an opercle terminated by points; heven branchial
                    rays.</p>
                <p>The species bear a great resemblance to perch, except that they want the teeth
                    upon the palate. Their whole head is scaly, their swimming bladder frequently
                    furnished with remarkable appendages, and the stony bones of the ear are larger
                    than in most fishes. One of the most remarkable is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maigre</hi> above alluded to (N. <hi rend="italic">aquila),</hi> called <hi
                    rend="italic">Umbrina</hi> by the Romans, and held in high esteem even at the
                    present day. (Plate CCXCIX. fig. 10.) It is a rare fish on the outer coasts of
                    Europe, and disappears almost entirely towards the north. The only example with
                    which we are acquainted of its appearance in the northern parts of our own
                    country is recorded by Dr Patrick Neill.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    It was caught off Ugea in Northmavine, Shetland, in November 1819, and was first
                    observed by the fishermen while endeavouring to escape from a seal. It measured
                    five feet four inches in length, and when lifted into the boat, made its usual
                    “purring sound.” Other instances are mentioned by Mr Yarrell. It is, however,
                    extremely common in many parts of the Mediterranean, especially along the Roman
                    states. Paul Jovius mentions that many are taken there at the mouths of rivers,
                    along with sturgeons. They swim in troops, and are said to utter at times a
                    singular low bellowing beneath the waters. It is recorded that three fishermen,
                    guided by this sound, dropt their net on one occasion so successfully as to
                    secure twenty fine fish at a single throw. The noise may be heard at a depth of
                    twenty fathoms, and is often very perceptible when the ear is placed upon the
                    gunnel of the boat. Its tone seems to vary, as some have compared it to a dull
                    buzzing, others to a sharp whistle. Some of the fishermen allege that the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192940090" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0090-0176"/>males alone are
                    musical during spawning time, and that it is quite possible to capture them
                    without any bait, merely by imitating this peculiar sound. One alluded to by
                    Cuvier as having been entangled in a net spread along the shore at Dieppe, was
                    at first found sleeping; but on being handled, it roused itself so suddenly, and
                    with such violence, as to precipitate the fisherman into the water, and force
                    him to call for assistance .before he could become its master. High, though of
                    course imaginary virtues, were formerly attributed to the stones which occur in
                    the ear of this, as of other osseous fishes. They were worn on the neck, set in
                    gold; and Belon says they were called <hi rend="italic">colicstones,</hi> being
                    renowned for the cure, and even prevention, of that complaint. It was necessary,
                    however, that they should be received as a gift,—such as were purchased being
                    found to lose their virtue.</p>
                <p>The species above mentioned belongs to the genus Scι- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >aena</hi> proper of Cuvier, a subdivision characterised by the feebleness of
                    the anal spines, and by the want of canine teeth and barbles.</p>
                <p>Other subdivisions of the principal genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Sciaena</hi> are
                    as follows :— <hi rend="smallcaps">Otolithus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ancylodon</hi> are foreign groups (from India and America), which we shall
                    merely name. <hi rend="smallcaps">Corvina</hi> of Cuvier differs from Sciaena
                    proper chiefly in the much greater strength of the second anal spine. An
                    abundant species in the Mediterranean is the <hi rend="italic">C. nigra,</hi> of
                    a silvery brown colour, with the ventral and anal fins black. It occurs in salt
                    marshes and the sea, but does not appear to ascend rivers. It is less esteemed
                    than the maigre, but is not unfrequently sold for that fish in the Italian
                    markets. <hi rend="smallcaps">Johnius</hi> of Bloch is closely allied to the
                    preceding. We here figure as an example of that minor group, the <hi
                    rend="italic">C. dentex</hi> of Cuv., a species from St Domingo. (Plate CCXCIX.
                    fig. 12.) Several of the fishes used as food in India belong to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Johnius.</hi> Their flesh is light, but not highly flavoured. They
                    are called <hi rend="italic">τvhitings</hi> by the English in Bengal. The
                    species are tolerably numerous, and inhabit both seas and rivers. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Umbrina</hi> of Cuvier is distinguished from the other Sciaenae
                    by bearing a barble on the symphysis of the lower jaw. (Ibid. fig. 11.) The
                    species represented (<hi rend="italic">U. coroides)</hi> is a native of Brazil.
                    The bearded Umbrina (<hi rend="italic">lJ. vulgaris,</hi> Cuv.), a species
                    frequent on the coasts of France, Italy, and Spain, was captured in the river
                    Eye in 1827, as recorded in the minute-book of the Linnaean Society. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pogonias,</hi> Lacépède, resembles the preceding; but it is
                    furnished with several barbles instead of one. The species are remarkable for
                    their size, some of them weighing occasionallyaboveahundred pounds, and for the
                    singular sounds uttered by them, and which have gained them the vulgar name of
                    <hi rend="italic">drums.</hi> Mr John White, an American lieutenant, who (in
                    1824) published a Voyage to the China Seas, relates, that being at the mouth of
                    the river Cambodia, himself and crew were greatly astonished by certain
                    extraordinary sounds, which were heard from around and beneath the vessel. They
                    resembled a combination of the base of an organ, the sound of bells, and the
                    guttural cries of a large frog, with certain tones, which the imagination might
                    attribute to a gigantic harp. It might almost have been said that the vessel
                    trembled at those uncertain sounds. For some time they increased, and finally
                    formed a loud and universal chorus, the entire length of the vessel, and on
                    either side. In proportion as they ascended the river the mysterious sounds
                    diminished, and finally altogether ceased. The interpreter gave the information
                    that they were produced by a troop of fishes of a flattened oval form, which
                    possess the faculty of adhering firmly to various bodies by their mouths. A
                    similar phenomenon was noticed by the illustrious Humboldt in the South Seas,
                    although he was unable at the time to divine the cause. It would, as Cuvier has
                    remarked, be an object of curious research to discover by what organ these
                    sounds are produced. We have already mentioned, that the majority of the
                    Sciaenidae, especially such as are the most remarkable for the utterance of the
                    sounds in question, have large swimming bladders, furnished with strong muscles.
                    In some species the organ is characterised by prolongations, more or less
                    complicated, which even penetrate the intervals of the ribs. It must, however,
                    be borne in mind that these swimming bladders have no communication with the
                    intestinal canal, nor in general with any part of the exterior. The example of
                    the genus here figured is <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    splendour of their colours, which are in general extremely brilliant. They may
                    be perceived swimming about incessantly, and with great vivacity, among the
                    rocks, and in the watery pools left by the ebbing tide. Although for the most
                    part eatable, none of the species furnishes an important article of consumption,
                    on account of the smallness of their size, and their not occurring in numerous
                    shoals.</p>
                <p>FAMILY IV—SPARIÐAE.</p>
                <p>The genera of this family, like those of the Sciaenidae, have the palate
                    destitute of teeth, and in their general forms, as well as in several
                    particulars of their organization, they bear a strong alliance to that family;
                    but they have no scales upon the fins. Their muzzle is not gibbous, nor the

                    spines to the opercle. The pylorus is furnished with caecal appendages. None of
                    the species possesses more than six rays to the branchiae. They are further
                    divisible according to the form of their teeth.</p>

                    notices of the Sargi are contained in ancient authors. Aelian and Oppian inform
                    us that the male is polygamous, and fights with great fury against his own sex

                <p>The same authors attribute to it a feeling still more extraordinary,—a lively
                    passion for goats, which it exhibits by always swimming with great rapidity
                    towards those animals, and indulging in playful gambols before them. So blind
                    was this passion, that a fisherman (it was so alleged) might catch as many as he
                    pleased by disguising himself with the skin and horns of a goat,'and scattering
                    in the water flour steeped in goats’ broth. We have somewhere seen a doggrel
                    rhyme in allusion to this strange and foundationless fancy (it may have been an
                    attempted translation of an ancient epigram), in which it was expressed that the
                    Sargus</p>
                <p>Went courting sŉe-goats on the grassy shore, Horning those husbands who had horns
                    before.</p>
                <p>The best-known species inhabits the Mediterranean. It is the »S'. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pondeletii</hi> of Cuv. (Plate CCC. fig. 12.) The American shores
                    produce several others, one of which <hi rend="italic">(S. οvis)</hi> is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">sheeps-head</hi> by the Americans. Dr Mitchell speaks in
                    the most eulogistic terms of the superexcellence of its flesh, and of the high
                    esteem in which it is held at the tables of New York. It yields in his opinion
                    to few fishes, and is worthy of being served at the most sumptuous
                    entertainments. The price varies from a dollar to a dollar and a half for a
                    middle-sized individual, and above that size the price ranges even so high as
                    from four to seven pounds sterling. They sometimes weigh from fourteen to
                    fifteen pounds. The fishery of this species forms an object of importance along
                    the coasts of the state of New York. It approaches those of Long Island in the
                    hot season from the month of June till the middle of September, after which it
                    seems to seek retirement in the deep abysses of the ocean. As they swim in
                    troops, they may be advantageously fished for with the net, and many hundreds
                    are sometimes taken at a single cast. With the great nets used at Rayner town,
                    and the two islands, thousands are drawn ashore. They are immediately packed in
                    ice, and despatched during the cool of the night to the markets of New York. It
                    is difficult to take the <hi rend="italic">sheep s-head</hi> with a line,
                    because it contrives to snap the very hooks asunder with its cutting teeth.</p>

                <p>The species of this genus are numerous, and extended through many seas. Those of
                    the Mediterranean are only two in number, and are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daurades</hi> by the French, no doubt from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurata,</hi> a term applied to them by ancient authors. The Greeks named them
                    Chrysophris, which signifies golden eye-brow, in allusion to the brilliant spot
                    of gold which the common species bears between its eyes. That the <hi

                    >Chrysophris</hi> of the Greeks, may be inferred from a passage in Pliny, which
                    is obviously borrowed from Aristotle, and where the former word is used as the
                    translation of the latter. According to Columella, the Aurata was among the
                    number of the fishes brought up by the Romans in their <hi rend="italic"
                    >vivaria</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the inventor of these vivaria, one
                    Sergius Orata, is supposed to have derived his surname from the fish in
                    question. Aelian tells us that the Chrysophris is the most timid of all fishes,
                    and that branches of poplars planted in the sand during a reflux so terrified a
                    party of these fishes which were carried upwards by the flux, that in the
                    succeeding reflux they did not dare to pass the poplars, but allowed themselves
                    to be taken by the hand.</p>

                    Cuv.</p></note> This fish seldom quits the vicinity of the shore, and grows
                    extremely fat in the salt ponds. We owe to Duhamel whatever information we
                    possess regarding its habits. The fishermen informed that author that it
                    agitates the sand forcibly with its tail, so as to discover the shell-fish which
                    may lie beneath concealed. It is extremely fond of muscles, and its near
                    presence is sometimes ascertained by the noise which it makes while breaking
                    their shells with its teeth. It greatly dreads cold, and many were observed to
                    perish during the severe winter of 1766. The Gilt-head is a British species, but
                    of extremely rare occurrence.</p>

                    authors, which appears to be confined chiefly to the Mediterranean. (See Plate

                    mingled in the works both of British and foreign authors with those of certain
                    <hi rend="italic">Pagelli</hi> and other Sparidae. Its history as a British
                    species is obscure. Dr Fleming no doubt records it in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >British Animals,</hi> p. 211; but as he indicates it by “a dark spot at the
                    base of the pectorals,” it is probable that his actual species was <hi

                    >Sparus</hi><hi rend="italic">οrphus</hi> of Linn. Mr Couch, however, observes
                    that it appears on the Cornish coast in moderately deepwater throughout the

                    Pennant also erroneously regarded as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">Sparus

                    concealed by our modern authors under some other name. It is the <hi

                    Mediterranean. They differ from most of their congeners in living entirely on
                    marine plants, such as algae and fuci of various kinds. In accordance with this
                    vegetable diet, their intestinal canal is very long, though they have few
                    appendages around the pylorus. They are celebrated for the beauty of their

                <p>The genera of this family differ from those of the preceding in their upper jaw
                    being capable of projection and retraction, in consequence of the length of the
                    intermaxillary pedicles, which withdraw between the orbits. Their body is sealy
                    like that of <hi rend="italic">Sparus,</hi> of which genus they formed <hi

                <p>As we have nothing of general interest to state regarding the fishes of this
                    comparatively limited group, we shall merely refer, in relation to its general
                    contents, to our <hi rend="italic">Systematic Table</hi> (note to page 165), and
                    proceed to</p>
                <p>FAMILY VI—SQUAMMIPENNES.</p>
                <p>So called because the softer, and frequently also the spinous portions of the
                    dorsal and anal fins are covered with scales, which as it were encrust them, and
                    render their discrimination from the rest of the body by no means easy. This is
                    the most obvious character of these fishes, of which the form is in general much
                    compressed. The intestines are rather long, and the caeca numerous. This family
                    was comprised by Linnaeus in his genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chaetodon,</hi> so
                    called from the long, slender, and hair-like character of the teeth; and the
                    species in general arealike remarkable for their singular forms and splendid
                    colours.</p>
                <p>The seas of the torrid zone have indeed no cause to envy the productions of those
                    famous lands, the shores of which they have so long bathed with their
                    translucent waters. If the equatorial regions of Africa and America possess,
                    among their feathered tribes, the brilliant souimangas, the lustrous humming
                    birds, and the gorgeous chatterers, the intermediate ocean and the Indian seas
                    contain countless thousands of the finny race which surpass even these in
                    splendour. The Chaetodons, in particular, form a family on which nature has
                    bestowed her ornaments with a most lavish hand. The deep purple of the iris, the
                    paler richness of the rose, the azure blue of the “crystalline sky,” the darkest
                    velvet black,—these hues, and many more, are seen commingled with metallic
                    lustre over the pearly surface of this resplendent group. The eye of man
                    receives the greater pleasure from their contemplation, in as far as being of
                    moderate size, and haunting habitually the rocky shores, at no great depth of
                    water, they are seen to sport in the sunbeams, as if desirous to exhibit their
                    splendid liveries to the greatest advantage in the blaze of day.</p>

                    less advanced; the pre-opercle sometimes finely dentated.</p>
                <p>The species resemble each other not only in the more essential characters just
                    stated, but even in the distribution of their markings. The majority, for
                    example, are characterised by a black vertical band, in which the eye is placed.
                    In some we find several additional vertical bands parallel to the one mentioned;
                    in others they are oblique or horizontal. Certain species are distinguished by a
                    filament which results from the prolongation of one or more of the soft rays of
                    the dorsal fin. The genus is very extensive, containing upwards of sixty species
                    even in its restricted constitution. We must here confine ourselves to a slight
                    notice of two or three of these. <hi rend="italic">Chaetodon</hi><hi

                    obtained by MM. Lesson and Garnot at Otaheité. Its sides are mailed or
                    reticulated by a longitudinal series of scales. It measures about six inches in
                    length, and four in height. <hi rend="italic">Ch. lunula,</hi> Cuv. (ibid, fig·

                    intermaxillary bone above, and of the inferior jaw. These parts are united for
                    two thirds of their length by a membrane, so that the mouth is nothing more than
                    a small terminal cleft. The teeth are rather fine and closely set than

                    anciently known. It is a small fish, measuring from six to eight inches in
                    length, and is remarkable for the following peculiarity. It feeds on flies and
                    other winged insects, and when it perceives one of these either hovering over
                    the surface, or settled on a twig or blade of grass, it ejects against it with
                    considerable force a drop of liquid from ist tubular snout, so as to drive it
                    into the water. In shooting at a sitting insect it generally approaches
                    cautiously within a few feet before it explodes the water. Schlosser has
                    described this curious device in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> for 1764, after Hummel, and it has since been confirmed by
                    Reinwardt. It is even said to be an amusement of the Chinese in Java to keep
                    this fish in confinement in a large vessel of water, with a view to observe its
                    dexterity in the practice of this admirable instinct. They fasten a fly or other
                    insect to the side of the vessel, when the Chelmon immediately bombards it with
                    such precision as very rarely to miss the mark. In a state of nature it is said
                    to inhabit both the coasts and rivers of Java. We are as yet acquainted with
                    only one other species of this restricted genus. It is the <hi rend="italic">Ch.

                <p>It is only of late that its characters and history have been rendered in any way
                    clear or satisfactory—a fact the more remarkable when we consider its large
                    size, its singular form, its extreme abundance, and the exquisite flavour of its
                    flesh. In spite of all these circumstances, most modern authors seem to have
                    written regarding it as if they were blindfolded. Bloch regarded it as a
                    northern fish, simply because so far back as 1681 a specimen was thrown ashore
                    on our Yorkshire coast; and Lacépède describes it as an oceanic species. The

                    species has been erroneously multiplied in systematic works. It is twice

                <p>FAMILY VII.—SCOMBERIDAE.</p>
                <p>One of the most useful to the human race of the entire class of fishes, whether
                    we consider their agreeable flavour, their considerable size, or their
                    inexhaustible productive powers. We may mention the mackerel, the tunny, and
                    bonito, as familiar examples.</p>
                <p>When considered isolately, these celcbrated fishes are by no means difficult to
                    characterise. The simple separation of the posterior of the second dorsal, and
                    of those of the anal fin, would of itself suffice; but the species above named
                    are the chiefs of a numerous series of genera and sub-gencra, in which the more
                    typical form gradually alters, and passes insensibly into others which do not
                    exhibit either the character just mentioned, or almost any other by which the
                    principal types arc distinguished. Scales usually very small, causing the
                    greater part of the skin to appear as if entirely smooth; opercular pieces
                    without spines or dentations, and in general numerous caeca ;—these arc almost
                    the only prevailing characters which can be assigned to the family, which at the
                    same time exhibits a likeness in the aspect of its constituent groups which
                    never leaves it. In short, it forms what botanists call a family by series or
                    transition. The majority have the sides of the caudal extremity carinated, or
                    armed with scales or shields, which are themselves carinated; or the terminal
                    rays of the second dorsal or of the anal arc free; or the spiny rays of that
                    dorsal want their uniting membrane. Most frequently the caudal fin is of great
                    size, and corresponding vigour. In the majority, also, the first spiny rays of
                    the anal fin are separated from the others, and form, as it were, a small
                    distinct fin by themselves. But none of these characters is common to the
                    whole.</p>
                <p>We may here group, as forming the <hi rend="smallcaps">First Great Tribe,</hi>
                    those genera of which the <hi rend="italic">anterior dorsal fin is entire, but
                    the terminal rays of the posterior one are detached or isolated, forming what
                    may be called fìnlets or spurious fins (pinnoe spurice).</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Genus Scomber, Cuv.</hi> The mackerels, properly so called,

                    space between the first and second dorsal fin.</p>

                    is blue, crossed by many dark transverse bands, nearly straight in the males,
                    but finely waved in the females. The sides and abdomen are of a silvery hue,
                    glossed with brilliant tints of gold. The name is said to refer to the spotted
                    appearance of the upper parts, and to be derived from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">macularius.</hi> We shall here avail ourselves of Mr Yarrell’s
                    history of this important species.</p>
                <p>“The mackerel was supposed by Anderson, Duhamel, and others, to be a fish of
                    passage, performing, like some birds, certain periodicaI migrations, and making
                    long voyages from north to south at one season of the year, and the reverse at
                    another. It does not appear to have been sufficiently considered, that,
                    inhabiting a medium which varied but little either in its temperature or
                    productions, locally, fishes are removed beyond the influence of the two
                    principal causes which make a temporary change of situation necessary.
                    Independently of the difficulty of tracing the course pursued through so vast an
                    expanse of water, the order of the appearance of the fish at different places on
                    the shores of the temperate and southern parts of Europe is the reverse of that
                    which, according to their theory, ought to have happened. It is known that this
                    fish is now taken, even on some parts of our own coast, in every month of the
                    year. It is probable that the mackerel inhabits almost the whole of the European
                    seas; and the law of nature which obliges them and many others to visit the
                    shallower water of the shores at a particular season, appears to be one of those
                    wise and bountiful provisions of the Creator, by which not only is the species
                    perpetuated with tire greatest certainty, but a large portion of the parent
                    animals are thus brought within the reach of man, who, but for the action of
                    this law, would be deprived of many of those species most valuable to him as
                    food. For the mackerel dispersed over the immense surface of the deep, no
                    effective fishery could be carried on; but, approaching the shore as they do
                    from all directions, and roving along the coast collected in immense shoals,
                    millions are caught, which yet form but a very small portion compared with the
                    myriads that escape.</p>
                <p>“This subject receives farther illustration from a freshwater fish, as stated in
                    the Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii. p. 637: ‘ When the char spawn, they
                    are seen in the shallow parts of the rocky lakes (in which only they are found),
                    and some of the streams that run into them: they are then taken in abundance,
                    but so soon as the spawning is over, they retire into the deepest parts of the
                    lake, and are but rarely caught.’</p>
                <p>“It may be observed farther, that as there is scarcely a month throughout the
                    year in which the fishes of some one or more species are not brought within the
                    reach of man by the operation of the imperative law of nature referred to, a
                    constant succession of wholesome food is thus spread before him, which, in the
                    first instance, costs him little beyond the exercise of his ingenuity and labour
                    to obtain.</p>
                <p>“On the coast of Ireland, the mackerel is taken from he county of Kerry in the
                    west, along the southern shore, eastward to Cork and Waterford; from thence
                    northward to Antrim, and north-west to Londonderry and Donegal. Dr M‘Culloch
                    says it visits some of the lochs of the Western Islands, but is not considered
                    very abundant. On the Cornish coast this fish in some seasons occurs as early as
                    the month of March, and appears to be pursuing a course from west to east. They
                    are plentiful on the Devonshire coast, and swarm in West Bay about June. On the
                    Hampshire and Sussex coast, particularly the latter, they arrive as early as
                    March; and sometimes, as will be shown, even in February: and the earlier in the
                    year the fishermen go to look for them, the farther from the shore do they seek
                    for and find them. Duhamel says the mackerel are caught earlier at Dunkirk than
                    at Dieppe or Havre: ∙ upon our own eastern coast, however, the fishing is later.
                    The fishermen of Lowestoffe and Yarmouth gain their great harvest from the
                    mackerel in May and June. Mr Neill says they occur in the Forth at the end of
                    summer; and Mr Low, in his <hi rend="italic">Fauna Orcadensis,</hi> states that
                    they do not make their appearance there till the last week in July or the first
                    week in August.</p>
                <p>“The mackerel spawns in June; and, according to Bloch, five hundred and forty
                    thousand ova have been counted in one female. I have observed, by the mackerel
                    sent to the London market from the shallow shores of Worthing and its vicinity,
                    that these fish mature and deposit their roe earlier on that flat sandy shore
                    than those caught in the deep water off Brighton. The young mackerel, which are
                    called shiners, are from four to six inches long by the end of August. They are
                    half grown by November; when they retire, says Mr Conch, ‘ to deep water, and
                    are seen no more that winter: but the adult fishes never wholly quit the Cornish
                    coast; and it is common to see some taken with lines in every month of the
                    year.’ Their principal food is probably the fry of other fish; and at Hastings
                    the mackerel follow towards the shore a small species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clupea,</hi> which is there called, in consequence, the mackerel mint. I have
                    been unable hitherto to obtain any specimens of this small fish; but, from
                    various descriptions, I think it is probably the young of the sprat. It is
                    described as being about one inch long in July.</p>
                <p>“The mackerel as feeders are voracious, and their growth is rapid. The ordinary
                    length varies from fourteen to sixteen inches, and their weight is about two
                    pounds each; but they are said to attain the length of twenty inches, with a
                    proportionate increase in weight. The largest fish are not, however, considered
                    the best for the table.</p>
                <p>“As an article of food they are in great request; and those taken in the months
                    of May and June are generally considered to be superior in flavour to those
                    taken either earlier in spring, or in autumn. To be eaten in perfection, this
                    fish should be very fresh. As it soon becomes unfit for food, some facilities in
                    the way of sale have been afforded to the dealers in a commodity so perishable.
                    Mackerel were first allowed to be cried through the streets of London on a
                    Sunday in 1698, and the practice prevails to the present time.</p>
                <p>“At our various fishing towns on the coast, the mackerel season is one of great
                    bustle and activity. The frequent departures and arrivals of boats at this time
                    form a lively contrast to the more ordinary routine of other periods; the high
                    price obtained for the early cargoes, and the large return gained generally from
                    the enormous numbers of this fish sometimes captured in a single night, being
                    the inducement to great exertions. A few particulars from various sources may
                    not be uninteresting.</p>
                <p>“In May 1807, the first Brighton boat-load of mackerel sold at Billingsgate for
                    forty guineas per hundred—seven shillings each, reckoning six score to a
                    hundred; the highest price ever known at that market. The next boat-load
                    produced but thirteen guineas per hundred. Mackerel were so plentiful at Dover
                    in 1808 that they were sold sixty for a shilling. At Brighton, in June of the
                    same year, the shoal of mackerel was so great, that one of the boats had the
                    meshes of her nets so completely occupied by them, that it was impossible to
                    drag them in; the fish and nets, therefore, in the end, sunk together, the
                    fishermen thereby sustaining a loss of nearly sixty pounds, exclusive of what
                    the cargo, could it have been got into the boat, would have produced. The
                    success of the fishery in 1821 was beyond all precedent. The value of the catch
                    of sixteen boats from Lowestoffe, on the 30th of June, amounted to L.5252; and
                    it is supposed that there was no less an amount than L. 14,000 altogether
                    realised by the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940168" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0168-0182"
                    />owners and men concerned in the fishery of the Suffolk coast.<note

                    sketch of the natural history of Yarmouth and its neighbourhood, by C. and J.

                    mackerel were taken there. A last is ten thousand.”</p></note> In March 1833, on
                    a Sunday, four Hastings’ boats brought on shore ten thousand eight hundred
                    mackerel; and the next day two boats brought seven thousand fish. Early in the
                    month of February 1834, one boat’s crew from Hastings cleared L.100 by the fish
                    caught in one night; and a large quantity of very fine mackerel appeared in the
                    London market in the second week of the same month. They were cried through the
                    streets of London three for a shilling on the 14th and 22d of March 1834, and
                    had then been plentiful for a month. The boats engaged in fishing are usually
                    attended by other fast-sailing vessels, which are sent away with the fish taken.
                    From some situations these vessels sail away direct for the London market; at
                    others they make for the nearest point from which they can obtain land-carriage
                    for their fish. From Hastings and other fishing towns on the Sussex coast the
                    fish are brought to London by vans, which travel up during the night.</p>
                <p>“The most common mode of fishing for mackerel, and the way in which the greatest
                    numbers are taken, is by drift-nets. The drift-net is twenty feet deep, by one
                    hundred and twenty feet long; well corked at the top, but without lead at the
                    bottom. They are made of small fine twine, which is tanned of a reddish-brown
                    colour, to preserve it from the action of the sea-water; and it is thereby
                    rendered much more durable. The size of the mesh is about two and a half inches,
                    or rather larger. Twelve, fifteen, and sometimes eighteen of these nets are
                    attached lengthways, by tying along a thick rope, called the driftrope, and at
                    the ends of each net, to each other. When arranged for depositing in the sea, a
                    large buoy attached to the end of the drift-rope is thrown overboard, the vessel
                    is put before the wind, and, as she sails along, the rope, with the nets thus
                    attached, is passed over the stern into the water till the whole of the nets are
                    run out. The net thus deposited hangs suspended in the water perpendicularly
                    twenty feet deep from the drift-rope, and extending from three quarters of a
                    mile to a mile, or even a mile and a half, depending on the number of nets
                    belonging to the party or company engaged in fishing together. When the whole of
                    the nets are thus handed out, the drift-rope is shifted from the stern to the
                    bow of the vessel, and she rides by it as if at anchor. The benefit gained by
                    the boat’s hanging at the end of the drift-rope is, that the net is kept
                    strained in a straight line, which, without this pull upon it, would not be the
                    case. The nets arc shot in the evening, and sometimes hauled once during the
                    night, at others allowed to remain in the water all night. The fish roving in
                    the dark through the water, hang in the meshes of the net, which are large
                    enough to admit them beyond the gill-covers and pectoral fins, but not large
                    enough to allow the thickest part of the body to pass through. In the morning
                    early, preparations are made for hauling the nets. A capstan on the deck is
                    manned, about which two turns of the drift-rope are taken. One man stands
                    forward to untie the upper edge of each net from the drift-rope, which is called
                    casting off the lashings; others hand in the net with the fish caught, to which
                    one side of the vessel is devoted; the other side is occupied by the drift-rope,
                    which is wound in by the men at the capstan. The whole of the net in, and the
                    fish secured, the vessel runs back into harbour with her fish; or, depositing
                    them on board some other boat in company, that carries for the party to the
                    nearest market, the fishing vessel remains at sea for the next night’s
                    operation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">British Fishes,</hi> p. 121.</p></note></p>
                <p>Another mode of fishing is with a hook and line, angled with a coarse rod, from a
                    boat under rapid sail. A slice from the mackerel’s own body affords an excellent
                    bait, and even a piece of scarlet cloth or leather is often used with great
                    success. The line is weighed down by a heavy plummet; and when the fish are
                    numerous, two men will thus capture from 500 to 1000 in a single day. It is a
                    singular fact, that the common mackerel has no swimming bladder, although that
                    organ is found in several closely allied species. What necessity of nature,
                    Cuvier asks, can require it in the one, and not in the other? What can have
                    produced it? These are great problems, both in the study of final causes, and in
                    the general philosophy of nature.</p>

                    the most remote antiquity; and the city of Byzantium was more especially
                    enriched by it. The shoals which entered the Bosphorus were said to meet near
                    Chalcedon with a white rock, which so terrified them that they turned into the
                    Gulf of Byzantium, now the port of Constantinople. It was, according to Cuvier,
                    in consequence of this abundance of tunnies, that the gulf in question received
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Horn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the oracle of Apollo designated Chalcedon as the <hi rend="italic">City of the
                    Blind,</hi> because its founders did not perceive the inferiority of its site in
                    relation to these valued fish. Gibbon, however, tells us, that “the curve which
                    it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag, or, as it should seem,
                    with more propriety, to that of an ox. The epithet <hi rend="italic">golden</hi>
                    was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant
                    countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople.” The same
                    prodigious quantities of the tunny are still seen there as in ancient times.
                    According to Syllius, twenty vessels might be filled by a single cast of the
                    net; and they may frequently be taken by the hand without the aid of nets. When
                    ascending towards the port, they may be killed with stones; and even women take
                    them in quantities, merely by suspending a large basket by a cord from the
                    windows.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    fishery was of still more ancient practice in the West. The Phoenicians
                    established it at a very early period on the coasts of Spain, both within and
                    beyond the columns of Hercules. It is thus that we find the tunny on the
                    Phoenician medals of Cadiz and Carteia. Its salted preparation was known to the

                    Mediterranean. The species sometimes wanders along the British shores; and a
                    fine specimen, measuring nine feet in length, was killed in the beautiful
                    Gairloch, opposite Greenock, in July 1831. It is preserved in the Andersonian
                    Museum, Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The fish known to navigators under the name of <hi rend="italic">Bonito</hi>
                    belongs to our present genus. It is the <hi rend="italic">Th. pelamys</hi> of
                    Cuv. and sometimes occurs along the British shores. It resembles the tunny in
                    form, but is a great deal smaller, seldom exceeding the length of thirty inches.
                    It is celebrated in the tropical seas for its eager pursuit of the flying fish.
                    The bonito of the Mediterranean, however, be it remembered, belongs to the
                    following genus.</p>

                    where it is called bonito, <hi rend="italic">Auxis vulgaris,</hi> Cuv. It is of
                    a fine blue colour above, with oblique blackish lines. The flesh is red and
                    coarse. We have eaten it during a voyage to Genoa, in the course of which the
                    vessel was followed by a flock for an entire day. We struck them with a small

                    here merely state, that it is distinguished from the tunnies by its strong,

                    of the species, the <hi rend="italic">Scomber</hi><hi rend="italic">sarda</hi>
                    of Bloch, common in the Mediterranean. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cybium</hi> has the body elongated, without corselet, the teeth large,
                    compressed, cutting, in the form of lancets. On the palatines there are only the
                    close-set kind of teeth. The species inhabit the warmer parts both of the
                    Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and some of them attain a great size. The genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thyrsites</hi> differs from the preceding in having the
                    anterior teeth longer than the others, as well as the palatines being furnished
                    with pointed teeth.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Gempylus</hi> is allied in many respects to that
                    last named, but it wants the teeth upon the palate, and the rentrais are almost
                    imperceptible. See Plate CCCII. fig. 6, where we have represented <hi

                <p>We shall here briefly notice two genera which cannot be better placed than in

                    last-named groups in almost every thing, except that they entirely want the
                    finlets, or false fins, and even the soft rays of the dorsal. There is merely a
                    vestige of the ventral fins. It is a singular thing, as Cuvier has observed,
                    that a fish so generally met with as the great <hi rend="italic">Lepidopus
                    argyreus</hi> of the European seas (there is no other species), so handsome, and
                    so large, should have remained unknown to naturalists so recently as the end of
                    the eighteenth century, and that it should have been afterwards successively
                    described by various writers, under a new name, and by each in ignorance of the
                    labours of his predecessor. If we figure to ourselves a large and broad riband
                    of silver, swimming with a wavy motion through the water, and casting from it in
                    its progress the most beautiful reflections of light, we may form some notion of

                    of four inches and a half; it gradually decreased from the vent to the
                    commencement of the anal fin, where it measured only two inches in depth; at the
                    end of that fin the form was nearly round, and the diameter only half an inch.
                    The weight, without the intestines, was about six pounds. Montagu’s specimen was
                    taken in Salcomb Harbour, on the coast of South Devon, on the 4th June 1808. It
                    was swimming with astonishing velocity, <hi rend="italic">with its head above

                    by the blow of an oar. It occurs occasionally on most of the European coasts; is
                    more frequent in some parts of the Mediterranean; and has been captured as far
                    south as the Cape of Good Hope. See our representation on Plate CCCII. fig.
                    4.</p>
                <p>The other genus to which we have alluded, that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Trichiurus,</hi> Linn., resembles the preceding in its head and teeth, but it
                    has not even a vestige of a ventral fin; the anal is replaced by a series of
                    very small spines, which scarcely project above the skin, and the tail
                    terminates in a filament or lengthened point, without any caudal fin. We here
                    figure (Plate CCCII. fig. 8) an Indian species, named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trichiurus savala</hi> by Cuvier. We believe it is synonymous with <hi

                    contains the sword-fish, and a few other species, which modern Ichthyologists,
                    anterior to the time of Cuvier, placed too much apart from each other, solely
                    because some were possessed of ventral fins, while in others those parts were
                    wanting, “difference,” observes our author, “qui ne sert qu’à prouver de plus en

                    in the parasitical animals by which they are infested; but as they differ in
                    wanting the false fins, ah actual resemblances have been set aside, at least in

                    to the family Scomberidae, and approaches the tunnies especially in the extreme
                    smallness of the scales, the carination of the sides of the tail, the strength
                    of the caudal fin, and the whole of the interior organization. The distinctive
                    character consists in the lengthened beak or sword-like prolongation of the
                    muzzle or upper jaw, which forms a powerful weapon of offence, and enables them
                    to attack and overcome the largest marine animals. This beak is composed chiefly
                    of the vomer and intermaxillaries, strengthened towards the base by the ethmoid,
                    the frontals, and maxillaries. The branchiae are not divided like the toothing
                    of a comb, but formed each of two large parallel plates, of which the surface is
                    reticulated. The rapidity of their course is excessive, the quality of their
                    flesh excellent.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief indication of the characters of the genus <hi rend="italic"

                    formidable weapon with which the front is armed. So remarkable a creature in
                    size and structure could indeed have scarcely remained unknown at any period.
                    All ancient writers within whose province it could possibly fall, speak of it in
                    such a manner as clearly to prove an intimate knowledge of its nature. They
                    describe its offensive weapon, the blows which it inflicts, the dreadful combats
                    which it sustains, the attacks which are made upon it, and the stratagems by
                    which, in spite of its strength, it is lured to its destruction. Although, in
                    relation to its European distribution, the Mediterranean may be said to be its
                    chief dominion, yet the older individuals especially often enter the ocean, and
                    astonish the natives of colder climes by spreading along the northern shores. It
                    has been frequently captured on the British coasts. It even enters the Baltic,
                    and has been seen near Lubeck, of an enormous size.<note anchored="true"

                    noticed by Dr Mitchell, in his description of the fishes of New York, and for
                    this reason Baron Cuvier does not admit that it crosses the Atlantic. It is,
                    however, fully described by Dr Smith, in his <hi rend="italic">Fishes of
                    Massachusetts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same writer assures us, on
                    the authority of an old pilot, that the swordfish is by no means uncommon off
                    that portion of the American shore. It cannot, however, be traced far south in
                    any part of the western world; whilst, like many of the Mediterranean species,
                    it advances along the African coast as far as the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>The fish now alluded to is the <hi rend="italic">Xiphias</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gladius,</hi> Linn. (Plate CCCII. fig. 7.) Its horizontal snout is flat and
                    cutting, like the blade of a sword. The sides of its tail are strongly
                    carinated∙ It has but one dorsal fin, which rises both before and behind, but of
                    which the middle portion in the adults becomes in some manner so worn away, that
                    an appearance is at last presented of two dorsal fins. This will be perfectly
                    understood by comparing the figure last referred to, with fig. 10 of the same
                    plate, where we have represented the young of the present species.<note

                <p>Sword-fish, though by no means uncommon, are seldom captured, owing to their
                    extreme vigilance. Captain Beechey informs us, that while in the Pacific Ocean,
                    near Easter Island, “as the line was hauling in, a large swordfish bit at the
                    tin case which contained our thermometer, but fortunately failed in carrying it
                    off.” Their mode of capture in the Mediterranean may be likened to whale fishing
                    in miniature, and is said to be a veryamusing and exciting sport. A watchman
                    placed upon a mast, or standing on the summit of a neighbouring rock, gives
                    warning by signal when he sees a fish approach. The fishermen then row towards
                    it; and, being so skilful as frequently to strike the fish from a great
                    distance, they throw a harpoon into it attached to a long line. An arduous
                    struggle then commences, during which the aggressors are sometimes pulled about
                    by the fish for many hours before they can get it into the boat.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude Dy observing,’ that the sword-fish is not only one of the
                    largest species of the European seas, attaining sometimes to a length of fifteen
                    feet, but that it is also much esteemed as an article of diet. When young,
                    especially, the flesh is white, firm, and of excellent flavour.</p>

                <p>This genus contains that large and showy species (ZZ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >indiens,</hi> Plate CCCII∙ fig. 9) known to the Malays by the name of fan-fish,
                    and called by the corresponding title of sail-fish by the Dutch. It sometimes
                    attains to so great a size as to have been compared to a small whale. When
                    swimming near the surface, its dorsal fin may be seen projecting, from the
                    distance of a league at sea. Many years ago a letter was addressed to Sir Joseph
                    Banks by the captain of an East Indiaman, containing an account of the
                    astonishing strength occasionally exerted by this species. The bottom of the
                    ship was pierced through by it in such a manner that the snout or sword was
                    buried almost toits base, and the animal itself was killed by the violence of
                    the blow. Accidents of a similar nature have also occurred with the common
                    sword-fish; and it is the opinion of naturalists that both species mistake our
                    wooden walls for the vast abdomen of some great cetaceous animal which they
                    desire to encounter and destroy.</p>

                    his return from the Cape to France in 1829. It measured only four inches in
                    length, and possesses certain special characters, which lead to the conclusion
                    that, notwithstanding its minute size, it ought not to be regarded as the young
                    of any previously described species. See Plate CCCII. fig. 11.</p>
                <p>We now enter upon a group of genera which form the <hi rend="smallcaps">Second

                <p>The Scomberidae, as has been already remarked, have the caudal fin in general
                    very strong, although the other vertical fins are often extremely feeble. We
                    have now noticed <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940207"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-0207-0185"/>the genera of the first great tribe, in which the
                    posterior portion of the second dorsal and of the anal fin possess no continuous
                    membrane between its rays, which thus remain free and disconnected, under the

                    keeping company with ships at sea, and frequently swimming beneath their bows.
                    It would seem, from early indications of a similar instinct, to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pompilius</hi> of the ancients, described as pointing out the way
                    to dubious or embarrassed sailors, and as announcing the vicinity of land by its
                    sudden disappearance. It was thus regarded as a sacred fish. The other story of
                    its serving as a guide to the shark does not appear to have been transmitted to
                    us from so remote a source. It is not mentioned even by the Ichthyologists of
                    the sixteenth century; and Cuvier regards as the first allusion to it, that of
                    Dutertre in his <hi rend="italic">Description of the Antilles,</hi> printed in
                    1667. Since that period it has been carefully repeated by all voyagers and
                    compilers; and Osbeck even makes it a subject of pious reflection on the
                    wonderful ways of Providence. We are told by a greater than Osbeck that “they
                    that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see
                    the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep but the fact in the present
                    instance seems reducible to this, that the pilot accompanies both ships and
                    sharks, sometimes swimming before, sometimes behind, for the sake of preying
                    upon whatever may be thrown over board in the one case, or left uneaten in the
                    other. It is true that the shark never attacks it; but it is also true that the
                    hawk does not attack the swallow; and in both instances the reason is the same;
                    the pilot being too nimble for the unwieldy shark in the water, just as the
                    feebler but more agile bird is too swift in its movements for <hi rend="italic"
                    >falco</hi> in the air. It is thus that the apparent alliance of these
                    dissimilar fishes may be explained even upon general principles, to say nothing
                    of Bose’s observation, who assures us that he has seen hundreds of pilot-fish,
                    that they always keep at a respectful distance from the shark, and swim about
                    swiftly in different directions, that they may more certainly avoid it. If any
                    food be thrown over board, the pilot stops to seize it, and abandons both the
                    shark and vessel. Geoffroy no doubt tells a story of two pilot-fish having been
                    seen to take a great deal of trouble, swimming to and fro, in order to conduct a
                    shark towards a <hi rend="italic">baited</hi> book; but admitting the truth of
                    the details, it is clear, that whatever advantage might eventually accrue to the
                    conductors, the probable result to the shark was a cruel death, and one is
                    consequently the more inclined to admire how the narrative itself should find
                    place in a Memoir <hi rend="italic">Sur l’affection mutuelle</hi> des quelques

                    illustration of the subject, we shall subjoin a short extract from a recent
                    publication, Dr Aleyen’s <hi rend="italic">Reise</hi><hi rend="italic">urn
                    die</hi><hi rend="italic">Erde.</hi> “The pilot swims constantly in front of the
                    shark; we ourselves have seen three instances in which the shark was led by the
                    pilot. When the sea-angel neared the ship, the pilot swam close to the snout, or
                    near one of the breast fins of the animal; sometimes he darted rapidly forwards
                    or sidewards, as if looking for something, and constantly went back again to the
                    shark. When we threw overboard a piece of bacon fastened on a great hook, the
                    shark was about twenty paces from the ship. AVith the quickness of lightning the
                    pilot came up, smelt at the dainty, and instantly swam back again to the shark,
                    swimming many times round his snout, and splashing, as if to give him exact
                    information as to the bacon. The shark now began to put himself in motion, the
                    pilot showing him the way, and in a moment he was fast upon the hook. Once we
                    watched a pilot for many days, who kept constantly swimming close before the
                    keel of the ship. The sailors say, as of a thing well known and familiar, that
                    such a fish so situated has lost his shark, and is seeking another. Upon a later
                    occasion, we observed two pilots in sedulous attendance on a blue shark, which
                    we caught in the Chinese Sea. It seems probable that the pilot feeds on the
                    shark’s excrements, keeps his company for that purpose, and directs his
                    operations solely from this selfish view.” On this very singular subject we arc
                    tempted to quote another anecdote, which, notwithstanding what we have said in
                    the text above, if correctly observed and recorded, would certainly indicate
                    something remarkable in the association of these species. The account was
                    furnished to the editor of the English edition of the <hi rend="italic">Animal
                    Kingdom</hi> (vol. x. p. 636), by Colonel Hamilton Smith, an accurate and
                    accomplished naturalist. “Captain Richards, R. N., during his last station in
                    the Mediterranean, saw on a fine day a blue shark, which followed the ship,
                    attracted perhaps by a corpse which had been committed to the waves. After some
                    time a shark-hook, baited with pork, was flung out. The shark, attended by four
                    pilot-fish, <hi rend="italic">Scomber ductor,</hi> repeatedly approached the
                    bait; and every time that he did so, one of the pilots, preceding him, was
                    distinctly seen from the taftrail of the ship to run his snout against the side
                    of the shark’s head, to turn it away. After some farther play, the fish swam off
                    in the wake of the vessel, his dorsal fin being long distinctly visible above
                    the water. “hen he had gone, however, a considerable distance, he suddenly
                    turned round, darted after the vessel, and before the pilot-fish could overtake
                    him and interpose, snapped at the bait and was taken. In hoisting him up, one of
                    the pilots was observed to cling to his side until he was half above water, when
                    it fell off. All the pilot fishes then swam about awhile, as if in search of
                    their friend, with every apparent mark of anxiety and distress, and afterwards
                    darted suddenly down into the depths of the sea. Colonel H. Smith has himself
                    witnessed, with intense curiosity, an event in all respects precisely
                    similar.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The pilot-fish in question is chiefly a Mediterranean species, although it also
                    spreads into distant oceans, having been found by Daldorf under the equator. A
                    great extent of geographical distribution may indeed be expected in reference to
                    a species which is said to suffer itself to be led away immense distances in its
                    eager pursuit of ships. Dutertre records that he saw one which followed his
                    vessel for more than 500 leagues. Whether he kept his eye upon it night and day
                    during all that time, or in what other way he ascertained it to be the same
                    individual throughout so long a traverse, is what he does not state, and we
                    therefore cannot explain. “In the year 1831,” Mr Yarrell observes, “two
                    specimens of pilot-fish were caught on the opposite side of the British Channel,
                    and more than one instance has occurred of their following ships into Guernsey.
                    A few years since, a pair accompanied a ship from the Mediterranean into
                    Falmouth, and were both taken with a net. In January 1831, the Peru, Graham
                    master, put into Plymouth, on her voyage from Alexandria for London, after a
                    passage of eighty-two days. About two days after she left Alexandria, two
                    pilot-fish, <hi rend="italic">Gasterosteus ductor,</hi> made their appearance
                    close alongside the vessel, were constantly seen near her during the homeward
                    voyage, and followed her into Plymouth. After she came to an anchor in Catwater,
                    their attachment appeared to have increased; they kept constant guard to the
                    vessel, and made themselves so familiar, that one of them was actually captured
                    by a gentleman in a boat alongside, but, by a strong effort, it escaped from his
                    grasp, and regained the water. After this the two fish separated; but they were
                    both taken the same evening, and, when dressed the next day, were found to be
                    excellent eating. In October 1833 nearly one hundred pilot-fish accompanied a
                    vessel from Sicily into Catwater, but they were not taken.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Other genera of this tribe are <hi rend="smallcaps">Elacate, Lichia,
                    Cho-rinemus,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Trachinotus,</hi> which we cannot
                    here do more than name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Rhinchobdelła,</hi> Bl. and Schn. Free spines on the
                    back, as in the preceding genera, and two free spines in front of the anal fin,
                    but the ventrals are absent, as in <hi rend="italic">Xiphias</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">proper.</hi> The body is lengthened.</p>
                <p>Of this genus Cuvier has formed two minor groups,— <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rhinchobdella</hi><hi rend="italic">(jRIacrognathus,</hi> Lacép.), including
                    such species as have the muzzle concave, and striated beneath, and the three
                    vertical fins separate; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mastacomblus,</hi> Gronovius,
                    containing such as have the muzzle simply conical, neither striated nor concave,
                    and the vertical fins more or less completely joined.</p>
                <p>The species of both genera inhabit the fresh waters of Asia, and are widely
                    distributed, from Syria to the isles of Sunda, the Moluccas, and China. Their
                    snouts are furnished with a delicate organ of touch, and it appears that they
                    employ it while searching in the mud for small worms, or other slender
                    substances on which they feed. They are generally regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                    >poissons</hi><hi rend="italic">de bon gout,</hi> the flavour of their flesh
                    bearing some resemblance to that of eels.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Notocanthus</hi> (of which <hi rend="italic">N.
                    Nasus</hi> is the sole species) is characteristic of the most northern seas.</p>
                <p>We next proceed to a group of the Scomberidae which forms the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Third Great Tribe,</hi> distinguished by having <hi
                    rend="italic">the sides furnished with a cuirassed lateral line.</hi></p>
                <p>In the tunnies, sword-fish, and other Scomberidae already discussed, a projecting
                    cartilaginous portion is observable, forming a kind of ridge or keel on each
                    side of the tail, at the extremity of the lateral line. In the genera of the
                    same family of which we have now to treat, this ridge is no longer a simple
                    prominence of the dermis, but is covered by sealyshields, themselves crested,
                    and overlapping each other. These shields, frequently ending in a point or hook,
                    are not always confined to the termination of the lateral line, but sometimes
                    spread over its entire length, and usually occupy a considerable portion. In
                    relation to this character, however, the tribe may be divided into two sections:
                    the first of which, comprising only the great genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caranx,</hi> exhibits this kind of armour in its greatest strength and
                    extension; while the second (of which the genus <hi rend="italic">Vomer</hi> is
                    the type) shows its gradual reduction to small scales, not surpassing those of
                    the rest of the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Caranx,</hi> Cuv. Lateral line armed to a greater or
                    less extent with sealyshields, raised into a keel, and pointed.</p>
                <p>As an example, we here figure the <hi rend="italic">Caranx boops,</hi> a
                    beautiful fish from Amboyna, of a fine silvery hue, tinted towards the back with
                    brilliant steel blue, with green reflections. A pure line of orange extends from
                    the gills to the tail, but this ornamental character is said to disappear
                    speedily after death. The pectoral fins are likewise orange. It varies from a
                    few inches to a foot in length. See Plate CCCII. fig. 12. The genus is extremely
                    numerous, containing probably not fewer than seventy different kinds; but the
                    only other species we shall here notice is a fish called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scad,</hi> or horse-mackerel <hi rend="italic">{Caranx trachurus,</hi> Lacép.
                    and Cuv.), which occasionally occurs in prodigious shoals along the British
                    shores. Ten thousand have been taken by a foot-sean in a single evening in
                    August. It likewise occurs in the Mediterranean, and in the vicinity of
                    Madeira.</p>
                <p>Of genera allied to <hi rend="smallcaps">Caranx,</hi> and consisting chiefly of
                    species heretofore and erroneously referred to <hi rend="smallcaps">Zeus,</hi>
                    Baron Cuvier has established or retained the following, viz. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Olistus</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Scyris, Błepharis,
                    Gallichtys, Argyreyosus, Vomer,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hynnis.</hi> Of
                    these our restricted limits prevent our exhibiting the detailed characters. We
                    shall merely present the reader with a figure of that singular little fish <hi
                    rend="italic">Gallichtys Aegyptiacus,</hi> brought by Ehrenberg from the
                    neighbourhood of Alexandria, It measures only from one to two inches in length,
                    and is of a truly remarkable form. See Plate CCCIII. fig. 1.</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at the concluding group or <hi rend="smallcaps">Fourth Great
                    Tribe</hi> of the Scomberidae, in which <hi rend="italic">the flnlets, the free
                    spines of the back, and the armour of the sides of the tail, are all
                    wanting.</hi></p>
                <p>The genera of this tribe, it will be perceived, are combined by means of merely
                    negative characters, and it may therefore be expected that they will exhibit
                    mutual relations of a less intimate kind than those of the preceding tribes.
                    They form in fact a group, as it were, by continuity,—one of those series of
                    which there are many in nature, and of which the agreement is not the less
                    evident and harmonious, although it may be difficult to point out a precise
                    character in common.</p>
                <p>As we have little to say of general interest regarding their history or habits,
                    we think it more suitable to the nature of this article to reserve a principal
                    portion of our allotted space for the elucidation of those species concerning
                    which some important or amusing information has been recorded,· We shall
                    therefore do little more than name the genera of our present tribe.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Seriola</hi> scarcely differs from <hi
                    rend="italic">Caranx,</hi> except in the lateral line being either unprovided
                    with a cuirass, or at least merely furnished with scales which slightly surpass
                    those of the rest of the body. <hi rend="italic">S. Dumerílii</hi> of Risso
                    occurs near Nice, and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. It sometimes attains to
                    the great weight of nearly 200 pounds, and dwells in deep and inaccessible
                    places of the sea, rarely approaching the shores, unless when compelled to do so
                    by hunger. Its flesh is of a reddish colour, firm, and of an exquisite
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Temnodon</hi> greatly resembles the preceding, but
                    its teeth are cutting. There are two small spines in advance of the anal fin,
                    but almost concealed beneath the skin. We here place the <hi rend="italic">Perca
                    saltatrix</hi> of Linn, called <hi rend="italic">ship-jack</hi> by the
                    Americans. Its geographical distribution is extremely extensive.</p>
                <p>The genus No <hi rend="smallcaps">meus,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cuv.</hi> was
                    for a long time combined with the Gobies. It is related in several particulars
                    to <hi rend="italic">Seriola,</hi> but the very large broad ventrals, attached
                    to the body by their inner edge, produce a peculiar character and aspect. We
                    here figure a small species, of which the ground colour is like brilliant
                    silver. The ventrals are traversed by two black bands. It was transmitted to the
                    Museum of the Low Countries from Java, by MM. Kuhl and Van Hasselt. See Plate
                    CCCIII.fig. 4. Three other genera are described by Cuvier in this portion of his
                    great work,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    more general interest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Coryphaena,</hi> Linn. Body compressed, elongated,
                    covered by small scales; head compressed, profile circular; eyes low,
                    approaching the angle of the mouth; dorsal fin rising from the cranium, and
                    stretching con-tìnuously<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940233"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-0233-0187"/> to the tail, towards which it decreases in
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>This noted genus has been remodelled in recent times, and now consists of the
                    following minor groups.</p>
                <p>Isŕ. Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Coryphaena</hi> proper. Cuv. Head very elevated,
                    profile curved and perpendicular, eyes low; mouth well cleft; teeth like those
                    of a wool card.</p>
                <p>The generic term is derived from <hi rend="italic">xoξυ&lt;pη, vertex,</hi> or
                    top of the head, in reference to the height of the crest of the cranium. This
                    division contains the famous <hi rend="italic">dolphin</hi> of the Mediterranean
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cor.</hi><hi rend="italic">hippurus,</hi> Linn.), so
                    celebrated for the beauty of its versatile tints.</p>
                <p>parting day</p>
                <p>Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues With a new colour as it gasps
                    away,</p>
                <p>The last still loveliest, till— ’ tis gone—and all is gray.</p>
                <p>The species are still in some measure indistinctly characterized. They occur in
                    the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea, and are remarkable,
                    among other things, for their keen pursuit of flying fish, which, in the first
                    place, they force to leave their native element, and then following swiftly in a
                    corresponding track, receive with open mouth the moment they descend exhausted
                    to the surface. The Coryphaenae may be regarded as among the most brilliant
                    inhabitants'of the sea. It is necessary, according to Bose, to have seen them
                    following a vessel in troops, before we can form a proper estimate of their
                    beauty. When they swim embodied near the surface, and beneath the light of a
                    cloudless sky, they seem effulgent with the richest gold, combined with the
                    sparkling lustre of the topaz, the emerald, and the sapphire,—and every
                    brilliant hue in perpetual change, accordant with the vivacity and varied grace
                    of their movements. It is indeed a spectacle sufficient anywhere to excite our
                    unfeigned admiration; and when seen suddenly amid the waves of the lonely and
                    monotonous ocean, it comes upon us like a glad surprise. The beauty of these
                    fishes has in every age attracted the wonder</p>
                <p>Of all who on the wide deep wandering are; and it is so far to be regretted, that
                    their fugitive colours have been the chief object of attention,—their more
                    precise description and specific discrimination having been greatly
                    disregarded.</p>
                <p>The Coryphaenae are strong, active, and voracious fishes. While swimming rapidly,
                    they seem rather as if impelled or projected forwards by some exterior force,
                    than by any exertion of their own. But, on attentive examination, a strong and
                    rapid muscular movement may be detected, by the constant undulation of the long
                    dorsal fin, a movement which greatly contributes to the throwing off of those
                    lustrous metallic reflections for which they have so long been noted. The
                    Mediterranean species, <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hippurus,</hi> if not the most beautiful, is the largest known. It sometimes
                    attains to the length of five feet. Its colours, so far as they are capable of
                    description, are silvery blue above, with markings of a deeper azure, and
                    reflections of pure gold—the lower parts citron yellow, marked with pale blue.
                    The pectoral fins are partly lead colour, partly yellow; the ventrals are yellow
                    on their under surface, and black above; the anal fin is yellow. The iris of the
                    eye is made of apparent gold.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and it is by no means easy for a landsman to ascertain which is the right one.
                    The play of colour, as it is called, may no doubt admit of great diversity in
                    the expressions used. The above description is from the recorded observation of
                    the living fish by Μ. Biberon. Another eye-witness, Colonel Bory St Vincent,
                    describes the back as being of a sea-green colour, sprinkled with orange spots;
                    the abdomen silvery; the lateral line yellow; the dorsal fin celestial blue,
                    with golden-coloured rays; the caudal fin surrounded by a green hue; the other
                    fins yellow. <hi rend="italic">(Dictionnaire Classique</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>One or two other hinds, not so distinctly known, occur in the Mediterranean, and
                    many others in more distant seas. We here figure a large species, measuring
                    nearly four feet in length, taken by Μ. Dussumier about fifty leagues to the
                    west of the Azores, for which reason it bears the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coryphaena Azorica,</hi> see Plate CCCIII. fig. 2. The Portuguese name more
                    than one species <hi rend="italic">Dorade,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> term
                    which, from its similarity to <hi rend="italic">Daurade</hi> (a frequent

                    rend="italic">aurata),</hi> has produced some confusion. Not less ambiguous is
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Dolphin,</hi> which appears to have been first
                    misapplied to the Coryphaenae by the Dutch. It is scarcely necessary to observe,
                    that the English word Dolphin, as synonymous with the Greek ∆sλp∕g, the Latin
                    Delphinus, and the French Dauphin, was originally, and is still correctly,
                    applied only to designate a group of cetaceous animals (allied in structure to
                    the whales), to which the classical dolphin of antiquity assuredly belonged. But
                    by some conversion, into the history of which it is not worth while to inquire,
                    the term has been applied by most modern writers, particularly poets, to a
                    creature of another class, a genuine fish, of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coryphaena.</hi> No fault therefore can be imputed to the naturalist, if the
                    general misapplication of the term is now found to occasion any misconception.
                    There is no doubt, however, that the animal beloved by gods and men, the <hi

                <p>Most of the species occur in the Mediterranean; and the <hi rend="italic">blach

                    referrible to this genus. It is a fish of great strength and velocity, measuring
                    from two to three feet, and is one of our rare British species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Astrodermus,</hi> Bonelli. Head elevated and sharp;
                    mouth slightly cleft; only four branchial rays; ventrals very small, and placed
                    upon the throat; scales scattered upon the body, and assuming the radiated form
                    of little stars. It is from the latter circumstance that the genus derives its
                    name.</p>
                <p>There is only a single species of this genus,—recently discovered, and still
                    extremely rare. It has been taken near Nice, and also in the Gulf of Cagliari in
                    Sardinia, and was originally described by Μ. Risso under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Coryphaena</hi><hi rend="italic">elegans.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the dorsal and anal fins prodigiously extended.</p>
                <p>This eccentric genus is founded on a fish described by Pallas in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Spicilegia,</hi> under the name of <hi rend="italic">Coryphaena

                    rend="italic">lifexa,</hi> and it was with a feeling of doubt that Cuvier placed
                    it where it now stands. It is not easy to conceive the use of its dorsal and
                    anal fins, so enormously large in proportion to the size of the body. Pallas
                    indeed imagined that they might serve to sustain it in the air; but in that case
                    the fish must fly, as a flounder swims, upon its side. The species are
                    unfortunately so rare, that it may be long before an opportunity occurs of
                    throwing any light upon the subject. The only known specimen of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pt. ocellatus,</hi> Cuv. was taken entire from the stomach of a
                    bonito in the Straits of Mosambique. The species represented in this work (See
                    Plate CCCIII. fig 3) was brought to Europe by MM. Quoy and Gaymard, but we know
                    not from what locality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Stromateus,</hi> Linn. Distinguished among the
                    Scomberidae by the want of the ventral fins, and by a single dorsal, the spiny
                    rays of which, few in number, are concealed in its anterior margin. The vertical
                    fins are covered by scales, as among the Squammipennes.</p>
                <p>The Mediterranean produces a beautiful species <hi rend="italic">(St.

                    Russel, it is abundant at Vizagapatam during the months of March and April, and
                    vanishes and re-appears alternately every two or three days. It requires to be
                    eaten immediately after capture.! A singular circumstance in the geographical
                    history of this genus is, that although the species seem common along a great
                    extent of Indian coast, and spread as far as China, none is known at the Isle of
                    France, nor in any part of the Indian Archipelago.</p>

                    Stromateus, but very small ventrals are perceptible, or at least the vestiges of

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Kurtus,</hi> Bloch. Allied to Rhombus, but differs in
                    the dorsal fin being shorter, and the ventrals more developed. The scales are so
                    fine as to be imperceptible in the dried state. There are seven branchial rays.
                    The pelvis shows a spine between the ventrals, and several small cutting blades
                    are visible anterior to the dorsal fin, at the base of which is a spine directed
                    horizontally forwards.</p>
                <p>The skeleton in this genus presents a striking peculiarity in the ribs, which are
                    dilated, convex, and in the form of rings which come in contact with each
                    other,— thus enclosing a conical empty space, which is prolonged beneath the
                    tail, in the inferior rings of the vertebrae, into a long thin tube enclosing
                    the swimming bladder. The species inhabit the Indian seas, and are few in

                <p>We shall conclude our exposition of the Scomberidae by a brief notice of the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Zeus,</hi> Linn, from which some of the preceding
                    genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Gallychtis, Argyreyosus,</hi> &amp;c. have
                    already been detached. In its more restricted form it contains fishes of a
                    compressed body, protractile mouth covered by small scales, with teeth feeble
                    and few in number. It is further divisible as follows:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Zeus, Cuv.</hi> Dorsal fin emarginate, its spines
                    accompanied by long slips of the membrane; a series of forked spines along the
                    base of the dorsal and anal fins.</p>
                <p>The type of the genus is <hi rend="italic">Zeus faber,</hi> commonly called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dory</hi> (Plate CCCIII. fig. 5), probably f ∙om the French
                    term <hi rend="italic">dorée,</hi> in allusion to the golden tints of its
                    body.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A variety of
                    derivations, however, have been assigned to the English name. In addition to the
                    one above alluded to, we shall merely mention the following: St Christopher,
                    while wading through an arm of the sea, and bearing the infant Saviour, is said
                    to have caught a dory, and to have impressed its sides with the two peculiar
                    marks, as a perpetual record of the fact. The name was therefore said to be from
                    the French <hi rend="italic">adorée,</hi> worshipped, as something unusually
                    sacred. The designation of <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Dory is in all
                    probability derived from the French <hi rend="italic">jaune dorée,</hi> in
                    allusion to the tints of a <hi rend="italic">golden yellow</hi> hue with which
                    it is adorned. Some, however, refer it (and again in connection with St Peter)
                    to the Italian term <hi rend="italic">janitore,</hi> or door-keeper, by which it
                    seems the species is known to the fishermen of the Adriatic.</p></note> Its
                    surface has at the same time a smoked appearance, on which account the French
                    name it <hi rend="italic">forgeron,</hi> a word which corresponds to the Latin
                    trivial name of <hi rend="italic">faber,</hi> or blacksmith. It is also called
                    the <hi rend="italic">fish of St Peter,</hi> from an ancient traditionary belief
                    that it was from the mouth of this species that the apostle extracted the
                    tribute-money, and the black spot on either side of its body is supposed to be a
                    record of its capture at that time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The common haddock also bears a share in this
                    tradition.</p></note> The dory is a fish greatly esteemed for the table. It
                    occurs both in the Mediterranean Sea, and along the oceanic coasts of Europe.
                    According to Pennant, the largest are found in the Bay of Biscay. Willughby
                    alludes to it as common in his day on the shores of Cornwall; and it is still
                    taken both there and along the Devonshire coast, occasionally even in profusion.
                    Mr Couch, as quoted by Mr Yarrell, considers the dory rather as a wandering than
                    a migratory fish, and as regulated in a great measure by the movements of the
                    smaller kinds on which it preys. When the pilchards approach the shore, it is
                    frequently taken in considerable numbers. In the autumn of 1829, more than sixty
                    were hauled on shore at once in a net, some of them of large size, and yet the
                    whole were sold together for nine shillings. The largest specimens of the London
                    market weigh from ten to twelve pounds, but the average weight is scarcely more
                    than five. The dory is a bold, voracious species, pr, eying greedily upon the
                    more timid kinds, and pouncing readily upon all sorts of bait. Its flesh was
                    highly esteemed in the time of Pliny. Columella, who was a native of Cadiz
                    (where it was regarded as the best of fishes), has recorded that it had been
                    long known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Zeus</hi> —-a designation which in

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Lampris,</hi> Retzius. A single dorsal fin, high in
                    front, where it is furnished with one or two small spines. The ventrals have ten
                    long rays, and the lobes of the caudal fin are considerably elongated, but these
                    prolongations seem to become effaced by age. The sides of the tail are
                    carinated.</p>
                <p>The only known species (Z. <hi rend="italic">guttatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeus
                    luna,</hi> Gmelin) occurs, though rarely, off the French coasts, and in the
                    British seas, where it is known as the <hi rend="italic">opah</hi> or kingfish.
                    It is one of the most splendid and remarkable of European fishes. Its back is of
                    a deep blue spotted with silver,—the rest of its body like polished gold,
                    reflecting all the colours of the rainbow. It is certainly sufficiently singular
                    that a species included by Nilsson in his <hi rend="italic">Prodromus</hi> of
                    the fishes of Scandinavia, should likewise be enumerated by Kaempfer as
                    occurring in Japan. The opah is a fish of great size, measuring sometimes five
                    feet in length. Its flesh is said to taste like beef. See Plate CCCIII. fig.

                <p>FAMILY VIII—T ENIOIDAE.</p>
                <p>This family is closely connected with the Scomberidae. The species are of a very
                    lengthened form, and flattened laterally, from which they have obtained the name

                    fin entirely wanting; dorsal fin long, with prolonged anterior rays, which,
                    however, are easily broken; ventrals also very long, when not worn away by use,
                    or otherwise fractured; the caudal, composed of few rays, rises vertically on
                    the extremity of the tail, which finishes in a little hook. There are six
                    branchial rays.</p>
                <p>The species are so soft and tender that they often present themselves as it were
                    with false characters, from the natural mutilation of the rays. For this reason
                    they are as yet indistinctly characterized by systematic writers. Even the
                    central skeleton, and especially the bones of the vertebrae, are extremely soft.
                    The stomach is long; there are numerous caeca; the swimming bladder is wanting;
                    and the flesh, of a mucous nature, decomposes with great rapidity. The European
                    species occur in the Mediterranean, and also occasionally in the British and
                    more northern seas. The fish called <hi rend="italic">hing</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>FAMILY IX.—THEUTIDAE.</p>
                <p>This family is perhaps as closely allied to the Scomberidae as the preceding, but
                    its alliance proceeds from other points,—such as the armature of the sides of
                    the tail in several genera, or the horizontal spine anterior to the dorsal fin
                    in others. It comprises but a small number of foreign genera, with compressed
                    oblong bodies, small mouths, slightly or not at all protractile, armed on each
                    jaw with cutting teeth upon a single range, the palate and tongue without teeth,
                    and a single dorsal fin. The species are of herbivorous habits, feeding chiefly
                    on fuci and other marine vegetation. Their intestines are ample. We are
                    compelled to be brief in our indications of the generic groups.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Siganus,</hi> Forsk. of which the species are <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192940272" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0272-0190"/> numerous in the
                    Indian seas, is characterized by a feature believed to be unique among fishes,
                    that of having both the outer and inner ray of the ventral fins spiny. The genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Acanthurus,</hi> Bloch, has the teeth cutting and dentated,
                    and a strong moveable spine on each side of the tail, capable of inflicting a
                    severe wound on those who grasp it incautiously. On this account a species
                    greatly sought for in the West Indies as food has received the name of surgeon,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ac.</hi><hi rend="italic">Chirurgus.</hi> As an example we
                    here figure the <hi rend="italic">Acanthurus Delisianus.</hi> See Plate CCCIII.
                    fig. 7. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nasξus</hi> the sides of the tail are
                    armed with fixed spines, and the teeth are conical. The great peculiarity,
                    however, consists in a hornlike prominence on the front of the head. The skin
                    resembles leather. Forskall relates of one species <hi rend="italic">(N.
                    fron-ticonis,</hi> Lac.) that although of peaceable demeanour and herbivorous
                    habits, it knows how to defend itself from unprovoked aggression; and he reports
                    the observations of some Arabian fishermen, who saw a troop of them come to the
                    rescue of a companion who had been transfixed on the surface of the water by an
                    eagle. They so bothered the “Bird of Jove” as eventually to produce his death by
                    drowning. This, however, savours more of an “Arabian Tale” than of a fact in
                    natural history. See Plate CCCIII. fig. 9. The reader will perceive in the two
                    preceding representations a resemblance to the genus Chaetodon. The remaining
                    genera of this small family are <hi rend="smallcaps">Axinurus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Priodon, Cuv.</hi></p>
                <p>FAMILY X—LABYRINTHIFORM PHARYNGEALS.</p>
                <p>By this term Baron Cuvier means to designate the peculiar structure of a part of
                    the upper pharyngeal bones, which are divided into leaflets more or less
                    numerous and irregular. This formation produces cells capable of containing
                    water, which flows upon and moistens the branchiae for some time after the fish
                    itself has been removed from its natural element; and this refreshing influence
                    is rendered the more effectual by the closeness of the opercula or gill-covers.
                    The consequence is, that most of the species possess the power of quitting their
                    streams and pools, and creeping, as it were, to some little distance from their
                    watery homes,—a faculty not unknown to ancient writers, and one which in India
                    has led to the belief that these fishes fall from heaven.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Anabas.</hi> In this genus the labyrinths alluded to
                    attain the greatest degree of complication. Nevertheless the third pharyngeals
                    have teeth <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">paves,</hi> and there are
                    others beneath the back of the cranium. The body is round, covered by strong
                    scales; the head large; the muzzle short and obtuse; the mouth small; the
                    lateral line interrupted about its posterior third. The margins of the opercle,
                    sub-opercle, and inter-opercle, are strongly toothed, but not those of the
                    pre-opercle. The branchial membrane has five rays. There are many spiny rays to
                    the dorsal, and even to the anal fin. The stomach is of medium size, rounded.
                    The pylorus has only three appendices.</p>
                <p>The generic name is derived from the Greek, <hi rend="italic">aνaβaινω, to
                    ascend,</hi> and refers to the singular instinct of the only known species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Am</hi><hi rend="italic">scandens,</hi> Plate CCCIII. fig. 11),
                    which induces it to climb trees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    by means of the spiny processes of the gill-covers, and moves at pleasure up the
                    trunks of trees which grow by the water side. It was observed by Lieutenant
                    Daldorff, at Tranquebar, ascending by a fissure in the stem of the palm called
                    <hi rend="italic">Borassus fiabellifer,</hi> and was also found to be so
                    tenacious of life as to move about upon the dry sand for some hours after it was
                    captured on the tree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    time other respectable observers who have attended to this species in its
                    natural state, make no mention of the fact. Μ. Reinwardt has frequently taken
                    the Anabas at Java, but never heard any climbing propensities attributed to it;
                    Μ. Leschenault, who transmitted several specimens to Pondicherry, simply
                    observes that they dwell in rivers and fresh-water ponds; while Mr Hamilton
                    Buchanan proceeds still further, and not only denies the fact, but regards it as
                    contrary to the laws of nature. One point, however, is certain, that it is
                    capable of living an unusual length of time out of the water, a fact in perfect
                    accordance with the peculiar structure of its pharyngeals. It also creeps about
                    upon the ground for hours together, and the fishermen are alleged to keep it
                    alive for five or six days in a dry vessel. It is thus brought alive to the
                    markets of Calcutta from the great marshes of the district of Yazor, which are
                    distant more than a hundred and fifty miles. “Les charlatans et jongleurs,” says
                    Cuvier, “dont l’Inde abonde, ont généralement de ces poissons avec eux dans des
                    vases, pour amuser la populace de leurs mouvemens.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Passing over the nearly allied genera of <hi rend="smallcaps">Helostoma,
                    Polyacantiius, Colisa,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Macropodus,</hi> we arrive
                    at the <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Osphronemus</hi> of Commerson, of which the
                    forehead is somewhat concave, the anal fin larger than the dorsal, the
                    sub-orbitals and base of the pre-opercle finely dentated, and the first soft ray
                    of the ventrals remarkably prolonged. There are six branchial rays, and the
                    general form of the body is much compressed.</p>
                <p>This genus contains the <hi rend="italic">Os. olfax,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gourami,</hi> one of the most famous for its flavour of all the fishes of the
                    East. See Plate CCCII1. fig. 10.) It grows as large as a turbot, and is even
                    more delicious than that favourite food. Commerson has recorded in his
                    manuscript that he never tasted so exquisite a fish,—“Nihil inter pisces tum
                    marinos tum fluviatiles exquisitius unquam degustavi and he adds, that the Dutch
                    of Batavia rear them in large earthen vessels, renewing the water every day, and
                    feeding them on aquatic plants, particularly <hi rend="italic">Pistia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">natans.</hi> That navigator was also of opinion that the species
                    had been imported originally from China to the Isle of France, and it appears to
                    have been recently conveyed to the French colonies in South America by Captain
                    Philibert. Its importation to Europe would be well worth attempting, and would
                    probably be attended by success if the Gourami, like the golden carp, is
                    actually a native of China, lt does not, however, appear that any mention is
                    made of it in any natural history notices of that empire, and it seems as yet
                    unknown in India. It is said that the female Gourami hollows out a little floss
                    in the side of the pond where she is kept, for the purpose of depositing her
                    eggs in safety.</p>
                <p>The remaining genera of this group are <hi rend="smallcaps">Trichopus,
                    Spirobranchus,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophicephalus.</hi> Of the former
                    two only a single species is known of each. The last named is more numerous, and
                    is deserving of a brief notice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ophicephali</hi> resemble all the preceding genera of the
                    family in the majority of their characters, and particularly in the cellular
                    disposition of their pharyngeals, which seem equally adapted for the singular
                    retention of water before alluded to. They can consequently also creep to a
                    considerable distance from their liquid abodes; but what particularly
                    distinguishes and even separates them from all <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192940285" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0285-0191"/>other acanthopterygian
                    fishes, is the absence of spines to the fins, except the single one to the
                    ventrals, which itself, though simple, is neither stiff nor pointed. The body is
                    elongated, and almost cylindrical; the muzzle short and obtuse; the head
                    depressed, and furnished with polygonal scales, or rather plates, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Anabas.</hi> It may be said, however, that it is by means of the
                    solitary ventral spines alone that they exhibit the normal character of the
                    great division of acanthopterygian fishes with which we have been hitherto
                    engaged. They thus, by such ambiguous combination of character, almost break up
                    the grand distinction of acanthopterygian and malacopterygian species, a
                    distinction otherwise so well grounded as to have hitherto produced no
                    disruption of the relations of natural affinity. “If it were possible,” says
                    Cuvier, “to admit that anomalous beings existed in nature, there is certainly
                    none to which the title is so justly due as to the Ophicephali.” Their watery
                    reservoirs enable them to journey from one marsh to another, and they are
                    moreover so tenacious of life that their bowels may be torn out, and themselves
                    cut to pieces, without producing immediate death. They are often thus carried
                    about alive, or sold in the markets slice by slice; and the consumers refuse to
                    give the best price when so much has been cut away that the remainder ceases to
                    move. This seems a parallel case to that of the beef-steaks from the oxen of
                    Abyssinia. We here figure as an example of this singular genus the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ophicephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">striatus,</hi> a species which
                    seems spread over the whole of India. See Plate CCCIII. fig. 12. Buchanan
                    describes another species under the name of <hi rend="italic">Gachua
                    (Oph.</hi><hi rend="italic">marginatus,</hi> Cuv. ?), which sometimes grows to a
                    foot in length. It is very common in the ponds and fosses of Bengal, and is one
                    of the species most generally believed to fall from the clouds in wet weather.
                    During the first heavy showers of the rainy season, they are certainly seen
                    crawling on the grass; but their object in so doing is doubtless to escape from
                    the corrupted water of the narrow dykes which they had previously inhabited, and
                    to go in search of a purer element, and a fresher and more ample food. The
                    species called <hi rend="italic">Earca</hi> by Buchanan lives in holes in the
                    vertical banks of the Brahmapootra, with nothing visible but its head, that it
                    may the more readily observe and seize its prey. It is a large fish, measuring
                    three feet in length, and is regarded as good eating. On the whole, however, the
                    species of this genus are consumed rather by natives than Europeans,—the latter
                    probably regarding them too much in the light of reptiles. We may add, that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ophicephali</hi> are often exhibited by the Indian jugglers,
                    and that even the children amuse themselves by íorcing them to crawl upon the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>FAMILY XI.—MUGILIDAE.</p>
                <p>The fishes which compose our present group (corresponding to the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mugil</hi> of Linn.) exhibit so many peculiarities of
                    organization, that Cuvier has deemed it advisable to form them into a distinct
                    family. The body is almost cylindrical, covered with large scales, and furnished
                    with two distinct dorsal fins, the first of which has only four spiny rays. The
                    ventrals are attached somewhat behind the pectorals. The gills have six rays.
                    The head is rather depressed, also covered with large scales or polygonal
                    plates. The muzzle is very short. The transverse mouth forms an angle by means
                    of a prominence of the middle of the lower jaw, corresponding to a depression of
                    the upper one; and the teeth are excessively fine, indeed m some cases
                    imperceptible. The pharyngeal bones, greatly developed, give an angular form to
                    the oesophagus resembling that of the mouth, which permits only fluids or very
                    small substances to enter the stomach, notwithstanding which the latter
                    terminates in a kind of fleshy gizzard, analogous to that of birds. The pyloric
                    appendices are few in number, but the intestine is long and folded.</p>
                <p>The species are excellent as articles of food. They resort in vast troops to the
                    mouths of large rivers, where they may be observed continually springing out of
                    the water.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mugil</hi><hi rend="italic">cephalus,</hi> or Mediterranean
                    gray mullet (the English name must not mislead the unpractised reader to
                    confound it with the genus <hi rend="italic">Mullus,</hi> formerly described),
                    is distinguished from all the other European species by its eyes, which are half
                    covered by two adipose veils adherent to the anterior and posterior margin of
                    the orbit, and by the peculiar concealment of the maxillary bone, which, when
                    the mouth is closed, is completely hidden beneath the sub-orbital. The base of
                    the pectoral fin is surmounted by a long carinated scale. See Plate CCCIII. fig.
                    13. The species just referred to is the best and largest of the Mediterranean
                    kinds. It weighs about ten or twelve pounds, and does not appear to have been
                    yet detected in the seas or estuaries of Britain, nor along the oceanic shores
                    of France. It is very common on the coast of Spain, especially around the island
                    of Ivica, where the fishermen are said to recognise two varieties under the
                    names of <hi rend="italic">Mugil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lissa.</hi> When
                    surrounded by a net, it endeavours, and often successfully, to effect its

                <p>. “Its hearing is very fine, as has been noticed by Aristotle, and it feeds on
                    worms and small marine animals; but it is doubtful, though it has been advanced,
                    that it can live on vegetable substances. It appears to be of a stupid
                    character, a fact which was known in the time of Pliny, for that author tells us
                    that there is something ludicrous in the disposition of the mullets; for if they
                    are afraid they con ceal their heads, and thus imagine they are entirely
                    withdrawn from the observation of their enemies.</p>
                <p>“When, towards the end of spring and the commencement of summer, the fishes of
                    this species, excited by the necessity of living in the fresh water, approach
                    the shores and advance towards the mouths of the rivers, they form such numerous
                    troops that the water through which they are seen, without being clearly
                    distinguished, appears to be bluish. This particularly happens in the Garonne
                    and the Loire at these periods. The fishermen there adopt the plan of
                    surrounding these legions of mullets with nets, the enclosure of which they
                    gradually contract, taking care to make a noise to frighten the fish, and oblige
                    them to press together, and heap themselves as it were one upon the other.</p>
                <p>“Of the mullets thus taken some are eaten fresh, others are salted and
                    smoke-dried; it is with their eggs salted, washed, pressed, and dried, that the
                    preparation called <hi rend="italic">bo-tardìa</hi> is made, which is a
                    condiment greatly in request in Italy and the southern provinces of France. The
                    flesh of this mullet is tender, delicate, and of an agreeable flavour; it is
                    fatter and more in estimation when it is taken in the fresh water. The ancients,
                    who from the time of Aristotle were acquainted with this fish, had it in great
                    request; and the consumption of it is still very considerable in most of the
                    southern countries of Europe. According to the report of Athenaeus, those
                    mullets were formerly in very high esteem which were taken in the neighbourhood
                    of Sinope and Abdera; while, as Paulus Jovius informs us, those were very little
                    prized which had lived in the salt marsh of Or-bitello<pb break="no"

                    neighbourhood of Commachio and Ravenna. All these places in fact are marshy, and
                    the streams by which they are watered are brackish, and communicate to the fish
                    which they support the odour and the flavour of the mud.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>At the conclusion of this family Cuvier places the two following genera, the

                    while the second partakes of characters intermediate between the Mugilidae in
                    general, and the ensuing family of Gobioidae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Tetragonurus,</hi> Risso, so called from two salient
                    crests on each side, near the base of the caudal fin. The body is elongated; the
                    spinous dorsal long, but very low,—the soft dorsal approximate, but higher and
                    short, with an anal of corresponding form; the ventrals are a little behind the
                    pectorals; the branches of the lower jaw are vertically raised, and furnished
                    with a range of pointed cutting teeth, forming as it were a saw, and fitting,
                    when the mouth is closed, into those of the upper jaw. The stomach is garnished
                    interiorly with hard and pointed papillae.</p>
                <p>The only known species (<hi rend="italic">T. Cuvieri,</hi> Risso) is found along
                    the Mediterranean shores, but only at great depths. It is of a black colour,
                    measuring about a foot in length, and is covered by hard, toothed, striated

                <p>All the known species are characterised by a broad silvery band along the sides.
                    They are highly esteemed for their delicacy; and the fry, which continue for a

                    that name; and Mr Yarrell has ascertained that the British species, commonly
                    called the Atherine, coincides in its characters with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atherina presbyter</hi> of Cuvier. It is a common fish at Brighton, where,

                    quantities by the inhabitants and visitors during the winter months. It partakes
                    of the cucumber smell and flavour of the true smelt, and is a small handsome
                    fish, measuring from five to six inches. It is rarely brought to the London
                    market. It spawns in May and June.</p>

                <p>1his family derives its name from the Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gobius,</hi> and is distinguished by having the dorsal spines slender and
                    flexible. The viscera of all the fishes pertaining to it are nearly of the same
                    conformation; the intestinal canal is equal, ample, and without caeca, and there
                    is no swimming bladder. </p>
                <p>The species referrible to the genus <hi rend="italic">Elennius,</hi> Linn,
                    present a very distinctive character in having their ventral fins placed before
                    the pectorals, and composed only of two rays. Their bodies are elongated and
                    compressed, and they bear only a single dorsal, composed almost entirely of
                    simple and flexible rays. They live in small companies in rocky streams, and can
                    survive for a considerable time out of the water, in consequence of their skin
                    being covered with a kind of mucus, a circumstance which has caused the Greek
                    name <hi rend="italic">Elennius</hi> to be applied to them. Many of them are
                    viviparous, and both sexes have a tubercle near the anus, which seems to be
                    subservient to the purposes of copulation. They are now arranged under the
                    following genera:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Blennius, Cuv.</hi> Includes the blennies properly so

                    only a single and rather regular row on each jaw, terminating behind in some
                    species by a long and hooked tooth. The head is obtuse, the muzzle short, and
                    the forehead vertical; the intestines broad and short. Several species occur
                    along the coasts of Britain. Of these we may mention the butterfly blenny (Zf.

                    chiefly observable among cartilaginous fishes, that, namely, of producing its
                    young alive. These are so matured at the time of their birth, that on their
                    first exclusion they swim about with the utmost agility. No fewer than 200 or
                    300 young are sometimes produced by an individual, and the abdomen of the mother
                    is so distended before parturition, that it is impossible to touch it without
                    causing them to be extruded. Full-grown individuals seldom exceed twelve inches
                    in length; the body is slender and smooth; the colour yellowish olive, pale
                    beneath, and marked on the upper parts with dusky spots. It is a littoral fish,
                    and of frequent occurrence under stones. When boiled, the back-bone acquires a
                    green colour. America produces a much larger species, which sometimes exceeds
                    the length of three feet. It has been described under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Blennius</hi><hi rend="italic">labrosus.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Genus Anarrhichas,</hi> Linn. Bear so much affinity to the blennies, that the
                    species have been termed by Cuvier Blennies without ventrals. The dorsal fin,
                    entirely composed of simple rays, but without stiffness, begins at the nape, and
                    extends, in common with the anal one, nearly to the caudal fin, which is rounded
                    like the pectorals. The whole body is smooth and covered with mucus. Their
                    palatines, vomer, and mandibles, arc armed with large osseous tubercles, which
                    are crowned with small enamelled teeth; but the anterior teeth are longer and
                    conical. Such a conformation of the teeth makes them very powerful instruments,
                    and these fishes, from their large size, are thereby rendered ferocious and
                    dangerous. They have six rays in the gills; the stomach is short and fleshy,
                    with the pylorus near its base; the intestine short, thick, and without caeca;
                    and the swimming bladder is wanting.</p>
                <p>’ pι ð ∙ ∙</p>
                <p>r∣n√ <hi rend="superscript"> e most</hi> common species is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. lupus.</hi> Plate CCCIV. fig. 2. It is of frequent occurrence in most of the
                    northern seas, and is well known along the coasts of Britain by the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">sea-wolf</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sea-cat.</hi> Its ordinary
                    length is from three to four feet, but examples sometimes occur nearly double
                    that size. The colour is obscure livid brown, with several transverse stripes or
                    bands of a darker hue. The dorsal fin, as already mentioned, extends along the
                    whole length of the back, and is composed of seventy-three rays. The fore teeth
                    project considerably, and diverge a little from each other, forming a powerful
                    kind of armature, moved by jaws of such strength that the animal has been known
                    to imprint the marks of its teeth on a bar of iron. The uninviting aspect of
                    this fish has probably not .been without influence in producing a prejudice
                    against it as an article of food. Its flesh, however, is far from being
                    unsavoury, and bears considerable resemblance to that of the eel. It is in great
                    request among the Icelanders, who eat it dry and salted; while the other parts
                    of the fish are likewise converted to useful purposes, the skin forming
                    shagreen, and the gall being used as soap.</p>
                <p>The gobies (<hi rend="italic">Gobius,</hi> Linn.) are at once distinguished from
                    their associates by having their thoracic ventrals united, either throughout
                    their whole length, or only towards the base, and forming a single hollow disk,
                    more or less tunnel-shaped.</p>
                <p>The spines of their dorsal fins are flexible; the opening of the gills, provided
                    there are only five branchial rays, is generally very small; and, like the
                    blennies, they can live for some time out of the water. Their stomach is without
                    a <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac,</hi> and the intestinal canal has no caeca: the
                    males have an appendage, like the blennies, behind the anus; and some species
                    arc known to produce their young alive. They are small or middlesized fishes,
                    and usually frequent rocky places near the margin of the waters which they
                    inhabit. The greater number are provided with a simple air-bladder.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Cuv.</hi> Includes the <hi rend="italic">gobies</hi> properly
                    so called. They have their ventrals united throughout their whole length, and
                    even anterior to their base, by a traverse, so as to form a concave disk. Their
                    body is elongated; the head of moderate size, and rounded , the cheeks inflated;
                    and the eyes placed near each other. The back bears two fins, the posterior one
                    rather long. Several species occur in European seas, the characters of which
                    have not been sufficiently examined. They frequent waters having a clay bottom,
                    and pass the winter in excavations which they make for that purpose. In the
                    spring they prepare a kind of nest in places which abound with Fuci, and cover
                    it with the roots of the Zostera: the male remains there waiting the arrival of
                    the females, which come in succession to deposit their eggs. These he
                    fecundates, and afterwards watches and defends courageously.</p>
                <p>The black goby <hi rend="italic">(Gobius niger,</hi> Linn.) is not a scarce
                    species on the coasts of Britain. It is about five inches long, of a dark-brown
                    colour above, and white beneath, variegated with darker spots and stripes. The
                    tail is rounded, and the superior rays of the pectorals are free at the
                    extremity. Several others are found in the Mediterranean, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">G.jozzo, G.</hi><hi rend="italic">capito,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">cruentatus.</hi> A few are inhabitants of
                    fresh waters, such as the small dark-coloured species described by Bonelli under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">fluviatilis.</hi> Among
                    foreign kinds the most remarkable are the <hi rend="italic">Cottus
                    macrocephalus</hi> of Pallas, in which the head is unusually large; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">G. lanceolatus</hi> of Bloch, distinguished by its elongated form,
                    and pointed caudal fin.</p>
                <p>The genus named <hi rend="smallcaps">Gobioides</hi> by Lacépède differs from the
                    gobies only in having their dorsals united so as to form a single fin, and in
                    the body being more elongated. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Tenioides</hi> of the
                    same distinguished Ichthyologist have likewise a continuous dorsal line, and the
                    body is still more lengthened. These fishes present a very peculiar aspect, in
                    consequence of having their upper jaw very short, and the lower one high and
                    convex, rising above it, both of them being armed with long crooked teeth, while
                    the eye is reduced to a mere point, and entirely<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192940324" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0324-0194"/> concealed under the skin.
                    The cavity of the mouth is filled with a fleshy tongue almost of a globular
                    shape, and the lower jaw has a few barbels beneath. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taenioides Hermann</hi> is the only species known: it is a native of the East
                    Indies, and is usually found in the mud of stagnant waters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Periophthalmus,</hi> Schn. Contains such as have the
                    head entirely scaly, the eyes placed quite close to each other, and furnished on
                    their lower margin with an eye-lid capable of covering them; the pectoral fins
                    clothed with scales for more than half their length, which makes them look as if
                    supported by a kind of arm. Their gills being still narrower than those of the
                    other gobies, they can live for a longer period out of the water; and in the
                    Moluccas, their native country, they are often observed to leap out on the mud
                    in order to escape their enemies, or to seize the small shrimps, which form
                    their principal nourishment. In some the ventrals have a concave disk like the
                    gobies properly so called; while in others these fins are separated almost to
                    the base. Plate CCCIV. fig. 3.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Eleotris,</hi> Cuv. In common with the gobies, the
                    fishes referred to this genus have the first dorsal with flexible spines, and an
                    appendage behind the anus; but the ventrals are perfectly distinct, the head
                    obtuse and a little depressed, the eyes remote from each other, and the
                    branchial membrane with six rays. The lateral line is faintly marked, and the
                    viscera resemble those of the <hi rend="italic">Gobii.</hi> The greater
                    proportion of the species live in fresh water, and often in the mud. That named
                    <hi rend="italic">E. dor-mitatrix</hi> is a native of the Antilles; it is of
                    considerable size, with the head depressed, the cheeks dilated, and the fins
                    spotted with black. Others occur in Senegal and the Indies, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> small gilded species, marked with a black spot at the base
                    of the pectoral (the <hi rend="italic">Gobius auratus</hi> of Riss.), inhabits
                    the coasts of the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Callionymus,</hi> Linn. Possesses very strongly marked
                    characters in the gills being open only by a hole on each side of the nape, and
                    in the ventral fins being placed under the throat, remote, and larger than the
                    pectorals. The head is oblong and depressed, the eyes approximating when seen
                    from above, the inter-maxillarics very protractile, and the pre-opercles
                    elongated behind and terminating in a few spines. The teeth are crowded, and are
                    wanting on the palate. They are beautiful fishes, with a smooth skin, and having
                    the anterior dorsal supported by some setaceous rays, occasionally much
                    elevated. The second dorsal is elongated, as well as the anal. The same
                    appendage is observable behind the anus as in the preceding genera. The stomach
                    is not in the form of a <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac,</hi> and they are without
                    caeca and air-bladder. Of this handsome genus we may mention as an example the
                    gemmeous dragonet <hi rend="italic">(C. lyra),</hi> which occurs not
                    unfrequently in the British seas. Plate CCCIV. fig. 4. It derives its specific
                    name from the form of the dorsal fin, which has been thought to bear an obscure
                    resemblance to a lyre. The full-grown fish is about a foot in length. It is of a
                    beautiful orange or yellow colour, spotted and striped with violet; the pupils
                    of the eyes fine deep blue, and the pectoral fins light brown. The sordid
                    dragonet (C. <hi rend="italic">dracunculus)</hi> differs from the above only in
                    having the dorsal fin short and without a fillet: by many it is conjectured to
                    be the female of <hi rend="italic">C. lyra.</hi> Several species inhabit the
                    Mediterranean, such as <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Trichonotus,</hi> Schn. Differs from the typical <hi
                    rend="italic">Callionymi</hi> only in having the body very much elongated, and
                    the continuous dorsal and anal of proportionate extent. The genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Comephora</hi> of Lacépède comprehends but one species, from
                    the Lake Baikal, which is usually found dead after storms, and is of so soft and
                    fat a substance as to afford a considerable quantity of oil. It is distinguished
                    from all the other members of this group by being destitute of ventrals. The
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Platypteron</hi> is constituted by a few Indian
                    fishes, which, to the large and remote ventrals of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callionymi,</hi> unite a short depressed head, a small mouth, open branchiae,
                    and large scales: their two dorsals are short and remote.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Chirus,</hi> Steller <hi rend="italic">(Labrax,</hi>
                    Pallas). Placed by Cuvier at the end of this family, presents so many
                    distinctive characters, that it may not improperly be regarded as the type of a
                    new family group. The body is elongated, and garnished with ciliated scales; the
                    head small and unarmed; the mouth but slightly cleft, and furnished with small
                    unequal conical teeth; the spines of the dorsal are almost invariably slender,
                    and that fin extends along the whole back. But their most distinctive feature
                    consists of numerous series of pores, resembling several lateral lines. Their
                    intestines are without caecal appendages; they have often a tuft on the
                    eye-brow, like certain kinds of blenny; but their ventrals are composed of five
                    soft rays, as is usual in the allied species. All the known kinds, amounting to
                    six or seven in number, are from the sea of Kamschatka, and were first described
                    by Pallas in the 11th volume of the Memoirs of the Academy of Petersburg for
                    1810.</p>
                <p>FAMILY XIII.—PECTORALES PEDICULATI.</p>
                <p>This family, in Baron Cuvier’s arrangement, comprehends such acanthopterygenous
                    species as have the carpal bone prolonged in order to form a kind of arm, which
                    supports the pectorals. From this peculiarity they have derived their family
                    name. Only two genera are here included, and these are closely allied to each
                    other, although the generality of authors have placed them widely apart.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi> Lop∏ιus,Linn. Besides the semi-cartilaginous
                    nature of the skeleton, and the want of scales on the skin, has for its general
                    character pectorals supported as if by two arms, each of them sustained by two
                    bones, which have been compared to the radius and cubitus, but which in reality
                    belong to the carpus, and arc more elongated in this genus than in any other.
                    The ventrals are placed greatly in advance of the pectorals, and the opercles
                    and rays of the branchiae are enveloped in the skin, while the gills open only
                    by a single hole, pierced behind the pectorals. The species are voracious; they
                    have a large stomach and a short intestine, and are able to live for a very long
                    period out of the water, on account of the small opening of their gills. The
                    kinds now included in this genus, in the restricted sense attached to it by
                    Cuvier, have the head excessively large in proportion to the rest of the body,
                    and at the same time broad and depressed, and spiny in many places; the opening
                    of the mouth very wide, and armed with pointed teeth; and the lower jaw
                    furnished with numerous barbels. There are two distinct dorsals, of which the
                    anterior possesses some detached rays, moveable over the head, where they rest
                    on a horizontal inter-spinal; the branchial membrane forming a very large sac
                    opening in the axilla, and supported by six very long rays; the operculum small.
                    It is asserted that they lie among the mud, and by putting in motion the rays of
                    their head, attract small fishes, which, mistaking the broad and fleshy
                    extremities of these rays for worms, thus become the prey of the Lophii. It is
                    also said that they can seize and retain their prey by means of their large
                    branchial sacs. Their intestine has two very short caeca towards its origin, and
                    the swimming bladder is awanting. Of these fishes, the most remarkable is the

                    slender, often terminating by a tuft; and the following, increased by a
                    membrane, are sometimes greatly inflated, and at other times united into a
                    single fin. Their body and head are compressed, and the mouth opens vertically;
                    their gill-covers, provided with four rays, open only by a canal, and a small
                    hole behind the pectoral; the dorsal occupies nearly all the back. The whole
                    body is sometimes garnished with cutaneous appendages. The branchiae are four in
                    number; the swimming bladder is large, and the intestine of moderate size and
                    without caeca. By filling their enormous stomach with air, after the manner of
                    the Tetrodons, they can inflate their abdomen like a balloon. When on land,
                    their fins assist them in creeping, which they do almost after the manner of
                    small quadrupeds, the pectorals, from their position, performing the office of
                    hinder legs. Moving about in this manner, they can live without entering the
                    water for two or three days. They are found in tropical seas; and Linnaeus
                    appears to have confounded several species under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lophius</hi><hi rend="italic">histrio.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Malthe,
                    Cuv.</hi> Has the head unusually large and flattened, principally by the
                    projection of the sub-operculum: the eyes placed very far forwards; the muzzle
                    projecting like a little horn, and the mouth situate under it, the latter being
                    of moderate size and protractile; the gill-covers supported by six or seven
                    rays, and open towards the back by a hole above each pectoral; the single dorsal
                    small and soft; the body covered with osseous tubercles, and having barbels
                    along the sides, but there are no free rays over the head. The swimming bladder
                    and ¢acca are wanting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Batraciius.</hi> Derives its name from a Greek word
                    signifying a frog, to which the species are thought to bear some resemblance, in
                    consequence of the enlargement of the head. The latter is flattened
                    horizontally, and wider than the body; the gape wide, and both the opercle and
                    sub-opercle spiny; the gill-covers six-rayed; the ventrale narrow, attached
                    under the throat, and consisting only of three rays, of which the first is wide
                    and elongated; and the pectorals supported by a short arm, formed by the
                    prolongation of the carpal bone. The first dorsal is short, supported by three
                    spiny rays; the second long and soft, which is also the case with the
                    corresponding anal one. The lips are often garnished with filaments. Such as
                    have been dissected have their stomach in the form of an oblong sac, the
                    intestines short and without caeca. The swimming bladder is deeply furcate
                    anteriorly. They conceal themselves in the sand, lying in ambush for tĥeir prey.
                    The wounds made by their spines are supposed to be dangerous. The species, which
                    vary considerably in their form and aspect, occur both in the Pacific and
                    Atlantic Oceans.</p>
                <p>FAMILY XIV LABRIDAE.</p>
                <p>Easily recognised by its external aspect. The body is oblong and scaly, and the
                    single dorsal fin is supported anteriorly by spines, each of which is generally
                    garnished with a membranous appendage. The jaws are covered by fleshy lips; the
                    two upper pharyngeals are supported against the cranium, and the lower one is
                    large, all the three armed with teeth, sometimes <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pave,</hi> at other times pointed or in the form of plates, but
                    generally stronger than usual. The intestinal canal is entirely without caeca,
                    or only with two very small ones; and there is a strong swimming bladder.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Labrus</hi> of Linnaeus forms an extensive group
                    of fishes, very like each other in their oblong shape, and double fleshy lips
                    (from which circumstance they derive their name), one of which is immediately
                    connected with the jaws, and the other with the sub-orbitals; the gills are
                    serrated, and have five rays; the maxillary teeth conic, the middle and anterior
                    ones being longest; the pharyngeal teeth cylindrical and blunt, disposed <hi
                    rend="italic">en pave,</hi> the superior on two large plates, the inferior on a
                    single one corresponding to the two above. The stomach is not in the form of a
                    cul-de-sac, but is continuous with an intestine without caeca, which, after two
                    convolutions, terminates in a large rectum. The swimming bladder is robust and
                    simple. The species are numerous, and the colours of many of them liable to so
                    much variation that it is difficult to distinguish them with precision.</p>
                <p>In recent times the Linnaean genus has been subdivided as follows:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Labrus,</hi> properly so called. Opercle and
                    pre-opercle destitute both of spines and dentations; cheeks and opercle covered
                    with scales; lateral line straight, or nearly so.</p>
                <p>Four different kinds have been described as inhabiting the British seas, but some
                    of these seem to be mere varieties, such, for example, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >L.</hi><hi rend="italic">balanus</hi><hi rend="italic">and. L. comber</hi> of
                    Pennant, which are probably referrible to the <hi rend="italic">Labrus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maculatus</hi> of Bloch. <hi rend="italic">L.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lineatus</hi> is likewise a British species. The ground colour is
                    reddish, with one or more irregular clouded bands of a deeper colour along the
                    flanks. The dorsal has from sixteen to seventeen spines, and is marked with a
                    dark-coloured spot anteriorly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Cheilinus,</hi> Lacép. Differs from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labri</hi> properly so called, by the lateral line being
                    interrupted opposite the dorsal fin, and commencing again a little lower. The
                    scales at the extremity' of the tail are large, and partially envelope the base
                    of the caudal. They are fishes of considerable beauty, and are found in the
                    Indian seas.</p>
                <p>The next genus of interest is that named <hi rend="smallcaps">Julis,</hi> in
                    which the head is entirely smooth and without scales, and the lateral line is
                    much bent opposite the end of the dorsal. Several species occur in tĥe Atlantic
                    and Mediterranean, and most of them are of very beautiful colours. The most
                    common European one <hi rend="italic">(Labrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Julis,</hi>
                    Linn.) is frequent in the Mediterranean, and has likewise been found on the
                    coast of Cornwall. It is about seven inches in length, and of a beautiful
                    violet, relieved by a bright zigzag orange band on each side.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Crenilabrus</hi> has been separated by Cuvier from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lutjani of</hi> Bloch, and associated with the <hi

                    internal, correspond, except the dentation of the edge of the pre-opercle. (See
                    Plate CCCIV. fig. 6.) Several species are found in the northern seas, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Luĳanus rupestris,</hi> Bloch, 250, of a yellow colour, with
                    clouded vertical bands. The British species <hi rend="italic">(C. tinea)</hi>

                <p>To the characters of the <hi rend="italic">Crenilabri,</hi> the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cori-</hi> cus of Cuvier joins that of a mouth nearly as
                    protractile as in the <hi rend="italic">Epibuli.</hi> The latter group are very
                    remarkable for this property, being capable of extending it to a great length,
                    and suddenly forming it into a kind of tube by a peculiar movement of the
                    maxillaries. They practise this artifice to seize small fishes as they swim
                    within reach of this singular instrument. Several allied genera avail themselves
                    of the greater or less protractility of their jaws to procure their food in a
                    similar manner.</p>
                <p>The whole body, and the head of the <hi rend="italic">Epibuli,</hi> are covered
                    with large scales, the hinder row of which encroaches even on the anal and
                    caudal fins, as likewise takes place among the <hi rend="italic">Cheilini.</hi>
                    The lateral line is interrupted in a similar manner, and, in common with these
                    last-named fishes, and the <hi rend="italic">Labri,</hi> they have two long
                    conical teeth in front of each jaw, and behind them small blunt ones. Those of
                    the pharynx have not been observed. The <hi rend="italic">Sparus insidiator</hi>
                    of Pallas is the only species hitherto discovered. It is of a reddish colour,
                    and found in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Clepticus.</hi> Furnished with a small cylindrical
                    muzzle, which rises suddenly like that of the <hi rend="italic">Epibuli,</hi>
                    but is not so long as the head, and scarcely permits the view of a few small
                    teeth; the body is oblong, the head obtuse, the lateral line continuous, and the
                    scales envelope the dorsal and anal fins, almost as far as the summit of the
                    spines. The only ascertained species <hi rend="italic">(C. genizara)</hi> is of
                    a reddish purple colour, and inhabits the Antilles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Elops,</hi> Commers. <hi rend="italic">Gomphosis,</hi>
                    Lacép. Has the head entirely smooth, as in <hi rend="italic">Julis,</hi> but the
                    muzzle is in the form of a long and slender tube, formed by the prolongation of
                    their inter-maxillaries and mandibularies, which the integuments bind together
                    as far as the small opening of the mouth. Of these fishes, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gomphosis</hi><hi rend="italic">coeruleus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >G.</hi><hi rend="italic">variegatus,</hi> Lacép., may serve as examples. They
                    are taken in the Indian seas, and many of them are said to form a delicious
                    article of food. The preceding genera, from <hi rend="italic">Labrus properly so
                    called</hi> inclusive, may be all regarded as Linnaean <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labri.</hi> We now come to <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Xiricγithys, Cuv.</hi>
                    Which comprehends fishes resembling the <hi rend="italic">Labri</hi> in form,
                    but they are very much compressed, and the forehead descends suddenly towards
                    the mouth by a deep and nearly vertical line, formed by the ethmoid and the
                    ascending branches of the inter-maxillaries. The body is covered with large
                    scales; the lateral line interrupted; the jaws armed with a row of conical
                    teeth, of which the medial ones are longest, and the pharynx paved with
                    hemispherical teeth; the intestinal canal is continuous, with two convolutions,
                    and no caeca, nor is the stomach in the form of a cul-de-sac. They possess a
                    pretty large air-bladder.</p>
                <p>Naturalists, anterior to the time of Cuvier, ranged the species with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coryphaence,</hi> from which they greatly differ in their
                    structure, internal as well as external. They approximate to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labri,</hi> to which, however, they are dissimilar in the profile
                    of the head.</p>

                    are filamentous, and even those of the abdomen are often prolonged into long
                    filets, and the lateral line is interrupted. The stomach is a cul-de-sac, but
                    there are no caeca. One small species, of a chestnutbrown colour <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sparus chromis},</hi> is found in immense numbers in the
                    Mediterranean. The Nile produces another, which attains the length of two feet,
                    and is regarded as the best fish occurring in Egypt. It is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Niloticus</hi> of Hasselq. and Sonnini. The genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cychla</hi> differs from the preceding by having all the
                    teeth crowded, and placed in a broad band, and by the body being more elongated.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Plesiops, Cuv.,</hi> has the head compressed, the eyes near

                    in the Antilles, of a yellowish colour, irregularly rayed across with violet; it
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Coryphena plumicri,</hi> Lacép. iv. viii. 1.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Scarus,</hi> Linn.
                    Comprehends fishes very remarkable on account of the form of the jaws (that is,
                    their inter-maxillary and pre-mandibularybones), which are convex, rounded, and
                    garnished with teeth like scales upon their edges and anterior surface; these
                    teeth succeed each other from behind forwards, so that those of the base are the
                    newest, and in time come to form a range upon the cutting edge. Naturalists have
                    erroneously thought that the jaw-bones themselves were naked or exposed. These
                    jaws are, besides, covered while the fish is alive by fleshy lips, but there is
                    no double lip adherent to the sub-orbitaries. The species have the oblong form
                    of Labrus, with large scales, and the lateral line interrupted; they bear on
                    their pharynx two plates above and one below, garnished with teeth like the
                    pharyngeal plates of the Labri, but these teeth are in the form of transverse
                    laminae, and not <hi rend="italic">en pavé.</hi></p>
                <p>Cuvier is of opinion that the <hi rend="italic">Scarus creticus</hi> of
                    Aldrovandus is the species so celebrated under the qame of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Searus</hi> by the ancients, and in search of which (in the time of Claudius)
                    Elipertius Optatus, the commander of the Roman fleet, went to Greece, with a
                    view to effect its introduction to the Italian seas. It is still used in our
                    days as an article of food in Greece. The species are numerous in the seas of
                    warm climates, and are vulgarly known, on account of the peculiar form of the
                    jaws, and the splendour of their colours, under the name of parrot fishes.</p>

                <p>Characterised by a long tube formed in front of the cranium, by the prolongation
                    of the ethmoid, the vomer, the pre-opercles, inter-opercles, &amp;c. at the end
                    of which the mouth is placed, composed, as usual, of inter-maxillaries,
                    maxillaries, palatines, and mandibularies. The intestine is without any
                    considerable inequalities, or many convolutions, and their ribs are either short
                    or wanting. Some of them (the <hi rend="italic">Eistularice)</hi> have the body

                    Acquires its name from the long tube common to all the family. The jaws are at
                    the extremity, opening but little, and nearly in a horizontal direction. The
                    head, thus elongated, composes a third or fourth part of the whole body, which
                    is itself long and slender. There are six or seven rays in the gills; the
                    osseous appendages likewise extend behind the head to the anterior part of the
                    body, which they tend more or less to strengthen. The dorsal corresponds to the
                    position of the anal, and the stomach, in the form of a fleshy tube, is
                    continuous with a narrow canal, without folds, at the commencement of which
                    there are two caeca. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fistularia</hi> properly so called,
                    there is only one dorsal, which, as well as the anal, is composed chiefly of
                    simple rays; the inter-maxillaries and lower jaw are armed with small teeth; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192940363" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0363-0197"/> and between the
                    lobes of the caudal there issues a filament sometimes as long as the whole body;
                    the tube of the muzzle is very long and depressed, the swimming bladder
                    excessively large, and the scales invisible. In the subdivision called <hi

                    the dorsal is preceded by numerous free spines, and the jaws are without teeth.
                    The body, which is very scaly, is broad, and compressed between the dorsal and
                    anal, the latter followed by a short, small tail, terminated by the usual fin.
                    The tube of the muzzle is rather short, large, and compressed; the swimming
                    bladder very large. We are acquainted with only one species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Fistularia</hi><hi rend="italic">chinensis,</hi> Bl.), which is found in the
                    Indian seas.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Centrisci</hi> of Linn, possess the tubular trunk of
                    this family; the body, however, is not elongated, but oval or oblong, compressed
                    laterally, and sharp on the under side; the gills have only two or three slender
                    rays; the first dorsal is spiny, and the small ventrals are placed behind the
                    pectorals. The mouth is extremely small, and opens obliquely; the intestines are
                    without caeca, folded three or four times; and the swimming bladder is of
                    considerable size. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Centriscus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >properly so called,</hi> the anterior dorsal, which is placed very far
                    forwards, has its first spine long and strong, supported by an apparatus
                    connected with the shoulder and head. The species arc covered with small scales,
                    and have several broad and denticulated plates on the apparatus just mentioned.
                    The <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">scolopax,</hi> or trumpet-fish,
                    is a very common species in the Mediterranean, about five inches long, and of a
                    silvery lustre. (See Plate CCC1V. fig. 7.) It occurs occasionally on the
                    south-western coasts of England. In the sub-genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphisile,</hi> the back is defended with large sealypieces, of which the
                    anterior spine and the first dorsal have the appearance of being a continuation.
                    All the species hitherto known to us are from the Indian seas: we may mention as

                    >Malacopterygn,</hi> contains within itself three orders, which admit of being

                    absence.</p>

                    ABDOMINALES.</p>
                <p>These are distinguished by having their ventrals suspended to the under part of
                    the abdomen, and behind the pectorals, without any attachment to the shoulder
                    bone. This is the most numerous of the three orders, and includes a large
                    proportion of the fresh-water fishes. It is divisible into five families.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I—CYPRINIDAE.</p>
                <p>May be known by having the mouth but slightly cleft, the jaws weak and generally
                    without teeth, and their edge formed by the inter-maxillaries; by pharyngeals
                    strongly toothed, thus compensating for the imperfect armature of the jaws; and
                    by the branchial rays being few in number. Their body is scaly, and there is no
                    adipose dorsal, such as is observed in Siluri and salmon. Their stomach has no
                    cul-de-sac, and the pylorus is without caecal appendages. They are the least
                    carnivorous of fishes.</p>
                <p>The typical genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyprinus</hi> is a very natural one, and
                    comprehends a great number of species, which are readily distinguished by the
                    small mouth, toothless jaws, and the three flat branchial rays. Their tongue is
                    smooth, and the palate provided with a soft and singularly irritable substance,
                    vulgarly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Carps tongue.</hi> The pharynx
                    presents a powerful instrument for mastication, consisting of large teeth
                    attached to the inferior pharyngeal bones, and capable of pressing the food
                    between them, and a stony disk enclosed in a wide cavity under an apophysis of
                    the basilary bone. These fishes have only one dorsal, and the body is covered
                    with scales, most frequently of large size. They inhabit fresh waters, and are
                    perhaps the least carnivorous of their class, subsisting chiefly on grains,
                    grass, and even on mud. Their stomach is continuous, with a short intestine
                    without caeca, and the bladder is divided into two by a constriction.</p>

                    well as the anal, has a spine for the second ray. Of these, some have barbels at
                    the angles of the upper jaw, and others are destitute of these appendages. Of
                    the former we may cite as an example the common carp; and the goldfish of China
                    affords an instance of the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">carpio,</hi> the common carp.
                    This well-known fish is of an olive-green, yellowish beneath, having the anal
                    and dorsal spines strong and denticulated, and the barbels short; the pharyngeal
                    teeth are flat and striated on the crown. It is a native of the central
                    countries of Europe; but, owing to its value as an article of food, it was early
                    distributed by human agency over the whole of that Continent. The ease with
                    which it can be transported from one place to another, and its speedy growth and
                    propagation in ponds and artificial reservoirs, afforded great facilities for
                    its rapid dispersion. The year 1614 is assigned as the date of its first
                    introduction into England; but it was naturalized in Germany and Sweden nearly
                    half a century before that period. It delights in tranquil waters, preferring
                    such as have a muddy bottom, and the surface partially shaded with plants. Its
                    food consists of the larvae of aquatic insects, minute Testacea, worms, and the
                    tender blades and shoots of plants. The leaves of lettuce, and other succulent
                    plants of a similar kind, are said to be particularly agreeable to them, and to
                    fatten them sooner than any other food. Although the carp eats with great
                    voracity when its supply of aliment is abundant,—to such a degree, indeed, as
                    sometimes to produce indigestion, which occasionally proves fatal,—it can
                    subsist for an astonishing length of time without nourishment. In the winter,
                    when they assemble in great numbers, and bury themselves among the mud and the
                    roots of plants, they often remain for many months without eating. They can also
                    be preserved alive for a considerable length of time out of the water,
                    especially if care be taken to moisten them occasionally as they become dry.
                    Advantage is often taken of this circumstance to transport them alive, by
                    packing them among damp herbage, or wet linen; and the operation is said to be
                    unattended with any risk to the animal, especially if the precaution be taken to
                    put a piece of bread in its mouth <hi rend="italic">steeped in brandy!</hi> In a
                    similar way, the Dutch preserve them by suspending them from the roof of a damp
                    apartment in a bag-net filled with moss, which is continually kept moist, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192940376" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0376-0198"/> and they are fed
                    with vegetables and bread steeped in milk,—a mode of treatment by which they are
                    not only kept alive, but actually thrive and fatten.</p>
                <p>The fecundity of these fishes is very great, and their numbers consequently would
                    soon become excessive, but for the many enemies by which their spawn is
                    destroyed. No fewer than 700,000 eggs have been found in the ovaria of a single
                    carp, and that too by no means an individual of the largest size. Their growth
                    is very rapid, more so perhaps than that of any other fresh-water fish, and the
                    size which they sometimes attain is very considerable. In certain lakes in
                    Germany and Prussia, individuals are occasionally taken weighing thirty or forty
                    pounds; and Pallas relates that they occur in the Volga five feet in leagth, and
                    even of greater weight than the examples just alluded to. The largest of which
                    we have any account is that mentioned by Bloch, taken near
                    Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which weighed seventy pounds, and measured nearly nine
                    feet in length.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cyprinus auratus</hi> (gold fish). This beautiful species, the
                    most brilliantly adorned of all our fresh-water fishes, and scarcely surpassed
                    even by the more richly ornamented inhabitants of the ocean, is well known to be
                    a native of China, although it is now domesticated, so to speak, in almost every
                    country, both of the old and new world. Like the carp, it has the dorsal and
                    anal spines denticulated. When young it is of a blackish colour, and it
                    gradually acquires the fine golden red by which it is characterised; but some
                    examples are of a silvery hue, and others are variegated with three different
                    shades of colour. Like most other animals that have been long estranged from
                    their natural habits, and subjected to artificial influences, this species
                    presents a great many varieties, extending even to some important parts of
                    structure. Individuals occur without a dorsal, others with a very large one,
                    others with the caudal greatly enlarged, and divided into three or four lobes;
                    and in some instances the eyes are enormously dilated.<note anchored="true"

                    paigter of the name of Martinet.</p></note> The golden carp is said to have been
                    originally confined to a lake near the mountain <hi rend="italic">Tsieking,</hi>
                    in the province of <hi rend="italic">The-kiang,</hi> in China, about the 30th
                    degree <hi rend="italic">of</hi> N. lat. It was first brought to England in
                    1691, but was very scarce till 1728, when a considerable number were imported,
                    and they soon became generally known. They do not flourish in rivers and open
                    ponds, not, however, because such places are uncongenial to them, but because
                    they are exposed to many enemies, against which they have no means of defence.
                    When kept in confinement they ought to be nourished with fine crumbs of bread,
                    small worms, flies, and yolks of eggs dried and powdered, and the water ought to
                    be frequently changed. The ordinary length of this species is from four to six
                    inches; but they have been sometimes known to reach a foot. Although natives of
                    a warm climate, they can sustain a great degree of cold uninjured. An
                    individual, which was accidentally exposed during the night, was completely
                    frozen up in the centre of its glass jar; but as the ice thawed it recovered its
                    vigour, and seemed to suffer no further inconvenience.</p>
                <p>To this group belongs the smallest of the European Cyprini, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">amarus,</hi> which is about an inch long,
                    greenish above, and of a fine red beneath. During the time of spawning, which
                    takes place in April, it has a steel-blue line on each side of the tail; the
                    second dorsal ray forms a rather stiff spine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Barbus</hi> of Cuvier, contains such species as have
                    the dorsal and anal short, with a strong spine for the second or third ray of
                    the dorsal, and four barbels, two of which are at the extremity, and two at the
                    angles of the upper jaw. As an example, we may refer to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">barbus,</hi> or barbel, which may be known by
                    its oblong head. It is very common in clear and running waters, where it
                    sometimes attains to a length exceeding ten feet. Several allied species are
                    found in Italy, having the spine weaker, but which, nevertheless, differ from
                    the following genus by possessing four barbels. Such are <hi rend="italic"

                    fish, seldom exceeding seven or eight inches, and is found in most parts of
                    Europe in small lakes and gently flowing rivers. It is of a pale olive-brown
                    colour, slightly spotted with black, especially on the fins, the sides and
                    abdomen being silvery white. It spawns in the spring, and as it deposits its ova
                    at distant intervals, the operation generally continues for a considerable time.
                    It is a very prolific fish; and as its flesh is of a very delicate flavour, it
                    is much sought after for the table.</p>

                    of a deep yellowish brown, sometimes, however, assuming a fine golden colour.
                    Its usual length is from twelve to fourteen inches; but instances are on record
                    of its having reached three feet. It inhabits stagnant waters with a muddy
                    bottom; and in the winter conceals itself among the mud, and seems to undergo a
                    kind of torpidity. In May and June it deposits its ova among aquatic plants;
                    these are very minute, of a green colour, and so numerous that 297,000 have been
                    reckoned in one female. The tench is very extensively distributed, appearing to
                    occur throughout the whole globe. Its flesh is not much esteemed, as it is soft,

                    >brama),</hi> and the little bream <hi rend="italic">(Cyp∙ blicca, C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">latus,</hi> Gm. Bl. 10). The former is the largest fish in this
                    subdivision; there are twenty-nine rays in the anal, and all the fins are
                    obscure. It is common in slow flowing rivers and lakes in most European
                    countries. It sometimes acquires two feet and a half in length, but its ordinary
                    dimensions may be stated to be about a foot. Worms, confervae, and aquatic
                    plants are its usual food; but, like many allied species, it often swallows mud,
                    which renders its flesh unsavoury. “There exists in the river Trent, in the
                    neighbourhood of Newark, two species or varieties of bream. The common bream,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">brama,</hi> is known there by
                    the name of Carp Bream, from its yellow colour, and has been taken of nearly
                    eight pounds weight. The other species or variety, which 1 believe to be a
                    non-descript, never exceeds a pound in weight. It is of a silvery hue, and goes
                    by the name of White Bream.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >Catastomus,</hi> of which the species are all foreign, and imperfectly known,
                    we now come to the generic group named <hi rend="smallcaps">Leuciscus</hi>
                    (Klein), comprehending several kinds indigenous to Europe. They have the dorsal
                    and anal short, and are destitute of spines and barbels, and there is nothing
                    particular<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940389" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0389-0199"/> in
                    the structure of the lips. The species of this subdivision are considerable in
                    amount, but they are held in little estimation as articles of food. They are
                    distinguished by the position of the dorsal, a character, however, which is not
                    always sufficiently defined. In some it corresponds to the position of the
                    ventrals; such is the case with <hi rend="italic">Lew. dobula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">dobula,</hi> Linn.), in which the
                    head is broad, the muzzle rounded, and the pectorals red. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lew.</hi><hi rend="italic">rutilus</hi> (the roach), has the body compressed
                    and silvery, and all the fins red. In others, the dorsal corresponds above to
                    the interval which is between the ventrals and the anal. This is exemplified in
                    <hi rend="italic">Leuc.</hi><hi rend="italic">alburnus</hi> (the bleak), in
                    which the body is narrow, and of a brilliant silvery hue; the fins pale; the
                    forehead straight, and the inferior jaws somewhat elongated. It is common
                    throughout Europe; and is one of the fishes whose nacre (or silvery-looking
                    substance) is employed in fabricating artificial pearls. <hi rend="italic">Leuc.
                    phoxinus</hi> (common minnow) likewise pertains to this group. The appearance of
                    this beautiful little fish is familiar to all. It is the smallest species of the
                    genus found in Europe, the greatest length which it attains seldom exceeding
                    three inches. It first makes its appearance in March, and disappears in October,
                    passing the winter beneath the mud. It is well known to be a gregarious species,
                    and small shoals are to be found in almost every shallow stream, especially in
                    clear weather, as they seem to delight in warmth and sunshine. They usually
                    spawn in the month of June, but their ova are often found at a much later
                    period. The flesh of the minnow is delicate and well flavoured, but its size is
                    too small to admit of its being of much value as an article of food. It is
                    principally used as a bait for the capture of larger kinds.</p>
                <p>Certain species of the present genus (the Chelae of Buchanan) have the dorsal
                    corresponding to the commencement of the anal, and in several of these the body
                    is compressed nearly in the same manner as in some of the <hi rend="italic"

                    the mouth at the end of the muzzle, but little cleft and without teeth, but
                    surrounded with lips fitted for sucking, and by barbels; gill-covers little
                    opened, and having only three rays. Their inferior pharyngeal bones are rather
                    strongly dentated, their intestines are without any caeca, and their swimming
                    bladder, which is very small, is enclosed in an osseous bilobate case, attached
                    to the third and fourth vertebrae. Three species are found in the fresh waters
                    of Europe, viz. <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">barbatula,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">fossilis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    taenia.</hi> The first of these, the bearded loach, is a well-known fish in this
                    country, as it occurs plentifully in almost every small stream. It is about four
                    or five inches long. The second species, which does not occur in Britain,
                    measures sometimes a foot m length. It dwells in the mud of ponds, and is so
                    tenacious of life as to live a long time after being stiffly frozen, or even
                    dried. In stormy weather it rises to the surface and agitates the water. It
                    swallows quantities of air, which it converts, according to Μ. Ehrman’s
                    observations, into carbonic acid. Its flesh is soft, and savours of mud. The
                    third species was introduced into the British Fauna by Berkenhout. Turton says
                    it occurs in the “clear streams of Wiltshire.”</p>
                <p>The fishes which Bloch distinguished by the name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anableps</hi> (a term first used by Artedi, and signifying to raise the cyes,
                    or to look up, being derived from cba∕3λ⅛ω) were long united with the loaches,
                    although they afford characters of a very distinctive kind. Their eyes, which
                    are very salient, and placed under an arch formed on each side by the frontal
                    bone, have the cornea and iris divided into two portions by transverse bands, in
                    such a manner that they have two pupils, and appear double, although in reality
                    there is only a single crystalline and vitreous humour, and one retina,—a
                    peculiarity of which no other instance is to be found among vertebrate animals.
                    The organs of génération, moreover, and the bladder of the male, have their
                    excretory canal in the anterior border of the anal fin, which is thick, long,
                    and clothed with scales; its extremity is perforated, and no doubt subserves the
                    generative functions. The female is viviparous, and the young are not produced
                    till they have attained a considerable size.</p>
                <p>The body of these fishes is cylindrical, and covered with scales; there are five
                    branchial rays, the head is flat, the muzzle truncated, the mouth cleft
                    transversely at the and, and armed in both jaws with numerous small teeth. The
                    inter-maxillaries are without a pedicle, and suspended under the nasal bones,
                    which form the anterior edge of the muzzle. The pectorals are in a great measure
                    scaly, and a small dorsal is placed over the tail, and further back than the
                    anal. Their pharyngeal bones are large, and provided with numerous small
                    globular teeth; their air-bladder is very large, and also their intestine; but
                    the latter is without caeca. Only one species is known, which is an inhabitant
                    of the rivers of Guiana. It is the <hi rend="italic">Anableps
                    tetrop-thalmus,</hi> Bl. 361. See Plate CCCIV. fig. 8.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Poecilia,</hi> Schn. Has the two jaws flattened
                    horizontally, protractile, slightly cleft, furnished with a series of small and
                    very fine teeth, the upper side of the head flattened, the opercula large, five
                    branchial rays, the body not much elongated, the ventrals not far back, and the
                    dorsal placed just above the anal. They are all small viviparous fishes, and
                    inhabit the fresh waters of America. The only remaining genera included in the

                <p>FAMILY II—ESOCIDAE.</p>
                <p>Corresponds to the undivided genus Esox, as established by Linnaeus. It is
                    characterised by the want of the adipose dorsal; by having the edge of the upper
                    jaw formed by the iuter-maxillary, or at least, when not wholly formed by that
                    bone, the maxillary is without teeth, and concealed in the thickness of the
                    lips. They arc a very voracious tribe of fishes; their intestine is short and
                    without caeca, and all are provided with a swimming bladder. With the exception
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Microstoma,</hi> all the kinds with which we are
                    acquainted have the dorsal opposite the anal.</p>
                <p>In the Cuvierian system this family is divided into many genera, of the principal
                    of which we shall now proceed to give some account. Such fishes as belong to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi> Esox, in its present restricted acceptation, have
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940402" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0402-0200"/>small
                    inter-maxillaries provided with minute pointed teeth in the middle of the upper
                    jaw, of which they form the two thirds; but the maxillaries occupying the sides
                    are without teeth. The vomer, the palatines, the tongue, the pharyngeals, and
                    the arches of the branchiae, are covered with teeth resembling those of a card;
                    and, in addition to these, a series of long pointed teeth occupy the sides of
                    the lower jaw. Tire snout is oblong and obtuse, broad and depressed; and there
                    is only one dorsal opposite the anal. The stomach, which is large and plicate,
                    is continuous with a slender doubly-folded intestine without caeca. The swimming
                    bladder is very large. There is only one European species, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">Esox lucius,</hi> Linn, (the common pike), Plate CCCIV. fig. 9.
                    During the earliest stage of its life it is of a greenish hue, but in the second
                    year it becomes gray with pale spots, the latter ultimately acquiring a
                    yellowish colour. Its markings, however, are very variable, and instances have
                    occurred of its being perfectly white. It is one of the largest of fresh-water
                    fishes, and indeed, if the accounts which some writers give are not exaggerated,
                    it occasionally attains a size not greatly inferior to the gigantic inhabitants
                    of the ocean. Individuals are recorded as measuring from five to nine feet in
                    length. They frequently weigh above thirty pounds in the lakes of the north of
                    England; and Dr Grierson mentions one taken in Loch Ken, in Galloway, which
                    weighed sixty-one pounds. Bloch indeed examined a portion of the skeleton of
                    another which could not be less than eight feet in length. The most remarkable
                    pike, however, of which we have any authentic account, is that caught at
                    Kaiserslautern, near Manheim, in 1497, which was nearly nineteen feet in length,
                    and weighed 350 pounds. The skeleton of this extraordinary specimen was for a
                    long time preserved, and bore a brass ring with an inscription to the effect
                    that the fish was put into a pond by the hands of the Emperor Frederick II., the
                    5th of October 1262. From this it is inferred that it was upwards of 235 years
                    old. Pikes are proverbially voracious. There seems indeed to be no bounds to
                    their gluttony, for they devour indiscriminately whatever edible substances they
                    fall in with, and almost every animal they are able to subdue. “It is,” says Μ.
                    de Lacépède, “the shark of the fresh waters; it reigns there a devastating
                    tyrant, like the shark in the midst of the ocean; insatiable in its appetites,
                    it ravages with fearful rapidity the streams, the lakes, and the fish-ponds
                    where it inhabits. Blindly ferocious, it does not spare its species, and even
                    devours its own young; gluttonous without choice, it tears and swallows with a
                    sort of fury, the remains even of putrified carcasses. This blood-thirsty animal
                    is also one of those to which nature has accorded the longest duration of
                    .years; for ages it terrifies, agitates, pursues, destroys, and consumes the
                    feeble inhabitants of the waters which it infests; and as if, in spite of its
                    insatiable cruelty, it was meant that it should receive every advantage, it has
                    not only been gifted with strength, with size, with numerous weapons, but it has
                    also been adorned with elegance of form, symmetry of proportions, and variety
                    and richness of colour.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    e cannot, however, agree with Μ. Lacépède in his admiration of the general
                    appearance of the pike, tor we think its long lank jaws and sunken eye give it
                    rather a diabolical aspect.</p></note> A singular instance of its voracity is
                    related by Johnston, who asserts that he saw one killed which contained in its
                    belly another pike of large size, and the latter on being opened was found to
                    have swallowed a water-rat!</p>
                <p>The pike inhabits almost all the fresh waters of Europe, but seems to flourish
                    most in the northern and middle countries. It likewise occurs in abundance in
                    Asia and North America. Its flesh is well flavoured and easy of digestion, and
                    is consequently much sought after as an article of food, especially for
                    convalescents, and others of weakly habit. It is most tender and nutritive in
                    young individuals, but full-grown pikes are occasionally found, in which the
                    flesh on the back and near the vertebral column acquires a greenish colour,
                    which is held in high repute, and often purchased at a great price.</p>

                    of <hi rend="italic">Egyptian herring.</hi> It sometimes leaps so actively out
                    of the water as to pass over a space of thirty or forty feet. Of the nearly
                    allied genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hemi-ramphus, Cuv.</hi> several species are to
                    be found in the warm latitudes of both hemispheres. Although their flesh is
                    oily, it is of an agreeable taste.</p>
                <p>We now come to a tribe of fishes which have attracted much attention, owing to
                    the power they possess of leaping to a great height into the air, and even
                    sustaining themselves in that element for a perceptible time. This faculty,
                    which has caused them to be named <hi rend="italic">flying fishes,</hi> they owe
                    to the excessive development of their pectorals, a peculiarity which readily
                    distinguishes them from all other abdominal fishes. Their bead and body are
                    clothed with scales, and a longitudinal series of carinated scales forms a
                    salient line at the bottom of each flank, as in some of the genera last
                    described. The head is flattened above and on the sides; the dorsal is placed
                    above the anal, the eyes are large, the inter-maxillaries without pedicles, and
                    themselves forming the edge of the upper jaw. The two jaws are furnished with
                    small pointed teeth, and the pharyngeal bones with teeth <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">pave.</hi> Such as present these characters are to be
                    referred to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Exocetus,</hi> Linn., a name which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">lying out,</hi> and which was given by the ancient
                    Greeks to a fish that was reported to be in the habit of coming to repose on
                    shore. They are further characterised by having ten branchial rays, a very large
                    swimming bladder, and straight intestines without caeca; the upper lobe of the
                    caudal fin is the shortest.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eχocetus</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans,</hi> Bloch, 398
                    (see Plate CCCIV. fig. 11), is a well-known flying fish of the ocean (but not to
                    be confounded, as it has sometimes been, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigla</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans,</hi> or flying gurnard, already alluded
                    to under the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dactylopterus).</hi> It is common in
                    many of the warmer parts of the northern hemisphere, especially between
                    Teneriffe and the line. It is also said to occur occasionally in the
                    Mediterranean, and may be recognised by its large eyes, and the smallness of the
                    ventral fins, which are placed in advance of the centre of the body. Its mouth
                    is slightly tubular, its scales deciduous, and its size from six to twelve
                    inches. A species more common in the Mediterranean is the <hi rend="italic">E.
                    exiliens,</hi> Bloch, 397, of which the ventrals are long, and placed behind the
                    centre of the body. It attains to the length of fifteen inches. The young have
                    black bands upon the fins.</p>
                <p>Some difference of opinion seems still to exist in regard to the mode of flight
                    in these fishes. Mr Bennet supposes, that because they do not use their pectoral
                    fins in the air precisely as birds use their wings, that their progression ought
                    rather to be termed leaping than flying. “In fish,” he observes, “the organ of
                    motion for propelling them through the water is the tail, and the fins direct
                    their course; in birds, on the contrary, the wings are the organs of motion, and
                    the tail the rudder. The only use of the extended pectoral fins in the fish is
                    for the purpose of supporting the animal in the air, like a parachute, after it
                    has leaped from the water by <hi rend="italic">some power</hi> which is
                    possessed even by the whale. From the structure of the fin, I cannot consider it
                    at all calculated for repeated percussions out of the water; while in that
                    fluid, it continues its natural action uninjured; but it soon dries when brought
                    into contact with the air, and the delicacy of the membrane between the rays
                    would very readily become injured were the organ similarly exerted in that
                    medium. The greatest length of time that I have seen these <hi rend="italic"
                    >volatile</hi> fish on the <hi rend="italic">fin,</hi> has been thirty seconds
                    by the watch.... Their usual height of flight is from two to three feet; but I
                    have known them come on board at a height of fourteen feet; and they have been
                    well ascertained to come into the channels of a line-of-battle ship, <hi
                    rend="italic">i. e.</hi> as high as twenty feet and upwards. But it must not be
                    supposed that they have the power of elevating themselves in the air, after
                    having left their native element: on watching them, I have often seen them fall
                    much below the elevation at which they first rose from the water, but never in
                    any one instance could I observe them raise themselves above that height. I
                    therefore regard the elevation they take to depend on the power of the first
                    spring or leap they make on leaving their native element.”<note anchored="true"

                    Indeed, all voyagers, whether ancient or modern, have recorded the delight with
                    which they witnessed these sudden emergencies; and Bose in particular describes
                    the flying fish as sometimes rising in hundreds, and even thousands, around his
                    vessel, and darting over the waves in all directions, scouring away, as
                    Coleridge has beautifully said in relation to another group of animals, “like a
                    Tartar troop over the wilderness.” We shall conclude this notice by observing
                    that the flesh of flying fishes is savoury and delicate, and that they thus
                    present another claim to the attention of the voyager.</p>

                    intestines provided with two caeca, and which will probably be formed into a
                    particular family.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Mormyrus,</hi> Linn. Body compressed, oblong and
                    scaly; tail slender at the base, and enlarged towards the fin; head covered with
                    a thick naked skin, enveloping the opercula and the branchial rays, and leaving
                    for their aperture only a vertical cleft, a circumstance which has caused some
                    naturalists to deny the existence of opercula, although they are as complete as
                    in any other fish, and to assign to them only two branchial rays, although there
                    are five or six. The opening of the mouth is very small, almost as in those
                    Mammalia named anteaters, and the maxillaries form its angles. The teeth, which
                    are slender and notched at the end, cover the inter-maxillaries and the lower
                    jaw; while on the tongue, and under the vomer, there is a band of small and
                    crowded teeth. The stomach is in the form of a rounded sac, followed by two
                    caeca, and a long slender intestine always enveloped in a profusion of fat. The
                    bladder is long, large, and simple. Many of these fishes inhabit the Nile, and
                    they are ranked among the best which that river produces. It is conjectured that
                    it was one of them which the ancient Egyptians held in religious veneration, and
                    which they named <hi rend="italic">oxyrhincus.</hi></p>

                    only a naked skin, or large osseous plates. The inter-maxillaries, suspended
                    under the ethmoid, form the edge of the upper jaw; and the maxillaries are
                    reduced either to mere vestiges, or are lengthened into barbels. The intestinal
                    canal is large, folded, and without caeca; the bladder large, and adhering to a
                    peculiar osseous process; the dorsal and pectorals have almost always a strong
                    articulated spine for the first ray, and there is very frequently an adipose fin
                    behind, as in the Salmonidae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Silurus.</hi> A numerous
                    genus, known by its want of scales, the mouth cleft at the end of the snout,
                    and, in the greater number of sub-genera, by the first ray of the pectoral being
                    composed of a strong spine. This is articulated to the shoulder bone, in such a
                    manner that the animal at pleasure can either draw it towards its body or erect
                    it perpendicularly, in which case it becomes a dangerous weapon, and inflicts
                    wounds which in some countries are considered venomous, doubtless because
                    tetanus or lock-jaw sometimes ensues. The head of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluri</hi> is depressed; the maxillaries very small; and the covering of the
                    branchiae wants that piece which has been named by Cuvier the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sub-opercle.</hi></p>
                <p>In some species <hi rend="italic">(Silurus,</hi> Lacép. properly so called) there
                    is only one small fin, with few rays on the anterior part of the back, but the
                    anal is very long, and reaches nearly to the caudal. In others, more especially
                    so named by Artedi and Gronovius, the small dorsal is without any apparent
                    spine; the teeth on both jaws are like those of a wool card, and behind the
                    inter-maxillary band of teeth there is a vomerian band. Of this kind of
                    structure an example is found in <hi rend="italic">Silurus glanis,</hi> L. which
                    is the largest of European fresh-water fishes, and the only one of this
                    extensive genus inhabiting the Continent. See Plate CCCIV. fig. 12. It is
                    smooth, greenish black, spotted with black above, and yellowish-white beneath.
                    The head is large, with six barbels. It sometimes attains the length of twelve
                    or fifteen feet, and the weight of 300 or 400 pounds. As this creature is
                    somewhat unwieldy in its motions, it does not pursue its prey, which consists of
                    small fishes, but lies concealed among the mud, and seizes such unwary
                    stragglers as happen to come within reach. It has occasionally been observed in
                    the sea, but always near the mouths of rivers, and in such other situations as
                    to leave no doubt that its appearance there is to be ascribed to accidental
                    causes. The, flesh is fat and sweet, and its lard has been employed in ,some
                    places as a substitute for that of the hog. Sir Robert Sibbald, at the

                <p>A few fishes, found hitherto only in the Nile, differ from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siluri</hi> in having their bodies compressed vertically, and by having a
                    strong and denticulated spine to the dorsal. Their head is small and depressed,
                    the nape suddenly raised, and the eyes placed very low—circumstances which
                    bestow upon them a very singular appearance. They constitute the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Schilbus.</hi> The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pimelodi</hi> of
                    Lacépède are characterised by the body being covered only by a naked skin,
                    without lateral armature. This definition, however, comprehends a great number
                    of fishes, many of which present so many differences in appearance and
                    structure, that it is necessary that they should be grouped in several
                    subordinate genera. The first of these, established by Cuvier, and which he
                    names <hi rend="smallcaps">Bagrus,</hi> has in each jaw a band of small crowded
                    teeth, and behind those of the upper jaw a parallel band which belongs to the
                    vomer. They admit of still further subdivision, from the number of their barbels
                    and the form of their head. Among those having eight barbels, some have the head
                    oblong and depressed; in others it is broad and short. Of such as are furnished
                    with six barbels, the most remarkable have the muzzle depressed and broad, after
                    the manner of the pike; while others have the head of an oval form, and its
                    shagreened bones forming a kind of helmet. The <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pimelodi,</hi> however, <hi rend="italic">properly so called,</hi> have no band
                    of teeth on the vomer, parallel to that of the upper jaw, but there are often
                    some on the palatines. In the number of their barbels, and in the form of their
                    heads, these fishes present still more numerous varieties than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eαgri.</hi> Thus, among such as have only a single band of teeth,
                    some are observed to have the head helmeted, and a distinct osseous plate or
                    buckler between the helmet and the spine of the dorsal. Such is <hi
                    rend="italic">Sil. clarias,</hi> Bl. XXXV. 1, 2. In others the buckler is united
                    to the helmet, añd forms only a single body with it, the helmet thus extending
                    from the muzzle as far as the dorsal. In some instances the head is oval,
                    clothed only by the skin, through which the bones do not appear; in this group
                    the species have either six or eight barbels. In those called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cat-fish,</hi> the head is naked but very broad, and their barbels also vary,
                    according to the species, from six to eight. We ought probably to place here the

                    have but recently become known to naturalists. Several have the muzzle
                    elongated, and these lead to a group of still more remarkable conformation,

                    terminating in hooks, and each suspended by a flexible pedicle; a kind of
                    dentition of which no other example is known. The rough helmet, formed by the
                    cranium of these fishes, is continuous, without any interruption, with an
                    osseous plate, which extends to the base of the spine of the first dorsal; and
                    that spine is very strong, as is likewise the case with those of the pectorals.
                    The lower barbels, and sometimes also the maxillaries, have lateral barbels. The
                    species are found in the Nile and Senegal, and are known to the inhabitants of

                    from all other fishes, viz. that besides the ordinary branchiae, they have
                    ramified appendages like trees adhering to the superior branch of the third and
                    fourth branchial arch, and which appear to be a kind of supernumerary branchiae.
                    All the species pertaining to this genus are found in the Nile, Senegal, and a
                    few of the Asiatic rivers. Their flesh is either of indifferent quality, or

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Plotosus,</hi> Lacép. Is characterised by a second

                    globular form, which at the upper jaw pertain to the vomer. The head, as well as
                    the rest of the body, is enveloped in a thick skin, and the branchial membrane
                    has nine or ten rays. All the known species are from the East Indies. They have
                    eight barbels, and, behind the anus, the fleshy and conical tubercle common to

                    besides, a fleshy ramified appendage, the functions of which, though unknown,
                    are probably remarkable. Some have the dorsal and pectoral spines dentated, and
                    of considerable size. Such is <hi rend="italic">Platystacus anguillaris,</hi>
                    Bl. 373, while others have them concealed beneath the skin. The latter is the

                    fishes referred by Linnaeus to the genus <hi rend="italic">Callichthys,</hi> and

                    their bodies almost entirely cuirassed, so to speak, on its sides, by four rows
                    of sealypieces; and there is likewise on the head a compartment of these pieces.
                    The extremity of the muzzle, however, is naked, as well as the under side of the
                    body. The second dorsal has but a single ray in its anterior edge; the pectoral

                    small, and placed on the sides of the head. These fishes can crawl for some time
                    on dry land like the eel. In some the pectoral spine is merely rough, in others

                    in pairs, one behind the other. Globules are seen on some of these fishes, which

                <p>The fourth family of the <hi rend="italic">Malacopterygii</hi> of Cuvier is
                    composed almost entirely of the Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Salmo,</hi> and
                    has in consequence received from modern Ichthyologists the title of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Salmonidae.</hi> It will remain, however, to future observation
                    to determine whether the family shall take its title from the salmon, as typical
                    of the form, or from some other group, leaving to the above-mentioned fishes the
                    value of a sub-family only. As it is, the circumstance of the present Salmonidae
                    possessing a small adipose fin, placed between the dorsal fin and the tail, has
                    been used in a light purely artificial, and too much consequence has been
                    attached to it. Mons. Agassiz is of opinion that the Clupeae should be added to
                    them, as differing only in the want of this fin; while all the Salmones of
                    Cuvier do not possess a true adipose fin,—that part being composed of rays in
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Serrasalmus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myletes.</hi></p>
                <p>The family, as it now stands, may be characterised by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192940454" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0454-0204"/>a lengthened form, the body
                    covered with scales of no great size, and furnished with two dorsal fins. The
                    first dorsal fin is composed of soft rays; the second, generally of a fatty
                    substance, resembling a fold of the skin, is usually of small size. The tail is
                    remarkably powerful, acting as an elastic lever, and, as usual, constitutes the
                    principal organ of locomotion. The margins of the jaws are formed by the
                    maxillary and inter-maxillary bones, and, with the vomer and palate bones, are
                    commonly thickly studded with teeth, strong, conical, and bending backwards. The
                    maxillary and inter-maxillary bones constitute a single continuous arch, as in
                    the higher animals. The pyloric portion of the stomach is furnished with
                    numerous appendices connected with a pancreas. The swimming bladder is large and
                    oblong, and opens into the gullet near the extremity. They are voracious, feed
                    on insects, the less Crustacea, and small fishes. Many of the species are
                    migratory, and approach the mouths of rivers, or ascend their streams for the
                    purpose of spawning. In the breeding season they are marked by some appendage
                    peculiar to the time, or by a change to colouring of more brilliant tints. They
                    reach a large size. The flesh is well flavoured and wholesome.</p>

                    hooked during the breeding season. The silvery colours change to gray and red.
                    The species inhabit the sea and fresh waters. Some migrate at the breeding
                    season; all spawn in shallow streams, and both sexes assist in forming the
                    spawning bed. They inhabit Europe, Asia, and America.</p>
                <p>The fishes which constitute this genus are of great importance, and are by far
                    the most esteemed and valuable of all those which inhabit the fresh waters. The
                    value of the fisheries, with the number of men engaged in them, is very great,
                    and the expense of the materials which are consumed in the capture of one or two
                    species is immense. In Britain they are mostly consumed in the great towns,
                    either in a recent or prepared condition. In the north of Europe and America
                    numbers are salted or otherwise cured for exportation. At the commencement of
                    the genus is generally placed <hi rend="italic">Salma sglar,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">common salmon,</hi> a species which likewise occupiaą theforemost
                    place in the estimation of both sportsman and çpicure. The salmon is a fish of
                    great elegance, combining a form fitted alike for strength and swiftness; and
                    its depth and thickness, while in good condition, are so proportioned to its
                    length as at once to convey the idea of a pleasing, symmetry. The body above is
                    of a rich bluish or greenish gray, changing below to silvery, sprinkled above
                    the lateral line with rather large sub-cruciform black spots, a few of which at
                    the shoulders generally extend below the line. The characters which distinguish
                    it from its British congeners are the different form of the opercular bones,
                    which show a rounded outline to the posterior edge of the gill-covers, the
                    longest diameter of which to the nose would be in a line through the eye, while
                    in all the other British migratory species the same line would pass much below
                    the eye. The black inner surface of the pectoral fin is nearly a constant mark.
                    The tail is forked in the young state, but fills up to a nearly square outline
                    in the adult, in which the width between the extremities is proportionally wider
                    than in <hi rend="italic">S. eriox,</hi> the only migratory species which
                    attains a weight at all approaching that of the salmon. The outline of the
                    scales also presents distinguishable differences.</p>
                <p>The common salmon inhabits the seas around Great Britain, and extends to the
                    north of Europe and to Asia; but it is not properly ascertained that those found
                    in North America are identical. Its true abode may be called the sea; for as
                    soon as it has entered the rivers it begins to deteriorate in condition, the
                    scales lose their brilliant silvery lustre, and the flesh becomes soft and pale.
                    It is drawn to the fresh waters by that natural instinct so wisely implanted for
                    the purpose of its reproduction, an instinct which enables it to stem the
                    current of the most rapid rivers, to ascend precipitous falls, and to pass
                    through weirs and obstacles of human intervention, which no other power could
                    overcome. This desire of looking for a suitable place in which to deposit their
                    ova is their sole reason for thus seeking the “rivers of water,” the torment of
                    sea insects, or other causes which have been assigned, having no influence. This
                    may be at once understood from the fact of the barren fish continuing their
                    usual haunts along the coast, while a great many do not for a year at all enter
                    the fresh waters. It is during this run to the proper spawning beds that the
                    greatest numbers are captured, either by weirs, cruives, nets, or the rod; and
                    it is then also that the sporting angler alone can ply his vocation, almost all
                    attempts to angle the salmon in salt water having yet proved unsuccessful. Many
                    fish far advanced with spawn are by these means destroyed; for unfortunately the
                    most advanced are the most voracious, and a needy fisherman looks more to his
                    present gain than to an expected produce of another year. It would be well and
                    wise if the net fisheries of this valuable species were more confined to the
                    tide-ways, where, in some estuaries, they are extensively carried on (as well as
                    in the rivers) by means of stake-nets. These are so constructed as to intercept
                    the fish entering the rivers, all in a high state of condition, and are
                    sometimes wrought to such an extent as to employ several miles of netting.</p>
                <p>Salmon generally delay entering the rivers in great numbers until the streams
                    become somewhat swollen by rains, although in the larger rivers there may be
                    said to be a limited daily run. When the flood has fairly mingled with, and to a
                    certain extent has saturated, the estuaries, the rush of fish is often very
                    great, especially if there has been a continued tract of dry weather. In the
                    latter case they collect at the mouths of rivers, and are seen and often taken
                    in vast numbers; but they do not then attempt an ascent, deterred perhaps by the
                    clearness of the stream, or by some instinctive feeling that the water would yet
                    be deficient to carry them through. As the <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>
                    approaches, however, an increased activity may be perceived; and, as íàr as we
                    can judge, the change is probably indicated by the nostrils receiving a sense of
                    the mixture of the waters, by means of the large ramification of nerves with
                    which they are supplied; and to this same sense may perhaps be attributed the
                    singular fact of the greater proportion of salmon returning to the very streams
                    in which they were spawned. The fish, on entering the river, rush forward as
                    long as the flood continues, seldom resting in their course during the time that
                    the water continues discoloured. From ten to twenty-five miles daily is the
                    rate, as far as can be ascertained, at which they are supposed to travel.</p>
                <p>In their more lengthened courses, where the rivers are deeper and the
                    interruptions less frequent, the rate at <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-0467-0205"/>which salmon travel is probably much more rapid.
                    We know indeed little as yet regarding the identity of species between our own
                    and those of foreign regions , but if, as some suppose, our salmon attains to
                    the lofty Cordilleras of South America, by means of the mighty Maragnon, then it
                    must run a course of about 800 leagues. Bearing in mind, however, that the
                    salmon is a truly northern fish (that they occur in <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                    abundance in the arctic regions, may be inferred from the fact, that Commander
                    Ross, during his recent voyage, took <hi rend="italic">three thousand three
                    hundred and seventy-eight</hi> at one haul, in the month of July; and that his
                    uncle Sir John obtained a <hi rend="italic">ton weight</hi> of salmon from an
                    Esquimaux, in exchange for one or two knives !), and also remembering those laws
                    of distribution which regulate, and, with a few exceptions, circumscribe, the
                    localities of living creatures, we think it more than likely that the South
                    American salmon belong to another species. We know, however, that our common
                    kind <hi rend="italic">(Salmo salar)</hi> makes its way by the Elbe into
                    Bohemia, and through the Loire as far as the environs of Puy, in the ancient
                    Velay. We also know that it works its way up the Rhine, and visits a portion of
                    the rivers of Switzerland, although the irresistible torrent of the Falls of
                    Schaffhausen prevents its ingress to any part of the basin of the great Lake of
                    Constance. But we feel less assured of its occurrence in the Persian Gulf, or of
                    the identity of the species found in the Caspian Sea. Neither can we credit that
                    it advances unrepelled by the gloomy terrors of a subterranean journey, and that
                    salmon from the Gulf, adorned by the fanciful Persians with rings of gold and
                    silver, have been found in the Caspian. The non-existence of the supposed
                    communication is of itself a pretty sufficient barrier, even did no other exist
                    in the laws of nature, and were light and atmospheric air dispensable.</p>
                <p>In our lower and clearer waters, however, they travel at a much slower rate than
                    that above alluded to,—resting for some time in the pools by the way, and now
                    and then taking a regular <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> in some chosen spot, which
                    they will return to daily as long as the river continues unfitted for their
                    progress. Upon the least accession, however, to the water, either directly or
                    from some swollen tributary, they are again upon the alert; and it is often felt
                    by them several hours before the quickest or most experienced human eye can
                    perceive a rise upon the river. Having ascended to a considerable height, they
                    remain more stationary, and proceed more slowly with the subsequent floods, till
                    the spawn increases in size. This increase, if not influenced by, is at least so
                    connected with, the commencement of the colder weather, as then to proceed at a
                    more rapid rate. As the spawn advances, the symmetry of the form is disfigured;
                    the female becomes disproportionately large, the colours lose the brightness of
                    their silvery tints, and become dull and gray. The male becomes thin upon the
                    back, the nose elongates, and the under jaw turns up in a large and strong hook,
                    which enters a hollow in the nose before the inter-maxillary bones. The colours
                    and markings become brown and red, those on the head and gill-covers being
                    particularly brilliant, and disposed in lines almost like the marking of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Sparus.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In this state it has received from Cuvier the erroneous name of <hi

                    p. 303.</p></note> In this full breeding dress the male and female seek some
                    ford or shallow stream, and commence to excavate a trench or furrow (chiefly by
                    the exertions of the female). In this the spawn is deposited, and impregnated at
                    the same time, and finally covered with gravel by the exertions of the fish. The
                    furrow is generally from six to nine inches in depth; and when the spawn has
                    appeared to be covered beyond that depth, this has occurred from some other
                    circumstances,— such as the stream or floods having carried downward additional
                    masses of gravel, &amp;c. After this great effort has been accomplished, both
                    sexes are reduced to a state of remarkable emaciation. The elongated nose, and
                    hooked jaw, and brilliant colours, are almost immediately lost; the old scales
                    are cast, and the fish retire to some pool to regain their strength and complete
                    their new clothing. They finally redescend to the sea by easy stages, where
                    their former condition and silvery lustre are regained, their strength
                    invigorated, and all their functions so repaired as to enable them ere long to
                    renew their visit to the flowing-streams, again to multiply their race.</p>
                <p>The ova continue covered by the gravel during the winter, and begin to vivify
                    from about the end of March to the commencement of April. The fry remove from
                    under the gravel when nearly an inch in length, with the ovum still attached;
                    and at this period, if the spawning bed or furrow be turned up, it will appear
                    in motion. When disengaged from the ova, the fish increase in size most rapidly,
                    and about the end of April and during May commence and perform their first
                    migration or journey to the sea. At this time they are from four to six inches
                    in length, of a greenish gray above, silvery below, the scales extremely
                    delicate and very deciduous. From the time they reach the sea, for two months or
                    ten weeks, we lose sight of them, and can only infer their growth from the fact,
                    that after the lapse of that period we find them again ascending the rivers with
                    a weight of from two and a half to four pounds. They are then known under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">gilse</hi> or <hi rend="italic">grilse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and their size, as they ascend from the sea, increases with
                    the advance of the season. The gilsc which thus ascend spawn during the ensuing
                    winter, and are then entitled to the name of <hi rend="italic">salmon.</hi>
                    Descending in a weak state (as before mentioned), they return again in the
                    summer of the following year, as fish of from ten to fifteen pounds weight,
                    according to special circumstances. A third year would still increase their
                    weight, as would several ensuing seasons, till the attainment of an enormous
                    size. Pennant, for example, mentions a salmon which weighed seventy-four pounds;
                    and although we now regard with something of wonder a fish which weighs even the
                    half of that amount, yet there is no doubt that not many years ago salmon of
                    forty pounds were much more frequent than in these degenerate days.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We observe that a salmon
                    above fifty pounds weight was recently taken at the mouth of the Leven in
                    Dumbartonshire. The general capture this season (1835) has been very great in
                    Scotland. Nearly 800 were taken at one haul in a bay of the island of Islay; and
                    our calculation, from accurate data, is, that for some time past about a <hi

                    in Scotland <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> from our eastern ports alone. A friend
                    of our own lately saw a salmon of sixty-one pounds weight on a fishmonger’s
                    stall in London.</p></note> The absence of salmon of the largest class from many
                    of the Scotch rivers, where they formerly abounded, is in fact owing to the
                    injudicious perfection of our fisheries, which occasions the constant capture of
                    the species in the state of gilse, or other early condition; and the chances are
                    by consequence greatly against any individual escaping the various dangers by
                    which it is environed, for such a succession of years as is likely to admit of
                    its attaining to its full dimensions. The destruction by poachers in the higher
                    parts of the rivers, of the large enfeebled <hi rend="italic">helts,</hi> or
                    fish which have completed their spawning operations, is also extremely
                    prejudicial; for these individuals (almost utterly useless as food at the time
                    alluded to) would, if allowed to descend to the salubrious sea, ere long revisit
                    their native streams, greatly increased in size, and full of health and

                    proportion to its length than the salmon; the fins are much more muscular; the
                    tail particularly so, and perfectly square at the end in all the stages of
                    growth, while the distance between the two extremes of the web is smaller
                    proportionally than in any of the other species. The head is larger in
                    proportion than that of the salmon of a similar weight, and the opercular
                    covering is more lengthened. The toothing is very strong. The general colours
                    are, above greenish gray, the lower parts silvery white; the body above the
                    lateral line being thickly covered with large cruciform black spots. In the
                    breeding dress they assume a much blacker tint than the salmon, and want much of
                    the red markings. All the under parts, jaws, and cheeks, become blotched with
                    deep blackish gray. The flesh is of a yellowish tint, and is coarse, except in
                    the young state; it has the least flavour, and is consequently less esteemed in
                    the market than any of the other species. The hook of the under jaw of the male
                    does not become so elongated as in the salmon. The old fish commence to enter
                    the rivers about the end of July, and appear to deposit their spawn and return
                    to the sea about a month earlier than the salmon. The young fish, of from two to
                    three pounds weight, and in this state known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >τvhitlings,</hi> enter the rivers about the beginning of June. In all its
                    states it is a very powerful fish, and feeds voraciously and indiscriminately.
                    When hooked it springs repeatedly from the water, and runs (to use an angler’s
                    expression) with extraordinary vigour to free itself. The river Tweed and its
                    tributaries are among the principal localities for this fish. It occurs also,
                    though more sparingly, in some of the rivers of the Solway, but appears to be
                    rare on the west and north coasts of Scotland.<note anchored="true"

                    described as distinct. The characters of each, however, are extremely difficult
                    to determine; and it is most probable that they will both be found to merge into
                    one species, entitled to the name of <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">trutta.</hi> Both fish are very abundant, and are taken in great
                    quantities in the Solway and its tributaries, and along the greater part of the
                    west and north coasts of Scotland. In the first-named locality, they bear the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">sea trout, herling,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >whitling</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the two latter, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >white trout</hi> and <hi rend="italic">finnochļ</hi> and being transported to
                    the markets of our metropolis, they receive the additional name of <hi
                    rend="italic">salmon trout.</hi> Thus we may easily conceive the immense
                    confusion that may and has arisen from the use or abuse of provincial names.
                    Along the south-east coast of Scotland they appear less abundant; but this may
                    arise from the larger mesh employed in the nettings. The Tay and the Forth
                    supply the Edinburgh market. In its largest state, or as known under the
                    specific title of <hi rend="italic">trutta,</hi> it enters the rivers from two
                    and a half to six pounds weight in the end of May. It is of an elegant form, and
                    possesses all the symmetry of the salmon. The head is small, the back remarkably
                    broad when viewed from above; the tail slightly forked, and wide at the
                    extremity of the web; the colour above greenish, inclining to bluish-gray, lower
                    parts of the clearest silver; body above the line spotted, as in /S'. <hi
                    rend="italic">eriox,</hi> with large, deepblack spots, but generally much fewer
                    in number. The flesh is pink, richly flavoured, and much esteemed for the table.
                    It ranks next to that of the salmon, and by many is esteemed more delicate than
                    even that prized species. The N. <hi rend="italic">albus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> smaller and younger state in which it is found, is very nearly of the
                    same proportion, form, and colours. They approach the mouths of the rivers in
                    the end of July and commencement of August, in immense profusion, and
                    immediately enter the fresh waters, where an angler may take almost any quantity
                    without the exercise of great skill. In the north they form a perquisite to the
                    taxmen or kayners of the salmon fisheries,—above a thousand being sometimes
                    taken at a sweep of the net. In the Solway they are taken in equal abundance in
                    houses of the stake-net, covered for the purpose with net of a small mesh, and
                    are then carried to the various country markets, and during the height of the
                    run to the villages, in cart-loads, for sale. The flesh of this smaller fish
                    (whether species or variety, as the case may be) is also pink, and delicately
                    flavoured. Its food is likewise the same as that of the larger kind; in the sea
                    small Crustacea <hi rend="italic">(Talitrus</hi><hi rend="italic">locusta</hi>
                    being a favourite and common food),—in fresh water aquatic insects, worms,
                    minnows, or other small fish. They appear also to spawn rather earlier than the
                    salmon, and after the same manner. The colours of both sorts during the breeding
                    season are deep-grayish black, slightly tinted with brown in the males; and at
                    this time they offer a most marked contrast (being black and lean) to the
                    symmetrical form and brilliant silvery tints of their perfect condition.</p>
                <p>The preceding species (S. <hi rend="italic">salar,</hi><hi rend="italic">eriox,

                    three or four in number, is still, as we have said, a dubious point—appear to be
                    the only migratory salmon yet known to inhabit the waters of Great Britain. On
                    the Continent of Europe, however, we have the <hi rend="italic">Salmo
                    hucho,</hi> said to be peculiar to the waters of the Danube, but most probably
                    migratory to the Black Sea, and certainly not a native of the British waters,
                    though inserted in many of our lists. It is a fish of extraordinary power,
                    attaining to the weight of sixty pounds; and is of more lengthened proportions
                    than the common salmon. The flesh pale coloured, and rather coarse. The young
                    have large transverse bands upon the back and sides; with age these break up
                    into spots, and gradually disappear, till the ground colour becomes uniform, and
                    is only broken by the ordinarily black or violet spotting. In America, again, we
                    have in this division the <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hearnii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Copper-mine River salmon.</hi> Above
                    olive-green, pale on the sides, and shading into bluish white, marked with
                    longitudinal rows of flesh-red spots, largest on the sides, where they are about
                    the size of a pea. The scales, like those of the other salmon of America, are
                    much smaller than those of the European species, and in this fish they possess
                    peculiar lustre. The teeth are weak and few, their size inferior to those of the
                    common salmon. Their flesh is red. This fish is abundant during July and August,
                    below the falls of the Copper-mine River.</p>
                <p>The migratory salmon are distinguished from those which inhabit only the fresh
                    waters by the clear grayish blue of the upper half of the body, and the
                    brilliant silvery lustre of the belly and lower parts. Among those <pb

                    language receive the appellation of <hi rend="italic">trouts,</hi> the colouring
                    is more varied and of brighter tints, in which yellow and orange predominate,
                    changing to various shades according to locality. The best and most familiar
                    example is <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">fario.</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">common trout.</hi> This lovely fish is most extensively
                    distributed over the whole of Northern Europe, being found in every burn and
                    tarn, in every lake and river. It may be also said to be one of the most
                    pleasing in its appearance; and, when newly taken in “golden glory” from some
                    translucent stream, is exquisitely beautiful. The variation of the tints of the
                    ground colour is infinite; yellow, however, is the most predominant, varying to
                    the most brilliant orange; while at other times the ground colour of the body
                    runs from a dark-greenish black to violet, in most instances numerously spotted
                    with black and red. Sometimes, however, the black is alone present in the form
                    of large round spots, placedin a pale circle, but in all cases beautifully
                    relieved, and breaking up the uniformity of the other colours. In a few
                    instances the spots have been observed to be wanting altogether. One cause of
                    the variation in the trout, is the difference of food; and, according to every
                    information we possess, those which feed on fresh-water shells, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gammari</hi> (screws, or fresh-water shrimps, as they are
                    sometimes called), are of the most brilliant tint, and also of the finest
                    flavour, with a decided pinkness in their flesh. Those feeding on the ordinary
                    water insects are next in brilliancy and flavour, while such as live chiefly
                    upon aquatic vegetables are dull in colour, and of soft consistence. This is
                    further confirmed by the trout in <hi rend="italic">stews</hi> being always
                    finished, or <hi rend="italic">fed off</hi> as it is called, on the foresaid
                    Gammari, collected often from a distance. It is only in this way also that we
                    can account for the variation in the appearance and flavour of trout found in
                    two adjoining bays of the same lake. The individuals, in fact, do not appear to
                    stray to any distance, but seem to be satisfied with whatever food is found
                    within a limited district, and which of course will be in many instances of a
                    peculiar and local kind. It is also true, that the colours of trout accommodate
                    themselves to the tint of the water, and to the prevailing <hi rend="italic"
                    >tone of</hi> the bottom, whether of rock or gravel, or of softer substance; and
                    so constantly is this the case, that an experienced and observant angler has
                    little difficulty in accurately predicating the general aspectof the fish of any
                    lake or river. The presence of moss, so frequent in alpine districts, has
                    invariably the effect of deepening the tints, particularly the shades of green
                    and yellow.</p>
                <p>In form this fish, when in perfect condition, may be said to be nearly
                    symmetrical; the head only being sometimes rather large in proportion to the
                    body, when considered in relation to what we regard as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >beau ideal.</hi> The fins are of moderate strength, those of the body assuming
                    a variation of form, from a rounded to a lengthened extremity. The tail is
                    almost always forked; the fins are always coloured, that is, never of the
                    transparent whiteness observable in the migratory species; and their tints are
                    generally of a paler shade than those of the corresponding parts of the body.
                    The anal fin is often bordered on its lower surface with white. The scaling is
                    proportionally less than in the migratory kinds. The toothing is in general
                    strong, and very prominent on both the tongue and vomer.</p>
                <p>The average growth of the common trout, taking the species generally, may be
                    stated at about a pound, and certainly not more than a pound and a half. In
                    almost all rivers, fish weighing beyond this may certainly be found; but they
                    are comparatively uncommon. Individuals from two to six pounds weight are
                    occasionally taken, even in what may be termed a “wild state.” In ponds or
                    stews, again, they reach a much greater size, but cannot be said to be in the
                    natural condition of unenclosed fish. The Thames trout seem to reach most
                    frequently the largest size, being short compared to their length, but of great
                    thickness and well flavoured. Two were lately taken, the one of eleven, the
                    other of fifteen pounds weight. The lakes in the north of England produce trout
                    of very fine quality, and which are often passed oft' for char. Loch Leven, too
                    (of which the barren isle and now dismantled castle are famous in history as the
                    prison-place of the beautiful Queen Mary), has long been celebrated for its
                    breed of trout. These, however, have fallen off of late considerably in their
                    general flavour and condition, owing, it is said, to the partial drainage of the
                    loch having destroyed their best feeding ground, by exposing the beds of
                    freshwater shells, which formed the greater portion of their food. Farther north
                    (as in Sutherlandshire) the immense multitude of lochs produce a corresponding
                    abundance and variety of trout. Of these, however, only a few are of superior
                    quality; but these few may assuredly vie with the trout of any country in the
                    world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We may here note
                    the existence of a strongly marked and peculiar variety, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">glllaroo trout</hi> of Galway. It is remarkable for feeding on
                    shell-fish, in consequence of which (as is supposed) the coats of the stomach
                    acquire a great degree of thickness,— from which peculiarity it is sometimes
                    called the <hi rend="italic">gizzard trout.</hi></p></note> Another large
                    species, occurring in the British waters, and not yet distinctly known
                    elsewhere, is the <hi rend="italic">Salmo ferox,</hi> Jardine. This species
                    reaches a weight of twenty-eight pounds, and is of very great power compared
                    with its size. The characters which distinguish this fish from <hi rend="italic"
                    >S.fario</hi> are the great size which it attains in a natural state, the large
                    proportional size of the head, the square extremity of the tail in all the
                    stages of its growth, the relative position of the fins, and the number of rays
                    in the dorsal, which vary from 2—11 to 4—11. The external skin or covering of
                    the scales is also extremely tough; and there is a difference in the form of the
                    scales of the lateral line. In colour the upper parts are generally of a deep
                    purplish brown, shading into purplish gray, and finally, on the lower parts, to
                    greenish or grayish yellow, more or less tinted with orange. The spotting is
                    large and not numerous, and consists of black spots placed in a pale circle, and
                    of large pink spots with a similar light area. These extend over the
                    gill-covers, upper fins, and often over the tail itself. A variety occurs in
                    Loch Loyal, in Sutherland, above purplish brown, beneath blackish gray, the
                    whole body spotted over with dark se-pio-coloured spots, of a smaller size on
                    the lower portions. <hi rend="italic">Salmo ferox</hi> appears to be entirely
                    confined to the lakes, seldom ascending or descending rivers, or wandering in
                    and out of them, and never migrating to the sea. When spawning, it ascends for a
                    short way up the rivers or streams which run into the lakes, but never, as far
                    as yet known, descends those which run out of them. It inhabits, among the
                    English lakes, Ulswater; but does not there reach a size above ten or eleven
                    pounds. In Ireland, as far as we can yet learn (specimens having not yet reached
                    us on this side of the water), it is found in Loch Neagh and some other large
                    lakes; and in Scotland we have taken it in Loch Awe, Loch Laggan, the upper end
                    of Loch Shin, and Lochs Loyal and Assynt. It is a fish of remarkable ferocity,
                    and as great an enemy to its smaller companions as the pike. It may be taken by
                    night lines, or by strong trolling tackle, baited with a small trout, and will
                    return a second and third time to the bait, even after it has been dragged for
                    forty or fifty yards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    decrease, so as to become comparatively rare, towards the north. It frequents
                    the clearest streams, delighting in the shallower fords having a fine gravelly
                    bottom, and hanging there in shoals, in constant activity apparently both day
                    and night. It is found during the whole year in the rivers; but its breeding has

                    their spawn when handled, close to the verge of the tideway. It is a remarkably
                    beautiful little fish when newly taken from the water, above of a greenish gray,
                    beneath white inclining to yellowish, the sides marked with dull bluish patches
                    of an oval form, and the body above the lateral line sparingly spotted with
                    brownish-black and red. On the gill-covers there are two black spots, one of
                    which is often indistinct. This fish has been always confounded, and still is
                    so, with other species. Many maintain it to be the young of the salmon, while
                    others insist that it bears that relationship to the common trout. The presence
                    of the dark finger-like markings upon their sides has naturally assisted in this
                    confusion. These marks, however, are distinguished by being always narrower in
                    their form than in the trout or young salmon.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We would also suggest, as a good logical

                    young of the common salmon, that it is frequent in streams where salmon are
                    scarcely ever seen. “What a pity it is,” observes the Rev. George Low, “that I
                    am almost obliged to deny the salmon a place in the Orkney zoology; yet true it
                    is, that this noble fish is so seldom got here, that it is considered as a <hi

                    our burns as to be taken. I have not heard of above three or four instances of
                    salmon being taken in Orkney, three of which (if they were all salmon) were
                    killed and brought on shore by the otter from the sea, and picked up by the
                    country people, and a fourth which stuck in a mill-wheel, and was caught by the
                    miller.” The same writer, under the article <hi rend="italic">Parr,</hi>
                    observes, “Pretty <hi rend="italic">frequent</hi> in the shallower lakes and
                    clear burns, though not in such numbers as I have observed them in Scotland.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Fauna Orcadensis,</hi> pp. 220 and 223.) The reader will also
                    bear in mind, that as we advance northwards in our own island, the parr becomes
                    scarcer, the salmon more abundant,—and that while in the icy streams of the
                    arctic regions the former has not yet been detected, the latter swarms in
                    (elsewhere) unequalled numbers. It is scarcely worth while to allude to the
                    opinion maintained by the late Sir Humphry Davy and others, that the parr is a
                    hybrid or mule between the trout and salmon!</p></note> Besides the external
                    aspect being so distinct that any observer will without difficulty separate them
                    when seen together, the whole skeleton of our present species is more delicately
                    formed, as are also the teeth. The form of the opercular bones is likewise
                    different, and the length of the maxillary bones is much less in the N. <hi

                    open mouths of the different fish are exhibited together. Another distinction
                    is, the great width and power of the pectoral fins, evidently a special
                    provision, as the principal organ of support in those rapid streams where this
                    little fish is almost always found.</p>
                <p>Although the history of the parr is still, in truth, obscure, we certainly deem
                    ourselves authorized to state that it is not the young of the salmon. It may be
                    found in rivers throughout the year, and is more especially abundant during
                    those midsummer months in which the acknowledged young of the salmon is unknown
                    except as a fish returning from the sea. The most characteristic and
                    irrepressible instinct of the latter seems to consist in its descent to the sea
                    a few weeks after exclusion from the egg; and if our summer parr is also the
                    young of the salmon, the fact presents a very rare and remarkable example of
                    different individuals of the same species varying in their instinctive habits.
                    The occurrence of parr in rivers so long after midsummer, and the entire
                    disappearance of <hi rend="italic">smoults</hi> (as the young salmon are
                    sometimes called) anterior to that period, is a main argument in favour of their
                    being distinct kinds; and we cannot get over the difficulty by simply asserting,
                    that such as go down to the sea early are parr, and that such as go down late
                    are parr also. It is admitted that the ova of salmon are hatched in spring, and
                    that the growth of the young (by whatever name we choose to call it) is
                    extremely rapid. Now, as nobody ever finds a parr above a few inches long (six
                    inches is a large one), and as by the end of summer they must be several months
                    old, how can we (in the belief of their being young salmon) reconcile their
                    imputed age with their actual dimensions?<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    confounded by most authors, in consequence of its great variety of aspect, and

                    alpinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sulvelinus,</hi> Linn. It is abundant in the
                    English and Welsh lakes, and in the greater number of those in the north of
                    Scotland, when of any considerable extent; but more seldom seen there, from the
                    absence of the practice of <hi rend="italic">netting,</hi> and the general
                    unwillingness of char to take a fly or bait. This fish is of great repute in the
                    Lake of Geneva, and is also found in many of the alpine lakes of northern
                    Europe. The common char reaches a considerable size, being sometimes taken in
                    Britain above two pounds in weight, although the more usual weight is under
                    three quarters of a pound. When in full condition, it is a fish of very great
                    beauty, above of a grayish green, shading into the most delicate white on the
                    lower parts, and tinted with a blush which is comparable to that seen on the
                    breasts of some of the gull tribe when newly shot in spring. The body is
                    sprinkled over with pale spots of a considerable size. In this state they remain
                    in the deeper parts of the lakes, and are not frequently taken, although we
                    doubt not they might be so were the practice adopted of hanging a herring-net in
                    the deep water, instead of trying only the <hi rend="italic">winter</hi>
                    practice of bawling in shore. We ourselves caught them by the former method, in
                    their prime <hi rend="italic">silvery</hi> state, in Sutherland, during the
                    month of June. On the approach of the breeding time, they seek the mouths of the
                    small tributaries, and are taken in vast numbers at the very period when their
                    preservation ought to be most strictly attended to, and when, in truth, they
                    begin to fall off in their condition. At this season the colour of the upper
                    parts is darkened, the fins are very rich, and the sides and belly become of a
                    beautiful and brilliant red, the whole spotted with small marks of a paler
                    tint.</p>

                    their natural habits,—the case char ascending rivers, and spawning about
                    Michaelmas,—the red char depositing its ova along the shores of the lake, and

                    is the left-hand branch (as we ascend from the lake), and draws its sources from
                    the mountain vales of Langdale, reaching Windermere without any resting
                    place,—while the Rothay has previously formed and flowed from two consecutive
                    lakes, Grassmere and Rydal. The char, in ascending from Windermere to spawn,
                    invariably turn to the left, and ascend the Brathay (though to no great
                    distance), and as invariably avoid the lake-descended waters of the Rothay. They
                    also spawn lower down the Lake of Windermere, at the mouth (or a short way
                    upwards) of the stream called Troutbeck, which is also derived from the flow of

                    to illustrate the character of colour, we shall extract from our note-book some
                    memoranda made <hi rend="italic">a</hi> few seasons ago, on six specimens of
                    char (supposed to exhibit examples of the different varieties or kinds) selected
                    from a hawl taken (by net) in Windermere on the 12th December. “No. 1 is a very
                    beautiful fish,— the ground colour of the body pale ashy brown, somewhat lighter
                    beneath the lateral line. The sides are richly marked with scarlet spots of
                    different sizes; the whole of the under surface, from the pectoral fins to the
                    tail, are brilliant scarlet. The fins are margined anteriorly with an opake
                    white stripe, followed by a blackish-brown portion, passing posteriorly into
                    deep crimson. The tail is blackish brown. The nose and front part of the head
                    are marked by a black spot. The dorsal fin is of .the same pale-brown colour as
                    the back, slightly inclining to blue.” This seemed a male. “No. 2 is a smaller
                    fish, brown upon the back, and becoming gradually paler beneath; the abdomen and
                    lower parts are dingy white, tinged with bluish colour. The ventral and anal
                    fins are margined with white, their other parts flesh colour; the pectoral fins
                    are reddish brown; the dorsal fin and tail blackish brown. The sides of this
                    specimen are indistinctly marked with pale yellowish-red spots.” This was a male
                    red char, which appeared to have spawned, “No. 3 is of a blackish-brown colour,
                    somewhat silvery, paler beneath the lateral line, and passing into yellowish
                    white on the belly. The pectoral, ventral, and anal fins are brown, tinged with
                    red. The dorsal fin and tail are brownish black. The upper part of the head is
                    also black. The sides of this specimen are distinctly marked with numerous very
                    pale, almost colourless, spots. No. 4 resembles the last described, but is
                    smaller.” These the fishermen called two <hi rend="italic">geld fish,</hi> full
                    grown and half grown. “No. 5 is a very dark fish, brownish black upon the back
                    and sides, becoming, as usual, gradually paler beneath the lateral line. <hi

                    anteriorly with opake white; the central portion of these fins are brownish

                    dark; the belly of a dingy red. No. 6 resembles the preceding, except that the
                    under surface, instead of being dingy red, is pale reddish white. The <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">case char</hi> (Salmo alpinus ?), male and female, —yet the
                    pectoral, ventral, and anal fins of the former, and the ventral and anal fins of
                    the latter sex, were conspicuously margined with white, although that character
                    is usually regarded as distinctive of the torgoch or <hi rend="italic">red
                    char.</hi> Perhaps the fact of the male having the pectorals so margined, while
                    those of the female were of uniform colour, may be regarded as of some
                    importance, as tending to show that the character itself is in some measure
                    variable, and therefore insufficient to constitute a specific distinction.<note

                    Ichthyology, it is at the same time evident that the successful practice of that
                    art necessarily illustrates the <hi rend="italic">food</hi> of fishes, and
                    therefore makes us acquainted with an important portion of their natural
                    history. For this reason we insert the following memoranda, transmitted to us by
                    Mr John Wilson, junior:—“The season for fishing char (with rod and line) in
                    Windermere and Coniston commences about the end of May, and, I should say, is
                    over by the first or second week in July. Trolling with a smallish minnow is by
                    far the most successful mode of angling for this fish. It may, however, be taken
                    with the artificial fly, the green and gray drake being the .favourites. I
                    killed three one day in May last with a small red <hi rend="italic"
                    >professor.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A noted
                    fly, so named in honour of the Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University
                    of Edinburgh,—a gentleman who is said to conjoin with various other
                    accomplishments, considerable skill in angling.</p></note> A Bowness fisherman
                    on the same day, trolling without intermission from six in the morning till six
                    in the evening, killed <hi rend="italic">six and twenty,</hi> being the greatest
                    number that has been taken in Windermere, in a single day, by one person, for
                    many years. In Coniston, where this fish is more abundant, I believe it is by no
                    means uncommon to kill three or four dozen in a day. In regard to the size of
                    char in Windermere, I should say they average three to the pound. I never saw
                    one that was a pound. Billy Balmer told me that he once saw one that was a pound
                    and a quarter, and that it was the largest ever taken in Windermere.” In
                    relation to the same subject, in a different locality, we may also add the
                    following extract from another hand. “A small red char is found in Loch Achilty,
                    Ross-shire, on the property of Sir George Mackenzie. It takes the fly greedily
                    in warm, still weather, and, what is singular, during all the summer and
                    autumnal months. I have captured eighteen in a forenoon in July,—raising many
                    more. My flics were of various sorts, from a midge to one as large as a
                    sea-trout fly. The water of Loch Achilty is singularly deep and transparent,—the
                    soil is rich and loamy, and contains large quantities of imbedded wood,—black
                    oak especially. It is supplied by numbers of minute streams, but has no visible
                    outlet, being supposed to discharge itself subter-raneously. The char found in
                    it average eight or nine inches in length; we, however, caught one much larger.
                    They rise with less velocity than the trout, and on missing the fly, unless
                    injured, will return to the hook. In Strathglass there is a Loch Bruiach, where
                    char are caught of a much larger size, but chiefly with the net,— except in the
                    month of October, when, as our informant, the Rev. Mr Chisholm, told us, they
                    may be taken in the shallows with the rod, but at no other season.”<note

                <p>On dissecting the char which we killed last summer in Sutherland, with a view to
                    ascertain their food, we found the stomach usually empty, but the lower part of

                    Characterised by two rows of teeth on each palate bone, the vomer with a tuft on
                    the fore part, the branchial membrane with only eight rays, the body without

                    sides and belly. It frequents the sandy bays at the mouths of rivers, which
                    during the breeding season it ascends to spawn. It is abundant on the British
                    coasts, and in many parts of Europe, and is taken in immense quantities, being
                    much esteemed for the table.</p>

                    minute scales; the first dorsal and ventral fins placed beyond the middle of the

                    is taken in immense profusion when approaching the coasts to spawn, and is used
                    as the principal bait for cod. A few are cured and brought to this country in

                    on account of the small scaling, and large dorsal fin. The species approach
                    nearer in form, colour, habits, and food, to the trouts. They have the mouth
                    with sides, that is, but slightly cleft, the teeth very fine, the body spotted,
                    the branchial membrane with seven or eight rays. The stomach is very muscular.
                    They inhabit rivers, and feed on aquatic insects, &amp;c. England produces a
                    beautiful species, commonly called the grayling, or <hi rend="italic">Thymallus
                    thymus,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So named
                    from its supposed scent or flavour resembling thyme.</p></note> Salvianus. The
                    grayling delights in clear rapid streams, and is found in many of those bearing
                    that character in the more hilly or mountainous parts of England, particularly
                    in Shropshire, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire,—reaching as far north as some of the
                    tributaries of the Tyne in Northumberland. The European range of this fish seems
                    extensive, if all the authors are correct in their designation. According to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Flora Lapponica,</hi> it is common in Lapland, and the viscera
                    are there used instead of rennet, with the milk of the reindeer. It is also
                    found in Siberia, in Prussia, and Pomerania. It is a very beautiful fish, above
                    of a dusky bluish green, changing to a fine silvery gray. The lower edges of the
                    scales are dusky, which gives the appearance of dark streaks running along the
                    fish. The most marked feature is the dorsal fin, of very large size, and darkly
                    spotted between the rays, in the form of transverse bands. The ordinary size is
                    from a foot to sixteen inches in length, but instances of one or two from four
                    to five pounds are recorded. By some authors the grayling is said to be a
                    migratory fish, passing the winter in the open sea, and the summer in the fresh
                    waters. This may, however, be the habit of the fish in some countries only, as
                    in certain of the English rivers they seem to remain during the winter. This
                    species, as far as we know, appears to be the sole example of the form in
                    Europe; and it is only seen again in North America, in a very beautiful fish,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Thymallus</hi><hi rend="italic">signifex,</hi> Cuv.; <hi

                    grayling was met with by the expedition under Captain Franklin, in the strong
                    rapids and clear rivers to the northward of Great Slave Lake, where it rose
                    eagerly at artificial flies, and afforded good sport from its <pb break="no"

                    water. Dr Richardson describes its sides as tinged with lavender purple, mixed
                    with bluish gray, without streaks; the belly blackish gray, with several
                    irregular white blotches; and there are five or six longitudinal rows of uniform
                    quadrangular spots of Prussian blue on the anterior part of the body. There is a
                    large blue mark underneath the lower jaw on each side. The dorsal fin, which
                    forms a prominent feature in the fish, is of a blackish-gray colour, with some
                    lighter blotches. Superiorly it has a narrow margin of light lake-red, and
                    posteriorly it is beautifully ornamented with spots of Berlin blue. The ventrals
                    are streaked with red, and with whitish lines in the direction of their rays.
                    The scales are moderately large, and have no great lustre; their exterior
                    margins are rotund and entire, or very slightly undulated, those on the anterior
                    part of the belly being much smaller than the others. Of the fins the dorsal is
                    the most extraordinary, being, according to Dr Richardson, “probably by far the
                    largest in this genus.” Its colours, as above mentioned, are beautiful, and,
                    with its great size, form the chief ornament of the fish. It contains
                    twenty-four rays; the first two or three are small; but the others increasing
                    rapidly in height, as their origin is more posterior, become more and more
                    branched, and cause the fin to play loosely like a flag over the posterior part
                    of the body; the insertion of the fin occupies about one third of the length of
                    the body, and the extremity of the posterior ray, which is five inches long,
                    reaches as far as the adipose fin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The body is compressed, and of a bluish gray, with purple reflections when moved
                    in the light. The dorsal fin contains from twenty-two to thirty-four rays; but
                    the posterior ones do not branch out in the same manner, and scarcely exceed the
                    others in height; hence the fin has a very different aspect. It is about one
                    inch high, has a dark bluish-gray colour, with several rows of spots, having
                    purple centres and light-red borders. The usual length is eight inches.<note

                    Westmoreland, and also found in some of the Scotch lochs,—for example, Loch

                    >schelley.</hi> According to the best authorities, it likewise occurs in those
                    of Alpine and Northern Europe. It does not reach a very large size; the average
                    may be stated from nine inches to a foot in length. The colours chaste and
                    delicate, of a greenish gray above, changing to whitish, with a silvery lustre.
                    The scales are of considerable size, and, when examined narrowly, are seen to be
                    covered with minute black dots. It is used for the table, but is not so delicate
                    as our other British species. It is known under the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    Mons. Agassiz during the autumn of 1834, he considered them distinct from the

                    suggested for the Scottish kind. Continental specimens of <hi rend="italic">C.
                    maraenula</hi> have not yet been received by us, and the distinctions,
                    therefore, cannot at present be detailed. The <hi rend="italic">vendace</hi> of
                    Lochmaben, whatever scientific name it may ultimately receive, or whether it may
                    be identical or not with the species inhabiting the lakes of Continental Europe,
                    may be described as an interesting example of the genus. It is one of the most
                    elegant, though of a small size, reaching from four to ten inches in length. The
                    head is of an angular shape, and small compared with the size and depth of the
                    body. The crown of the head is very transparent, and the form of the brain,
                    which is heart-shaped, is seen through the integuments. This peculiarity is one
                    of the first things pointed out to the stranger naturalist who visits Lochmaben
                    to see this species. The eye is large and brilliant; the body rises gracefully
                    to the back fin, and recedes with a gradual line to the tail; the under line is
                    nearly straight from the gills to the ventral fin. The upper parts are of a
                    delicate greenish brown, shading gradually into a clear silvery white; the
                    dorsal fin greenish brown, the anterior edge much lengthened and pointed; the
                    lower fins all bluish white; the tail much forked. They spawn about the
                    commencement of November. The roe is minute and abundant, and of a bright orange
                    colour. The flesh is white and rich, and highly prized as food; but as it
                    requires almost to be <hi rend="italic">eaten on the spot,</hi> it is not useful

                    of Lochmaben are the only authentic British habitat for this species.</p>
                <p>Several other species inhabit the Swiss lakes, and are known chiefly from the
                    works of the continental Ichthyologists, particularly Μ. Jurine, who has devoted
                    a paper to the fishes of the Lake of Geneva. He there describes C. <hi

                    from its appearing only in winter); and Baron Cuvier notices a third from the
                    Lake Neufchatel, under the title of <hi rend="italic">C. palaea.</hi> In America
                    several species are found in the lakes and rivers. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >whitefish</hi> of Dr Richardson seems to belong to the genus. It is the <hi

                    rend="italic">Attihhawmegh,</hi> a name corrupted to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tittameg</hi> by the traders. This fish attains a weight of from three (the
                    ordinary size) to twenty pounds. It abounds in every lake and river, and is much
                    esteemed as food, in many parts forming the sole article of diet for years
                    together, without producing satiety. The stomach is of great thickness,
                    generally filled with earth mixed with slender roots, and small white worms. It
                    spawns in October. Another species is <hi rend="italic">C. quadrilateralis,</hi>
                    Richardson, of which the colour of the upper parts is intermediate between honey
                    yellow and wood brown; the scales with a thin border of blackish gray round
                    their exterior margins; the belly white, with a pearly lustre; the eye
                    moderately large, the iris with a silvery hue; the mouth without teeth; the fins
                    are yellowish; the adipose fin attached for its whole length. The stomach not
                    thickened. The food small insects. Inhabits the Arctic Sea, and the small rivers
                    about Fort Enterprise. The average size is about fifteen inches in length.</p>
                <p>Under this division also appears to rank the <hi rend="italic">Inconnu</hi> of

                    For this purpose the species is fished in great numbers along the coast of
                    Tuscany. It is a small fish, scarcely exceeding four or five inches in length,
                    of delicate tints,·—the integuments being transparent, and giving a clear
                    brilliancy to the colours. The upper parts are grayish, the sides and lower
                    surface of a brilliant silvery lustre.</p>
                <p>Following this fish, Cuvier adopts the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Characinus</hi>
                    of Artedi, as a group to contain all the species of the Linnaean <hi

                    membrane, but as the form, toothing, &amp;c. vary in most of these fishes, ho
                    has thought it necessary to subdivide them into subordinate genera. It is
                    remarkable that many of them have the caecal or pancreatic appendages, and at
                    the same time the narrowing or girth of the air-bladder, which is seen in many
                    of the Cyprini. The first subdivision is <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Curimata,

                    teeth are, however, variable, and the divisions of this group may yet require
                    examination. The number of branchial rays not exceeding five, must be
                    remembered; some of the species, with the exception of that distinction,
                    approaching very nearly to the genus just named. They inhabit the rivers of
                    South America. As an example may be noted a new species, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Curimata Gilbert</hi> of Quoy and Gaimard. This fish somewhat resembles a small
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> but is distinguished, even on a superficial
                    view, by the presence of the adipose fin. The scales are rather large in
                    proportion; the upper parts are bluish gray, changing into silvery; the fins
                    yellowish; the body appears spotted, or rather blotched, with indistinct dark
                    markings, conspicuous only when placed in particular lights. This species was
                    discovered in the fresh waters of Brazil, near the river Macaca, and appeared to

                    They embrace two forms, which, he thinks, will eventually be converted into
                    sub-genera. They are of small size, the body high, and very compressed; the
                    mouth directed upwards. The humeral bones form on the fore-part a sharp crest or
                    ridge, terminated below by a small spine. The pelvic bones form another and
                    similar crest, also terminated by a small spine placed before the ventral fins,
                    which are so minute as to have escaped the observation of the first observer. On
                    each side of the last ridge there is a row of small hollows, which has been
                    regarded as a fold of the sternum, and has suggested the name of <hi

                <p>Fishes allied to herrings are easily recognised by their having no adipose fins;
                    their upper jaw is formed as in trouts,—in the middle by inter-maxillary bones
                    without pedicles, and on the sides by the maxillarybones; their body is always
                    very scaly. The majority of the species possess a swimming bladder and numerous
                    caeca. Those which ascend rivers are comparatively few in number.</p>
                <p>The great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Clupea</hi> of Linnaeus may be known by two
                    well-marked characters; IsĄ by the narrow and short inter-maxillary bones, which
                    constitute only a small portion of the upper jaw, the sides of which are
                    completed by the maxillaries in such a way that the lateral parts only are
                    protractile; and, 2d, by the compressed and sharp inferior edge of the body,
                    upon which the scales project like the teeth of a saw. Besides, the maxil]aries
                    are divided into three pieces. The branchial openings are very much cleft; and
                    hence these fishes speedily die when removed from their native element.</p>
                <p>Their branchial arches are furnished on the side next the mouth with pectiniform
                    dentations. The stomach has the form of an elongated pouch; the swimming bladder
                    is long and pointed, and in some species sends forwards two long and small
                    processes, which communicate with the internal ear in a remarkable manner. Their
                    caeca are numerous. Of all fishes, these have the most numerous and the finest
                    bones.</p>

                    fish has visible teeth in both its jaws; the carina of the belly is but slightly
                    marked; the sub-opercle is rounded; there are veins on the sub-orbital,
                    pre-opercle, and upper part of the opercle. The attachment of the ventral fins
                    corresponds to the middle of the dorsal; the head is one fifth of the length of
                    the whole fish, and by carrying backwards from the first dorsal fin the distance
                    of that organ from the snout, we arrive at the middle of the caudal. The anal
                    fin has sixteen rays.</p>
                <p>The investigation of the habits of this fish has not received that attention
                    which its importance as an article of food to the inhabitants of this country
                    demands; and there are several circumstances respecting its economy which still
                    require farther examination. It is generally believed that the herring inhabits
                    in winter the depths of the Arctic Ocean, or other seas in northern latitudes,
                    and that during the rest of the year it makes migrations southwards. In summer
                    and autumn they appear on the north and west coasts of Europe in immense shoals,
                    and about the same season they arrive at some parts of the coast of America and
                    Asia. It has been supposed that those coming from the north divide into two
                    detachments, one of which proceeds along Newfoundland to America, the other
                    along Norway to the south of Europe, and that one subdivision of this second
                    detachment goes up the Baltic, while the other proceeds along Great Britain,
                    Ireland, Germany, and France, as far as the western coast of Spain.</p>
                <p>This is the description of the annual migrations of the herring given by Pennant;
                    but some doubts have been entertained as to its accuracy, from the
                    circumstances, Isř, that while in some places the herrings do not make their
                    appearance for years, in others they are taken in abundance all the year round;
                    and, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, that they have never been observed on their
                    return northwards. Other naturalists suppose that they come merely from the deep
                    into shallow water during the spawning season, and that in so doing they do not
                    make any very lengthened journeys. In truth, we are not as yet furnished with
                    sufficient data to decide the question; but, in the mean time, we do not feel
                    inclined entirely to reject the generally received opinion, that the herrings
                    migrate from north to south in summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>In migrating, the herrings proceed in vast troops,—so great, indeed, that the sea
                    is sometimes covered with them for miles, and that they have even been known to
                    be stranded or crushed in immense quantities in confined bays, or when thrown by
                    the wind or by currents upon the shore. The shoals are said to be generally
                    preceded, sometimes for days, by one or two males. The largest generally go
                    first, to act in some measure as guides; and, as they proceed onwards, immense
                    numbers fall an easy and unresisting prey to rapacious birds, or to their own
                    not less rapacious kindred of the sea.</p>
                <p>It is generally believed that the herrings captured far north are larger, fatter,
                    and of a better quality, than those of the south; and for this reason, in the
                    month of July, our fishermen go out to meet the shoals as far as Orkney and
                    Shetland. The greatest number are taken on the coasts of Norway and Sweden, in
                    the first of which countries it is said that about 400 millions are taken in one
                    year, and sometimes twenty millions in a single fishery. The inhabitants in the
                    neighbourhood of Gothenburg, in Sweden, take as many as 700 millions in a year.
                    Herrings are fished also in great quantity in this country, Germany, France,
                    Holland, the United States, and Kamtschatka.</p>
                <p>The average size of the herring is stated to be about ten inches. According to Dr
                    Knox, the females are considerably larger than the males,—the largest female he
                    found on the east coast of. Scotland measuring eleven inches, the largest male
                    nine inches and a half. It does not appear to be precisely known at what age
                    they attain their full size.</p>
                <p>Considerable doubt has at all times prevailed regarding the food of the herring.
                    They were generally stated to live on small crabs and fishes, and on a minute
                    crustaceous animal named by Fabricius <hi rend="italic">Astacus harengum.</hi>
                    But this was chiefly matter of supposition, for most practical fishermen
                    described the stomach of the fish when in good state as quite empty, or, at
                    most, as containing a little brownish mucus; and it has appeared difficult to
                    reconcile the fact, that it is when the stomach appears thus empty that the fish
                    is in its best condition, viz. fullest, with the finest flavour, and most
                    capable of keeping,—with the notion, that when it appears upon our coasts it has
                    quitted its natural feeding ground, and has been longer and longer in a state of
                    starvation the more southern the latitude in which it is found. Dr Knox’s
                    interesting observation, that the principal food of the salmon and vendace
                    consisted of minute crustaceous animals, led him to examine carefully with the
                    microscope the brownish matter contained in the alleged empty stomachs of the
                    herring; and he then formed the opinion, that this matter consisted of the
                    debris of a very minute entomostraeous animal.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is well known that the herrings caught upon the east coast of Scotland are
                    much inferior to those taken on the west coast, and more particularly to those
                    of Loch Fine, and other lochs of Argyleshire. Dr Knox states that the herrings
                    taken near the Firth of Forth in July are foul, or are engaged in spawning,
                    while those of the west coast, in the same season, have the organs of
                    reproduction very slightly developed; and he conjectures that that species of
                    crustaceous animal which forms their appropriate and most favourite food may
                    exist abundantly in the bays on the west coast of Scotland, and either not at
                    all, or not in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940597" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0597-0215"

                    after these fishes have been absent for some time from their proper feeding
                    places that they eat marine worms and small fishes; and when so feeding they
                    lose much of their flavour, and run rapidly into putrefaction after being
                    captured. The time of spawning seems to vary considerably, both in the same and
                    in different districts; so that we may have spring, summer, and autumn herrings,
                    as we know they have in some parts of the Baltic. During the spawning season
                    they are seen to rub their bellies against the rocks or sand. As many as 68,606
                    eggs have been counted in one female. The young do not accompany the larger
                    herrings in their migrations.</p>
                <p>Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Clupea,</hi> Cuvier makes four other species
                    besides the common herring, viz. the <hi rend="italic">sprat, white-bait,

                    resemblance in form to the herring, but does not attain the same size. The
                    number of its vertebrae is forty-eight, and the dorsal fin is placed farther
                    back than in the herring. It has no veins on the opercle; a gilded band runs
                    along the sides in the spawning season. This fish is eaten in considerable
                    quantity in this country, both in the fresh and salted condition. It appears in
                    the Thames from November to March.</p>

                    The length of its head, and height of its body, are each one fourth of the whole
                    length of the fish. The dorsal fin is placed farther forwards, the anal is
                    longer and situate nearer the caudal fin, than in the herring.</p>
                <p>Considerable difference of opinion formerly existed among ichthyological writers
                    as to the exact specific nature of the white-bait. Pennant and Shaw considered
                    it as allied to the bleak, <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus alburnus.</hi> Turton,
                    Donovan, and Fleming, regard it as the young of the shad <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clupea alosa,</hi> an opinion which was generally received as correct, until Mr
                    Yarrell in 1828 ascertained that the number of vertebrae in the white-bait is
                    invariably fifty-six, and in the shad only fifty-five; and he is thus supposed
                    to have demonstrated that the well-known <hi rend="italic">white-bait</hi> ought
                    to be regarded as a species distinct from every other. It is a very small fish,
                    seldom exceeding four inches in length. It is of a very brilliant silvery
                    colour, and has a black spot on the end of the snout. The flavour of the
                    white-bait is considered as particularly delicate, and great numbers are eaten
                    by the Londoners in the month of July, at which time innumerable quantities make
                    their appearance in the Thames.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">pilchardus,</hi> Bl. The pilchard
                    <hi rend="italic">(le</hi><hi rend="italic">Célan,</hi> Fr.) nearly equals the
                    herring in size, and bears a considerable resemblance to it in form. The
                    sub-opercle is quadrangular, the pre-operclc and operclc striated; the head
                    proportionally shorter than in the herring, and the dorsal fin placed farther
                    forwards. The ventral fins begin as it were under the end of the dorsal; the
                    anal consists of eighteen rays; and on each side of the caudal two scales longer
                    than the rest project. The habits of this fish seem to be nearly the same as
                    those of the herring. It is believed, like it, to reside in winter and spring in
                    the northern seas, and to proceed southwards in the beginning of summer. It is
                    fished in enormous quantities off the coast of Cornwall for the purpose of
                    salting and exporting to the Mediterranean, “specially to Naples. It appears
                    there in July. Its flavour is considered by some as even superior to that of the

                    which is esteemed for the extreme delicacy of its flavour, differs only in size
                    from the pilchard. Numbers are taken off the coast of Brittany, and also in the

                    the absence of sensible teeth, and by an irregular black spot behind the gills.
                    This fish is much larger than the herring, attaining sometimes to the length of
                    three feet. It is also of a much flatter shape; its tail is much forked; and on
                    each side of the lower margin of the belly the scales are very large. It is a
                    native of the Mediterranean, as well as of the North Atlantic and Caspian Seas.
                    According to Pennant, the best in this country are found in the Severn. The shad
                    ascends rivers in spring and the beginning of summer, and it is then highly
                    esteemed; but it is of a dry and disagreeable flavour when taken at sea. The
                    Russians believe that the shad has deleterious properties. The Arabs smoke-dry
                    it. This species lives chiefly on vermes, insects, and small fishes; and Dr
                    Fleming informs us that he has taken small herrings from its stomach. The number
                    ascending rivers varies very much in different years.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Polypterus,</hi> Geoff. Distinguished at once from
                    other genera by a number of separate fins placed along the back, each supported
                    by a strong spine, to the posterior edge of which are attached some soft rays.
                    The caudal fin surrounds the end of the tail, and the anal is very near it; the
                    ventrals are very far back. The body is covered with bony scales like those of
                    the preceding genus, and the whole cheek is covered by an osseous plate,
                    shagreened in a similar manner to those on the rest of the head. Around each jaw
                    there is a row of conical teeth, and behind some close or rasp-like teeth. Their
                    stomach is capacious, the intestine narrow, with a spiral valve and one caecum.
                    The swimming bladder is double, with large lobes, particularly that on the left
                    side, communicating by a wide aperture with the oesophagus.</p>

                <p>ORDER III.—MALACOPTERYGII SUB-BRACHIATI.</p>
                <p>This order is characterised by the attachment of the ventral fins beneath the
                    pectorals,—which latter may be regarded as analogous to the arms, and hence the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Sub-brachiafi.</hi> The pelvis is suspended immediately
                    from the bones of the shoulder.</p>
                <p>This order contains as many families as Linnaean genera.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I—GADIDAE.</p>
                <p>Comprehends the members of the great Linnaean genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gadus,</hi> containing the well-known cod and haddock.</p>
                <p>The Gadi in general are recognised by the ventral fins being pointed and attached
                    to the throat. The body is moderately elongated, slightly compressed, and
                    covered with soft and not very large scales. The head is well proportioned, and
                    without scales; all the fins are soft. The jaws, and the front of the vomer, are
                    armed with several rows of pointed, irregular, middle-sized, or small teeth,
                    forming a sort of currycomb or rasp. Their gillcovers are large, with seven
                    rays. Most of the species have two or three fins on the back, one or two behind
                    the anus, and a distinct caudal. Their stomach forms a large muscular sac; the
                    caeca are very numerous. The swimming bladder is large, and has strong parietes,
                    frequently dentated on the sides.</p>
                <p>These fishes generally live in cold or temperate climates, and constitute a very
                    important article of fishery. The greater number are considered wholesome, and
                    form a light and agreeable food,—the flesh separating easily by boiling, into
                    white flaky layers. The great sand bank of Newfoundland is the most famous
                    station of the cod fisheries, and is resorted to by English fishermen, who
                    chiefly use the hook and line. The fish abound in this place probably on account
                    of the great quantity of the smaller animals which serve as food, viz. mussels,
                    clams, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The family of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gadidae</hi> has been divided by Cuvier into
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Morrhua,</hi> or cods properly so called, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Merlangus</hi> or whitings, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Merluccius</hi> or hakes, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lota</hi> or lings, <hi

                    Morrhua, Cuv.</hi> Has three dorsal fins and two anal; a tuft at the point of
                    the lower jaw. The species are extremely prolific.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ. vulgaris ( Gadus morrhua,</hi> L.). The common cod <hi

                    measures from two to three feet in length. The back is spotted with yellowish
                    brown. It inhabits the whole Northern Ocean, and occurs in vast profusion.</p>
                <p>This fish dwells in salt water only. It is not found nearer the equator than the
                    40th degree of latitude. The weight of the common cod varies from twelve to
                    eighty or even 100 pounds. It is extremely voracious, and its digestive powers
                    are seemingly very great. It feeds upon smaller fishes, such as herrings, on
                    Mollusea, worms, and Crustacea, and even on the young of its own species. It has
                    a strong muscular stomach, and is said to possess the power of rejecting by the
                    mouth substances, such as wood, &amp;c. which it finds indigestible.</p>
                <p>In spring they come nearer the shore in order to deposit their spawn. This
                    happens in January in England, in February in Norway, Denmark, and Scotland, and
                    in March in Newfoundland. One female is said to contain from <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> to <hi rend="italic">nine millions</hi> of eggs!</p>
                <p>The most extensive cod fisheries our coasts are off the Western and Shetland
                    Isles, but they are still greater in more northern countries. The cod has been
                    fished on the coast of Sweden since the year 1368, by the inhabitants of
                    Amsterdam. The English resorted to Iceland before the year 1415; and it is
                    stated that in the year 1792, 200 French vessel⅛of a burden of 191,153 tons were
                    employed in the cod fishery. Every year more than 6000 European vessels are
                    employed in this fishery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The flesh of the cod has a good flavour, and may be easily preserved. The tongue,
                    salted and dried, has been considered a great delicacy. The gills are preserved
                    and used as bait. The liver is eaten, and is sometimes used for the production
                    of oil. The swimming bladder affords a very good isinglass.</p>
                <p>This important species constitutes a principal article of food to the inhabitants
                    in some parts of Iceland, Norway, and other northern countries. In a dried state
                    it is also much used in some papal kingdoms of the south.</p>
                <p>In the neighbourhood of the Isle of Man, and elsewhere, there is a variety of the
                    cod named the red or rock cod, the skin of which is of a brightish vermillion
                    colour. Its flesh is much esteemed.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ. oegtefinus ( Gaaus ceglejinus,</hi> Linn.). The haddock <hi
                    rend="italic">(l’Egrefln,</hi> Fr.; <hi rend="italic">Schollfisch,</hi> Germ.)
                    is as well known, and almost as important, as the cod in this country; it is of
                    a smaller size, usually eighteen inches long. The back is brown, the belly
                    silvery, and the lateral line black. There is a blackish spot behind the
                    pectoral fin, which tradition assigns to the impression of St Peter’s finger and
                    thumb when he took the tribute-money out of the mouth of a fish, supposed the
                    haddock. The upper jaw is longest.</p>
                <p>The haddock is found, like the cod, in the Northern Ocean, but has not been seen
                    in the Baltic. It annually approaches the shores, in February and March
                    generally, in order to deposit its spawn. The regularity with which it
                    re-appears in some districts en a stated day is quite remarkable. On the coast
                    of Yorkshire, since the year 1766, they have annually made their appearance on
                    the 10th of December. At this place they are supposed to form an immense shoal
                    three miles broad, and extending eighty miles in length,—from Flamborough Head
                    to the mouth of the Tyne. It is in autumn that they visit the shores of Holland
                    and East Friesland, and the neighbourhood of Heligoland.</p>
                <p>The haddock frequents our coasts during the greater part of the year, although
                    the largest are taken in winter. The flesh is generally best in the months of
                    May and June.</p>
                <p>It is stated, that in the north, when the sea is frozen near the shore, these
                    fish collect in troops beneath any openings in the ice, and the Greenlanders are
                    thus enabled to catch them in considerable numbers. The seals and foxes adopt
                    the same method of securing them for food. The food of the haddock is very
                    similar to that of the cod, which species it resembles in its voracious
                    habits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Μ. callarias ( Gadus callarias,</hi> Linn.). The dorse <hi

                    haddock, being only eleven or twelve inches long. It is spotted like the cod,
                    and has the upper jaw longer than the under. The lateral line is placed near the
                    back. It resembles the whiting in taste, and is considered by many as the best
                    eating fish of all the Gadus tribe. It is much sought after on the shores of the
                    Baltic.</p>
                <p>This fish frequents the mouths of large rivers, which it sometimes ascends along
                    with the salt water. It is generally taken in June. The Icelanders salt and dry
                    it, and the Greenlanders are said frequently to eat it in a state of
                    semi-putrefaction.</p>
                <p>To these fishes, which are among the best-determined species of the old genus

                <p>This fish is very common on our coasts, and is valued on account of its
                    abundance, and the wholesomeness and fine flavour of its flesh. It is often
                    salted and dried in this country, as well as in Holland. The shoals of whitings
                    sometimes occupy a space three miles long, and one and a half broad. It is
                    generally fished in summer in this country, and is taken both with the line and
                    net. The food of the whiting is similar to that of the haddock. It is more
                    frequently found near the shore than that species.</p>

                    line straight ana white. The flesh of the young is rather delicate; that of the
                    adult is somewhat leathery, but it is used when salted and dried, like the cod.

                    coasts. The young swarm along the British shores, and form a frequent sustenance
                    of the lower orders of the Western Highlands. On one occasion we killed
                    thirty-three dozen with the rod in a few hours, using a line with six small
                    flies. By giving the line one or two additional turns through the water, we
                    frequently pulled six ashore at once. It even constitutes an important article
                    of exportation from our northern coasts. In Norway the poor feed upon it; and
                    oil is made from its liver. The adult fish is taken principally in summer; it
                    deposits its spawn in this country in February and March. The coal-fish is found
                    in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; and sometimes, though very rarely, in
                    die Mediterranean Sea,—for example, near Nice.</p>

                    with brown; a single barbel on the chin. The two dorsal fins are of equal
                    height, the second extending to near the tail. The body is almost cylindrical,
                    and the head slightly depressed, so as to give the fish a peculiar appearance,
                    somewhat resembling that of an eel; hence its occasional name of Eel Pout. See

                    It is also well known in North America. In England it is found only in a few

                    its stomach is generally so crammed with cray fish as to distort the shape of

                <p>FAMILY II.—PLEURONECTIDAE.</p>
                <p>This family of the sub-brachian malacopterygian order comprehends the great
                    Linnean genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleuronectes,</hi> which includes all those
                    osseous species usually known under the name <hi rend="italic">oiflat
                    fish.</hi></p>
                <p>They are at once distinguished by a character unique among vertebrated animals,
                    viz. the want of symmetry in the construction of the head; both eyes being
                    placed on the same side, or on that which remains uppermost when the animal
                    swims, and which is always of a darker colour; while the side in which the eyes
                    are wanting faces the ground, and is always whitish, or very pale. Some of the
                    other organs participate in this irregularity of the orbits; thus the two sides
                    of the mouth are unequal, and the two pectoral fins are generally of different
                    sizes. Their body is much compressed, and raised vertically. The dorsal fin runs
                    along the whole of the back, the anal occupies what may be regarded as the under
                    part of the body, and the ventrals have almost the appearance of continuing that
                    fin forwards, so much do they often appear as if united together. There are six
                    rays in the branchiostegous membrane. The abdominal cavity is small (the anus
                    being far forwards); but it is prolonged into a sinus in the thickness of the
                    two sides of the tail, in which some portion of the viscera is lodged. There is
                    no swimming bladder, and these fishes seldom quit the bottom.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleuronectidae</hi> furnish an agreeable and wholesome
                    food, and occur along the coasts of almost all countries. The disposition of the
                    bones of the head is curious, on account of the inversion which brings the two
                    orbits to the same side; still we recognise in it all the pieces com-mop to the
                    other genera, but of unequal size. Individuals termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >reversed</hi> are sometimes found, having the eyes placed on a different side
                    from that on which they are situated in the rest of their species. Others,
                    having the two sides of the body of the same colour, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">double.</hi> The brown or upper side is more frequently thus
                    repeated than the white one; but the <hi rend="italic">rose-coloured
                    fiounder</hi> of Shaw presents an instance of the duplication of the paler

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectxs</hi> was formerly subdivided according
                    as the eyes were placed on the right or left side of the middle line; but, on
                    account of the irregularity of individuals in this respect, Cuvier has rejected
                    the character, and has distinguished various groups, as follows:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Platessa,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cuv.</hi> Has on each jaw a range of obtuse cutting teeth, and
                    generally some teeth in the form of pavement <hi rend="italic">(en pavés)</hi>
                    on the pharyngeal bones. The dorsal fin advances forwards as far as the upper
                    eye, and leaves, as well as the anal, a naked interval between it and the
                    caudal. The form of the body is rhomboidal; the majority have the eyes on the
                    right side. They have two or three small caeca. Several inhabit the British
                    seas.</p>

                    tubercles forming a line on the right side of the head between the eyes, and by
                    spots of a bright yellow colour, which relieve the brown of the body on that

                    line of the head, and at the base of each ray of the dorsal and anal fins there
                    is a small rough projection; the lateral line has also bristly scales. Many of
                    this species occur reversed.</p>
                <p>The flounder is taken in spring near the shore, and at the mouths of rivers, into
                    which it sometimes ascends a considerable way; it lives well in fresh water, and
                    is kept in ponds in Friesland. It inhabits the Baltic and North Atlantic Seas.
                    Its flesh is much inferior to that of the plaice; the best are said to be taken

                    between them. Its lateral line is strongly curved above the pectoral fin. Its
                    scales are rougher than in the preceding species, and to this character it owes
                    its name (from <hi rend="italic">lima,</hi> file). Its teeth, though in a single

                    have teeth closely set, or <hi rend="italic">en carde,</hi> both on the jaws and
                    pharynx; but their dorsal fin advances as far as the edge of the upper jaw, and

                <p>In some the eyes are approximate, and in the interval between them there is a

                    >Turbot,</hi> Fr.; <hi rend="italic">Steinbutte,</hi> Germ. This fish, so highly
                    prized on account of its delicate flavour, and the wholesomeness of its flesh,
                    is distinguished by the rhomboidal shape of its body, which is nearly as high as
                    it is long. It is bristled on the brown side with small tubercles; has the
                    lateral line curved; and the eyes on the left side.</p>
                <p>This species is usually much smaller than the holibut; it is frequently two feet
                    long, with a weight of twenty pounds; but it is stated sometimes to attain the
                    length of five or six feet. Extensive turbot fisheries are established on
                    different parts of our coast. The turbot is taken with the hook; it is very
                    voracious, and may be lured by various baits, such as portions of herring or
                    haddock, mussels, limpets, and other shell-fish; but all these must be very
                    fresh. Indeed the species very sensibly prefers live bait without hooks, more
                    especially the small river-lamprey. Mr Pennant has particularly described the
                    extensive turbot fishery at Scarborough. There are three men in each of the
                    fishing-boats, each man having three lines, and each line 280 hooks. All the
                    nine lines are fastened together, and then extend to about three miles in
                    length; they are laid across the current, and are allowed to remain for six
                    hours before they are hauled. This fish is called the water or seapheasant, by
                    the French common people, on account of its fine flavour.</p>

                    fishes for the table, the flesh being firm, white, and of delicious flavour. The
                    sole generally measures from one to two feet in length, and its weight varies
                    from one to seven pounds. It is a gregarious fish, and is generally taken with
                    the trawl-net. It inhabits the Baltic, North, Atlantic, and Mediterranean Seas.
                    There is a large sole fishery at Brixham in Torbay, and a very extensive one on

                    union of the two ventral fins. The body is smooth and without scales; the head
                    broad and depressed; the muzzle projecting and extensile; the branchial openings
                    small; the gill-covering furnished with four or five rays. There is only one
                    soft dorsal fin, opposite to an anal of a similar kind. The intestine is short,
                    straight, and without caeca. There is no swimming bladder, but nevertheless the
                    species swim rapidly along the shores. The genus is divisible as follows:</p>

                    called. The membrane already mentioned, which takes the place of the ventral

                    other hand, the bones of the shoulder form a slight projection behind, which
                    completes a second disk with the membrane uniting the pectorals.</p>
                <p>Several species inhabit the Mediterranean and neighbouring seas. In some the

                    forming only a large single disk, cleft on both sides, and prolonged by the
                    membranes. The dorsal and anal fins are short, and distinct from the caudal. The

                    fins, the rays of which, suspended all round the pelvis, and united by a single
                    membrane, form an oval and concave disk, which the fish employs as a sucker to
                    fix itself to the rocks. Besides this, their mouth is wide, and furnished on
                    both jaws and pharyngeal bones with small pointed teeth. Their opercles are
                    small; their branchial openings closed towards the bottom, and furnished with
                    six rays. Their pectoral fins are very large, and unite almost under the throat,
                    embracing as it were the disk of the ventrals. Their skeleton does not harden
                    much; and their skin, viscous and without scales, has small hard grains

                    perceptible, though very low, and with simple rays,—and a second one with

                    dorsal fin so much enveloped in a thick tubercular skin, that externally it

                    conical tubercles on each side.</p>
                <p>This fish is about eighteen inches long. It lives, especially in the north, on
                    Medusae and other gelatinous animals. Its flesh is soft, insipid, somewhat oily,
                    and is seldom<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940688" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0688-0222"/>
                    used for food by those who can provide better. It is, however, held in some
                    estimation by the Greenlanders, themselves an oily people, whose lines do not
                    always fall in pleasant places. They also eat its roe (which is a very large
                    one), after having reduced it by boiling to a pulp. In Ireland it is sometimes
                    salted. This fish is very unwieldy, and, possessing few means of defence, it
                    generally remains at the bottom of the sea, adhering to the rocks. It thus
                    becomes an easy prey both to seals and sharks. Large placid oily spots upon the
                    surface of the sea are often seen above the places where the lump-fish have been
                    seized and slain. We also occasionally find their skins floating empty along the
                    shore, the flesh and blood having been previously extracted by their insatiate
                    foes. The male is said to preserve with great care the eggs which he has
                    fecundated, and he has moreover been famed in fable for his affectionate
                    behaviour to the female. There does not, however, appear to be any real
                    foundation for this trait in his character,—a very unfrequent one in that of any

                    dentated or spinous at their posterior edge, and moveable in such a manner that
                    the fish can create a vacancy between them; and thus, aided also by the toothed
                    margin, it fixes itself securely either to rocks or floating bodies.</p>
                <p>This genus has the body elongated, and clothed with small scales; a single soft
                    dorsal fin opposite to the anal; the head quite flat above; the mouth cleft
                    horizontally, and rounded; the lower jaw placed more forwards, and furnished, as
                    well as the inter-maxillary bones, with small pectiniform teeth. There is a row
                    of regularly-set small teeth, like cilia, along the edge of the maxillaries,
                    which form the external margin of the upper jaw; the vomer is furnished with
                    cardiform teeth, as well as the tongue. They have eight branchiostegous rays.
                    Their stomach is a wide cul-de-sac; the caeca six or eight in number; the
                    intestine wide, but short. They have no swimming bladder.</p>
                <p>The species are few in number. Of these, <hi rend="italic">Echencis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">remora,</hi> Linn., the famous <hi rend="italic">Remora,</hi> or
                    sucking fish, of the Mediterranean, is the best known. It has usually eighteen
                    plates in its cranial disk.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary power possessed by this fish, of adhering tenaciously to any
                    flattish surface, was known to ancient writers, as well as to the curious
                    inquirers of modern times. Pliny luxuriates upon it with his usual discursive
                    verbosity. The reader may possibly be amused by Philemon Holland’s translation
                    of the passages in question. “Having so far proceeded in the discourse of
                    nature’s historié, that I am now arrived at the very heigth of her forces, and
                    come into a world of examples, I cannot chuse but in the first place consider
                    the power of her operations, and the infinitnesse of her secrets, which offer
                    themselves before our eyes in the sea: for in no part else of this universal
                    frame is it possible to observe the like majestie of nature: insomuch, as we
                    need not seeke any farther, nay, we ought not to make more search into her
                    divinitie, considering there cannot be found any thing equall or like unto this
                    one element, wherein she hath surmounted and gone beyond her own selfe in a
                    wonderfull number of respects. For, first and foremost, is there any thing more
                    violent than the sea; and namely when it is troubled with blustring winds,
                    whirlepuffs, storms, and tempests? or wherein hath the wit of man been more
                    employed (seeke out all parts of the know n world) than in seconding the waves
                    and billows of the sea, by saile and ore? Finally, is there ought more admirable
                    than the inerrable force of the rcciprocall tides of the sea, ebbing and flowing
                    as it doth, whereby it keepeth a current also, as it were the stream of some
                    great river <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi></p>
                <p>‘‘ The current of the sea is great, the tide much, the wands vehement and
                    forcible; and more than that, ores and sailes withall to help forward the rest,
                    are mightie and powerfull: and yet there is one little sillie fish, named
                    echencis, that checketh, scorneth, and arresteth them all. Let the winds blow as
                    much as they will, rage the storms and tempests what they can, yet this little
                    fish commaundeth their furie, restraineth their puissance, and, maugre all their
                    force, as great as it is, compelleth ships to stand still: a thing which no
                    cables, be they never so big and able as they will, can perform. She bridleth
                    the violence and tameth the greatest rage of this universall world, and that
                    without any paine that she putteth herselfe unto, without any holding or putting
                    backe, or any other meanes save only by cleaving and sticking fast to a vesscll:
                    in such a sort as this one small and poore fish is sufficient to resist and
                    withstand so great a power both of sea and navie, yea and to stop the passage of
                    a ship, doe they all wdiat they can possible to the contrarie. What should our
                    fleets and armadoes at sea make such turrets in their decks and forecastles?
                    what should they fortifie their ships in warlike manner, to fight from them upon
                    the sea, as it were from mure and rampier on firme land? See the vanitie of man!
                    alas, how foolish are we to make all this adoe? When one little fish, not above
                    half a foot long, is able to arrest and stay per force, yea, and hold as
                    prisoners, our goodly tall and proud ships, so well armed in the beakehead with
                    yron pikes and brazen tines; so offensive and dangerous to bouge and pierce any
                    enemie ship which they doe encountre. Certes, reported it is, that in the naval

                    Antium; when and where this little fish detained his ship, and (as it fell out
                    afterward) presaged an unfortunate event thereby: for this was the last time
                    that ever this emperour made his returne to Rome: and no sooner was he arrived,
                    but his own souldiours in a mutinie fell upon him and stabbed him to death. And
                    yet it was not long ere the cause of this wonderfull staic of his ship was
                    knowne; for so soon as ever the vessel (and a galliace it was, furnished with
                    five bankes of ores to a side) was perceived alone in the fleete to stand still,
                    presentlie a number of tall fellows leapt out of their ships into the sea, to
                    search what the reason might be that it stirred not; and found one of these
                    fishes sticking fast to the very helme: which being reported unto <hi
                    rend="italic">Caius</hi><hi rend="italic">Caligula,</hi> he fumed and fared as
                    an emperour, taking great indignation that so small a thing as it should hold
                    him back perforce, and check the strength of all his mariners, notwithstanding
                    there were no fewer than foure hundred lustic men in his galley that laboured at
                    the ore all that ever they could to the contrarie. But this prince (as it is for
                    certain knowne) was most astonied at this, namely, that the fish sticking only
                    to the ship, should hold it fast; and the same being brought into the ship and
                    there laid, not worke the like effect. They who at that time and afterward saw
                    the fish, report that it resembled for all the world a snaile of the greatest
                    making: but as touching the form and sundrie kinds thereof, many have written
                    diversly, whose opinions I have set downe in my treatise of living creatures
                    belonging to the waters, and namely in the particular discourse of this fish:
                    neither doe I doubt but all the sorte of fishes are able to doe as much: for
                    this we are to believe, that Pourcellans also be of the same vertue, since it
                    was well knowne by a notorious example, that one of them did the like by a ship
                    sent from <hi rend="italic">Periander</hi> to the Cape of Gnidos: in regard
                    whereof, the inhabitants of Gnidos doe honour and consecrat the said Porcellane
                    within their temples of <hi rend="italic">Venus.</hi> Some of our Latin writers
                    do call the said fish that thus staieth a ship, by the name of Remora.”</p>
                <p>Another species, <hi rend="italic">Echencis Naucrates,</hi> Linn. (Plate CCCV.
                    fig. 10), commonly called the Indian Remora, has usually twenty-two plates upon
                    the head. In its habits it resembles the preceding; but it seems to be more
                    frequent in the seas of India and America, than in those of Europe. The
                    manuscripts of Commerson, as quoted by Count Lacépède, inform us that it is
                    common along the coasts of Mosambique, where it is made use of in a singular way
                    for the purpose of catching turtles. A ring is first fastened round its tail,
                    and then a long cord is attached to the ring. When thus accoutred, the fish,
                    placed in a vessel of seawater. is carried out in a boat; and as soon as the
                    fishermen perceive a sleeping turtle, they row gently towards it, and throw the
                    remora into the water, with a sufficient length of cord. It seldom fails
                    speedily to attach itself to the unconscious turtle,· which by the tenacity of
                    its adherence is immediately drawn towards the boat and captured.</p>
                <p>A third species of remora is described by Mr Archibald Menzies as an inhabitant
                    of the Pacific Ocean.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    are acquainted) has been more recently discovered by Baron Cuvier. The rays of
                    its pectoral fins are bony, compressed, and terminated by a slightly notched <hi

                <p>ORDER IV.—MALACOPTERYGII APODES which may be considered as constituting a single
                    natural family, the</p>
                <p>ANGUILLIFORMES, or fishes with an elongated shape; a thick skin, on which scales
                    are in general but indistinctly visible; and without <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeca</hi> to their intestines. Almost all are provided with a swimming
                    bladder, which often assumes a remarkable form. The. ancient unrestricted <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Genus Müraena</hi> of Linnaeus is distinguished by the
                    snake-like form of the body; the small opercles covering concentric
                    branchiostegous rays, buried in the skin, and only opening posteriorly by a sort
                    of tubular orifice. This structure, by giving a more perfect command over the
                    closure of the gills, enables them to remain longer out of water without injury
                    than the generality of fishes. They have scarcely-perceptible scales, which are
                    concealed in a tough skin, covered with a slippery mucus. They all are destitute
                    of ventral fins and caeca, and have the anus placed very far behind. Numerous
                    subdivisions of the old genus <hi rend="italic">Muroena</hi> have taken place in
                    modern times. We shall here note the following:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Anguilla,</hi> Thunberg and Shaw. Eels in general, as
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Muroenoe,</hi> are characterised by the
                    possession of pectoral fins, under which the branchial aperture opens; their
                    swimming bladder has an elongated shape, and near its middle a peculiar
                    glandular body; their stomach has a long cul-de-sac; their intestine is almost
                    straight.</p>
                <p>The more restricted genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Anguilla,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">eel properly so called,</hi> has the dorsal and caudal fins
                    continued around the tail, giving it a pointed form.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> eels, the dorsal begins a considerable
                    distance behind the pectorals. Some have the upper jaw shorter than the lower;
                    such as the <hi rend="italic">Anguilla vulgaris,</hi> or common eel. (Plate
                    CCCVI. fig. 1.) This fish is universally distributed, and scarcely requires
                    description. The usual colour is an olive tint above, and a silvery colour
                    below; but in some instances the back is spotted with brown. We have observed
                    these fish in considerable numbers leaving fresh-water lakes in the night time,
                    and frequenting meadows, seemingly for the purpose of preying on slugs and
                    snails. They easily move on the land, with α motion resembling that of snakes.
                    The eel grows to the size of two or three feet, and is sometimes said to reach
                    five or six feet in length. It abounds in many European rivers. Eels are caught
                    in immense numbers in the rivers emptying themselves into the Baltic; and they
                    form a considerable article of trade. Two thousand are stated to have been
                    caught at one sweep in Jutland; and in the Garonne 60,000 were taken in one day
                    by a single net.</p>
                <p>“That eels migrate towards brackish water,” observes Mr Jesse, “in order to
                    deposit their roe, I have but little doubt, for the following reasons. From the
                    month of November until the end of January, provided the frost is not very
                    serious, eels migrate towards the sea. The Thames fishermen are so aware of this
                    fact, that they invariably set their pots or baskets with their mouths up stream
                    during those months, while later in the spring and summer they are set down
                    stream. The best time, however, for taking eels, is during their passage towards
                    the sea. The eel-traps, also, which are set in three different streams near
                    Hampton Court (the contents of which, at different times, I have had
                    opportunities of examining<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940714"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-0714-0224"/>), have invariably been supplied with eels
                    sufficiently large to be breeders, during the months I have mentioned. This
                    migratory disposition is not shown by small eels; and it may therefore be
                    assumed that they remain nearly stationary till they are old enough to have
                    spawn. I have also ascertained that eels are taken in greater or lesser numbers
                    during the months of November or December, all the way down the river to the
                    brackish water. From thence the young eels migrate, as soon as they arc
                    sufficiently large and strong to encounter the several currents of the river,
                    and make their way to the different contributary streams. I have also been able
                    to trace the procession of young eels, or, as it is called here, the <hi
                    rend="italic">eel-fair,</hi> from the neighbourhood of Blackfriar’s Bridge, as
                    far up the river as Chestrey, although they probably make their way as far, or
                    farther than Oxford. So strong, indeed, is their migratory disposition, that it
                    is well known few things will prevent their progress, as, even at the locks at
                    Teddington and Hampton, the young eels have been seen to ascend the large posts
                    of the flood-gates, in order to make their way, when the gates have been shut
                    longer than usual. Those which die stick to the posts; others, which get a
                    little higher, meet with the same fate, until at last a sufficient layer of them
                    is formed to enable the rest to overcome the difficulty of the passage. A
                    curious instance of the means which young eels will have recourse to, in order
                    to perform their migrations, is annually proved in the neighbourhood of Bristol.
                    _ Near that city there is a large pond, immediately adjoining which is a stream.
                    On the bank between these two waters a large tree grows, the branches of which
                    hang into the pond. By means of these branches, the young eels ascend into the
                    tree, and from thence let themselves drop into the stream below, thus migrating
                    to far distant waters, where they increase in size, and become useful and
                    beneficial to man. A friend of mine, who was a casual witness of this
                    circumstance, informed me that the tree appeared to be quite alive with these
                    little animals. The rapid and unsteady motion of the boughs did not appear to
                    impede their progress.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Wolga, the Danube, or any of its tributary streams. It is said there are no eels
                    in the Caspian or Black Seas, but they abound in the Mediterranean; and Μ. Risso
                    has described eight species in his work on the Natural History of the Environs
                    of Nice. There is no doubt, also, that fishes in general, and eels more
                    particularly, are able to appreciate even minute alterations of temperature in
                    the water they inhabit. The brackish water they seek to remain in during the
                    colder months of the year, is of a higher temperature than that of the pure
                    fresh water of the river, or that of the sea. It is a well-known law in
                    chemistry, that when two fluids of different densities come in contact, the
                    temperature of the mixture is elevated for a time, in proportion to the
                    difference in density of the two fluids, from the mutual penetration and
                    condensation. Such a mixture is constantly taking place in rivers that run into
                    the sea, and the temperature of the mixed water is accordingly elevated.”<note

                    inferred that their descent to the brackish water, though customary, is not
                    indispensable. They sometimes attain a great size. The species (or variety)
                    called the <hi rend="italic">sharp-nosed silver eel</hi> has been taken near

                <p>Some authors make a separate division of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Congers</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Conger,</hi> Cuv.), which chiefly differ from the common eels in
                    having the upper jaw the longest, and the dorsal fin commencing almost over the
                    pectorals. The chief species are the following: <hi rend="italic">Anguilla
                    conger</hi> (Plate CCCVI. fig. 3) grows to the size of six feet or more, and is
                    as thick as a man’s leg. The conger is found around all our coasts. The skin has
                    a leaden hue above, and is white below, with darker spots along the sides. The
                    dorsal is bordered with black. The teeth are sharp, and when captured the fish
                    is capable of giving very severe bites. The fishermen are stated also to dread
                    injury to their legs from a large conger twining round them. It has been said to
                    attack swimmers by coiling round them, and preying on their bodies. It is
                    voracious, and has not unfrequently been found within the carcasses of dead
                    animals, on which it was evidently feeding. The conger fishery was at one time
                    of some consequence on the Cornish coasts, for the supply of Spain and Portugal.
                    The fish were cured by drying, during which they lost much fat. <hi

                    snout, a thin roundish body of a dark colour, without spots, except toward the
                    head, where a few yellowish dashes are seen; as also a whitish transverse band
                    on the occiput, and two rows of small specks on the back of the neck. This
                    species occurs in the Mediterranean, as do several other small congers, such as

                    The last named lives among the rocks near Nice, and attains to the weight of

                    fins terminating abruptly before reaching the extremity of the tail, which is
                    thus deprived of fin, and ends in a sharpened point. The intestine resembles
                    that of the eels; but a portion of it extends into the tail, farther back than
                    the anus. The teeth are sharp and cutting. <hi rend="italic">Ophisurus

                    grows to the length of six feet, and is as thick as the human arm. The snout is

                    were united by Linnaeus to the eels; but they are distinguished sufficiently by
                    the total want of pectoral fins. Their branchial apertures are minute lateral
                    holes; their opercles are so small, and their branchiostegous rays so slender,
                    and so concealed within the skin, that some able naturalists have denied their
                    existence in this genus. Their stomach is a short pouch; and their swimming
                    bladder is small, oval, and placed towards the upper part of the abdomen. Some
                    of them have the dorsal and anal fins distinctly visible; some have obtuse,
                    others sharp cutting teeth, and the latter can bite severely.</p>

                    and was introduced by the luxurious Romans of antiquity, in crystal vases, to
                    the table before being cooked, that the guests might admire its variegated skin.
                    This fish is very voracious, and feeds on all sorts of animal matter. The Romans
                    fed them in ponds, and Pliny has recorded the atrocities of Vedius Pollio, who
                    used to punish his offending slaves by throwing them alive to his muraenae. We

                    The skin is beautifully marbled with yellow sub-angular markings on a rich brown
                    ground. When captured in nets it lives long out of the water, and is capable of
                    biting very severely, from the sharpness of its numerous teeth. A very beautiful

                    chiefly in having the branchial apertures close together, and beneath the
                    throat, instead of being on each side of the neck. The snout is sharp, and
                    projecting far beyond the mouth; the dorsal and anal fins, when perceptible, do
                    not commence until within one third of the length of the fish from the extremity
                    of the tail. Some of them have no appearance of pectoral fins; others have

                    The best-known species is <hi rend="italic">Gymnotus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >electricus,</hi> or electric eel (Plate CCCVI. fig. 5). This animal has been
                    well described by Dr Garden of Charlestown, by John Hunter, and by Humboldt. It
                    is remarkable for the violence of its electric shocks, which are often so
                    powerful as to stu-pify a man or a horse. The researches of Hunter detected an
                    organ in the posterior part of this fish, resembling the electric apparatus of
                    the torpedo. See Plate CCCVI. fig. 6. This organ consists of four longitudinal
                    fasciculi, which occupy one half the thickness of the part in which they occur,
                    and about one third of the whole animal. The larger pair lie above, the smaller
                    below. Each fasciculus is composed of flat partitions or septa, with transverse
                    divisions between them. The outer edge of the septa appear in nearly parallel
                    lines in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the body, and consist of thin
                    membranes, which are easily torn; they serve the same purpose as the columns in
                    the analogous organ of the torpedo, making the walls or abutments for the
                    perpendicular and transverse dissepiments, which are exceedingly numerous, and
                    so closely aggregated as to seem almost in contact. The minute prismatic cells,
                    intercepted between these two sorts of plates, contain a gelatinous matter; the
                    septa are about one thirtieth of an inch from each other, and one inch in length
                    contains a series of 240 cells, giving an enormous surface to the electric
                    organs. The whole apparatus is abundantly supplied with nerves from the medula
                    spinalis; and these nerves are seen coming out in pairs from between the
                    vertebrae. In their course they give out branches to the muscles of the back,
                    and to the skin of the animal. In the gymnote, as in the torpedo, the nerves
                    supplying the electric organs are much larger than those bestowed on any part
                    for the purposes of sensation or movement. Hunter thinks, however, that these
                    nerves are more considerable in point of size in the torpedo than in the
                    gymnote. These organs are attached loosely to the muscles of the back which lie
                    between the larger, and they are immediately connected with the skin by a loose
                    cellular texture. Humboldt has given a very interesting and lively description
                    of the mode of capturing the electric gymnote, as practised in South America,
                    near the town of Calabozo.</p>
                <p>These fish abound in the stagnant pools of that vicinity. The Indians are well
                    aware of the danger of encountering the gymnote when its powers are unexhausted.
                    They therefore collect twenty or thirty wild horses, force them into the pools,
                    and when the fish have exhausted their electric batteries on the poor horses,
                    they are laid hold of without difficulty. The horses at first exhibit much
                    agitation and terror; they are prevented leaving the pool by an enclosing band
                    of Indians, who goad them with bamboos whenever they attempt to escape. “The
                    eels,” says Humboldt, “stunned and confused by the noise of the horses, defended
                    themselves by reiterated discharges of their electric batteries. For some time
                    they seemed likely to gain the victory over the horses and mules; these were
                    seen in every direction, stunned by the frequency and force of the shocks, to
                    disappear under water. Some horses, however, rose again, and, in spite of the
                    active vigilance of the Indians, gained the shore, exhausted with fatigue; and
                    their limbs being benumbed by the electric explosions, they stretched themselves
                    out upon the ground.” “I remember the superb picture of a horse entering a
                    cavern, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940740" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0740-0226"/>and
                    terrified at the sight of a lion. The expression of terror is not there stronger
                    than what we witnessed in this unequal conflict. In less than five minutes two
                    horses were already drowned. The eel, more than five feet long, glides under the
                    belly of the horse or mule; it then makes a discharge from the whole extent of
                    its electric organs, which at once attacks the heart, the viscera, and
                    especially the gastric plexus of nerves.” <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> After
                    this commencement, I was afraid that the sport might end very tragically. But
                    the Indians assured us that the fishing would soon be finished, and that nothing
                    is to be dreaded but the first assault of the gymnotiļs. In fact, whether the
                    galvanic electricity is accumulated in repose, or the electric organ ceases to
                    perform its functions when fatigued by too long-continued use, the eels, after a
                    time, resemble discharged batteries. Their muscular motion is still equally
                    active, but they no longer have the power of giving energetic shocks. When the
                    combat had lasted a quarter of an hour, the mules and horses appeared less
                    affrighted; they no longer bristled up the mane, and the eye was less expressive
                    of suffering and of terror. They no longer were seen to fall backwards; and the
                    gymnotes, swimming with the body half out of the water, and now flying from the
                    horses instead of attacking them, began themselves, in their turn, to approach
                    the shore.”</p>
                <p>The electric gymnote is by no means fierce or voracious; but its electric organs
                    are the instruments by which it procures its prey, and defends itself against
                    alligators and other enemies.</p>
                <p>It has been several times brought alive to Europe, and some experiments have been
                    made on its electricity,— which is conducted and insulated by the same
                    substances as common galvanism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>So common is the gymnotus in some parts of South America, that, in the
                    neighbourhood of Uritucu, a route at one time much frequented has been entirely
                    abandoned, in consequence of the necessity of fording a stream, in which many
                    mules were killed every year by these subaqueous electric shocks.</p>
                <p>The only other known species of gymnotus is the <hi rend="italic">G.
                    oequilabiatus</hi> of Humboldt, which appears to differ from the other in
                    wanting the posterior swimming bladder.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Carapus</hi> was separated by Cuvier from the
                    gymnotes, with which they were formerly confounded; and the species are
                    distinguished by a sealycompressed body and a slender tail. The appellation is
                    derived from their Brazilian name. All the species live in the rivers of South
                    America, or on the coasts of that country. <hi rend="italic">Carapus
                    macrourus</hi> grows to the length of eighteen inches or two feet, and is of a

                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Sternarchus</hi> of Schneider was so denominated
                    from the anus being near the sternum. The anal fin ends before it reaches the
                    extremity of the tail, which has a fin of its own; but the most singular
                    character in the structure of this fish consists of a soft fleshy filament,
                    concealed in a furrow on the dorsum, beyond the middle of the back, and retained
                    in this groove by tendinous threads, which admit of its having some motion; a
                    very singular organ, of which we cannot conjecture the use. The head is oblong,
                    naked, and compressed; neither opercula nor branchial rays are externally
                    visible; the rest of the body is scaly; the teeth are soft, short filaments,
                    like velvet, on the middle of each jaw. The only species is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sternarchus albifrons,</hi> which was considered by Pallas, its first

                    believe, the only known species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Leptocephalus,</hi> Pennant. This genus differs from
                    the eels by being greatly compressed laterally, by a larger branchial aperture
                    opening before the pectorals, by a head extremely small, and a pointed snout.
                    The pectorals are almost invisible; the dorsal and anal are very small, and
                    unite at the point of the tail. The intestines occupy a narrow line along the
                    inferior margin of the body.</p>
                <p>Only one species is known, a native of our own seas, first described by Pennant.
                    It is the <hi rend="italic">Leptocephalus Mor-risii,</hi> a small fish of four
                    inches long by one tenth of an inch in thickness, and so transparent as almost
                    to exhibit the form of the vertebra^ which may also be felt through the
                    integuments. This singular creature was first seen near Holyhead by Mr William
                    Morris, who transmitted it to Pennant. Though still a rare species, it has since
                    been observed by several other British naturalists.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ophidium,</hi> Linn. This genus has the anus far
                    behind; the dorsal and anal fins join in a point at the tail; the body is long
                    and compressed, and covered with small irregular scales, scattered in the
                    thickness of the skin. But these fish differ from eels, in having open gills,
                    furnished with a large operculum, and a branchiostegous membrane, with short
                    rays. The dorsal rays are articulated, but not branched.</p>
                <p>The genus is subdivided into two sub-genera, viz. <hi rend="italic">Ophidium
                    proper,</hi> in which the throat is provided with two cirrhi adhering to the
                    point of the os hyoides. The best-known species is <hi rend="italic">Ophidium
                    bαrbaturn,</hi> which grows to eight inches; general colour silvery, but the
                    vertical fins banded with black; the surface smooth, scales attached by their
                    centre to the skin; two biful cirrhi on the throat; skin spotted with small red
                    spots. The swimming bladder is oval, large, and thick, for the size of the fish,
                    and is supported by three peculiar bones suspended under the first vertebra, and
                    moveable by particular muscles. This fish abounds in the Mediterranean, where it
                    is in request as an article of diet. <hi rend="italic">Ophidium Vassali</hi> is
                    a small species, also found in the Mediterranean; but in the South Seas a large
                    species has been caught. It is named <hi rend="italic">Oph. blacodes.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Enchelyopus (Herasfer),</hi> Klein, differs in wanting the
                    beards of the true Ophidium. The dorsal fin is so slight as only to seem a fold
                    of the skin; the swimming bladder has but two supporting bones. Only one species
                    is recognised, <hi rend="italic">Cphidium</hi><hi rend="italic">imberbe</hi> of
                    Linn., which is also <hi rend="italic">Gyrnnο~ tus acus</hi> of several
                    naturalists. As a British species, it was first communicated to Pennant by the
                    Duchess of Portland, from Weymouth. It has since been found by Montagu on the
                    south coast of Devon.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ammodytes,</hi> Linn. Has a thin and elongated form.
                    The dorsal fin is furnished with articulated rays, but is simple for a
                    considerable part of its extent. There is a second fin behind the anus, and a
                    third at the end of the tail, which is forked. These three fins are quite
                    distinct, or separate from each other. The snout is pointed; the upper jaw
                    susceptible of extension, but the lower is longer than the upper when the latter
                    is not extended. The stomach is angular and fleshy; there is no swimming bladder
                    nor caeca. Only one British species is as yet distinctly known, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ammodytes tobianus</hi> (our common launce), a fish about eight or
                    ten inches long, the body somewhat of a square form, but the angles not sharp,
                    and the sides slightly convex. It is very frequent on our sandy coasts. Its back
                    is bluish, the rest rich silvery. This fish lives on vermes and other marine
                    animals, which it is believed to pursue by burrowing in the sand, from whence it
                    is often dug up at the depth of a foot. It is prized as food, and is considered
                    as an excellent bait for turbot and mackerel. It is the favourite prey of the
                    latter fish; and the porpoise ploughs up the sand at the bottom of the sea with
                    his nose, in the manner of a hog, in search of this species, which has often
                    been found in his stomach. It is also sought for by salmon, which have been
                    captured in the sandy bays of Sutherland, by means of a hook baited by a launce,
                    commonly called the <hi rend="italic">sand-eel.</hi></p>
                <p>It is extremely probable that two British species are usually confounded by us
                    under the name of launce.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The various genera of fishes with which we have been hitherto engaged, not only
                    possess an osseous or fibrous skeleton, and free and complete jaws, but their
                    branchiae are constantly pectiniform, that is, in the shape of laminae or combs.
                    We now proceed to others, in which the respiratory organs assume another
                    form.</p>
                <p>ORDER V.—LOPHOBRANCΠΠ.</p>
                <p>Jaws complete and free, as in the preceding orders, but the branchiae, instead of
                    being comb-shaped, are divided into little rounded tufts, disposed in pairs
                    along the branchial arches. The branchiae have this further peculiarity, that
                    they are entirely enclosed beneath a large operculum, attached all round by a
                    membrane, which permits the water to escape merely through a small hole, and
                    exhibits only vestiges of rays.</p>
                <p>The genera of this order may be distinguished externally by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cuirassed</hi> aspect of their bodies, which are strongly plated, very angular,
                    and frequently furnished with spiny projections. The species are meagre
                    creatures, of small size, and very extraordinary aspect. They have scarcely any
                    <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> upon their bones. The intestine is uniform, and
                    without caeca; the swimming bladder is thin, but tolerably large in proportion
                    to the other parts. The order is almost entirely composed of the old genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Syng-ηαthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pegasus</hi> of
                    Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Syngnathes</hi> of the great Swedish naturalist
                    consisted of a rather numerous assemblage of species, distinguished by a tubular
                    muzzle, formed, like that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fistularidae,</hi> by a
                    prolongation of the ethmoid, vomer, and tympanic bones, of the pre-opercles,
                    sub-opercles, &amp;c. and terminated by a mouth of the ordinary kind, but almost
                    vertically cleft. The respiratory opening is towards the nape of the neck, and
                    the ventral fins arc wanting. The generative system is characterised by this
                    peculiarity, that the eggs slip into, and are hatched in∣ a kind of sac or
                    pocket, formed by a pursing of the skin—in some beneath the belly, in others at
                    the base of the tail. This pouch opens in due time for the escape of the young.
                    In this respect, then, these fishes may be said to connect the osseous with the
                    cartilaginous kinds, for the eggs are hatched internally, and the young are
                    produced alive. This fact was observed by Aristotle, and has lately been
                    confirmed (so far, at least, as concerns <hi rend="italic">S. acus)</hi> by
                    Cavolini. The genus is now subdivided into three minor groups, as follows :—</p>
                <p>Is/, Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Syngnatiius</hi> properly so called. Body very
                    long, thin, and differing but little in its diameter throughout. Several species
                    occur in all our seas. They differ in the character and number of their
                    fins.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hippocampus, Cuv.</hi> Body
                    laterally compressed, and obviously higher than at the tail. The surface is
                    raised into ridges, its edges are angular and incised, and the hinder parts of
                    the body and tail have the appearance of being divided into segments. The caudal
                    fin is wanting.</p>
                <p>, Of this genus several species are found in the European seas, and one or two
                    occur along the British shores. The greater number, however, are exotic. In the
                    dried specimens the head is usually bent at right angles with the body, the
                    thorax curved, and the tail bent nwards. From the peculiar aspect which they
                    exhibit in this condition, they have received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sea-horses.</hi> The most remarkable species with which we are acquainted is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus foliatus</hi> of Shaw, or foliated pipe-fish.
                    (Sec Plate CCCVI. fig. 7.) This rare and very singularly constructed fish is a
                    native of the Southern Ocean. The specimen described by Shaw was transmitted
                    from New Holland to Sir Joseph Banks. The one here figured was sent to Professor
                    Jameson from Van Liemen’s Land. We should not have hesitated to consider this
                    species as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">S. taeniolatus</hi> of Lacépède
                    (and the more readily as they seem to be regarded as identical by Cuvier<note

                    comparing it with the figure in the <hi rend="italic">Annales du Mus.</hi> we
                    find that the Van Diemen’s Land specimen possesses two large appendages on the
                    dorsal outline, not represented by the author of the earlier <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist. Nat. des Poissons.</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solenostoma,</hi> Seb. and Lacép. Differs from <hi
                    rend="italic">Syngnathus</hi> chiefly in possessing very large ventrals placed
                    behind the pectorals, and united together and with the body so as to form a kind
                    of apron, which, like the pouch of the genus just named, serves to retain the
                    ova. There is also a dorsal, with few rays, but elevated, and placed near the
                    nape; another very small fin on the origin of the tail; and a large pointed
                    caudal. In other respects the genus bears a great resemblance to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hippocampus.</hi> There is only a single species known, the <hi

                    nature, so far resembles that of the sturgeon, although it is composed of the
                    same bones as the mouth of ordinary fishes.</p>
                <p>The body in this genus is cuirassed like that of <hi rend="italic">Hippo
                    campus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Solenostoma,</hi> but the trunk is broad,
                    depressed, the branchial opening lateral, and there are two distinct ventral
                    fins behind the pectorals, which are often large and wing-like, and have given
                    rise to the generic name. The dorsal and anal are opposite to each other. The
                    species are chiefly from the Indian seas. See Plate CCCVI. fig. 10.</p>

                <p>ORDER VI.~PLECTOGNATHI.</p>
                <p>The fishes of this order approach the great chondropterygian division in the
                    imperfection of their jaws, and the slowness with which their skeleton hardens;
                    yet that skeleton is fibrous, and its general structure resembles that of the
                    ordinary or osseous fishes. The principal distinctive character, however, of the
                    Plectognathi, consists in the maxillary bone being soldered or firmly attached
                    on the side of the inter-maxillary, which alone forms the jaw, and in the
                    palatine arch being connected by suture with the cranium, which consequently
                    renders it immoveable. Moreover, the rays and opercles are concealed beneath a
                    thick skin, which permits only a small branchial cleft to be visible externally.
                    The vestiges of ribs are very slight. The true ventrals are wanting. The
                    intestinal canal is ample, but without caeca, and almost all the species are
                    provided with a rather large swimming bladder.</p>
                <p>The order comprises two very natural families, characterised by the different
                    armature of the jaws.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I—GYMNODONTES.</p>
                <p>Instead of apparent teeth, the jaws are furnished with a substance like ivory,
                    divided internally into laminae or plates, the totality of which resembles the
                    beak of a parrot, and is essentially composed of true teeth united together, and
                    succeeding each other as they become used by trituration. The opercles are
                    small, their rays five in number on each side, and the whole greatly concealed.
                    The species live on Crustacea and Fuci. Their flesh is in general mucous, and
                    slightly esteemed. Some indeed are even poisonous, at least during certain
                    seasons.</p>
                <p>Two of the genera (<hi rend="italic">Tetraodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diodon),</hi> commonly called orbs or balloon-fish, possess a singular faculty
                    of inflating their bodies by swallowing great quantities of air. When thus
                    swollen, they roll over and float upon the surface, belly uppermost, apparently
                    unable to direct their course. They are not, however, defenceless, for the
                    spines with which their skin is armed project in all directions. Their swimming
                    bladder has two lobes, and their kidneys, which are placed very high up, have
                    been sometimes mistaken for lungs. There are büt three branchiae on each side.
                    Each nostril is furnished with a double fleshy tentaculum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Diodon,</hi> Linn. The undivided jaws exhibit but one
                    piece above and another below,—from whence the generic name, which signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">two teeth.</hi> Behind each cutting edge is a rounded portion,
                    transversely grooved, and forming a powerful instrument of mastication.<note

                    the jaws of these fishes are by no means unfrequent among
                    petrifactions.</p></note> The skin is armed on all sides by strong, pointed
                    spines, so that, when inflated, these creatures bear a resemblance to a gigantic
                    burr of a chestnut tree.</p>
                <p>The species are numerous in the warmer seas. One of the most common is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diodon atinga</hi> of Bloch, which measures about a foot in
                    diameter. It inhabits the seas of India, America, and Southern Africa, and feeds
                    on the smaller fishes, Crustacea, and shell-fish, the calcareous covering of
                    which it breaks with great facility, by means of its robust and bony jaws. It is
                    a dangerous species to meddle with, owing to the sudden and hedgehog-like manner
                    in which it bristles up its spines. It seems synonymous with <hi rend="italic"
                    >D.</hi><hi rend="italic">hystrix</hi> of Linn., commonly called the
                    sea-porcupine, and was formerly a frequent and dustyappendage in the shop of the
                    apothecary. (See Plate CCCVI. fig. 8.) <hi rend="italic">Diodon holocanthus</hi>
                    inhabits almost all the seas between the tropics. When taken by means of a hook,
                    it exhibits the most ungovernable movements,—alternately inflates and compresses
                    its body, ascends and descends with rapidity and violence, and is extremely
                    dangerous to lay hold of. It is fished for both in the Red Sea and along the
                    coast of Japan; and, according to Dutertre, the hooks are baited with Crustacea.
                    The bait, it appears, is first approached with caution, then tasted, left,
                    returned to, and finally swallowed. It no sooner, however, finds itself fairjy
                    hooked, than it swells itself up like a balloon, utters a dull sound like that
                    produced by a turkey-cock while making its wheel, and then becomes exceedingly
                    furious. It next has recourse to an opposite mode of action, by lowering its
                    spines, disinflating its body, and becoming as loose and flabby as a wet
                    glove.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Griffith’s <hi

                    activity, however, as soon as it perceives the fisherman drawing towards it, or
                    feels itself being drawn towards the fisherman. In short it has a particular
                    dislike to being killed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Tetraodon,</hi> Linn. Jaws divided in the centre by a
                    suture, so as to exhibit the appearance of four teeth (from whence the name),
                    two above and two below. The skin is armed merely by small spines, which project
                    but little. Several species are regarded as poisonous.</p>
                <p>The most anciently known is an Egyptian species, <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lineatus,</hi> Linn., which is thrown by the floods in vast
                    numbers over the prolific banks of the Nile, where it is afterwards gathered as
                    a plaything by the children. According to Hasselquist, however, the Egyptians
                    hold it in abhorrence, and believe that the use of its flesh as food is followed
                    by death. The prickles of its skin produce a sensation like the stinging of
                    nettles. In many Mahommedan countries another species, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >T.hispidus</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">)y</hi> Lacépède, is fully inflated, then
                    carefully dried, and afterwards suspended from the pinnacle of the minarets,
                    where it serves the purpose of a weathercock. The hare tetraodon, as it is
                    called (<hi rend="italic">T. lαgocephalus,</hi> Linn.), appears to have been
                    described by Pennant under the title of <hi rend="italic">Globe Diodon.</hi>
                    Though a tropical species, it has occurred occasionally along the British
                    coasts, particularly near Penzance in Cornwall. We here figure a curious Indian

                    of an artificial truncation. The form is in consequence extraordinary and
                    characteristic. The dorsal and anal fin, each high and pointed, seem to unite

                    number of distinct teeth on each jaw. The skin is generally rough, or covered by
                    hard scales. The swimming bladder is large and robust, and of an oval form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Balistes,</hi> Linn. Body compressed; eight teeth upon
                    a single row on each jaw, and generally <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a cutting
                    kind; skin sealyor engrained, but not absolutely osseous; first dorsal composed

                    cranium, and presents a groove into which the spines are received; second dorsal
                    soft and long, and corresponding in its position to an anal fin of nearly
                    similar form. Although the ventral fins are wanting, we nevertheless perceive in
                    the skeleton a true pelvic bone suspended to those of the shoulder.</p>
                <p>The species occur in vast numbers in the torrid zone, among rocks nearly on a
                    level with the surface of the water, where they shine with a brilliant lustre
                    resembling that of the beautiful chaetodons, formerly described. Their flesh, at
                    no time much esteemed, is said to become dangerous as food while they themselves
                    are nourished by the polypi of the coral reefs. Cuvier however states, that in
                    such specimens as he had occasion to dissect, he found nothing but the remains
                    of marine vegetation. The generic name is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >balista,</hi> an ancient implement of war, to which the inclined dorsal spine
                    has been regarded as bearing some resemblance. In modern times the original
                    genus has been divided into the four following groups.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Balistes</hi> (properly so called) of Cuvier, the w+ole
                    body is clothed by large, hard, rhomboidal scales, which not being imbricated,
                    or encroaching on each other, present the appearance of compartments on the
                    skin; their anterior dorsal has three spines, of which the first is much the
                    largest, the third being very small, and placed somewhat apart behind. The
                    extremity of the “pelvis is always prickly and projecting, and behind it are
                    some spines involved in the skin, which in the lengthened species have been
                    regarded as rays of the ventral fins. Some have no particular armature on the
                    sides of the tail; others have the lateral portion of that part armed by a
                    certain number of ranges of spines curved forwards.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Monocanthus, Cuv.,</hi> the scales are very small, and
                    beset by close asperities; the extremity of the pelvis is projecting and spiny,
                    as in the preceding group, but there is only one large dentated spine to the
                    first dorsal, or, if the second exists, it is almost imperceptible.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Aluteres, Cuv.,</hi> the body is elongated, and covered
                    by scarcely visible, small, close-set grains; there is a single spine to the
                    first dorsal; and the pelvis is entirely subcutaneous, not forming that spiny
                    projection visible in the other <hi rend="italic">Balistes.</hi> See Plate
                    CCCVI. fig. 12.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Tri acanthus, Cuv.,</hi> the species are distinguished by
                    possessing a kind of ventral fins, each sustained by a large single spiny ray,
                    and adhering to an unprojecting pelvis.) The first dorsal, posterior to its
                    principal spine, has three or four smaller ones. The skin is covered by small,
                    closeset scales, and the tail is more elongated than in the other groups. There
                    is only one species known, a small fish from the Indian seas, figured by Bloch
                    (148, 2) under the name of <hi rend="italic">Balistes bi-aculeatus.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Genus Ostracion,</hi> Linn. Instead of scales, the species of
                    this genus have the head and body covered by regular and bony compartments,
                    soldered together so as to form an inflexible cuirass, which leaves nothing
                    moveable but the tail, fins, mouth, and a small lip which borders the gills. The
                    majority even of the vertebral joints are also as it were soldered. Each jaw is
                    armed with from ten to twelve conical teeth. The branchiae open only by a small
                    cleft, furnished with a cutaneous lobe; but internally they are provided with an
                    opercle and six rays. Both the pelvic bones and ventral fins are wanting, and
                    there is only a single dorsal and anal fin, each small of its kind.</p>
                <p>These anomalous-looking fishes are sparingly supplied with flesh; but their liver
                    is large, and yields an abundant supply of oil. Some are suspected of being
                    poisonous. The species are called <hi rend="italic">trunk-fish</hi> by our
                    English writers. We here figure the horned trunk-fish, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>SECOND GREAT SERIES OF THE CLASS OF FISHES.</p>
                <p>THE CHONDROPTERYG1I, OR CARTILAGINOUS FISHES.</p>
                <p>This division of fishes, by the peculiarities of the organs of hearing and
                    generation in some genera, approaches to the class of reptiles; while others
                    have a skeleton so defective, and such simplicity of organization, that we might
                    almost arrange them with Vermes. We may thus consider them, says Cuvier, as
                    bearing the same relation to the first series as the marsupial animals do to the
                    other mammifera furnished with clawè.</p>
                <p>Their skeleton is distinctly cartilaginous, destitute of true bony matter, as the
                    calcareous portion is not disposed into a fibrous structure, but is deposited in
                    grains in a substance essentially gelatinous. The skull is composed of a single
                    piece, and consequently is destitute of sutures, but possesses foramina,
                    prominences, and fossulae, like the cranium of other fishes. The facial
                    articulations are also wanting; and it forms one of their characteristics to
                    want the maxillary and inter-maxillary bones, which ordinarily support the teeth
                    of the upper jaw; or they have only vestiges of these parts, while their
                    functions are performed by bones analogous to the palatines or the vomer. In
                    some the vertebral column, as in the lamprey, forms but a single piece; in
                    others, as in certain rays, several vertebrae are joined· together. The
                    gelatinous inter-vertebral substance, which in other fishes communicates from
                    one to another through a small foramen, is in several of this series a cord of
                    equal thickness, perforating all the vertebrae. Yet their nervous system,
                    connected with the organs of digestion, is as complete as in other fishes; and
                    some of them have organs of copulation and generation quite as perfect as in the
                    class of reptiles.</p>
                <p>This series is divided into two orders; one distinguished by having the gills
                    free, as in other fishes; the other with fixed branchiae.</p>

                <p>ORDER I.—STURIONES, OR CHONDROPTERYGII WITH FREE BRANCHIAE.</p>
                <p>The few genera of this order approach to ordinary fishes, by their gills being
                    attached only at one extremity. They have but one branchial aperture, which is
                    very open; they have but one operculum, and are without rays to the membrane of
                    the gills.</p>

                    Sturgeon. The general form of this genus resembles that of the sharks; but they
                    are distinguished by longitudinal rows of bony plates or bosses implanted on the
                    skin; the head is defended by similar plates; the mouth is small, and. as in
                    sharks, placed below the snout; the palatal bones are united to the maxillaries,
                    and vestiges of the inter-maxillaries may be traced in the lips, while the mouth
                    is capable of some degree of projection, by its position on a style with three
                    articulations. Instead of teeth, the mouth is furnished with a sort of horny
                    process on the jaws. The nostrils and eyes are on the sides of the head; the
                    muzzle is furnished with vermiform cirrhi. There is no vestige of an external
                    ear, but the labyrinth is perfect within the bones of the head. The dorsal fin
                    is behind the ventrals, and the anal immediately below the dorsal. The caudal
                    fin surrounds the extremity of the spine, and its upper lobe is longer than the
                    lower. Internally there exists the spiral intestinal valve, and the pancreas
                    forming a single mass; but we also find a very large and strong swimming
                    bladder, communicating by a wide aperture with the gullet. They prey on the
                    smaller fishes, in pursuing which they can exert much speed; but in the rivers
                    they frequent they are said to search for Vermes in the oozy bottom, which they
                    explore with their snout, like swine.</p>
                <p>Sturgeons are marine fishes, but at certain seasons they ascend in vast numbers
                    particular rivers, where they are the subject of extensive fisheries,
                    particularly in the large rivers that disembogue themselves into the Black Sea
                    and Caspian, and the rivers of France and Prussia; they abound also in the large
                    rivers of North America, where the species appear to be peculiar to that
                    continent.</p>

                    skin is much less tuberculated than the common sturgeon, and is covered with a
                    viscid mucus; the snout and cirrhi are shorter. This species is chiefly found in
                    the Caspian and Euxine, or the rivers that flow into those seas; but the large
                    sturgeons sometimes caught in the northern seas appear also to belong to the

                    ria,</hi> Shaw. This genus, which consists but of a single species, is at once
                    recognised by the enormous prolongation of its snout, which has a dilated
                    middle, something resembling the leaf of a tree when viewed from above. The
                    habit of the body resembles the sturgeon; but the spinal column is formed of one
                    piece, as in the lamprey. The upper jaw is formed of the maxillary and palate
                    bones united together, and the pedicle of the mouth has two articulations; the
                    mouth is small, and furnished with numerous minute teeth. The spiracle is wide,
                    and covered by a very large, soft operculum, extending to the middle of the
                    body. The intestine is provided with the spiral valve, so frequent among the
                    Chondropterygii; but the pancreas exhibits the commencement of a subdivision
                    into lobules. The existence of an air-bladder sufficiently distinguishes it from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Squati.</hi> It has only been found in the Mississippi,
                    and does not exceed a foot in length.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Chimaera,</hi> Linn. This genus has a strong affinity
                    to the Squali in general shape, and in the position of the fins, but the gills
                    have only one aperture on each side; yet, on inspecting more accurately, we see
                    that the rays are attached by most of the edges, and that there are really five
                    holes opening into the bottom of a general cavity. A rudiment of an operculum is
                    found in the skin; the jaws are still less complex than in the Squali, for the
                    upper jaw is represented only by the vomer, and the palate bones and tympana are
                    merely rudimentary, attached to the sides of the muzzle. Instead of teeth, the
                    mouth is furnished with undivided hard plates, of which four are above and two
                    below. The snout resembles that of the shark, and also has regular ranges of
                    pores. The first dorsal fin is armed with a strong spine, and is placed over the
                    pectorals. The males, as in the Squali, are distinguished by the cartilaginous
                    appendages of the ventral fins, divided into three branches, and have two spiny
                    plates before the base of the ventrals. These fish have also on their front a
                    fleshy caruncle, garnished with a group of small prickles. The intestine of this
                    genus is short, and has a spiral valve. The female lays eggs of a large size and
                    coriaceous consistence, flattened, and hairy. The only species is <hi
                    rend="italic">Chimaera borealis,</hi> or northern chimera. It is found in the
                    Northern Ocean, where it is believed to feed on the numerous Mollusea and
                    Crustacea of that sea. It is rarely taken, because it keeps much in deep water;
                    but it has been occasionally caught among our northern islands, and is sometimes
                    seen of the length of three or four feet. Its head is the thickest part of the
                    body, whence it tapers uniformly to the tail. It is most çommon on the coasts of
                    Norway, where its eggs are eaten, and the oil of its liver is used as a
                    stimulant embrocation. It also occurs in the Mediterranean.</p>

                    The mouth is small, and below the snout. The second dorsal fin commences over
                    the ventrals, and terminates opposite to the commencement of the lower part of
                    the tail. The only known species inhabits the Southern Ocean. See Plate CCCVII.

                <p>ORDER II.—CHONDROPTERYGΠ WITH FIXED BRANCHIAE.</p>
                <p>Instead of having the gills free at their external edge, in this order we find
                    them fixed all round; and in respiration water is emitted through as many
                    apertures as there are intervals between the rays. Another peculiarity of this
                    order consists in the small cartilaginous arches suspended from the soft parts
                    at the outer edge of the branchiae.</p>
                <p>The Linnaean genera <hi rend="italic">Squalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raia</hi> are the principal members of this order; but Cuvier and the later
                    Ichthyologists have subdivided these into several genera, according to marked
                    peculiarities in their anatomical structure.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I SELACHΠ, OR PLAGIOSTOMI.</p>
                <p>The palatal and post-mandibular bones support the teeth, while the bones
                    corresponding to the jaws in other fishes are merely rudimentary. A single bone
                    connects these jaws with the cranium, and represents at the same time tympana,
                    jugal, and temporal bones. The os hyoides is attached to a single pedicle, and,
                    as in ordinary fishes, supports the rays of the gills. The labyrinth is
                    membranous, and included in the cartilaginous substance of the cranium; the sac
                    attached to it does not contain, as in fishes, the porcelanous concretions, but
                    masses that are easily pulverized. The pancreas has the form of a conglomerate
                    gland. The intestinal canal is short; but one part of the tube is furnished
                    internally with a spiral lamina, that seems intended to prevent the too rapid
                    passage of the food.</p>
                <p>The Selachii have pectoral and ventral fins; the latter placed behind the
                    abdomen, and on the sides of the anus.</p>
                <p>In some respects their sexual intercourse resembles that of Mammifera. The
                    females have well-developed oviducts, which serve the purpose of a matrix in the
                    species whose young are perfected within the body; while in others the ova are
                    covered by a tough and horny envelope, to the formation of which a large gland
                    surrounding each oviduct is subservient. These eggs, especially in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Squali,</hi> have the form of a parallelogram with long
                    filamentous tendrils at each corner, intended for attaching the egg to Fuci or
                    sub-marine rocks during the maturation of the young included animals. Many of
                    these eggs are found in a female, but only two appear to be perfected at once.
                    In these the foetus is coiled up, and to its umbilical region is attached a
                    large pyriform bag, of a white colour, by a slender tube. On opening this bag it
                    is found filled with a yellowish, thin liquid, like the yolk of a hen’s egg,
                    intended for the nourishment of the foetus. When the young animal becomes able
                    to collect its own food, the coriaceous egg opens at one end, the creature
                    escapes, and soon the bag, now empty and useless, drops off. The males are
                    provided with two peculiar organs, placed at the inner edge of the ventral fins.
                    Some have supposed that these are <hi rend="italic">intimately</hi> connected
                    with the generative process; others regard them as mere <hi rend="italic"
                    >holders,</hi> by means of which the female is more closely embraced by the
                    male.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Squalus,</hi> Linn.; Shark.
                    This forms the first great genus of our present order. The general form is
                    elongated; the tail is thick, with the spinal column continued into the upper
                    lobe; the pectoral fins are of considerable size; the spiracles are on the sides
                    of the neck; and the eyes on each side of the head. The muzzle is&lt; supported
                    by three cartilaginous projections, proceeding from the anterior part of the
                    cranium; and we can easily observe in the skeleton the rudimentary jaws. The
                    scapula is suspended in the flesh behind the gills. Some of the sharks are
                    oviparous, while others are viviparous. Distinct but small branchial rays; there
                    are rudiments of ribs along the spine; and that column is divided into regular
                    vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The original genus is numerous, and may be divided as follows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Scyllium, Cuv.</hi> This division is characterised by
                    a short, obtuse muzzle, by nostrils near the mouth, continued in grooves which
                    reach to the edge of the lip, and more or less closed by one or two cuticular
                    lobules. Their teeth have a central point and two lateral prongs. They have
                    spiracles, partly over the pectoral fins. Their dorsal fins are placed far back,
                    the anterior not being before the ventrals. All have an anal fin; and, in some
                    species, its position corresponds to the interval between the two dorsals; the
                    tail is elongated, truncated, not forked.</p>
                <p>The most common on our coasts are the following species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sq.</hi><hi rend="italic">canicula,</hi> L.; greater spotted
                    dog-fish, P. This common and prolific species is very numerous on the northern
                    and western coasts of Britain. The colour of the male is dusky, with numerous
                    distinct small, blackish, spots: the female, of which some naturalists have made
                    another species, is larger than the male, of a more red hue, variegated with
                    deep-brown spots disposed in an ocellated pattern on the sides. The ventral fins
                    of this species have the edge cut obliquely.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sq. catulus,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sq.</hi><hi rend="italic">stellaris,</hi> are also the male and female of
                    another species not uncommon on our coasts. This species differs from the last
                    in size. The spots on its surface are fuller and broader; the ventral fins are
                    more square at the edge.</p>
                <p>To this sub-genus belong several other <hi rend="italic">Squali,</hi> natives of
                    foreign seas. They are distinguished by the position of the anal fin, which is
                    placed behind the second dorsal; the spiracles are remarkably small; the fifth
                    branchial aperture is often concealed in the fourth, and the lobes of the
                    nostrils are usually prolonged into cirrhi.</p>

                <p>This last is one of the most beautiful of the order, and has been observed of the
                    length of fourteen or fifteen feet, with a large and blunt head, and tapering
                    body. (See Plate CCCVII. fig. 4.) A few years ago one of them was observed for
                    several hours to follow a Liverpool East Indiaman off Madagascar. It was
                    elegantly transversely banded with alternate whitish and dark brown or blackish
                    fasciae; and was further variegated by ocellated spots or rings on various parts
                    of its body, which seemed to be about fourteen feet long. Its head appeared to
                    be four and a half feet across; but the thickest part of its body did not seem
                    more than two feet in diameter. It was accompanied by several <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilot-fish,</hi> which often swam before, and returned towards it. Several
                    attempts were made to catch it with large baits of fresh meat, but it never
                    ventured to seize one of them. The lower jaw was distinctly visible whenever it

                    under which the nostrils are placed; but the latter parts are not terminated by
                    a groove, nor are they furnished with lobules. The tail has more or less of a

                    >Carcharias, Cuv.</hi> This well-known and numerous group have extremely
                    sharp-pointed teeth, often serrated on their edges. Of these, their jaws are
                    armed with several rows, which they have the power of elevating or depressing,
                    and can use with remarkable effect, from the strength of the muscles moving the
                    lower jaw. The first dorsal fin is considerably before the ventrals, and the
                    second is almost opposite to the anal. The posterior branchial apertures are
                    over the pectoral fins.</p>
                <p>The best-known species is <hi rend="italic">Sq. carcharias,</hi> orwhite shark,
                    the dread of seamen in hot climates, and not unfrequently seen on our own
                    coasts. It is a very large fish, growing, it is said, to more than thirty feet,
                    and often observed to measure from fifteen to twenty-five feet. The teeth are,
                    in full-grown animals, in six rows; those in the upper jaw are nearly isosceles
                    triangles, with sharp, dentated edges; those in the lower jaw have a narrow
                    lancet-shaped point on a broader basis, with smooth-cutting edges. From the
                    position of the mouth in this species, the animal turns on its side on seizing
                    its prey. Its voracity is well known, and it has been seen to leap out of the
                    water in its eagerness to snatch a suspended morsel. The jaws are so powerful as
                    to bite at once through the body of a man. The gullet is very large, and the
                    intestine short. One killed near Marseilles is alleged to have had the entire
                    body of a man, and several fish, in its stomach; and one captured off the island
                    of St Margaretta is even said to have contained the whole body of a horse. This
                    one had the enormous weight of 1500 pounds.</p>
                <p>The sailors believe that the pilot-fish, which is so constant an attendant on
                    this species, directs him to his prey; and, by touching his head, warns him
                    against a baited hook. Certain it is, that the pilot-fish have been repeatedly
                    seen clinging to a shark while he was hoisting on deck, and appeared as if
                    distressed on separation from their formidable comrade, who has never been
                    known, in his utmost voracity, to attack his friendly guides. What the instinct
                    is that produces this attachment is unknown; but probably it depends on the
                    pilot <hi rend="italic">(Naucrates</hi><hi rend="italic">ductor)</hi> obtaining
                    its subsistence from the remains of the shark’s prey, as the jackal does from
                    that of the lion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We

                <p>Little of the age or development of this species is ascertained. The female has
                    been known to contain many ova; but only three or four are perfected at a time,
                    and impregnation may take place long before the full growth of the animal. A
                    shark ten feet long has been found to contain forty ova, three or four of which
                    were near maturity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sq.</hi><hi rend="italic">vulpes,</hi> the thrasher, so called
                    from the inordinate length of his tail, which is almost half the length of the
                    animal. It is the upper lobe which is thus elongated;! and as it has the fin
                    along its under side, it gives the organ some resemblance to a fox’s tail. It
                    grows, even in our own seas, to a large size. Pennant measured one thirteen
                    feet, of which the tai] was more than six feet. The body is round, the nose
                    short but pointed; the teeth are small, but sharp.</p>
                <p>It is this species which is said to attack various Cetacea, which it harasses by
                    dealing them violent strokes with its tail, when they rise to the surface for
                    the purpose of breathing.</p>

                    above, and smoother than the rest of the genus. Head large, muzzle very pointed;

                    and to the air-holes of Galeus, large branchial apertures almost surrounding the
                    neck. It is the gills of this species that have been erroneously described as a
                    sort of whalebone. The mouth is provided with small teeth; the muzzle projects
                    far beyond it. Nothing has ever been found in its stomach except the remains of
                    Fuci or Algae, in the numerous instances in which it has been captured in
                    various parts of Scotland. They grow to thirty or thirty-six feet or more, and
                    are fishes of great strength, but are harmless, indolent, and not very sensible
                    to slight wounds. They often lie on the surface of the water, with their large
                    dorsal fin exposed, and permit the approach of boats until the harpoon can be
                    securely fixed in their bodies. They sometimes appear in shoals, but more
                    commonly in pairs; and enter the bays on the western and northern shores of
                    Britain in the months of June and July, but retire from the land on the approach
                    of cold weather. The liver of a full-grown fish has been known to afford eight
                    barrels of fine oil; and on this account the basking shark is considered as a
                    profitable capture.</p>

                    preserved in the Museum of the University of Edinburgh, prove that idea to be
                    inconsistent with the fact, and show that singular animal to have been some
                    great species of cartilaginous fish as yet unknown to naturalists,—a species in
                    which we are to look for the prototype of the famous sea-serpent of the Northern

                <p>The formidable animal described by 0. Fabricius, in his <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                    Groenlandica,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Sq. carch,arias,</hi> is now. from the
                    descriptions of Scoresby and others, to be referred to this sub-genus. It is
                    Scoresby’s <hi rend="italic">Sq. borealis.</hi> It wants the anal fin, but has
                    the temporal orifices. It grows to the length of twelve or fourteen feet, and is
                    six or eight in circumference. Scoresby mentions the singular appendages which
                    he invariably found attached to the cornea of this animal. Some have supposed
                    them to be parasitic animals. If so, it is singular that they should be so
                    uniformly in the same position, and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the same size,
                    about one or two inches long, and cleft at their fore extremity into two parts.
                    This shark is peculiarly attracted by a dead whale, out of which it scoops at
                    once masses of blubber as large as a man’s head. The sailors believe this
                    species to be blind, from its returning to feed on its favourite morsel, even
                    after having a flensing knife run through its body; but this only shows its
                    fondness for whale blubber,—to which circumstance we may also attribute the
                    comparative safety of Greenland sailors who have fallen into the water when
                    flensing the whale. But, if we may credit Fabricius, when this delectable food
                    is not present, he will attack the slender bark of the Greenlanders.</p>

                    Zygaena, Cuv.</hi> This genus, which has the general form of body and fins of
                    <hi rend="italic">Carcliarias,</hi> is distinguished by the extraordinary form
                    of its head, that has no analogy in nature, except in some of the insect tribe.
                    It is flattened horizontally, truncated in front, and extended laterally into
                    two arms, at the extremity of which are the eyes, giving to the animal the form
                    of a hammer. The mouth is below' the centre of this singular head, and the
                    nostrils at its anterior edges on each side. The most common in Europe is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sq. zygaena,</hi> or hammer-headed shark, which often attains
                    the length of sixteen or seventeen feet, and is formidable on account of its
                    voracity and strength. It is found also around the West Indies, and in the
                    Indian Ocean, especially at Taheite, where the natives are said, from their
                    dexterity in swimming, to hold it in little dread. It is a very prolific animal.
                    Two kindred species are known: the <hi rend="italic">Sq. Blocliii,</hi> Cuv.,
                    which differs in having the nostrils nearer the middle of the head, and its two

                    differs from all the sharks. The head and body are flattened; the pectoral fins
                    are extremely broad, and project forward to the sides of the head, but are
                    separated from it and the neck by a fissure, in which the branchial apertures
                    are placed; the two dorsals are behind the ventrals, and the tail is equally
                    finned above and below the spinal column.</p>
                <p>The best-known species is the <hi rend="italic">Sq.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >squatina,</hi> Linn., or angel-shark, which grows to eight or ten feet. It is a
                    bold and voracious fish; when captured, it bites with great fury; it preys much
                    on flat fish; it has tentacula on its upper lip; its eyes, placed obliquely,
                    give it a sinister look· The English name has been given ironically to this
                    hideous creature, which is by seamen generally termed <hi rend="italic">devil,
                    fish.</hi></p>
                <p>The teeth are slender, sharp, and dilated at their base; the dorsal fins very
                    small, the pectorals very broad, the ventral large, and enclosing the male
                    organs. The upper lobe of the tail longer than the lower. It is very prolific,
                    fourteen young being sometimes found in its belly; twelve frequently.</p>

                    >Squali,</hi> but is more flattened in front, and has the branchial apertures
                    beneath, like the <hi rend="italic">Bays.</hi> The most peculiar character,
                    however, consists in the great depression and extension of the snout, which has
                    on each side a row of strong teeth or spines, which are trenchant on the
                    fore-side, and mucronated. These spines are not, however, their true teeth.
                    These are lodged in the mouth, and are very small and rounded. But, with their
                    formidable beak, they are said successfully to attack the larger Cetacea. In the
                    foetal Pristis the rudiments <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these osseous spines are
                    mere tubercles, and the snout is folded up over the head of the embryon. These
                    spines are not, like the teeth of cartilaginous fishes, attached by ligaments to
                    the bones, but are firmly implanted in the bone of the snout.</p>
                <p>The best-known species is the <hi rend="italic">Sq.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    orifices, and the eyes, are on the dorsal surface. The dorsal fins are usually
                    placed on the tail. These animals are oviparous. Their eggs are coriaceous,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Torpedo,</hi> Dum. This subdivision is short, and
                    rather fleshy. The body appears a nearly circular disk, the anterior edge being
                    composed of two projections of the muzzle, which stretch sidewise, and unite
                    with the pectorals. The space between these last and the head is entirely filled
                    with the very extraordinary electric apparatus first accurately described by
                    John Hunter. It consists of irregular columns, varying from one and a half inch
                    to one fourth of an inch in length by 0∙2 broad. They are irregular hexagons or
                    pentagons, reaching from surface to surface of the fish, and forming (in that
                    dissected by Hunter) an electric organ five inches long, varying in breadth from
                    three to about one and a half inches. Their number on both sides is about 940 in
                    a small fish; but in a large one there were 2364. Their coats are thin and
                    transparent; they are horizontally divided by thin partitions, so numerous that
                    one inch of these columns contained 150 dissepiments filled with fluid. This
                    curious apparatus is supplied with numerous nerves from the eighth pair. The
                    columns are firmly united by cellular substance. When the skin covering this
                    apparatus is touched, the person receives a violent shock at each contact; and
                    it is probable that in this way the species stuns its prey. The animal can give
                    the shock at pleasure; but if often reiterated, the shocks are weakened, until
                    the nervous energy of the fish is recruited by rest. This animal electricity is
                    conducted and intercepted by the same substances that conduct and intercept
                    ordinary artificial electricity. Wehere figure <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">P. batis,</hi> the skate. One of the thinnest and broadest of
                    the tribe; but sometimes growing to an immense size, and weighing 200 pounds.
                    The nose, though not very long, is pointed. Sometimes the surface of the back is
                    marbled with dusky and white. Along the tail is one row of spines; a few are
                    irregularly dispersed on the sides of the tail, and the fins of the males have
                    many small spines.</p>
                <p>The spring is their season of love; and when coupling, both may be drawn into the

                    by fishermen. The eggs have the form of coriaceous parallelograms, and are ,
                    vulgarly with us termed <hi rend="italic">purses,</hi> which the females begin
                    to cast in May, and continue to perfect and cast till September. This species is
                    often eaten, as well as the thornback, both in the greatest perfection in
                    spring.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">P. oxyrinchus,</hi> the sharp-nosed ray. We do not agree with
                    Cuvier in confounding this with <hi rend="italic">P. batis.</hi> The form of the
                    nose is much longer and narrower; the body much smoother than any species we
                    have mentioned, though there are triple rows of small spines along the tail. A
                    single row of small spines runs down its back, and a few are scattered about the
                    eyes. The teeth too, in this species, differ from those of the skate, being bent
                    inward, and less granular. It is not inferior in size to the skate. Indeed
                    specimens are said to have been seen of the weight of 500 pounds.</p>
                <p>Some species of this division have a sort of membranous expansion, like a fin

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Cephaloptera,</hi> Dum. The last division of the rays
                    is distinguished by the bifurcation of the appendages to the head, derived from
                    the pectorals, which give the species the appearance of being horned. The head

                    refer what Barrère and other travellers have said of the enormous rays of the
                    American and equinoctial seas, which spring above the surface of the water, and
                    splash it to an immense distance on falling into it. Levaillant, in his second
                    voyage to Africa, speaks of having seen one, the smallest of three, which swam
                    round about the vessel, about twenty-five feet long and more than thirty wide;
                    and Sonnini speaks of one which appeared to him larger and wider than the ship
                    in which he was sailing.” “Colonel Hamilton Smith once witnessed the destruction
                    of a soldier by one of these Cephalopteri, off Trinidad. It was supposed that
                    the soldier, being a good swimmer, was attempting to desert from the ship, which
                    lay at anchor in the entrance of the Bocca del Toro. The circumstance occurred
                    soon after daylight; and the man, being alarmed by the call of a sailor in the
                    main cross-trees, endeavoured to return to the vessel; but the monster threw one
                    of his fins over him, and carried him down. The colonel is positive as to this

                    constantly about the boat for three days, as if bewailing the fate of his

                <p>FAMILY II—CYCLOSTOMI, OR SUCKERS.</p>
                <p>The suckers, as far as their skeleton is concerned, are the most imperfect of all
                    vertebrate animals. The bodies of all their vertebrae are traversed by a single
                    tendinous cord, uniformly tapering from head to tail, which almost reduces the
                    vertebrae to cartilaginous rings, scarcely distinct from one another, and not
                    even cartilaginous through tHeir whole circumference. The body is terminated
                    abruptly in front by a fleshy circular or semicircular mouth, supported on a
                    cartilaginous ring formed by the union of the palatal and maxillary bones. No
                    ribs are distinguishable: there are no solid branchial arches; but the small
                    branchial rays, scarcely recognisable in <hi rend="italic">Squalus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Paia,</hi> are in them fully developed, and united together into a
                    sort of lattice. The gills, instead of the pectinated form they have in almost
                    all other fishes, exhibit the appearance of little sacs, from the union of each
                    gill with that adjacent. The labyrinth is enclosed in the cranium, the nostrils
                    have only a single aperture, in front of which is a cul-de-sac, mistaken by some
                    authors for a temporal orifice. The intestine is straight and narrow, with a
                    spiral valve.</p>

                    seven branchial apertures on each side; the skin above and below the tail is
                    elevated in a' rayless fin. The sub-genera are the following:</p>

                    with strong teeth, within which are tubercles, with a hard enamel lining the
                    lips. This ring is suspended by a piece answering to an inter-maxillary bone.
                    The tongue is furnished with two longitudinal ranges of small teeth, and is
                    capable of vigorous motion. The tongue acting like a piston in the circular
                    mouth, is an essential part of the mechanism by which the fish is enabled to
                    attach itself firmly to stones, or to fasten itself to the larger fishes, which
                    it is thus enabled to suck and devour at its leisure. In respiration, the water
                    is carried from the mouth to the gills by a canal under the gullet, and pierced
                    with lateral apertures. The dorsal fin is farther forward than the anus, and a
                    second unites with the tail. The European species are, <hi rend="italic"

                    single tooth on its superior part; while the strong dentations of the tongue are
                    arranged in two rows on each side, so as to give to these animals the appearance
                    of having lateral jaws, like insects or nereides; but the rest of their
                    structure corresponds with <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon,</hi> and their tongue
                    in particular performs the office of a piston in exhausting the mouth, so as to
                    enable them to adhere to other bodies, like the lamprey. The lips arc furnished
                    with eight cirrhi, and above is an aperture communicating with the mouth; the
                    body is nearly cylindrical, and terminates in a fin which surrounds the tail.

                    plaited within: the liver has two lobes: the eggs grow to a considerable size.
                    When taken and confined in a large glass jar, a single fish will pour so much
                    mucus from its lateral pores as to give the water the appearance of jelly.</p>
                <p>Three species are known, which Cuvier makes the types of a corresponding number
                    of sub-genera, as follows:</p>
                <p>Isí, <hi rend="smallcaps">Heptatremus,</hi> Dumer. With seven branchial
                    apertures, as in the lamprey. This animal is the <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    Dom-beyi,</hi> found on the coast of South America by Dombey. It has a rounded
                    head; the teeth are sharp, and arranged in two rows, respectively of fourteen
                    and twenty-two, and with one longer than the rest in the upper part of the
                    mouth; tail rounded at the extremity, and terminated by a very shallow fin.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gastrobranchus,</hi> Bloch. The
                    intervals of the branchial rays open into a common canal for each side, and
                    these two canals terminate in two apertures under the heart of the animal, about
                    one third of its length from the head.</p>
                <p>The only known species is the European <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">glutinosa,</hi> Linn. On the Yorkshire coast the fishermen
                    occasionally find that it has entered the mouths of fish on the hooks of the
                    long lines, and devoured the flesh, leaving only the skin and bones. They often
                    catch it in the fish thus emptied, and term it the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sea-hag.</hi> It grows ,to the length of six or eight inches.</p>
                <p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammocaetes,</hi> Dumer. Is
                    destitute of a real skeleton; body cylindrical, with numerous annular lines
                    around it, that give it much the appearance of a worm. It lives in the mud of
                    rivers. Mouth cirrhated, toothless, lobated below, and incapable of adhering <hi
                    rend="italic">by suction</hi> to other bodies; fins very shallow; tail sharp at
                    the tip; no tracheal tube, as in the rest, but the gills receive water from the
                    oesophagus. The only species is <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >branchialis,</hi> Shaw, the <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi> of Pennant, which
                    grows to six or eight inches long, and is as thick as a'goose-quill. It inhabits
                    the rivers of Oxfordshire, and occurs in various parts of the European
                    continent.</p>
                <p>We have now brought our exposition er the modern system of Ichthyology to a
                    close. The subjects of which it treats are of deep and sustaining interest, in a
                    philosophical point of view, and of the highest and most immediate importance
                    when considered in relation to the economical advantages derivable by the human
                    race. We have endeavoured to combine with the precise and technical expression
                    of the generic and other characters such miscellaneous information as could be
                    collected from authentic sources, with a view to render the subject more
                    palatable to the general reader ;—and if any great deficiency in that department
                    is observable, we hope it may in some measure be attributed to the nature of
                    this branch of natural history, the objects of which inhabiting another element
                    from ourselves, have thus their on-goings too often veiled from mortal sight by
                    a “world of waters,” —which no eye can pierce but the eye of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Him</hi> who called the light out of darkness, and who created
                    the “heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is.”</p>
                <p>We shall conclude with a brief allusion to a subject of the highest interest to
                    the naturalist,—one to which we believe no reference has been made in the
                    introductory portion of the present treatise, and which, we regret, our now
                    exhausted space must prevent us from exhibiting at greater length,—we mean the
                    <hi rend="italic">geographical distribution</hi> of fishes. Our knowledge of the
                    laws which regulate that distribution is meagre in the extreme; in other words,
                    the facts concerning their true localities are few, and have never been properly
                    generalised. From the immeasurable extent and continuous nature of the fluid
                    which they inhabit, they are supplied by nature with greater facilities of
                    dispersion than most other animals; and the greater equality of the temperature
                    of water, compared with that of earth or air, admits in several instances of the
                    same species inhabiting almost every latitude from pole to pole. Those races
                    especially, which, travelling together in vast shoals, speedily consume the
                    natural food which each particular spot affords, are obliged, like the pastoral
                    tribes of old, or the woodland hunters of America, to remove from place to place
                    in search of additional supplies; and thus the species acquires a more widely
                    extended distribution. It is thus that the cod and herring are spread over the
                    whole extent of the Northern Ocean, and in undiminished numbers, notwithstanding
                    the war of extermination which man and other voracious animals appear to wage
                    against them. Those species which lead a solitary, and, as it may be called, a
                    stationary life, are frequently confined within very narrow limits. The
                    Chaetodons, for example, which delight in rocky coasts covered with madrepores,
                    attach themselves to the torrid zone, which produces so abundantly those
                    magnificent ornaments of the sea. But though thus confined to particular spots,
                    from which the individuals of the species seldom wander, the species itself may
                    be said to be repeated again in different regions, separated from each other by
                    almost insurmountable obstacles. Thus many of what may be termed stationary
                    species are found identically the same along the coasts of Brazil, in the
                    Arabian Gulf, and over the multiplied shores of Polynesia. It has hence been
                    concluded, that such species, incapable of colonizing themselves by leaving
                    their accustomed shores, and hazarding a journey across unknown oceans, have
                    either been created in more places than one, or have been enabled to transport
                    themselves by means different from any of those that are now available in the
                    ordinary course of nature.</p>
                <p>If the natural means by which the more powerful species inhabiting the saline
                    waters of the ocean have spread themselves from clime to dime, be to a certain
                    extent within the reach of our comprehension, it is otherwise with those
                    peculiar to rivers, and the waters of inland lakes. How these have contrived to
                    migrate from one region to another, and to people with identical species the
                    depth of far-removed and solitary waters, separated from each other by chains of
                    lofty mountains, or wide extended wastes of desert sand, is a problem which, in
                    the present state of our knowledge, we seek in vain to solve. It may indeed at
                    times happen that spawn or ova are carried by water-fowl <pb break="no"

                    reservoir to another, and thus the rivers of half a continent may be put in
                    possession of species unknown before ;—but this supposition scarcely suffices to
                    account for the general diffusion of certain species, and still less for the
                    narrow restriction of others equally exposed to the chances of that aerial
                    flight.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Consult Μ.
