                    properties which this liquor ought to have, are, 1. To flow freely from the pen,
                    and sink a little into the paper, that the writing may not be easily discharged;
                    2. a very deep black colour, which should be as deep at first as at any time
                    afterwards; 3. durability, so that the writing may not be subject to decay by
                    age; and 4. ink should be destitute of any corrosive quality, that it may not
                    destroy the paper, or go through it in such a manner as to render the writing
                    illegible.</p>
                <p>In Mr Delaval’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Colours,</hi> (p. 37), he acquaints
                    us, that with an infusion of galls and iron filings, he had not only made an
                    exceedingly black and durable ink, but by its means, without addition of any
                    acid, dyed silk and woollen cloth of a good and lasting black. This kind of ink,
                    however, though the colour is far superior to that of any other, has the
                    inconvenience of being very easily discharged, either by the smallest quantity
                    of any acid, or even by simple water; because it does not penetrate the paper in
                    such a manner as is necessary to preserve it from the instantaneous action of
                    the acid or of the water. During the action of the infusion of galls upon the
                    iron in making this kind of ink, a very considerable effervescence takes place,
                    and a quantity of air is discharged, the nature of which has not yet been
                    examined.</p>
                <p>The materials usually employed for the making of ink are, common green vitriol,
                    or copperas, and galls; but almost all of them are deficient in durability,
                    which is a property of such importance, that Dr Lewis thought the subject of
                    ink-making not unworthy of his attention. From experiments made by that author,
                    he infers, that the decay of inks is chiefly owing to a deficiency of galls;
                    that the galls are the most perishable ingredient, the quantity of these, which
                    gives the greatest blackness at first (that is, about equal parts with the
                    vitrioD, being insufficient to maintain the colour; that, for a durable ink, the
                    quantity of galls cannot be much less than three times that of the vitriol; that
                    it cannot be much greater without lessening the blackness of the ink; that by
                    diminishing the quantity of water, the ink is rendered blacker and more durable;
                    that distilled water, rain-water, and hard spring-water, have the same effects;
                    that white wine produces a deeper black colour than water; that the colour
                    produced by vinegar is deeper than that by wine; that proof-spirit extracts only
                    a reddish brown tinge; that the last-mentioned tincture sinks into, and spreads
                    upon, the paper; and hence the impropriety of adding spirit of wine to ink, as
                    is frequently directed, to prevent mouldiness or freezing; that other
                    astringents, as oak-bark, bistort, sloe-bark, &amp;c. are not so effectual as
                    galls, nor give so good a black, the colour produced by most of these, excepting
                    oak-bark, being greenish; that the juice of sloes does not produce a black
                    colour with martial vitriol; but that, nevertheless, the writing made with it
                    becomes black, and is found to be more durable than common ink: that inks made
                    with saturated solutions of iron, in nitrous, marine, or acetous acids, in
                    tartar, or in lemon juice, were much inferior to the ink made with martial
                    vitriol; that the colour of ink is depraved by adding quicklime, which is done
                    with an intention of destroying any superabundant acid which may be supposed to
                    be the cause of the loss of the colour of ink; that the best method of
                    preventing the effects of this superabundant acid is probably by adding pieces
                    of iron to engage it; that this conjecture is confirmed by an instance the
                    author had heard, of the great durability of the colour of an ink in which
                    pieces of iron had been long immersed; and lastly, that a decoction of logwood
                    used instead of water, sensibly improves both the beauty and deepness of the
                    black, without disposing it to fade. The same author observes, that the addition
                    of gum-arabic is not only useful, by keeping the colouring matter suspended in
                    the fluid, but also by preventing the ink from spreading, by which means a
                    greater quantity of it is collected on each stroke of the pen. Sugar, which is
                    sometimes added to ink, is found to be much less effectual than gums, and to
                    have the inconvenience of preventing the drying of the ink. The colour of ink is
                    found to be greatly injured by keeping the ink in vessels made of copper or of
                    lead, and probably of any other metal, which the vitriolic acid can
                    dissolve.</p>
                <p>The foregoing experiments point out the best proportions of the ingredients for
                    ink, one part of green vitriol, one part of powdered logwood, and three parts of
                    powdered galls. The best menstruum appears to be vinegar or white wine, though
                    for common use water is sufficient. If the ink be required to be of a full
                    colour, a quart, or at most three pints, of liquor, may be allowed to three
                    ounces of galls, and to one ounce of each of the other two ingredients. Half an
                    ounce of gum may be added to each pint of the liquor. The ingredients may be all
                    put together at once in a convenient vessel, and well shaken four or five times
                    each day. In ten or twelve days the ink will be fit for use, though it will
                    improve by remaining longer on the in-gredients<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941416" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1416-0278"/>. Or it may be made more
                    expeditiously, by adding the gum and vitriol to a decoction of galls and logwood
                    in the menstruum. To the ink, after it has been separated from the feculencies,
                    some coarse powder of galls, from which the fine dust has been sifted, together
                    with one or two pieces of iron, may be added, by which its durability will be
                    secured.</p>
                <p>Such is the substance of the discoveries and inquiries made by Dr Lewis and other
                    chemists, relative to the composition of black writing ink, and upon
                    modifications of them, most of the methods hitherto followed in making it have
                    been founded. It might be supposed that after the determination, by such
                    authority, of the relative proportions of the usual ingredients, it would only
                    have been necessary to attend to that proportion, and that the result would be
                    uniformly satisfactory. Experience, however, has shewn the reverse of this; and
                    it is often found that the same ingredients, and the same proportions of them,
                    produce inks of very different qualities. This arises from two causes, which
                    were not apparent to the expèrimenting chemist. His attention was chiefly
                    directed to the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> effect produced by the mixture
                    he prepared, or the additions made to it. Hence his experiments generally led
                    him to the formation of a good black <hi rend="italic">dye,</hi> if applied to
                    immediate use; whilst the <hi rend="italic">ultimate</hi> effect of the action
                    of the atmosphere on the liquid itself, and the decomposition which frequently
                    resulted, from the quantity of vegetable matter contained in it, were seldom
                    brought under his notice. To these two causes, as well as the various modes of
                    extract and of mixture, are to be attributed the very different results which
                    have arisen from the use of the same ingredients and the same proportions of
                    them; and on the connexion and regulation of these two agents, we believe the
                    quality of the ink to depend, as much as upon the nature and proportion of the
                    materials employed. This opinion is strengthened by the information we have
                    received from Mr Morison (the extent of whose ink manufactories is a remarkable
                    instance of the importance of the most minute branch of the arts, at the present
                    day, in Great Britain), who has assured us, that he never could depend on the
                    quality of the ink which was to be produced from any mixture of ingredients,
                    however well manipulated, or however’strong, until he adopted a method of
                    abstracting that part of the vegetable ingredients which induced decomposition;
                    a process which required much time and attention, but in the accomplishment of
                    which so full opportunity was given for the action of the atmosphere that the
                    liquid was not liable to be afterwards affected by either cause.</p>
                <p>In some attempts made by Dr Lewis to endow writing ink with the great durability
                    of that of the ancients, as well as the properties which it has at present, he
                    first thought of using animal glues, and then of oily matters. “I mixed both
                    lamp-black,” says he, “and ivory-black with solutions of gum-arabic, made of
                    such consistence as just to flow sufficiently from the pen. The liquors wrote of
                    a fine black colour; but when dry, part of the colour could be rubbed off,
                    especially in moist weather, and a pencil dipped in water washed it away
                    entirely.</p>
                <p>“I tried solutions of the animal-glues with the same event. Isinglass or
                    fish-glue being the most difficultly dissoluble of these kinds of bodies, I made
                    a decoction of it in water, of such strength that the liquor concreted into a
                    jelly before it was quite cold. With this jelly, kept fluid by sufficient heat,
                    I mixed some ivory-black. Characters drawn with this mixture on paper bore
                    rubbing much better than the others, but were discharged without much difficulty
                    by a wet pencil.</p>
                <p>“It was now suspected, that the colour could not be sufficiently fixed on paper
                    without an oily cement. As oils themselves are made miscible with watery fluids
                    by the intervention of gum, I fixed some of the softer painters’ varnish, after
                    mentioned, with about half its weight of a thick mucilage of gum arabic, working
                    them well together in a mortar till they united into a smooth uniform mass. This
                    was beaten with lamp-black, and some water added by little and little, the
                    rubbing being continued till the mixture was diluted to a due consistence for
                    writing. It wrote freely, and of a full brownish black colour; the characters
                    could not be discharged by rubbing, but water washed them out, though not near
                    so readily as any of the foregoing. Instead of the painters’ varnish or boiled
                    oil, I mixed raw linseed oil in the same manner with mucilage and lamp-black;
                    and on diluting the mixture with water, obtained an ink not greatly different
                    from the other.</p>
                <p>“Though these oily mixtures answered better than those with simple gums or glues,
                    it was apprehended that their being dischargeable by water would render them
                    unfit for the purposes intended. The only way of obviating this imperfection
                    appeared to be, by using a paper which should admit the black liquid to sink a
                    little into its substance. Accordingly, I took some of the more sinking kinds of
                    paper, and common paper made damp as for printing, and had the satisfaction to
                    find, that neither the oily nor the simple gummy mixtures spread upon them so
                    much as might have been expected, and that the characters were as fixed as could
                    be desired, for they could not be washed out without rubbing off' part of the
                    substance of the paper itself.</p>
                <p>“But a further improvement may yet be made, namely, that of uniting the ancient
                    and modern inks together; or using the common vitriolic ink instead of water,
                    for tempering the ancient mixture of gum and lamp-black. By this method it
                    should seem that the writings would have all the durability of those of former
                    times, with all the advantage that results from the vitriolic ink fixing itself
                    in the paper. Even where the common vitriolic mixture is depended on for the
                    ink, it may in many cases be improved by a small addition of the ancient
                    composition, or of the common Indian ink, which answers the same purpose. When
                    the vitriolic ink is dilute, and flows so pale from the pen, that the fine
                    strokes, on first writing, are scarcely visible, the addition of a little Indian
                    ink is the readiest means of giving it the due blackness. By this admixture it
                    may be presumed also that the vitriolic ink will be made more durable, the
                    Indian ink in some measure covering it, and defending it from the action of the
                    air. In all cases, where Indian ink or other similar compositions are employed,
                    cotton should be used in the ink-stand, to prevent the settling of the black
                    powder.”</p>
                <p>There is little doubt that the monkish ink was a composition of this nature,
                    combining in some degree the ancient and modern materials. The ancient ink must
                    have been very similar to the Indian or Chinese cakes. Pliny and Vitruvius both
                    mention it as a preparation of soot, or lamp-black, with glue or gum; and
                    Dioscorides gives the proportions of three parts of soot to one of gum. To this
                    the liquor extracted from the cuttle-fish had sometimes been added. When this
                    could not be had, there is indeed great reason to believe that some of the
                    modern vitriolic ingredients were added by the ancients; many of the manuscripts
                    of the Greek and Roman authors, erased by the monks, having been found to retain
                    as much of the vitriolic principle as to become again legible on the application
                    of chemical tests.</p>
                <p>In the Philosophical Transactions for 1787, DrBlagden gives some account of a
                    method of restoring decayed inks so as to render them legible. His experiments
                    originated from a conversation with Mr Astle, on the question whether the inks
                    made eight or ten centuries ago, and which are found to have preserved their
                    colour very well, were made of the same ’materials now employed or not? In order
                    to decide the question, Mr Astle furnished the doctor with several manuscripts
                    on parchment and vellum from the ninth <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941429"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1429-0279"/>to the fifteenth centuries inclusively. Some of
                    these were still very blaok; others of different shades, from a deep yellowish
                    brown to a very pale yellow, in some parts so faint that it could scarcely be
                    seen. This was tried with simple and phlogisticated alkalies, the mineral acids,
                    and infusion of galls. From these experiments it appeared that the ink anciently
                    employed was of the same nature as at present. The letters turned of a reddish
                    or yellowish brown, with alkalies became pale, and were at length obliterated by
                    the diluted mineral acids. The drop of acid liquor, which had been put upon a
                    letter, changed to a deep blue or green on the addition of phlogisticated
                    alkalies; with an infusion of galls, in some cases the letters acquired a deep
                    tinge, in others a slight one. “Hence,” says the doctor, “it is evident that one
                    of the ingredients was iron, which there is no reason to doubt was joined with
                    the vitriolic acid; and the colour of the more perfect manuscripts, which in
                    some was a deep black, and in others a purplish black, together with the
                    restitution of that colour in those which had lost it by the infusion of galls,
                    sufficiently proved that another of the ingredients was astringent matter, which
                    from history appears to have been that of galls. No trace of a black pigment of
                    any sort was discovered; the drop of acid, which had completely extracted a
                    letter, appearing of an uniform pale and ferruginous colour, without an atom of
                    black powder, or other extraneous matter, floating in it.”</p>
                <p>In considering the methods of restoring the legibility of decayed writings, our
                    author observes, that perhaps one of the best may be to join phlogisticated
                    alkali with the calx of iron which remains; because the precipitate formed by
                    these two substances greatly exceeds that of the iron alone. On this subject Dr
                    Blagden disagrees with Mr Bergmann; but to bring the matter to a test, the
                    following experiments were made.</p>
                <p>1. The phlogisticated alkali was rubbed in different quantities upon the bare
                    writing. This, in general, produced little effect, though, in a few instances,
                    it gave a bluish tinge to the letters, and increased their intensity;
                    “probably,” says the doctor, “where something of an acid nature had contributed
                    to the diminution of their colour.” 2. By adding, besides the alkali, a diluted
                    mineral acid to the writing, our author found his expectations fully answered;
                    the letters then changing quickly to a very deep and beautiful blue. It is but
                    of little consequence whether the acid or phlogisticated alkali be first added;
                    though upon further consideration the doctor inclined to begin with the alkali.
                    The reason is, that when the alkali is first put on, the colour seems to spread
                    less, and thus not to hurt the legibility of the writing so much as would
                    otherwise be done. His method is to spread the alkali thin over the writing with
                    a feather, then to touch it as gently as possible upon or nearly over the
                    letters with the diluted acid by means of a feather or bit of stick cut to a
                    blunt point. The moment that the acid liquor is applied, the letters turn to a
                    fine blue, beyond comparison stronger than the original trace of the letter; and
                    by applying a bit of blotting-paper to absorb the superfluous liquid, we may in
                    a great measure avoid the staining of the parchment; for it is this superfluous
                    liquor which, absorbing part of the colouring matter from the letters, becomes a
                    dye to whatever it touches. Care ought, however, to be taken not to allow the
                    blotting-paper to come in contact with the letters, because the colouring matter
                    may easily be rubbed off while soft and wet. Any one of the three mineral acids
                    will answer the purpose effectually. Dr Blagden commonly uses the marine. But
                    whichever of the three is used, it ought to be diluted so far as not to be in
                    danger of corroding the parchment; after which the degree of strength seems not
                    to be a matter of great nicety.</p>
                <p>Another method of restoring the legibility of old writings is by wetting them
                    with an infusion of galls in white wine; but this is subject to the same
                    inconvenience with the former, and is besides less efficacious. The doctor is of
                    opinion that the acid of the galls by itself would be better for the purpose
                    than the infusion of the whole substance of them; and he thinks also that a
                    preferable kind of phlogisticated alkali might be prepared either by purifying
                    the common kind from iron as much as possible, or by making use of the volatile
                    alkali instead of the fixed. Mr Astle mentions a method of restoring the
                    legibility of decayed writings; but says that it ought not to be hazarded, lest
                    a suspicion of deceit should arise.</p>
                <p>The illegibility of modern manuscripts, compared with those of an earlier date,
                    is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> matter of much interest, and has of late excited
                    considerable inquiry. It appears to us, that the greater durability of the
                    colour of the ink in old manuscripts is owing not only to the strength of the
                    ink, but to the quality of the paper and vellum. The strength of the astringent
                    or <hi rend="italic">tannin</hi> principle is acknowledged on all hands to be
                    that on which the durability of a vitriolic ink chiefly depends. Now that
                    principle is strong not only in old vellum, but it is retained to a considerable
                    extent in old paper made from linen rags. The vellum formerly used was prepared
                    by a tedious process, by which tannin was largely imparted to it in the same
                    manner as to leather; and to this cause old vellum owes its deep brown colour
                    more than to mere age. In like manner, the paper, instead of being bleached, as
                    is now done, with oxymuriatic acid, to <hi rend="italic">bring up</hi> the
                    colour, as it is called, but, in fact, to destroy the natural colour of the
                    paper, and to deprive it of one of its most valuable qualities, was allowed to
                    retain somewhat of its original <hi rend="italic">flax</hi> colour, and with its
                    colour a large proportion of the astringent quality on which the tenuity of the
                    paper, as well as its preservative property, depended. On that strong vellum,
                    parchment, and paper, our ancestors wrote with an ink, the component parts of
                    which seem to have been the same as of that now in use; but as they wrote more
                    seldom, and were not in so great haste, as their descendants, they were content
                    to use their ink so <hi rend="italic">thick,</hi> that the quantity of gum in it
                    was sufficient to hold a very strong mixture of the other ingredients in
                    suspension. This superabundance of gum or glue was not only serviceable in this
                    respect, but it also acted as a varnish, defending the ink from the corrosive
                    action of the atmosphere. Nor were these the only precautions taken. It will be
                    observed, that those writings on vellum which are in the best preservation, are
                    not only of a deep brown shade, and the ink with an apparent <hi rend="italic"
                    >body</hi> of colour, but the <hi rend="italic">grain</hi> side of the vellum,
                    or that not written upon, is smooth, almost as if it had been burnished. This
                    seems to have been done with animal glue, and afterwards well rubbed. The ink
                    was thus not only preserved from the action of the air on the one side by the
                    varnish incorporated with it, but protected on the other by the polished surface
                    of the parchment.</p>
                <p>Taking these circumstances into consideration, and giving them their due weight,
                    we feel convinced that any effectual plan for giving durability to the public
                    records of the kingdom or other deeds of importance, must commence with the
                    improvement of the paper and vellum upon which they are written. This is a
                    matter deserving the attention of government, and the correction of which is
                    within its reach. The books of records kept in the public offices are or ought
                    to be under its superintendence; and the only deeds the preservation of which is
                    of importance are written upon stamped paper, the issue of which is also within
                    the control of the government. By offering premiums for the manufacture of paper
                    in which the tannin or astringent principle is most effectually preserved or
                    introduced, and using proper precautions respecting the ink with which the deeds
                    are written, we can see nothing in the nature or composition <pb break="no"

                    generally marked with Chinese characters. Dr Lewis, from experiments made on
                    this substance, has shewn that it is composed of fine lamp-black and animal
                    glue; and, accordingly, for the preparation of it, he desires us to mix the
                    lamp-black with as much melted glue as is sufficient to give it a tenacity
                    proper for being made into cakes; and these when dry, he tells us, answered as
                    well as those imported from the East Indies, both with regard to the colour and
                    the freedom of working. Ivory-black, and other charcoal blacks, levigated to a
                    great degree of fineness, answered as well as the lamp-black; but in the state
                    in which ivory-black is commonly sold, it proved much too gritty, and separated
                    too hastily from the water.</p>

                    different from Indian ink, or that made use of in writing. It is an oily
                    composition, of the consistence of an ointment. The method of preparing it was
                    long kept a secret by those whose employment it was to make it, and who were
                    interested in concealing it; and even yet it is but imperfectly known. The
                    properties of good printing ink are, to work clean and easily, without daubing
                    the types or tearing the paper; to have a fine black colour; to wash easily off
                    the types; to dry soon; and to preserve its colour, without turning brown. This
                    last, which is a most necessary property, is effectually obtained by setting
                    fire to the oil with which the printing ink is made for a few moments, and then
                    extinguishing it by covering the vessel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    an ingredient; and its working clean depends on its having a proper degree of
                    strength, which is given by a certain addition of rosin. A good deal, however,
                    depends on the proportion of the ingredients to each other; for if too much soap
                    is added, the ink will work very foul, and daub the types to a greater degree.
                    The same thing will happen from using too much black, at the same time that both
                    the soap and black hinder the ink from drying; whilst too much oil and rosin
                    tear the paper, and hinder it from washing off. The following receipt has been
                    found to make printing· ink of a tolerable good quality: Take a Scotch pint of
                    linseed oil, and set it over a pretty brisk fire in an iron or copper vessel
                    capable of holding three or four times as much. When it boils strongly, and
                    emits a thick smoke, kindle it with a piece of paper, and immediately take the
                    vessel off the fire. Let the oil burn for about a minute; then extinguish it by
                    covering the vessel; after it has grown pretty cool, add two pounds of black
                    rosin, and one pound of hard soap cut into thin slices. If the oil is very hot
                    when the soap is added, almost the whole mixture will run over the vessel. The
                    mixture is then to be set again over the fire; and when the ingredients are
                    thoroughly melted, a pound of lamp-black, previously put through a lawn sieve,
                    is to be stirred into it. The whole ought then to be ground on a marble stone,
                    or in a levigating milk</p>
                <p>Though the above receipt is greatly superior to any that has been hitherto
                    published, all of which are capitally deficient in not mentioning the necessary
                    ingredients of rosin and soap; yet it must be acknowledged that ink made in this
                    manner is inferior in point of colour, and is likewise more apt to daub the
                    types and make an indistinct impression, than such as is prepared by some of
                    those who make the manufacture of this commodity their employment; so that
                    either a variation in the proportion of the ingredients, a nicety in the
                    mixture, or some additional ingredient, seems necessary to bring it to the
                    requisite perfection.</p>

                    workman adding oil or black to his ink as he thinks proper, in order to make it
                    suit his own taste. Some, however, mix a portion of common boiled oil, which has
                    never been burned; but this must necessarily be a bad practice, as such oil is
                    apt to go through the paper; a fault very common in prints, especially if the
                    paper is not very thick. No soap is added; because the ink is not cleared off

                <p>These kinds of ink may be divided into seven classes, with respect to the means
                    used to make them visible, viz. 1. such as become visible by passing another

                    that do not appear so long as they are kept close, but soon become visible on
                    being exposed to the air; 3. such as appear by strewing or sifting some very

                <p>The first class contains four kinds of ink, viz. solutions of lead, bismuth,

                    with a solution of gold in nitro-muriatic acid, and let the paper dry gently in
                    the shade; nothing will appear for the first seven or eight hours. Dip a pencil
                    in the solution of tin, and draw it lightly over the invisible characters, they
                    will immediately appear, of a purple colour.</p>
                <p>Characters written with a solution of green vitriol will likewise be invisible
                    when the paper is dry; but if wetted with an infusion of galls, they will
                    immediately appear as if written with common ink. If, instead of this infusion,
                    a solution of an alkaline prussiate be used, the writing will appear of a deep
                    blue.</p>
                <p>To the second class belong the solutions of all those metals which are apt to
                    attract oxygen from the air, such as lead, bismuth, silver, &amp;c. The
                    sympathetic ink of gold already mentioned belongs also to this class; for if the
                    characters written with it are long exposed to the air, they become by degrees
                    of a deep violet colour, nearly approaching to black. In like manner, characters
                    written with a solution of nitrate of silver are invisible when newly dried, but
                    being exposed to the sun, appear of a gray colour like slate. To this class also
                    belong solutions of sugar of lead, nitrates of copper and of mercury, acetate of
                    iron, and muriate of tin. Each of these has a particular colour when exposed to
                    the air; but they corrode the paper.</p>
                <p>The third class of sympathetic inks contains such liquids as have some kind of
                    glutinous viscosity, and at the same time are long in drying; by which means,
                    though the eye cannot discern the characters written with them upon paper, the
                    powders strewed upon them immediately adhere, and thus make the writing become
                    visible. Of this kind are urine, milk, the juices of some vegetables, weak
                    solutions of the deliquescent salts, and other liquids.</p>
                <p>The fourth class, comprehending all those that become visible by being exposed to
                    the fire, is very extensive, as it contains all those colourless liquids in
                    which the matter dissolved is capable of being reduced, and of reducing the
                    paper into a sort of charcoal by a small heat. Sulphuric acid, diluted with as
                    much water as will prevent it from corroding the paper, makes a good ink of this
                    kind. Letters written with this fluid arc invisible when dry, but instantly on
                    being held near the fire appear as black as if written with the finest ink.
                    Juice of lemons or onions, a solution of sal ammoniac, green vitriol, &amp;c.
                    answer the same purpose.</p>
                <p>The fifth class comprehends only a solution of muriate of cobalt.</p>
                <p>Ί he sixth class comprehends such inks as become visible when characters written
                    with them are wetted with water. They are made of all such substances as deposit
                    a copious sediment when mixed with water, dissolving only imperfectly in that
                    fluid. Of this kind are dried alum, sugar of lead, vitriol, and other
                    substances. We have therefore only to write with a strong solution of these
                    salts upon paper, and the characters will be invisible when dry; but when we
                    apply water, the small portion of dried salt cannot again be dissolved in the
                    water. Hence the insoluble part becomes visible on the paper, and shews the
                    characters written in white, gray, brown, or any other colour which the
                    precipitate assumes.</p>
                <p>Lastly, characters may be made to appear of a fine crimson, purple, or yellow, by
                    writing on paper with solution of muriate of tin, and then passing over it a
                    pencil dipt in a decoction of cochineal, Brazil-wood, log-wood, yellowwood, or
                    the like.</p>
                <p>A treatise upon inks was published by Peter Caniparius, professor of Medicine at
                    Venice, of which an edition was printed at London in 1660. It is divided into
                    six parts. The first treats of inks made from pyrites, stones, and metals; the
                    second of such as are made from metals and calces; the third of those which are
                    prepared from soots and vitriols; the fourth of the different kinds of inks used
                    by the <hi rend="italic">librarii</hi> or book-writers, by printers, and
                    engravers: likewise of staining or writing upon marble, stucco, or sea-gliolia,
                    and of encaustic modes of writing; of liquids for painting or colouring leather
                    and linen or woollen cloth, and of restoring inks that had been decayed by time;
                    together with many methods of effacing writing, restoring decayed paper, and
                    different modes of secret writing. The fifth treats of writing inks made in
                    different countries from gums, woods, the juices of plants, and the like, as
                    well as of different kinds of varnishes. The sixth treats of the different
                    methods of extracting vitriol, and the chemical uses of it.</p>
                <p>Weckerus, in a treatise <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Secretis,</hi>
                    printed at Basil in 1612, contains a number of curious particulars concerning
                    ink. He also gives receipts for making gold and silver inks, composed both with
                    these metals and without them; and directions for making inks for secret
                    writing, and for effacing them, though in this last part there are many
                    particulars bordering too much on the marvellous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ink</hi><hi rend="italic">Stones,</hi> a kind of small round
                    stones, of a white, red, gray, yellow, or black colour, containing a quantity of
                    native martial vitriol, from which they derive the property of making ink, and
                    hence their name. They are almost entirely soluble in water, and besides their
                    other ingredients, contain also a portion of copper and zinc.</p>
