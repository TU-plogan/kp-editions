                    rend="smallcaps">Ancient,</hi> a country situated on the east coast of the
                    Adriatic, the limits of which were at no time distinctly marked. In its most
                    restricted sense it may be considered as extending from Dalmatia on the north,
                    to Epirus on the south, from which it was separated by the Acroceraunian range
                    of mountains. To the east it was separated from Macedonia by a lofty chain of
                    mountains, which was known under the several names of Bertiscus, Scardus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tschar Dagh,</hi> and Bernus. When the Romans conquered the
                    country, they added to it the Dalmatians, Japydes, and other petty tribes; and,
                    under the emperors, so widely were the frontiers of Illyria extended, that it
                    comprehended the great districts of Pannonia, Rhaetia, Noricum, and Moesia
                    (Appian, <hi rend="italic">Illyr.</hi> 6). In the third century we find <hi
                    rend="italic">Duces</hi><hi rend="italic">totius Illyrici</hi> mentioned, under
                    whose command were placed not only the troops of the above-mentioned countries,
                    but also those of Thrace. When the Roman empire was divided into two parts, they
                    each received a portion of Illyria. The western portion comprehended Dalmatia,
                    Pannonia, and Noricum, and belong-eđ<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Prcefectus prcetorio Italioe.</hi> It is remarked by Strabo (vii.
                    317), that the coast of Illyria presented everywhere good harbours, whilst the
                    opposite side of Italy was entirely devoid of them. The climate was excellent,
                    and the soil in general such as to produce olive trees and vines. In the
                    interior, however, the country is mountainous, and covered with snow during a
                    great part of the year.</p>
                <p>Illyria was inhabited by a great number of different tribes, of whom we shall
                    mention the principal. In the north were the Japydes, the Liburni, celebrated as
                    a maritime people, and the Dalmatae, whose chief city was Salon, now <hi
                    rend="italic">Salona.</hi> The Scordisci, it would appear, were an Illyrian
                    people, reaching as far as the river Danube. More to the south were the Dardani,
                    who occupied the upper valleys of the river Drilo, and extended to the frontiers
                    of Paeonia and Macedonia. The most interesting part, however, of Illyria was
                    that which extended along the coast for nearly ninety miles, from the Gulf of
                    Drino and the vicinity of Lissus, to the Acroceraunian Mountains and the
                    confines of Chaonia. There we find the important towns of Epidamnus, Apollonia,
                    Oricum, and in the interior the Atin-tanes, and the Dassaretii with their
                    capital Lychnidus, situated on a great lake of the same name. Its chief rivers
                    were the Drilo, formed by two branches, which rise nearly two hundred miles
                    apart, and the northern branch of which is now called the <hi rend="italic"

                    Illyria.</p>
                <p>Respecting the origin of the Illyrian people we have little information on which
                    we can depend. Their vicinity to the Thracians, and the peculiar practice of
                    tatooing their bodies, would lead us to connect them with that important people;
                    yet it is curious that ancient writers always distinguish them, and when they
                    both served as light troops in the army of Alexander they formed separate
                    bodies. Of their early history we know nothing, nor are they mentioned till the
                    reign of Amyntas, king of Macedonia, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 383, when
                    we find Bardylis, a leader oì banditti, elected king by his followers. His power
                    increased daily, and he at last included within his kingdom all that part of
                    Illyria which lies along the sea-coast. He attacked Macedonia, and defeating its
                    king Amyntas, took several of its cities (Diodor. XV. 15, 19); and again, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 359, we find him at war with Perdiccas, who fell in
                    an engagement with the Illyrians (xvi. 2). The same year, however, he was
                    defeated by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who succeeded on the
                    death of Perdiccas, and was obliged to surrender all the cities and districts
                    which he had taken from Macedonia (xvi. 4). Bardylis was succeeded by his son
                    Clitus, who made an unsuccessful attempt to recover from Alexander that portion
                    of Macedonia which his father had been compelled to give up (Arrian, i. 5).
                    Clitus was succeeded by his son Pleuratus, and he again by Agron, a powerful
                    prince, who ruled over the Dalmatians, the Greek colonies in the islands Issa,
                    Corcyra, and Melaena, and also some of the Greek cities in Epirus. The Greeks,
                    however, were by no means willing to be subject to one whom they considered as a
                    barbarian, and they applied for assistance to the Romans, who were at that time
                    beginning to interfere in the affairs of Greece. Besides, the Roman merchants
                    had suffered considerably from the piracy of the Illyrians. The remonstrances of
                    the Romans were little attended to, and whilst preparations were making for an
                    effective attack, Agron died, and was succeeded in the government of Illyria by
                    his queen Teuta. The year B. c. 229, the Romans first landed on the coast of
                    Illyria, and before the end of the year they had so humbled the pride of the
                    Illyrians that they were glad to sue for peace, which was granted on condition
                    that they should give up the greater portion of the coast, and agree that no
                    armed vessel should sail south of the Gulf of Lissus. The islands were declared
                    free, and the country taken from the Illyrians was made over to Demetrius, whose
                    treachery had proved the principal means of the success of the Romans. The
                    Illyrian princes seem to have lived quietly within the bounds which the Romans
                    had assigned them, nor do they appear to have made any attempt to recover their
                    dominions, till the reign of Gentius, great-grandson of Agron, who was induced
                    to join Perseus, king of Macedonia, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 168, in his
                    attack on the Romans. Thirty days were sufficient to finish the war with the
                    Illyrians; and Gentius, with his whole family, having fallen into the hands of
                    the conqueror, was sent to Rome to grace the praetor’s triumph. From that time
                    Illyria was considered as a Roman province, and though some portion of the
                    country was at times rebellious, it generally submitted to the power of the
                    Romans. (Appian, <hi rend="italic">Illyrica,</hi> Liv. xliv.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Illyria,</hi><hi rend="italic">Modern,</hi> a province of
                    the empire of Austria, which in the nomenclature of the government is classed by
                    the name of a kingdom. When the Romans had made themselves masters of the
                    Danube, the Save, and the Drave, they united all the country to the south of
                    Noricum and Pannonia into a province, to which they gave the name of Illyricum.
                    When the western Roman empire fell to pieces, and, through the pressure of the
                    northern invaders, Byzantium was deprived of its outworks, that province lost
                    its name, and was only distinguished by the Austrians as the Hungarian provinces
                    to the south of the Drave.</p>
                <p>By the peace of Presburg in 1809, these portions of country were ceded to
                    Bonaparte, and with them also Villach, Friuli, Istria, and a part of Tyrol, to
                    which afterwards Dalmatia was added; and they were constituted a portion of his
                    vast empire, under the name of the Illyrian Provinces. The campaigns of 1813 and
                    1814, with the treaty of Vienna which .followed as the consequence of these,
                    gave back these provinces to the ancient ruler. Dalmatia, the military frontier,
                    and the Tyrol, were detached from them; and in 1822 they were further diminished
                    by the erection of Croatia into a separate government.</p>
                <p>This kingdom is, for political purposes, divided into two parts, with separate
                    chiefs; one in the north, denominated, from its capital, Laybach; and the other
                    in the south, from the same cause called Trieste, but sometimes distinguished as
                    the division of the sea-shore.</p>
                <p>This kingdom extends in north latitude from 44° 59' to 47° 8', and in east
                    longitude from 12° 36'to 16° 27'. It is bounded on the north by the Austrian
                    province of the Upper Ens, by Steyermark, and Civil Croatia; on the east by
                    Military Croatia; on the south by the Adriatic Sea; and on the west by Venetian
                    Lombardy and the Tyrol. The extent and population of the several districts

                    mountains, having some of their points very lofty, between which are valleys,
                    some of greater, others of less extent. The sea-coast is generally flat and
                    sandy, particularly to the westward, and abounds in morasses. The bay of Trieste
                    on the east, and that of Quarnaro on the west, run far up into the land, and
                    thus form the great peninsula of Istria. The valleys in the districts of Villach
                    and Klagenfurth are stony, but have a soil of moderate fertility. In Karlstadt
                    there is an excess of wood. The districts of Laybach, Neustadt, and Adelsburg,
                    are full of stone quarries, marshes, and sand-hills, and are very unproductive.
                    In the districts on the coast, the want of water is sometimes much felt. A range
                    of mountains near Laybach divides the course of the waters, which on the north
                    of it run to the Save and the Drave, and through them to the Black Sea; whilst
                    those rivers in the south of the range discharge their water into the
                    Adriatic.</p>
                <p>The great ranges of mountains already noticed may be divided into three classes,
                    all of which take their direction from east to west. 1sZ, The Noric Alps, which
                    cover the northern parts of the districts of Villach and Klagenfurth. The names
                    of the particular parts are various, but the loftiest portion is the Great
                    Glockner, the highest points of which arc 11,980 feet above the level of the
                    sea, and are covered with snow during the whole year. From it a projection
                    extends to the south, and separates Klagenfurth from the province of Steyermark.
                    2d, The Carinthian Alps. This range is divided into two branches, one of which
                    extends to Stcyermark, and the other terminates with the massive Terklow, from
                    which a lower branch is continued to the river Save. 3d, The Julian Alps. These
                    begin with the Terklow, which is 6500 feet in height, and run quite to the
                    Adriatic Sea. It is a characteristic of these Julian mountains, that they are
                    all of calcareous formation, and are filled with an incredible number of caverns
                    and grottos. From Isonzo to the frontier of Bosnia more than a thousand of these
                    are remarked; and it has been supposed that the whole of the mountains in
                    question are filled with such natural excavations. Many small streams flow under
                    as well as upon the earth; they are visible for a short space, and then bury
                    themselves in the bowels of the earth. The washing of such streams causes a
                    sinking of the land in many parts in the form of a funnel, which has a very
                    remarkable appearance. The whole district, but especially the eastern part, from
                    the peculiar formation, the numerous caverns, the subterranean rivers, the
                    lakes, cascades, and other curiosities, presents many natural phenomena, such as
                    are unknown in any other part of Europe.</p>
                <p>The population consists of several original tribes, mostly of the Sclavonian
                    race. The original language is still retained, but with a great variety of
                    dialects, by which they may still be traced up to the countries whence they
                    emigrated twelve or thirteen centuries ago. They adhere to their ancient
                    customs, dress, food, and amusements, and rarely intermarry with any of the
                    families of German origin. They arc mostly occupied in agriculture, though some
                    are employed in the mines, and a few in the towns and cities in the several
                    kinds of labour. Their number exceeds 800,000 persons. The next are the Germans,
                    some cultivators, others mechanics or traders, who are stated to be rather more
                    than 300,000. Besides, there are about 60,000 Italians, residing chiefly on the
                    Adriatic shores. The far greater proportion adhere to the Roman Catholic
                    communion, and are zealously, or rather bigotedly, attached to it. They are
                    under the ecclesiastical direction of thirteen bishops in the different cities.
                    In the circles of Villach and Klagenfurth there are about 18,000 Lutherans, who
                    have sixteen churches and eighteen chapels. Besides these, there are 200
                    Protestants reformed, 1200 Jews, and 1000 of the Greek church, all of whom have
                    the free exercise of their several religious rites.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the surface, agriculture can be but little productive, though
                    it is well managed in the valleys about Villach and Klagenfurth. The corn
                    produced is, according to Blumenbach, a million quarters of the four principal
                    kinds; and in one year, where actual returns were made, the following products
                    were harvested, viz. wheat 94,300 quarters, rye 185,000, barley 142,500, and
                    oats 350,000 quarters. Though some maize, buck-wheat, and millet are raised, and
                    though potatoes have been introduced and extended in every year, there is a
                    deficiency to be supplied from other districts, which is paid for by the timber
                    and wood-ware which is floated down by the rivers, and the preparation of which
                    furnishes a great portion of the employment of labourers. Flax and hemp are
                    cultivated; and there are in most parts abundance of fruit trees, and in the
                    southern part great plenty of almonds, chestnuts, and walnuts. Some olives grow
                    near Trieste; and about forty eimers, of thirty gallons each, are annually
                    exported. The stock of cattle is small when compared with either the extent of
                    the land or the number of the inhabitants. The northern districts yield no wine;
                    in the south there is abundance, but most of it is of bad quality, and cannot be
                    kept longer than a year.</p>
                <p>The fishery gives considerable employment to the residents on the sea-shore,
                    especially the taking of the large tunny and small sardinias, operations which
                    are carried on by joint-stock companies. Many oysters also are taken, and the
                    city of Vienna is supplied with them by a very expensive land-carriage.</p>
                <p>The mining operations are very numerous, if not very extensive. The chief minés
                    of lead are near .Villach, Adelsburg has the most productive mines of
                    quicksilver, and most of the other districts yield silver, iron, copper,
                    antimony, sal-ammoniac, alum, or vitriol. The iron is chiefly converted into
                    tools or utensils, particularly nails, which are exported. There is abundance of
                    fossil coal in many parts, and some saline springs. The latter do not yield
                    sufficient culinary salt for the consumption, and much is made by the sun on the
                    sea-shore. Whatever shipping trade exists is conducted through the ports of
                    Trieste or Fiume. As there are good roads in all directions, the internal trade
                    with the other dominions of Austria is very extensive, and rapidly
                    increasing.</p>
                <p>The courts of law, both civil and criminal, are held at Klagenfurth, which is
                    also the chief seat of the police, and of the treasury board for the whole
                    kingdom.</p>
