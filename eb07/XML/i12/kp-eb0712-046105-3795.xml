                <p><label type="entry">ISPAHAN</label>, from time immemorial the capital of the
                    Persian monarchy, and long celebrated as one of the most splendid cities of the
                    East, though now nearly in a state of ruin and decay. Its original name is said
                    to have been Sipahan, which it received from the Persian kings, in consequence
                    of its having been the general place of rendezvous for their armies. The origin
                    of this city is lost in a remote antiquity; but it is generally supposed to have
                    arisen from the ruins of Hecatompylos, the capital of Parthia; whilst some will
                    have it to stand on the site of the Aspa or Aspadu-ra of Ptolemy. It is well
                    adapted, from its central situation with the noble river Zeinderood flowing
                    through it, for the capital of the empire. It was under the caliphs of Bagdad
                    that it rose to be the capital of Irak, and under their powerful protection it
                    soon increased in wealth, population, and trade. The invasion of Timor gave a
                    fatal blow to its rising prosperity. Ispahan was taken by his conquering army in
                    the year 1387; and at first he contented himself with exacting a large
                    contribution from its inhabitants But being apprised that the inhabitants
                    meditated a nocturnal insurrection against his troops, he gave up the place to
                    military execution; and in the indiscriminate massacre which followed, it is
                    computed that 70,000 inhabitants perished; indeed their heads piled up in heaps
                    on the walls of Ispahan, attested the merciless severity of the conqueror. From
                    this desolation, owing to its favoured situation, it quickly revived; and under
                    the early sophis great efforts were made to restore its former prosperity. But
                    it was reserved for the renowned Shah Abbas to raise it to the height of royal
                    magnificence, and to render it not only a luxurious capital, but the great
                    emporium of the Asiatic world. During his reign it contained nearly a million of
                    people, and to supply its markets required the labour of 1400 villages, whose
                    inhabitants drew their subsistence from its prosperity. “Its bazaars,” says Sir
                    R. K. Porter, “were filled with merchandize from every quarter of the globe,
                    mingled with the rich bales of its own celebrated manufactures.”<note

                    activity; whilst the court of the great king was the resort of ambassadors from
                    the proudest kingdoms of the East, as well as from Europe; and travellers
                    visited it, to behold its splendours, and to enjoy the gracious reception
                    bestowed by its monarch on the learned and ingenious of all nations. It was
                    visited by Chardin at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and its mag <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192943808" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3808-0462"/> nificence was
                    such, mat no city of the East could compart with it, except the capitals of
                    Hindostan and China. Such was the state of Ispahan during the reign of Abbas the
                    First, and also during the subsequent reign of the second Abbas. In 1722, it was
                    taken by the Afghans, when all its prosperity and splendour were for ever
                    extinguished by those merciless invaders. The people were massacred without
                    mercy; the most superb edifices erected by the Persian kings were reduced to
                    ruins; and the wall which formerly surrounded the city was entirely destroyed by
                    them. In 1727 it was retaken by Nadir Shah, who took no pains, however, to
                    restore its prosperity. Since this period, Ispahan has never again been a royal
                    residence, the late sovereigns of Persia having preferred a more northern
                    capital, particularly Teheran; and Ispahan, instead of being repaired and
                    beautified as formerly, has gone more and more into decay, and now presents
                    little else than a scene of ruin. Its people are in fact reduced to scarcely
                    one-tenth of their former numbers; the streets are everywhere in ruin; the
                    bazaars remain silent and unattended; the caravansaries are equally forsaken;
                    its villages He waste; and its palaces are solitary, the sounds of revelry,
                    which were wont to be heard in the festive halls, being now succeeded by the
                    howling of jackals and famishing dogs.</p>
                <p>According to the ancient account of this city by Chardin, it was twenty-four
                    miles in circuit, contained 172 mosques, 43 colleges, 1800 caravansaries, and
                    273 public baths. The most splendid edifice which adorned the city was the
                    palace of Shah Abbas. It is said to have been five miles in circuit, and was
                    divided into gardens and pleasure grounds, with summer-houses and other elegant
                    structures. The extent and elegance of the buildings, the number and beauty of
                    the fountains dispersed through the gardens, and the grandeur of the royal halls
                    in the interior, are said to have surpassed any thing of the kind to be found in
                    Europe. The walls and buildings of the palace remain still nearly entire; but it
                    has been stripped of all its costly furniture, and every thing valuable that
                    could be removed.</p>
                <p>The Meydun is a large square, nearly one-third of a mile in length, and about
                    one-halt n breadth. It was formerly surrounded by a canal, bordered by very fine
                    plane trees; but all vestiges of both are now obliterated. Its original purpose,
                    by Shah Abbas, was for the display of horsemanship and military exercises, but
                    it is now entirely devoted to trade, being the place of the city where the
                    finest shops arc to be found, with a second storey, in which mechanics have
                    their working apartments; and in the middle is a market for horses and cattle.
                    In the centre of this immense area stand some edifices remarkable for grandeur
                    or for character. In the north-west we find the great gate or rather tower of
                    entrance to the bazaar, on which in former times stood the celebrated clock of
                    Ispahan. The south-eastern side of the quadrangle shews the Mesched Shah, a
                    superb mosque, which Shah Abbas built and dedicated to Mehedi, one of the twelve
                    imams. On the northeast is the mesque of Looft Ullah; and on the south-west the
                    Ali-kapi, or gate of Ali, forms a majestic parallel to the bazaar porch on the
                    opposite side. This is the most perfect piece of fine brick-work to be found in
                    the Persian empire. Another remarkable object is the Chahar Bagh, or four
                    gardens. The royal domain which bears that title, is a very extensive tract,
                    inclosed with four majestic walls, and divided into gardens with
                    pleasure-grounds. The prevailing plan of all these is that of long parallel
                    walks, shaded by even rows of tall and umbrageous planes; and interspersed with
                    a variety of fruit-trees, and of every kind of flowering shrub. Canals, which
                    receive the waters of the Zeinderood, flow down the avenues in the same
                    undeviating lines, and generally terminate in some large marble basin of a
                    square or octagon shape, ornamented with sparkling fountains; the effect of the
                    whole, though formal, being extremely grand.</p>
                <p>Many magmħcent rivers and palaces opened into these grounds, which are now all
                    destroyed. That at the east called Hooser Jereeb, one of the noblest edifices of
                    Is ļ han, was reduced into a heap of rubbish by the Afghans. Its garden,
                    however, still remains, and is nearly a mile in extent. The object of this
                    garden was to form a repository of the finest fruits which Persia produced, and
                    which are still to be found there in the greatest perfection. The palace of
                    Forty Pillars, which was the favourite residence of the Sefi kings, is said to
                    exceed all our European ideas of splendour, and to realize the wonderful tales
                    of the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. At a considerable distance from the
                    Chehel Setoon, or the palace of the Forty Pillars, to the left of the gardens,
                    stands the Winter Palace, containing the harem, royal arsenal, and stables,
                    where Ashneff, the second tyrant of the Afghan invaders, held his short and
                    cruel sway, which he stained wdth the blood of its native prince, the captive
                    Shah Houssain. Close to the winter palace stands a superb structure, lately
                    erected by the Nizam-a-Doulah, for the reception of his present majesty, should
                    he ever visit the capital. The general style of the architecture is the same
                    with that of the neighbouring palaces, but executed in a more light, simple, and
                    elegant taste.</p>
                <p>There are several very handsome bridges in Ispahan across the Zeinderood. They
                    were all the work of Shah Abbas, built of brick, and on the same plan, being
                    perfectly level, presenting the appearance of Roman aqueducts. Each bridge is
                    formed of a long succession of small arches, over wh ch the causeway is laid;
                    and on that run two lines of arcades on each side of the bridge, affording a
                    road for foot passengers, and leaving the middle part open fôr horsemen and
                    cattle. The bridge which joins the Chaur Bang with the suburb of Julpha, is 1000
                    feet long, and has thirty-four arches. The streets of Ispahan are narrow,
                    winding, and irregular; and being quite unpaved, the wind, in dry weather,
                    raises such clouds of dust, that the sun cannot be seen. Great pains are in
                    consequence bestowed in watering the streets. The houses within, though they are
                    handsome and convenient, have a mean appearance from the street, being built
                    merely of bricks dried in the sun, and covered with flat roofs. The walls by
                    which the city was formerly surrounded, are now entirely obliterated. They were
                    merely built of mud dried in the sun, and were never able to offer any effectual
                    resistance against a vigorous assault.</p>
                <p>Ispahan, during its prosperity, was greatly distinguished by the extent and
                    beauty of its suburbs. The suburb of Julpha was very wealthy and populous. It
                    was chiefly inhabited by Armenians, who were transferred here from Old Julpha in
                    Armenia, on account of their skill in manufacturing industry. They were soon
                    joined by others of their countrymen, as well as by a number of Georgians,
                    Circassians, and other Christians, the suburbs being appropriated to the
                    professors of that faith. The streets are broad, with well built houses and a
                    numerous population, with walks of trees, cooling fountains, and pleasant
                    gardens. It is now reduced to a complete ruin. Its 10,000 inhabitants have
                    diminished to 300 wretched families, dwindling every year both in respectability
                    and numbers; its thirteen churches are reduced to two, and these dirty and dark
                    and dismal in their appearance. The· worship of the Guebres, the ancient
                    worshippers of fire, and that of Abbas Adab, formerly very extensive, have quite
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>Ispahan, after such a long period of misery and desolation from foreign wars and
                    internal revolutions, has begun to revive from its low state, partly through the
                    spontaneous efforts of its inhabitants, anxious to better their condition, and
                    partly also through the exertions of Hajee Mahommed Hussein Khan, who, from the
                    lowest situation, having acquired immense wealth, has employed it in the
                    improvement<pb break="no" facs="nls:192943821" xml:id="kp-eb0712-3821-0463"/> of
                    his native city and province. He has completed a royal palace, and has
                    beautified and rebuilt many of the bazaars; repaired and added to the number of
                    the fountains and aqueducts which supply the public gardens with water; and
                    inclosed and cultivated all the waste land in the vicinity of the city, by
                    planting rice fields, which are irrigated by the waters of the Zeinderood, and
                    the cultivation of which is likely to supersede entirely its once abundant
                    nurseries for cotton and silk. Ispahan has still very extensive manufactures. It
                    excels in silk manufactures and in gold brocade; and it is also a great emporium
                    of inland trade, and a depot of Indian produce, being the chief medium of
                    intercourse between India, Cabul, and the east, and Turkey, Egypt, and the
                    countries round the Mediterranean, in the west. Lat. 32° 25' N.; Long. 52° 50'
