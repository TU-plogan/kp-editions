                <p><label type="entry">INSCRIPTION</label>, in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inscriptio</hi> (a word formed from the preposition <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">scribere</hi> to write), and signifying something written
                    or engraved on any substance, whether of wood, stone, metal, or other material,
                    and having for its object to transmit to posterity the record of some important
                    event or transaction.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the ancients engraved on temples and columns the principles
                    of science, as well as the events of history. In the early ages of the world
                    this was the only means by which valuable truths could be preserved, and the
                    memory of important transactions transmitted to succeeding ages. Sanchoniathon,
                    a Phoenician historian, born at Berytus in Syria, and who flourished about the
                    time of the Trojan war, is said to have drawn most of the materials of his
                    history from inscriptions which he found in temples and on columns, both in his
                    own country and in Palestine. But however this may have been, the circumstances
                    mentioned by Herodotus shew, that the first method of instructing men, and of
                    transmitting sciences as well as history to posterity, was by inscriptions. And
                    this is confirmed by Plato; who, in his <hi rend="italic">Hippias,</hi> informs
                    us that Pisistratus caused to be engraved on stone, for the benefit of his
                    countrymen, useful precepts in husbandry. Pliny assures us that the earliest
                    public monuments consisted of plates of lead, on which were engraved the records
                    of public transactions; and, in corroboration of this, he mentions, by way of
                    exception, that the treaty of confederacy concluded between the Romansand the
                    Jews, was inscribed on plates of brass, in order that the record of the compact
                    might be less liable to be effaced, and that the Jewish people might always have
                    something to remind them of the alliance which they had formed with the Romans.
                    Nor were inscriptions discontinued in proportion as the art of writing was
                    improved and facilitated. On the contrary, amongst the Greeks and Romans
                    especially, this method of preserving the memory of important events, in
                    connexion with distinguished names, continued to be employed long after it had
                    ceased to be a matter of necessity; and hence the multitude of inscriptions, or
                    fragments of inscriptions, which has outlasted the injuries of time, and the
                    still more destructive dilapidations of barbarism-</p>
                <p>inscriptions are of different kinds, and they have been variously classed. Spohn,
                    for instance, has divided archaeography into no less than eight parts, viz.
                    numismatography, epigrammatography, architectonography, iconography,
                    glyptography, toreumatography, bibliography, and angiography. But this
                    classification, which Boeckh has denominated rude, appears to be extremely
                    unscientific and arbitrary, and not being founded upon any clear or definite
                    principle, it is calculated to involve the subject in inextricable perplexity. A
                    more natural and obvious division readily suggests itself. Inscriptions,
                    generally considered, may be arranged in two classes, namely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >numismatic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">monumental</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the former including the legends preserved on ancient coins and medals; the
                    latter, the texts engraved on palaces, temples, and other edifices, together
                    with those on columns, obelisks, statues, and such like monuments. The one of
                    these branches is entirely distinct from, and can never be confounded with the
                    other. In numismatics, our attention is exclusively confined to simple legends,
                    consisting merely of names, titles, and dates. In monumental inscriptions we
                    meet with texts, or the remains of texts, which, besides names and titular or
                    official designations, contain, in a more or less perfect form, records of
                    particular transactions or events, the memory of which it was intended thus to
                    perpetuate. But the latter, with reference to their subjects, may nevertheless
                    be subdivided into four different kinds. These are, first, the inscriptions
                    relating to public affairs and civil institutions, which it is the principal
                    object of the historian to investigate; secondly, those which respect private
                    affairs, or the economy and intercourse of common life; thirdly, those which
                    relate to the ceremonies of religion, and the arts or observances therewith
                    connected; and, lastly, those which have reference to the history of science,
                    whether as respects philosophy, mythology, or any other branch of knowledge.
                    Under one or other of these heads may be included every kind of monumental
                    inscription.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable inscriptions in the world are those sculptured on the
                    temples, palaces and obelisks, or painted on the interior of the <hi
                    rend="italic">hypogoeaox</hi> burial-vaults of the ancient Egyptians; the texts,
                    in cuneiform characters, observed on the ruins of Persepolis, as well as on
                    vitrified bricks found amidst the ruins of Babylon; and those preserved on the
                    pillars and ornamental parts of the rock-temples of Elephanta, Ellora, Carli,
                    and other ancient monuments in India. Of the first of these, some account has
                    already been given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hieroglyphics,</hi> to
                    which the reader is accordingly referred. In this interesting field of inquiry,
                    modern sagacity has, in part, triumphed over the difficulties, so numerous and
                    formidable, which seemed destined to oppose an insuperable barrier to all
                    investigation. But much, very much, yet remains to be done; indeed, the task may
                    be said to have only been commenced. Proper names have been deciphered, legends
                    have been interpreted and explained, dates have also been determined; but the
                    body of those texts, to which the history of ancient Egypt has probably been
                    consigned, still remains as great a mystery as ever. To a double or perhaps
                    triple lock only one key has as yet been found. With regard to the Persepolitan
                    characters, again, various attempts have been made to decipher them, though
                    hitherto without any certain or assignable success. By a fortunate accident or
                    rather conjecture, Μ. Saint-Martin has, we understand, been enabled to detect
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Xerxes</hi> upon a vase in the cabinet of the King
                    at Paris. But whilst <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941585"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1585-0291"/>little reliance can be placed on such divinations,
                    it is plain that the interpretation, even if well-founded, cannot afford
                    sufficient data for advancing a single step beyond it. No parasite translations
                    into any known language have been discovered, as in Egypt, where the pillar of
                    Rosetta and the monument of Philae afforded the means of instituting tentative
                    comparisons, and furnished the elements of an alphabet; nor is it at all
                    probable that, without some such accessory helps, any progress will ever be made
                    in determining the values of the nail-headed characters. The Indian
                    inscriptions, also, still remain in a great measure undeciphered; nor has there
                    yet been found any certain or safe clew calculated to lead to the interpretation
                    of the characters in which they are written, much less of the texts which these
                    characters have been employed to express. The discovery of such a key, indeed,
                    is a question in the theory of probabilities, where the chance of failure is to
                    that of success, within a given time, as a number incalculably great to unity.
                    Some interpretations have, indeed, been published, as for example of the
                    Allahabad and Delhi inscriptions, and also of those found in the caves of Carli;
                    but none of the interpreters, so far as we know, has condescended to state the
                    data on which he proceeded, or to explain the process by which he was enabled to
                    construct an alphabet; and it must be evident that, without the most distinct
                    and precise information on this point, no confidence can be placed in the
                    results alleged to have been obtained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>With regard to the Carli inscriptions, the Rev. Mr Stevenson
                    of Poonah, having directed his attention to the subject, employed a year and a
                    half in searching for a key amongst the natives; but as the latter were wholly
                    unacquainted with the characters in which these inscriptions were written, his
                    researches proved fruitless. He then made a collection of alphabets used on the
                    western side of India, and attempted, by means of these, to decipher the
                    inscriptions; but still with indifferent success. The publication of the
                    Allahabad inscription, however, gave a new impulse and direction to his studies,
                    and at length he was enabled, though we are not informed how, to read and
                    translate the Carli inscriptions. It would certainly have been much more
                    satisfactory, and, in appearance at least, far less empirical, had Mr Stevenson
                    condescended to state the data on which his method of interpretation is
                    founded.</p><p>But be this as it may, the results alleged to have been obtained
                    from the Carli inscriptions deciphered are curious. These are, first, that the
                    rock temple in question was excavated about sixteen centuries ago; secondly,
                    that the empire of Shalivahana, in the Deccan, continued at least a hundred
                    years after his time; thirdly, that Buddhism was the religion at that time
                    favoured by the ruling party; fourthly, that the Shakas, so far from supplanting
                    the language and literature of the Brahmins, adopted the Sanscrit as the vehicle
                    for transmitting the memory of their own deeds to posterity; fifthly, that a
                    simpler character than the Devanagari was probably used at the time when the
                    Vedas and other ancient compositions were committed to writing; sixthly, that
                    the Arabic numeral ciphers had been introduced into India at the period above
                    mentioned; and, lastly, that great caution must be observed in admitting local
                    traditions as of authority in regard to the condition of society or the state of
                    knowledge and manners in such remote times.</p><p>These results, however, though
                    probable enough, require confirmation. We have already observed that Mr
                    Stevenson’s scheme of an alphabet is not satisfactorily developed; and Mr
                    Princep found that, when applied to the Allahabad inscription, it did not
                    convert the text of that monument into intelligible Sanscrit. Besides, Mr
                    Hodgson, resident in Nepaul, has expressed his conviction that the characters of
                    this incription, so far from having preceded, are in fact derived from the
                    Devanagari, or literal symbols of the learned Hindus. It appears, also, that the
                    Allahabad and Delhi inscriptions are identical with one discovered at
                    Mattia-lath, on the Nepaul frontier.</p></note></p>
                <p>Inscriptions in an unknown character have also been found cut upon granite and
                    sandstone rocks, between Mount Sinai and the Red Sea. Several specimens of these
                    now lie before us, copied from the rocks at Wady Magara, Gebel Mokatteb, Mount
                    Horeb, Wady Maggup, and Nasby. With the exception of a mixed inscription, and
                    also one in Greek, and another Cufic, they are all in the same character. In
                    those found at Wady Magara and Geb el Mokatteb, we discover rude delineations of
                    the camel, the horse, the goat, and the antelope, with, in one instance, the
                    figure of a man holding a club or staff in his hand. The characters bear a
                    considerable analogy to the Cufic, though much more distinct; and, judging from
                    the figures of loaded camels, with their heads all turned in the same direction,
                    it seems not improbable, that the texts record the transits of different
                    caravans. In one of these inscriptions, a number of characters are marked out in
                    such a manner, by a line underneath, as to suggest the idea that they represent
                    the name of some distinguished person, upon a principle analogous to that which
                    was observed in the royal scrolls of the Egyptian writing; and this conjecture
                    is somewhat countenanced by the circumstance that, amongst the characters thus
                    defined, there is one which occurs thrice. But there exist no data upon which to
                    found an attempt at interpretation; nor can any opinion be formed as to their
                    relative antiquity.</p>
                <p>In the countries of the west, where civilization is comparatively but of recent
                    origin, few remains of extinct forms of writing have been discovered. This is
                    easily accounted for, because, in Europe, the origin of letters is of much more
                    recent date than in those countries where such interesting relics are found. The
                    language of the Eugubian tables is, no doubt, an exception, inasmuch as all the
                    learning and ingenuity of scholars have as yet been insufficient to analyze its
                    structure, or to penetrate the meaning of the texts in which it has been
                    partially preserved. But, by a singular anomaly, the characters on these tables
                    have been resolved into an alphabet; and it may not unreasonably be hoped, that
                    the power thus obtained of combining words, will ultimately lead to the
                    discovery of their respective values. The Runic characters and the Runic
                    language are now pretty well understood.</p>
                <p>But the category of inscriptions to which the most direct interest and the
                    greatest importance are naturally attached, whether with reference to the
                    subjects of history, antiquities, or philology, is that which includes the
                    monumental remains of Greece and Rome, particularly of the former.</p>
                <p>Not to mention the writers who, between the age of Herodotus and that of Cosmas
                    Indopleustes, or even later, make frequent mention of inscriptions, Philochorus
                    of Athens, who flourished between the 118th and the 129th Olympiad, and was
                    deeply skilled in Attic antiquities, appears to have been the first who applied
                    himself to this subject; and, on the authority of Suidas we learn that he
                    published <hi rend="italic">’Επίγραμμα™</hi> ’ Aττ&lt;⅛α, or Attic inscriptions
                    of different kinds. He was succeeded by Polemo Graecanicus, the son of Euegetus,
                    and the contemporary of Aristophanes of Byzantium, who, on account of his
                    indefatigable study of inscriptions, was denominated ∑∙∏1λoκa7rαj. His principal

                    existed a repository or collection of confiscated goods, arranged according to a
                    method copied from the inscriptions, and that this fact was known both to
                    Athenaeus and to Pollux. The book of Heliodorus, <hi rend="italic

                    Lastly, Craterus Macedo, whom Niebuhr considers to have been the brother of
                    Antigonus Gonatas, son of Craterus and Phila, published <hi rend="italic"

                    sought to confirm public transactions by extracts of decrees and other
                    documents, the greater part of which he, doubtless, derived from inscriptions,
                    whilst as to the remainder, it was in all probability obtained from the Attic
                    rolls or registers. From this collection of Craterus, indeed, and from others of
                    a similar description, derived from the same sources, those who have preserved
                    to us the Attic decrees copied the documents which we find embodied in their
                    works; and to it also may be referred the greater part of the decrees inserted
                    by the orators, particularly those cited by Demosthenes in his celebrated
                    oration for the crown.</p>
                <p>The first modern work on inscriptions was that of Cyria-cus Anconitanus, who, in
                    the early part of the fifteenth century, applied himself to collect those
                    remains which had escaped the ravages of the barbarous ages, and who, whatever
                    some critics may allege to the contrary, displayed equal diligence and fidelity
                    in the execution of this laborious undertaking. He was succeeded, at intervals,
                    by a long series of learned men, extending downwards even to our own time, who
                    devoted their talents and industry to the collecting, interpreting, and
                    illustrating of the monumental remains of antiquity. Amongst these a
                    distinguished place must be assigned to Gruter, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum</hi> (Heidelberg, 1601, in folio) is
                    still a work of high importance. It is an immense collection of Greek and Latin
                    inscriptions, which having been commenced by Smetius, was considerably augmented
                    by Gruter, who subjoined to it the <hi rend="italic">Notae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romanorum veterum Tulli Tironis</hi><hi rend="italic">et Annoei Senecae,</hi> a
                    work which has since been much surpassed. Gruter was followed by Reinesius, who
                    compiled another large volume of inscriptions; and Reinesius was succeeded by
                    Fabretti, who also published at Rome, in 1609, a large volume, in which he
                    corrected numerous errors that had escaped preceding antiquarians, and added a
                    number of inscriptions which they had omitted. The next collection which
                    appeared was that of Graevius, in three volumes folio; a work of extensive
                    erudition, and, in all respects, more complete than any which had preceded it.
                    In the course of the last century, Scipio Maffei, a man of various learning, and
                    eminently skilled in this branch of archaeology, undertook to make a more
                    complete collection than had yet appeared of Greek and Roman inscriptions, the
                    former of which he proposed to include in the first volume of his work; but
                    after the expenditure of much labour and research, he found that the enterprise
                    exceeded in magnitude his powers of execution, and at length, in his old age,
                    abandoned it in despair. The project of Carcanius, who meditated an universal
                    collection of inscriptions, proved equally abortive; as did also that of
                    Raponus, a man who, by his knowledge of Greek, was not unequal to the task,
                    though he published only one commentation on Greek inscriptions, written in
                    indifferent Latin. The first volume of Boeckh’s splendid work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Groecarum,</hi> in folio, was published at Berlin in 1828, and at once
                    established the author’s claim to rank in the very first class of scholars and
                    critics. It is indeed a masterpiece of learning, research, critical sagacity,
                    and philosophical acuteness; nor, in point of typographical elegance and
                    accuracy, is it equalled, or perhaps even approached, by any work which has yet
                    appeared on the subject. This volume is divided into six parts, which treat
                    respectively, of, 1. <hi rend="italic">Tituli antiquissima Scripturae</hi><hi

                    >Thessalicae.</hi> Of the second volume, only a small portion has as yet been
                    published. Boeckh has drawn his materials not only from the larger collections
                    of Gruter,. Reinesius, Spohn, Fabretti, Muratori Donius, Donatus, and others,
                    but also from diaries, catalogues and descriptions of museums, itineraries, in a
                    word, from books of every kind; and he acknowledges having been aided in his
                    inquiries at the commencement of his undertaking by Bekker, Buttmann, Niebuhr,
                    and Schleiermacher, as well as by Gerhard, Kliitze, Müller, Bischoff, Steinhart,
                    and other young men who have since distinguished themselves by their erudition.

                    interpolated, the reader is referred to the general preface, which is full of
                    curious and original learning.</p>
                <p>Those persons who desire to study the Roman inscriptions, may consult any of the
                    large collections already referred to; and they will also do well to bestow a
                    careful perusal on Funccius <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine,
                    Pueritia, et Adolescentia</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguae Latinae</hi> (Francfort,
                    1720, in small 4to), a work of great learning, ingenuity, and research, in which
                    the progress of the Latin language from infancy to maturity is distinctly
                    traced, and appropriately illustrated. This magnificent idiom, which was
                    gradually formed and perfected by grafting on the rude original stock of an
                    uncouth and barbarous dialect successive improvements, suggested by converse
                    with a refined people, who had made considerable advances in civilization,
                    whilst Rome remained in a state of comparative barbarism, and which derived
                    nearly all its peculiar excellences of form, structure, and expression, from the
                    transfusion, partly of the vocabulary, and partly of the spirit of the ancient
                    Greek, presents altogether one of the most interesting subjects of inquiry in
                    the annals of philology; and it is chiefly by the aid of inscriptions that such
                    an investigation can be successfully prosecuted. The history of the language, in
                    short, reflects, like a glass, that of the progress of social and intellectual
                    improvement. With regard to ancient Roman numismatics, the best manual, perhaps,
                    which has yet appeared on the subject, is the work of Μ. Hennin (Paris, 1830, in
                    two vols. 8vo), containing the elements of the science, and the nomenclatures,
                    with an indication of the degrees of rarity of the antique monies and medals,
                    and tables of their actual values. The first volume treats of the origin of
                    monies, an invention which followed the introduction of commerce by exchange; of
                    the epochs distinguishable in the style of the art, the legend, the form of the
                    characters, and the metal employed in the coins; of the titles and functions of
                    the persons entrusted with the direction of the fabrication of coins; of the
                    materials employed in ancient coins and medals, their names, values, weights,
                    dimensions, inscriptions or legends, and dies, with the method of detecting
                    spurious medals; and, lastly, of the history of numismatical science. The second
                    volume is occupied with four nomenclatures, which comprehend the whole of
                    numismatics. The first is that of peoples, cities, and kings, arranged in the
                    geographical order adopted in the cabinets; the second is that of the Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the third is that of the medals of
                    Roman families; and the fourth is that of the Roman emperors, of the Caesars and
                    the Tyrants, classed in chronological order. Each nomenclature is accompanied
                    with a table of the value of the medals, which, however, is not remarkable for
                    its accuracy. The works of Jobert, Patin, and Mangeart, though they contain
                    excellent things, are antiquated; the Introduction of Millin, the Summary of
                    Champollion-Figeac in the Portable Encyclopaedia, and the Essay on the science
                    of Medals by Dumersan, in the Numismatics of Anacharsis, are merely abridgments,
                    which can scarcely satisfy those who desire to make themselves thoroughly
                    masters of the subject.</p>

                <p>As to the study of inscriptions, little need be said to shew its indispensable
                    importance to the historian and philosopher, as well as to the antiquary and
                    philologist. The records thus preserved contain much information which is not to
                    be found in ancient authors; and they afford the best tests by which the
                    accuracy of historians may be tried, their fidelity proved or impeached, their
                    errors corrected, and their defects supplied. They determine dates, establish
                    facts, and throw light on the modes and habits of civil life, as well as the
                    observances of religion; whilst in many of them the most important historical
                    documents have been preserved. In fact, it is only necessary to consult the
                    Roman History of Niebuhr, to be satisfied as to the importance of inscriptions,
                    considered as materials of history, and how greatly they may contribute, when
                    skilfully interpreted and rightly understood, to elucidate obscurities, dispel
                    doubts, correct mistakes, and reduce to their true value the fabulous legends of
                    romancing chroniclers and poetical historians. Again, it is in inscriptions that
                    the various phases, changes, and transitions of language are reflected as in a
                    glass; it is by means of them alone that we are enabled to trace the progressive
                    steps by which it advanced from its primitive state, characterized by a rude
                    simplicity, to the more refined, perfect, and complicated form which, by a
                    course of gradual improvement, it afterwards attained. The text of the Duilian
                    column, for example, is an invaluable monument to the historian of the Latin
                    language, which it exhibits in a state of transition from the rugged and uncouth
                    form of a barbarous and dissonant dialect, such as that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carmen</hi><hi rend="italic">Saliare</hi> and the Fescennine verses, to the
                    finished regiflarity of structure, and philosophical precision and elegance of
                    arrangement, which we discover in the great writers of after times. As to the
                    learned antiquary, again, he lives, moves, and has his being amidst these
                    interesting monuments of the past; and whilst pursuing his minute
                    investigations, perchance contributes in no unimportant degree to throw a new
                    light on facts of more pith and moment than any of those which more immediately
                    engage his attention. In a word, we may say to the historian, the scholar, and
                    the antiquary, in regard to inscriptions, <hi rend="italic">Nocturna versate
