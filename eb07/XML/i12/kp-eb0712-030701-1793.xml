                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance</hi> is a contract of indemnity, by which one
                    party engages, for a stipulated sum, to insure another a∏∙ainst a risk to which
                    he is exposed. It is of three kinds, viz. Fire, Life, and Marine; all of them
                    producing similar results by very different means. The party who undertakes the
                    risk is called the insurer, assurer, or underwriter, and the party protected by
                    the insurance is called the insured or assured; the sum paid is called the
                    premium, and the instrument containing the contract is termed the policy.</p>
                <p>I.—FIRE INSURANCE.</p>
                <p>This species of insurance has been practised in Great Britain for nearly a
                    century and a half, and is now, notwithstanding the heavy duty imposed upon it,
                    of almost universal use, particularly in our cities and large country towns.
                    Though practised in France, Holland, Austria, and other countries on the
                    Continent, it is not general anywhere except in Great Britain; and in this
                    country fire insurance is not confined to subjects within the realm, or even to
                    our colonies, but is extended to risks of all descriptions, and in every quarter
                    of the world. Indeed, of late years foreign fire insurance has become a most
                    important addition to the extensive transactions of some of the principal London
                    establishments, a very considerable portion of their premiums being derived from
                    insurances effected in other countries.</p>
                <p>Insurance against fire is that contract by which the insurer, in consideration of
                    a certain premium received by him, undertakes to indemnify the insured against
                    all losses o-damage which he may sustain by fire, within a limited period, in
                    his houses, warehouses, merchandise, or other property. Insurances of this
                    description are generally made by joint-stock companies, of which the principal
                    are in London, though there are now several in almost all the large towns
                    throughout the kingdom; and there is scarcely a village in which there arc not
                    some of their branches and agents. Most of these insure at their own risk, and
                    for their own profit; in a few of them, however, called contribution societies,
                    every person insured becomes a proprietor, and participates in the profit or
                    loss of the concern.</p>
                <p>The only society of this description in Scotland is the Friendly Insurance
                    Incorporation, which was also the first established company in this part of the
                    island for insurance against loss by fire. In 1720 there had been some
                    disastrous fires in Edinburgh, by which many individuals sustained great loss of
                    property; and in the same year a meeting of inhabitants took place, for the
                    purpose of founding a society for their mutual protection from loss in cases of
                    fire. A certain per-centage of premium upon the sum insured by each proprietor
                    or contributor was paid for a perpetual insurance on their properties, and these
                    premiums formed the capital stock of the concern. The corporation, however, much
                    more than answered the purpose which those interested in its formation had in
                    view; for, after the payment of all claims for loss, the capital, by judicious
                    management, had accumulated to such an extent, that in 1760 it was resolved no
                    longer to limit the business to Edinburgh and Leith, but to extend it over
                    Scotland, and upon every description of property, on the principles now followed
                    by other insurance companies.</p>
                <p>The rules by which these establishments are governed, and the conditions on which
                    they insure, are made by their own directors; and as a copy of these conditions
                    is printed upon the policy, and forms a part of the contract therein contained,
                    the insured is understood, by his acquiescence, to submit to their proposals,
                    and is fully apprized of those rules, upon the compliance or non-compliance with
                    which, he will or will not be entitled to an indemnity.</p>
                <p>The construction to be put upon the regulations of the various offices has but
                    seldom become the subject of judicial inquiry; and the law of the case, in as
                    far as it has been ascertained by precedent, is of course embraced by all of
                    them.</p>
                <p>1. The insurers must be made fully acquainted with the nature of the risk they
                    arc required to cover. Any misrepresentation in describing the building or
                    goods, or the process of manufacture carried on, whereby the same may be charged
                    at a lower rate of premium than they would otherwise be, invalidates the policy;
                    and if any alteration be made in the state of the building or process of
                    manufacture after the insurance is effected, the insured is required to give due
                    notice thereof to the insurers, as, in default, he will be unable to recover
                    under his policy. Concealment, too, is not less fatal to the contract than
                    positive misrepresentation. A policy was effected at the Phoenix Fire Office on
                    the 25th of July 1814, “on a warehouse in the lower town of Heligoland, for
                    three months, as by letter of 11 th July 1814.” It appeared that the person
                    applying for insurance had two warehouses in Heligoland, one of them separated
                    by another building from a boat-builder’s workshop, in which a fire broke out at
                    seven in the evening of the 11th July, but apparently was almost immediately
                    extinguished. The same evening after this had occurred, the insured wrote to
                    London for a three months’ insurance of L.400 on the warehouse near the
                    boat-builder’s, and L.3500 on coffee therein. The mail was shut; but the master
                    of the packet took the letter to Cuxhaven, and there put it into the
                    post-office. The insurance was effected without any disclosure of what had
                    happened. Early in the morning of the 13th a fire again broke out in the
                    boat-builder’s, and destroyed the adjoining warehouse, with its contents. The
                    jury, though they acquitted the plaintiff of any fraudulent intention, thought
                    that the fire of the 11th ought to have been communicated, and therefore found
                    for the defendant. Bufe <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Turner, 1814.</p>
                <p>2. Nothing can be ιecovered from the insurers in the event of loss, unless the
                    party insuring had an interest or property in the thing insured at the time when
                    the insurance was effected, and when the loss happened. Any trustee, mortgagee,
                    reversioner, factor, or agent, however, has sufficient interest in the goods
                    under his custody to effect a policy of insurance, provided the nature of such
                    interest be distinctly specified at the time of executing such policy. In the
                    same manner, it is customary for hotel and inn-keepers to insure the property of
                    their lodgers; of the masters of boarding-houses to insure that of their
                    scholars; of salesmen and auctioneers to insure merchandise, furniture, &amp;c.
                    whilst about to be disposed of in their premises; and so forth.</p>
                <p>There is reason to believe that frequent frauds are perpetrated by individuals
                    insuring to a large amount property of trifling value; and it is an undoubted
                    fact that fraudulent and excessive claims are of constant occurrence. These have
                    been very much increased by the competition and keenness for business which have
                    existed amongst the offices for some years past. But parties are not always
                    aware, that in tendering such a claim, they are running the risk of <hi
                    rend="italic">forfeiting all right under their policy.</hi> This was decided in
                    1832 in the case of Friedlander <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> the London Assurance
                    Company, where, although it was not denied that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941806" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1806-0308"/>loss and damage had been
                    occasioned by fire, and that not arising from improper means, still, from the
                    extravagance of the claim made by the pursuer, it was held to be a fraudulent
                    valuation, and a verdict was consequently given against him. No reliance can be
                    placed on the oath of a suspected claimant; if a man make out a fraudulent
                    claim, he will not be very scrupulous in swearing to its correctness.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, where a loss has occurred, and there is no suspicion of any
                    unfair practice on the part of the insured, it is the duty of the insurers to be
                    generous and liberal. The insured is always put to much inconvenience, and
                    frequently to serious loss beyond what he can claim for under his policy; and
                    therefore a fair sufferer ought to be promptly and cheerfully settled with.</p>
                <p>3. In general there is an exception in favour of the insurers in cases of fire
                    occasioned by “invasion, foreign enemy, civil commotion, riot, or any military
                    or usurped power whatever.” The terms “civil commotion and riot” were introduced
                    in consequence of its having been found that the term “usurped power” means an
                    invasion from abroad, or an internal rebellion, not the power of a common mob.
                    The offices likewise, with propriety, decline paying losses on hay or corn
                    occasioned by spontaneous combustion, though they make good the loss of any
                    other property in consequence of such fire; it being the interest of the
                    community at large to put down all such occasions of loss as are contained in
                    the former, and negligence generally being the cause that damage is sustained in
                    the latter. The offices, however, pay all loss by fire occasioned by lightning,
                    as well as, <hi rend="italic">primo</hi><hi rend="italic">loco,</hi> all losses
                    caused by incendiarism, though in this last case they have a claim on the county
                    for indemnification.</p>
                <p>4. “Books of accounts, written securities, bills, bonds, tallies, and ready
                    money,” are naturally not the proper subjects of insurance, and are therefore
                    excepted by all the offices; many adding to this list “gunpowder.”</p>
                <p>5. China, glass, crockery, and mirrors, are usually made the subject of a
                    distinct item in a policy of insurance; and, from their fragile nature, are
                    always charged as doubly hazardous. The rate for “curiosities” is the same.
                    Pictures and prints are generally taken at single hazardous; but when a very
                    valuable collection is insured, the offices usually require a catalogue, with a
                    distinct value attached to each. Jewels, trinkets, mathematical and musical
                    instruments, are by some offices also required to be valued separately, and in
                    that case are charged single hazardous. Generally, however, these are considered
                    as common risks, and are included along with printed books, linen, and liquors,
                    in one item with “household furniture.”</p>
                <p>6. It often occurs that no one office will insure to the full amount required by
                    an individual who has large property; and in such cases the party, to cover his
                    whole interest, is obliged to insure at different offices. But in order to
                    prevent the frauds that might be practised by insuring the full value in various
                    offices, there is, in the proposals issued by all the companies, an article
                    which declares that persons insuring must give notice of any other insurance
                    made on their behalf elsewhere upon the same houses or goods, that the same may
                    be specified and allowed by indorsement on the policy, in order that each office
                    may bear its rateable proportion of any loss that may happen; and unless such
                    notice be given of each insurance to the office where another insurance is made
                    on the same effects, the insurance made without such notice will be void.
                    Different people, however, may have different interests in the same property,
                    and each may insure his own interest without communication with the others.</p>
                <p>7. An important condition in the proposals is that referring to the proof of
                    loss. Most offices make it a condition that the individual claiming shall
                    procure a certificate under the hands of some reputable householders, and
                    minister of the parish, to the satisfaction of the company, importing that they
                    are acquainted with the character and circumstances of the person insured, and
                    do know, or verily believe that he really, and by misfortune, without any kind
                    of fraud or evil practice, has sustained, by such fire, loss and damage to the
                    amount therein mentioned. This condition has given rise to a great deal of
                    discussion in the courts; but it has been finally settled, that the procuring of
                    the certificate is a condition <hi rend="italic">precedent</hi> to the payment
                    of any loss, and that its being wrongfully refused will not excuse the want of
                    it.</p>
                <p>8. On bespeaking policies, the insured are required either to pay the premium, or
                    make a deposit for the same; the Phoenix and most other offices conditioning,
                    that unless an interim-receipt for such payment has been issued, either by the
                    office or one of its agents, no order for insurance shall be held as in force.
                    Fifteen days are allowed at the expiration of each year for the payment of the
                    premium for the next year in succession, upon all annual policies, and others
                    for a longer period; and, provided the premium be paid within that time, the
                    insured is considered as under the protection of the office. But the Phoenix and
                    other offices always expressly declare, in all policies for a shorter period
                    than a year, that the insurance ceases at six o’clock in the evening of the day
                    mentioned therein. If, however, either the insurers or the insured intimate,
                    during the continuance of a policy, their intention of dropping the contract at
                    the expiration of the year, it has been decided, that a loss happening within
                    the fifteen days after the end of the year does not in such a case fall under
                    the contract.</p>
                <p>9. A policy of insurance is not in its nature assignable, nor can it in England
                    be transferred without the express consent of the office. In Scotland every
                    pecuniary obligation is assignable; but there being something of the nature of a
                    <hi rend="italic">delectus personae</hi> in this contract, the power of
                    assignment is, by the terms of the policy, put under particular restraints.
                    λVhen, however, any person dies, his interest remains in his executors or
                    administrators respectively, who succeed or become entitled to the property,
                    provided such representatives procure their right to be indorsed on the policy.
                    In the same way, no one who sustains a loss on stock or merchandise in premises
                    to which he has removed since his policy was extended, has a valid claim, if
                    such change be not indorsed on the policy in question. On bankruptcy the
                    creditors are entitled to the full benefit of the policy, provided the premium
                    has been duly paid up.</p>
                <p>10. The insurers are liable, not only for loss by burning, but for all damage or
                    injury caused by the accident, as well as for all reasonable charges attending
                    the removal of articles which may never have been touched by the fire; as, for
                    instance, in the case of the gable of a house falling across a street, and
                    damaging the property on the opposite side, or in the case of destruction done
                    to fine goods by the smoke of a conflagration in the vicinity, or from the water
                    which may have been thrown about in endeavouring to extinguish it. In such cases
                    the insurers are distinctly liable; but as their contract is one of
                    indemnification only “for loss or damage by fire,” there must have been actual
                    ignition to entitle the insured to recover, it not being sufficient that there
                    has been a great and injurious increase of heat, whilst nothing has taken fire
                    which ought not to be on fire. For example, in one case of a sugar-house, in
                    which, for the purposes of the manufacture, heat was communicated to each of the
                    separate stories by a chimney, forming nearly one side of the house, at the top
                    of which there was a register; the neglect to open this register on one occasion
                    caused an excessive heat, which blackened the walls, and injured the sugar in
                    different states of preparation; but the damage thus sustained was held not to
                    come under the spirit of the contract.</p>
                <p> II. The loss by fire is scarcely ever a total loss, and the valuation in the
                    policy is only the fixing of a maximum, bevond<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941819" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1819-0309"/> which the underwriters are
                    not to be liable, and not the conclusive ascertainment of the value to be
                    replaced. There is no such thing in this contract as the “average” in marine
                    insurance; the amount insured is payable to its full extent, without (unless
                    otherwise stipulated) any reference to the value of the subject insured, either
                    in itself, or in comparison with such parts of it as have been saved; at least
                    such is the practice in Great Britam, but on the Continent all policies are
                    subject to average. The loss is generally settled by arbitration, and a clause
                    of reference is consequently inserted in most policies. The company, however,
                    generally retain the right of either reinstating the subject lost or damaged, or
                    of paying its value.</p>
                <p>Insurances are generally divided into <hi rend="italic">common, hazardous, double
                    hazardous,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">special.</hi> The charge for insuring
                    property of the first description is now usually Is. 6d. per cent., the second
                    2s. 6d., the third 4s. 6d., whilst the fourth, as its name denotes, comprehends
                    those extra risks which are made the subject of special agreement between the
                    parties.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible to form a correct classification of the risks
                    comprehended under these heads, as the higher risks not only vary most
                    materially in themselves, but in one large town it is well known that losses are
                    constantly occurring upon a species of risk which in another is rarely or never
                    the cause of a fire. But as the law of average is a fundamental principle in
                    insurance, and can only be derived from observations made on a very large scale,
                    the tables published by most offices are formed principally from experience.</p>

                <p>The statute 55 Geo. III. c. 184, imposes on every policy a duty of one shilling,
                    and also the annual sum of three shillings for every L.100 insured for a year,
                    and according to that rate for any fractional part of L.100 insured, and for any
                    fractional part of a year.</p>
                <p>.All property excepting farm stock and public hospitals is liable to this duty.
                    It is collected by the offices along with their premiums, and they are allowed a
                    drawback of five per cent, upon it for their trouble and expense in so doing.
                    From the last returns, it appears that this duty amounts to nearly L.900,000 per
                    annum, which shows that British property to the extent of at least six hundred
                    millions sterling must be covered by our insurance offices.</p>

                <p>This, however, affords no criterion of the actual amount of risk undertaken by
                    these offices. In the first place, because the duty on farm-stock having been
                    repealed in 1833, that very extensive description of risk is not included in
                    this calculation; and, secondly, because some of the offices underwrite foreign
                    risks to a very large amount, and these are equally, by act of parliament,
                    exempt from duty. Perhaps, therefore, the enormous sum of one thousand millions
                    sterling does not greatly exceed the amount of property insured by our British
                    fire establishments.</p>
                <p>The advantages of fire insurance are too prominent to require any description
                    here. It affords great comfort to individuals, and often preserves whole
                    families from poverty and ruin. The destruction of a mansion-house, or the
                    conflagration of a cotton-mill, is a calamity that would press heavily on even
                    the richest. But when distributed amongst several individuals, each feels it
                    proportionally less; and provided the number of those amongst whom it is
                    distributed be very considerable, it occasions no sensible inconvenience to any
                    one in particular. Hence the advantage of combining to lessen the injury arising
                    from the accidental destruction of property; and it is the diffusion of the risk
                    of loss over a wide surface, and its valuation, that forms the employment of
                    those engaged in the business.</p>
                <p>II. LIFE ASSURANCE.</p>
                <p>The insurance, or assurance on lives, as it is now most generally termed, is the
                    insurance of a certain sum of money to be paid in the event of a person named
                    being alive at a certain time, or dying within a certain time, or to be paid
                    within a certain time after the death of a person named, whenever that may
                    happen.</p>
                <p>Life assurance is comparatively of recent date in this country; for, although the
                    Amicable Society was incorporated by charter as early as the reign of Queen
                    Anne, it was not till the commencement of the present century that its
                    beneficial effects came to be felt, and that as a business it was carried to so
                    great an extent. The precarious dependence of a numerous family upon the life of
                    a single person naturally induces the desire of seeking some protection against
                    a calamity which, sooner or later, must befall them; and this, probably,
                    suggested the first idea of insurances upon lives, as an expedient by which <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192941845" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1845-0311"/> a pecuniary
                    indemnity, at least, might be secured to the sufferers, sufficient to rescue
                    them from the poverty and distress which otherwise awaited them. All
                    professional persons, or those living on salaries or wages, such as lawyers,
                    physicians, military and naval officers, clerks in public or private offices,
                    &amp;c., whose incomes must of course terminate with their lives, and many
                    others who are either not possessed of capital, or cannot dispose of their
                    capital at pleasure, must naturally be desirous of providing, as far as they may
                    be able, for the comfortable subsistence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their
                    families in the event of their death. Take, for example, a physician or lawyer,
                    without fortune, but making perhaps L.1'000 or L.2000 a year by his business,
                    and suppose that he marries and has a family. If this individual attain to the
                    average duration of human life, he may accumulate such a fortune as will provide
                    for the adequate support of his family at his death. But who can presume to say
                    that such will be the case; that he will not form one of the many exceptions to
                    the general rule? And suppose that he were hurried into an untimely grave, his
                    family would necessarily be destitute. Now it is against such calamitous
                    contingencies that life assurance is intended to provide. An individual
                    possessed <hi rend="italic">of</hi> an income terminating at his death, agrees
                    to pay a certain sum annually to an insurance office; and this office binds
                    itself to pay to his family, at his death, a sum equivalent (under deduction of
                    the expenses of management and the profits of the insurers) to what these annual
                    contributions, accumulated at compound interest, would amount to, supposing the
                    insured to reach the common and average term of human life. Though he were to
                    die the day after the insurance was effected, his family would be as amply
                    provided for, as it is likely they would be by his accumulations, were his life
                    of the ordinary duration. In all cases, indeed, in which those insured die
                    before attaining an average age, their gain is obvious. But even in those cases
                    in which their lives are prolonged beyond the ordinary term, they are not
                    losers; they then merely pay for security which they could not otherwise have
                    possessed. During the whole period from the time τvhen they effect their
                    insurances, down to the time when they arrive at the mean duration of human
                    life, they are protected against the risk of dying without leaving their
                    families sufficiently provided for; and the sum which they pay after having
                    passed this mean term, is nothing more than a fair compensation for the security
                    they previously enjoyed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    professional men, men in trade and business, and generally to all liferenters,
                    life insurance is therefore peculiarly suited. By the same means also facilities
                    are afforded for raising money on loan, creditors may in many cases obtain
                    ultimate payment of their debts, and provisions in marriage settlements are
                    secured</p>
                <p>Policies of this kind are most frequently granted by companies, on account of the
                    greater security there is in large bodies of men, than it is easily possible to
                    be attained by an individual when the policy maybe oflong continuance.</p>
                <p>The premium of assurance is either a gross sum paid at once, or a sum paid down
                    on the day that the contract is made, with an obligation to pay the same sum
                    annually during the existence of the policy. The latter is the more general mode
                    of assurance.</p>
                <p>V hen a party is desirous of effecting an assurance, he receives from the office
                    of the company a printed paper called a declaration, which he fills up with the
                    name of the party to be assured, his age, the place and time of his birth, and
                    place of his present residence, with certain particulars as to his health. To
                    corroborate the statement, references are given to two or more persons well
                    acquainted with the party, one of whom must be a medical man. The reasons for
                    these precautions are obvious.</p>
                <p>When the declaration has been thus completed, the person by whom the assurance is
                    made makes his appearance at the office <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the company,
                    where he is interrogated as to the general state of his health, and a minute is
                    entered in their books accordingly. The letter of the referees, with the
                    declaration, are subsequently laid before the directors, who, from these
                    documents, and information frequently derived from other sources, form their
                    decision. Ön the payment of the premium a receipt is given, containing the
                    number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the policy, which is then made out according to
                    the declaration, signed by a certain number of directors, and delivered to the
                    other party interested in it. If the person on whose life the assurance is made
                    cannot appear before the directors, or any one appointed by them for that
                    purpose, an additional sum is frequently charged for non-appearance. There is
                    also a duty to be paid to government on each policy, in addition to the first
                    year’s premium; but the premium only is named in the policy, as on the future
                    payment of this sum its existence depends.</p>
                <p>A policy is assignable, and frequently forms a security for sums advanced, and
                    not unfrequently becomes an object of sale. In these cases the holder of the
                    policy pays the future premiums, and the advantage <hi rend="italic">of a</hi>
                    purchaser consists in holding a policy at a less premium than he must have paid
                    at the present age of the party on whose life the assurance was made. Thus,
                    supposing a policy to have been granted for the payment of L.1000 at the death
                    of a party aged between tliirty and thirty-one when the policy was made; if sold
                    when the party is between fifty and fifty-one, the purchaser will have to pay
                    L.26. 2s. 6d. annually during the existence of the policy; whereas, if he had
                    taken out a policy at the present age of the party, his premium would be L.45.
                    Ils. 8d.; and for the difference between these two sums, namely, L.19. 9s. 2d.,
                    a price is fixed on. The public sale of a policy, however, possesses this
                    disadvantage, that the bidders are frequently unacquainted with the person on
                    whose life the assurance is made; and, being liable to trouble and expense,
                    toascertain that he is alive at each payment of the premium, must require a
                    deduction on this account, from what they might otherwise presume to be a
                    compensation for the difference between the two premiums. Policies are in
                    consequence sold at very disproportionate prices; and it is evident, that a
                    policy must be most valuable to the party insured, and less so to others,
                    according to their convenience of paying the premiums, and receiving proper
                    information respecting the party in whose life and death they are
                    interested.</p>
                <p>On the death of the party on whom the claim depends, certain documents are
                    required, such as the register of the burial of the deceased, and references to
                    the medical persons or others who attended him in his last illness; and, if he
                    effected the policy himself, the probate of his will, or, if it has been
                    assigned to another, a copy of the assignment. The nature of his death must also
                    be ascertained; as, in ease of any contravention of the conditions of assurance,
                    the policy is vitiated. In the interval between the notice of the party’s death,
                    and the time assigned for the payment of the claim, which by most of the offices
                    is fixed at three months, due investigation is made, and, every thing being
                    found satisfactory, the claimant brings with him the policy, and a receipt for
                    the sum claimed, which is immediately paid.</p>
                <p>When a claim is payable in the event of a person being alive at a certain time,
                    his appearance before the directors is requisite, or sufficient proof must be
                    given that he was alive at the time defined by the policy. Policies depending<pb

                    alive at a certain time are very rare, and chiefly confined to endowments for
                    children, in which case the paymentof a gross sum down, or of an annual payment
                    till the child attains the age of 14 or 21, secures to that child, at that age,
                    the sum named in the policy.</p>
                <p>For adjusting the premium to be paid according to the age of the party on whom
                    the assurance is made, tables of rates have been formed, and those derived from
                    the registers of mortality at Northampton and Carlisle are in general adopted.
                    Tables of the duration of human life have also been made from observations in
                    various other places; amongst which the most distinguished are those of De
                    Parcieux, Kerseboom, Aikin, the registers of Sweden, Finland, and London; and
                    one published within these few years by the Equitable Society, founded on the
                    experience of that well-known establishment.</p>
                <p>In the formation of these tables, a vulgar error is entertained, that they are
                    dependent on chance; for life being uncertain, every attempt to regulate
                    premiums is of no avail. It is true that life cannot be reduced to a certain
                    scale, that is, if a thousand persons are named, it is impossible to state how
                    many will die in each year, till the whole cease to exist. But if the
                    observations are extended over a very large surface, and very numerous data are
                    collected, the most accurate calculations may be made of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >probable</hi> duration of any one life.</p>
                <p>After a scale of life has been adopted, a table of premiums is derived from it by
                    strict mathematical calculation, and in a very ingenious manner. Suppose the
                    premium for a person of a certain age to be known, then the premium for a person
                    of one year younger, being compounded of the premium for one year and the
                    present value of the above premium, is easily calculated from the table of
                    lives. The rule is this: Multiply the premium on the oldest life into the number
                    of persons alive in the tables of that age, and divide by the number of persons
                    of the younger age alive in the tables. This sum discounted for a year gives the
                    premium for assuring the desired sum at the end of the year. Then multiply the
                    sum to be assured into the number of persons of the younger age that die
                    according to the tables in a year, and divide by the number of persons alive at
                    that age, and this sum discounted for a year is the assurance of the sum for the
                    first year, and, consequently, the two sums added together give the desired
                    premium. Now, as the oldest person in the scale of life dies in the ensuing
                    year, the premium on him is evidently the sum to be paid discounted for one
                    year, and thence the premium for the age below is ascertained by the above rule;
                    and so of every age in succession. No errors can be committed without detection,
                    as every step is checked by a similar table drawn out for the value of an
                    annuity at each age.</p>
                <p>In a similar manner, tables are formed for the assurance of a sum payable at the
                    death of one out of two persons, or at the death of the survivor of two persons,
                    or at the death of one on the contingency of his surviving another, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>The above rules give tables of rates for the payment of a gross premium; but as
                    it is generally more convenient to pay an annual sum equivalent to it, a table
                    of rates is made for this case, and it is formed by dividing the gross premium
                    by the value of an annuity upon each age added to unity. If the annual premium
                    were paid at the end of the year, the addition of unity would be unnecessary;
                    but a policy is not granted till one premium is paid, and hence the necessity of
                    the addition is obvious.</p>
                <p>As premiums are settled from a fixed table of observations on life, it is evident
                    that, as deaths never happen exactly in the order prescribed in the tables,
                    there must arise either a surplus or deficiency of capital for the payment of
                    the sums assured. From the care which has hitherto been taken in the choice of
                    lives, and the high premium which the offices have been enabled to demand all
                    the old establishments have accumulated very large capitals; consequently, we
                    believe it has never occurred that the proprietors have been called upon to make
                    up a deficiency. It is in the management of this capital, or surplus, that life
                    assurance companies differ. One of them, termed Proprietary Companies, undertake
                    to pay <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> sums upon the death of the individual
                    assuring with them; the profits made by such companies being wholly divided
                    amongst th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> proprietors, their premiums are
                    generally, or at least ought to be, lower than those of others. Of this class
                    are the Pelican, Sun, and others, principally of old standing. The second class
                    of life assurance companies are the Participating, which, instead of
                    undertaking, like the former, to pay certain specified sums upon the death of
                    the assured, allow the latter to participate, to a certain degree, alorw with
                    the proprietors, in the profits made by the business. The mode in which this
                    class allot their profits is not the same in all, as we shall immediately see;
                    but in general their premiums are somewhat higher than those of the preceding,
                    and are made to depend in a considerable degree on the amount of the profits set
                    apart for the insurers. The Alliance, Guardian, and Rock, as well as a large
                    portion of the new companies, are of this description; and latterly a
                    considerable number of them have united their participating with their
                    proprietary business, by publishing different scales of premiums to suit the
                    wishes and intentions of individuals assuring. The third class are Mutual
                    Assurance Companies, of which the Equitable of London is the groundwork and
                    model. In this sort of company there is no proprietary body distinct from the
                    assured. The latter, after deducting the expense of management, share amongst
                    themselves the whole profits of the concern; and therefore, as all the surplus
                    returns to themselves, their scales of premiums are naturally higher than that
                    of either of the foregoing.</p>
                <p>In the two last classes, where the surplus is made advantageous to the assured,
                    either a sum is at certain periods added to each policy, or the premium is
                    diminished. In both cases, a valuation is made of all the annual premiums, with
                    the past and future expected accumulations, and also of the claims upon every
                    policy. It is requisite, however, that the utmost care should be taken to secure
                    to each policy the sum named in it, with every addition made to it; and hence a
                    certain portion, generally a third or a fifth, of the surplus is constantly
                    retained to guard against possible contingencies. This reservation occasions a
                    singular anomaly in mutual assurance companies. In these all are partners, being
                    guarantees to one another for the payment of their respective claims. The
                    surplus arising from the excess of premiums, with their accumulations above the
                    claims, evidently belongs to the whole of the company, and consequently each
                    partner is entitled to a portion of it. But of this surplus, a third or fifth
                    being constantly reserved, and each person at his death ceasing to be a partner,
                    every person leaves behind him a portion for his successors. The third or fifth
                    is therefore, we may say, without an owner; for a partner has not a right to it
                    during his life, and his heirs or assignees have not a claim to it after his
                    death.</p>

                    an annual premium for a limited number of years, instead of one to continue
                    annually during life, may do so on the following terms.</p>

                <p>The advantage to a person assuring in any one office as compared with another,
                    must plainly depend on a comparison between the premiums demanded, the
                    conditions of the policy, and, above all, the security which it holds out. Where
                    it is wished to assure on a certain life for a limited period, the party having
                    no interest in procuring a larger sum, in case of death, than the amount
                    assured, makes his application to that office where he can get it effected at
                    the lowest premium. Such an office will be a Proprietary one. The principal
                    advantage of such companies is, that individuals dealing with them know exactly
                    what they are about. They know the precise premium they will have to pay, and
                    the exact amount of the sums that will accrue to their assignees at their
                    decease. The subscribed capital of such associations as the Pelican, Sun, Royal
                    Exchange, &amp;c. and the wealth of their partners, afford unquestionable
                    security; and, unless some very unprecedented and unlooked-for change in the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> condition of the country take place, they may reckon
                    with certainty on the terms of the policy being fulfilled to the letter. If, on
                    the other hand, the individual be desirous of leaving as large an amount as he
                    can afford to assure to his family, and more especially if be happen to be a
                    young and a healthy life, he will generally prefer the conditions of a
                    Participating or a Mutual Assurance society. The subscribed capital and fortunes
                    of the former of these afford a guarantee on which the public may depend, in
                    dealing with any respectable society of this sort; whilst, by receiving a share
                    of the profits, the assured gain by the flourishing condition of the
                    association, and it is of less consequence to them though the premium should be
                    too high.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> profits of Mutual Assurance societies being
                    divided amongst the assured, render such establishments of very great value,
                    particularly to young lives; instances having frequently occurred of more than
                    double the amount assured on one life being paid at the termination of a long
                    standing policy in one of these societies. It has been objected to them, that
                    every one being a partner of the concern, has not only his own life assured, but
                    is part assurer of the lives of all the other members, and may, in this
                    capacity, incur some serious responsibilities; but in this there is a material
                    mistake, since it is a stipulation in the contract of copartnery of every such
                    society, that the funds of the society alone shall be liable for their losses;
                    and thus, though there may be a distant possibility of the sums assured not
                    being paid in full, it is directly undertaken by every individual entering the
                    society, that no claim shall be made on his account upon any of the other
                    members. Moreover, when it is considered that the premiums required by all the
                    assurance companies are very much higher than the risk demands, and that those
                    of Mutual Assurance societies are among the highest, there is little danger,
                    when due precaution is taken in accepting lives, of any loss being incurred by
                    partaking of the benefits of this description of society. This will be placed in
                    a still clearer view by the perusal of the following table from Mr Babbage’s
                    work on life assurance, exhibiting the profit per cent, on the premiums of
                    several English offices, on an assurance on a life aged forty-six, which is
                    about one year less than the average age of persons assuring.</p>

                <p>The most important points to be attended to in this description of insurance are
                    the following.</p>
                <p>1. No life assurance can be effected without an interest in the life. This was
                    enacted to prevent gambling transactions, by stat. 14 Geo. III. c. 48, sect. 1,
                    which declares that “no insurance shall be made by any person or persons, bodies
                    politic or corporate, on the life or lives of any person or persons, or any
                    other event or events whatsoever, where the person or persons for whose use or
                    benefit, or on whose account, such policy or policies shall be made, <hi
                    rend="italic">shall have no interest,</hi> or by way of gaining or wagering; and
                    that every insurance made contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act
                    shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.” Under this act
                    it has been found, that though a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> creditor has a
                    sufficient interest in the life of his debtor to enable him to effect a valid
                    assurance on such life; still, that in the case of money won at play, the
                    creditor has not an assurable interest in the life of the individual who lost
                    the money to him.</p>
                <p>2. Life assurances are always assignable; indeed were they otherwise, assurance
                    on lives would lose much of its utility. It is an every-day occurrence for a
                    debtor to open a policy on his own life, and to assign it in security; and there
                    can be no ground for pleading the extinction of the policy on his payment of the
                    debt; for the benefit of the assurance still belongs to him, and he may make it
                    the means of credit on another occasion, or dispose of it by settlement or
                    otherwise. Assignment in sequestration carries a policy of life assurance; and
                    if the debtor has secretly disposed of it after his bankruptcy, the person to
                    whom it has been assigned will be bound to return any money drawn under it as
                    For the use of the creditors. In the case of Schondler <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Wace, the bankrupt held a policy upon his own life, which, after bankruptcy, he
                    sold to Wace for a lottery ticket. He died, and Wace received the sum assured.
                    The assignees under the commission brought an action for recovery, and it was
                    found that this <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941923" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1923-0317"
                    />was a possibility of benefit to which they were entitled, as part of the
                    bankrupt’s effects; the defendant having a right, however, to deduct his
                    outlay.</p>
                <p>3. As the conditions in fire insurance form part of the contract; so, in life
                    assurance, the declaration made previously to the policy being extended, is
                    considered as part and parcel thereof. In this declaration it is stated that he
                    whose life is to be assured “has no disorder tending to the shortening of life
                    ;” but this does not imply that he is free from all complaints, provided he be
                    in a reasonably good state of health. Nor does it appear to be sufficient
                    evidence of the tendency of the disorder to shorten life, that the person had it
                    at a former period, and afterwards died of it, if free from disease at the time
                    of assuring.</p>
                <p>4. The death must happen within a limited time, otherwise the assurers are not
                    liable; and there is no doubt, if an individual whose life is assured for one
                    year be fatally wounded during the existence of that policy, but linger till
                    after the term limited in the contract, that his executors have no claim. When,
                    however, an assurance of this description exists on a man’s life who goes to
                    sea, and the vessel in which he sailed is never afterwards heard of, a question
                    arises for a jury to decide from the circumstances produced in evidence.</p>
                <p>5. In almost every life policy there are several exceptions in limitation of the
                    risk. These generally are, death abroad or at sea; entering into naval or
                    military service without the previous consent of the company; death by suicide;
                    death by the hand of justice; and, in some offices, also death by duelling. The
                    three last, however, do not apply where the assurance is effected on the life of
                    another.</p>
                <p>6. The premium on life assurance is not returnable. If a person whose life was
                    assured should commit suicide or be put to death by the hand of the executioner
                    the next day after the risk commenced, there would be no return of premium.</p>
                <p>7. Life assurances, when a loss happens upon them, must be paid according to the
                    tenor of the agreement, in the full sum assured, as this sort of policy, from
                    its nature, being on the life or death of man, does not admit of the distinction
                    between total and partial losses.</p>
                <p>HI.—MARINE INSURANCE.</p>
                <p>Most persons are in some degree acquainted with fire and life insurances; the
                    security which they afford to individuals and families is a comfort which no one
                    is willing to dispense withal. Hence the great increase in modern times of
                    companies professing to afford this security; and hence the knowledge on the
                    part of the public generally, of the nature and principles of the engagements
                    into which these companies enter. But marine insurance is a subject of immediate
                    interest only to merchants and shipowners; and in times of peace it is, even to
                    them, of a much less engrossing nature than during the bustle and excitement of
                    a Continental or an American war.</p>
                <p>It is used as a means of indemnification for loss or damage to ships or goods
                    whilst at sea, and that arising either from the elements or the enemy. From its
                    nature there is no doubt of its being of a much more ancient date than either of
                    the preceding, its introduction having generally been attributed to the Lombards
                    and Venetians, the great carrying traders of Europe during the thirteenth,
                    fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. On the Continent it has consequently been
                    longer practised, and is there much better understood than either fire or life
                    insurance. The famous <hi rend="italic">Ordonnance</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Marine</hi> of Louis XIV. was published in 1681, and has ever since been a
                    standard work on this subject. In England there are few positive enactments to
                    regulate marine insurance, its practice having been conformed to general
                    principles and the usage of trade. The endless variety of circumstances
                    connected with it naturally render it a much more abstruse and difficult subject
                    than any other kind of insurance; and the numerous points, as sea-worthiness,
                    deviation, capture, and others, which must be attended to, have from time to
                    time created a vast variety of most complex and difficult cases in our law
                    courts. Upon these the laws of British marine insurance are founded.</p>
                <p>The nature of this contract is similar to those of the other descriptions of
                    insurance. Suppose it has been remarked, that of fifty ships of the ordinary
                    degree of seaworthiness, employed in a given trade, one is on an average
                    annually cast away; the probability of loss will plainly be equal to one
                    fiftieth: and if an individual wish to insure a ship, or the cargo on board a
                    ship, engaged in this trade, he ought to pay a premium equal to the one fiftieth
                    part of the sum he insures, exclusively of such an additional sum as may be
                    required to indemnify the insurer for his trouble, and to leave him a fair
                    profit. If the premium exceed this sum, the insurer is overpaid; if it fall
                    below it, he is underpaid. In this country marine insurance has always been for
                    the most part effected with individuals; and of these the subscribers to Lloyd’s
                    have, from the extent of their transactions, been long the most distinguished.
                    When a merchant or ship-owner desires to effect an insurance, he fills up a
                    blank policy, so as to meet the particular object in view; he then hands it to
                    one of the members of the room, who either rejects it, or underwrites for a
                    certain limited sum; from him it goes to another; and thus it is handed about
                    until the amount required is complete. Agents are appointed in all the principal
                    parts of the world, who forward regularly*to Lloyd’s, accounts of all the
                    arrivals at, and departures from, their ports, as well as of losses and other
                    casualties, and, in general, all such information as may be supposed of
                    importance towards guiding the judgments of the underwriters. In addition to
                    this, there are annually published certain register books for shipping, which
                    give an account of the tonnage, build, age, repairs, and quality of almost all
                    the vessels that frequent our ports; and which, though in many respects
                    defective, are material assistants to the insurers. Besides the subscribers to
                    Lloyd’s, there are many wealthy individuals, both in London and in all the
                    considerable sea-ports of the kingdom, who underwrite policies of marine
                    insurance. As these cannot be personally known to many of the ship-owners, a set
                    of middle-men, or brokers, have arisen, whose business it is to receive orders
                    for insurance, who apply to the persons they suppose most likely to cover the
                    risks; and also become responsible for them being effected with accuracy and
                    celerity.</p>
                <p>Many of the inconveniences attending this mode of effecting insurance,
                    particularly in the saving of time, are obviated when the business is transacted
                    with a company. In such a case, the party having property to insure goes
                    directly to the manager of the company, and states the particulars of the risk
                    to be insured; when the premium is agreed on, the manager writes out a
                    memorandum of the policy, which the party signs, and he is thus effectually
                    insured before he leaves the office. The security afforded by such companies is
                    also of infinite importance to the insured; severe and heavy losses having
                    frequently occurred, from the bankruptcy or inability of individual
                    underwriters. The Royal Exchange, Alliance Marine, Indemnity Mutual Marine, and
                    London Assurance, are the principal companies for marine insurance in the
                    metropolis; and, as well as the private underwriters mentioned above, there are
                    similar establishments, though on a smaller scale, in most of the large
                    sea-ports of the empire.</p>
                <p>With respect to the rates of premium charged for marine insurance, it is
                    self-evident that these will vary ac <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941936"

                    the known character of the captain, the nature of the commodity, and the state
                    of our political relations. Of these no comprehensive table could be
                    constructed, and therefore they come naturally to be regulated very much by
                    general experience and particular information. All policies of marine insurance
                    must be on stamped paper, the duties on which are as follows, viz.</p>

                <p>It would be quite foreign to the purpose of the present work were we to enter
                    upon the legal details of marine insurance. On this point the standard English
                    authors, Park and Marshall, and the work of the learned professor of Scotch Law,
                    Mr Bell, afford every possible information. We shall merely take notice of the
                    following circumstances to be attended to in the contract.</p>
                <p>1. The name of the insured or his agent is required by statute. By 28 Geo. III.
                    c. 65, it is enacted, that it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to
                    make or effect, or cause to be made or effected, any policy of insurance upon
                    any ship, without first inserting, or causing to be inserted, in such policy or
                    policies of insurance, the name or names, or the usual style and firm of
                    dealing, of one or more of the persons interested in each insurance. This was
                    required to remedy the evil of policies being issued in which the name of the
                    insured was purposely left blank.</p>
                <p>2. The names of the ship and master are necessary to identify the subject-matter
                    of the policy; for whether it be ship, or freight, or goods, the risk attaches
                    itself to a particular bottom. The place and time at which the risk is to
                    commence and terminate are obviously requisite particulars; but the subject of
                    the insurance is the essential part or <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of
                    the contract, for there must be no room to question what property is really put
                    in risk.</p>
                <p>3. The policy must be subscribed or underwritten with the names of the several
                    insurers, each adding to his name the sum for which he is liable; and this may
                    be done by a procurator acting under either express or tacit delegation. No
                    witnesses are required.</p>
                <p>4. The insured are under certain obligations in respect to representation and
                    warranty of the facts whereon the undertaking of indemnity is grounded.
                    Insurance being a contract of faith, in which the insurer is to rely for the
                    most part on the statement of the insured, his representation of the facts must
                    be fair and open; there must be no misrepresentation, no false insinuation, no
                    concealment of circumstances material to the risk. Warranty, again, is an
                    absolute condition expressed or implied, relative to the state or circumstances
                    of the subject insured, which, if not true, or not complied with, defeats the
                    insurance, whether material to the risk or not. A warranty may be affirmative,
                    as that a ship was safe on a particular day; or promissory, that the ship will
                    proceed with the convoy, or sail on a day certain; express, as that the ship is
                    to sail on a day certain, or that she was on a certain day safe in harbour; or
                    implied, including all those conditions relative to the risk which necessarily
                    enter into the conception of the contract, as that the ship is seaworthy, that
                    the voyage is lawful, that there shall be no deviation, and so on.</p>
                <p>5. Policies are of two kinds, valued and open. By the former, the value of the
                    subject insured is fixed by agreement of the parties, so that when a loss
                    occurs, the value stated in the policy regulates the settlement, without regard
                    to the original cost or invoice of the subject insured. By the latter the value
                    is left open, and in case of loss the assured must adduce evidence of his
                    interest, and he recovers indemnification only to the actual extent of his loss.
                    In the settlement of a loss under an open policy, the ship is valued at what she
                    was worth at the time of sailing, including her stores; the freight, at the
                    amount which she would have earned according to the charter-party; and the
                    cargo, at the invoice price, including the premium of insurance, and all
                    charges.</p>
                <p>6. Losses may be said to be of three kinds; total, general average, and partial
                    loss. The former consists not solely in the entire destruction of the subject
                    insured, but in such damage as to render it of little or no value to the owner,
                    or at least to frustrate the adventure the securing of which was the object of
                    the insurance.</p>
                <p>When the total loss is manifest and undoubted, as where a ship is lost and is
                    never heard of again, it falls directly upon the underwriter; but where any
                    thing remains, the claim for loss must be accompanied by abandonment, which is a
                    renunciation to the underwriter of all right, title, and claim to what may be
                    saved, leaving it to him to make the most of it for his own benefit. In
                    abandoning, the insured must make up his mind <hi rend="italic"
                    >tempestive</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he is not bound to do so till he
                    has an opportunity of receiving correct information. The common custom
                    now-a-days, in paying such losses, is for the underwriter to settle for a
                    certain per-centage, retaining a sum equivalent to the probable proceeds,
                    leaving the insured to recover the savings, and settling the balance of the loss
                    when these are ascertained.</p>
                <p>General average is constituted by the voluntary sacrifice of the ship’s
                    materials, or part of the cargo, or when charges are incurred for the general
                    benefit, such as the cutting from anchors and cables to avoid a lee shore,
                    jetson of part of the cargo to lighten the vessel, expenses of taking the ship
                    off the strand, &amp;c.; in which, and all similar cases, the loss and expenses
                    are borne by ship, cargo, and freight, in proportion to their respective values
                    saved.</p>
                <p>Partial loss, or, as it is in general termed, <hi rend="italic">particular
                    average,</hi> means a loss or damage by unavoidable accidents, not amounting to
                    a total loss. Under it is included damage to the ship by stranding, by
                    unavoidable collision with another vessel, damage to the hull, boats, masts, or
                    other parts, by a stroke of the sea, by lightning, accidental fire, &amp;c.
                    These, and such like, are of the nature of particular average on the ship; but
                    the springing of a leak at sea, or the splitting of sails, or the parting of a
                    cable, and similar damages, are held to be the ordinary wear and tear of the
                    ship, and which the owner cannot recover from the underwriter.</p>
                <p>Particular average on the cargo means damage by seawater, fire, or any accident
                    which the care of the master and crew could not prevent. (See article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Average.)</hi></p>
                <p>7. The mode of settlement after the damage is ascertained is likewise an
                    important subject.</p>
                <p>In adjusting a partial loss on a ship, it is usual to deductone third from the
                    new materials and labour, except on certain articles, unless the ship or the
                    materials injured were perfectly <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941949"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1949-0319"/>new. When the loss is on cargo, it is settled
                    either by taking the invoice price and deducting the nett proceeds of sale of
                    the damaged goods, or by comparing the amount of sales of the damaged goods with
                    a <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> account of sales of the same articles if they
                    had arrived in a sound state. The former of these, termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >salvage</hi> loss, is the mode of adjustment where the goods required to be
                    sold short of the port of destination, and where it was consequently impossible
                    to refer to the market price of that port, as in the second instance. The latter
                    method avoids involving the underwriters in a falling or rising market; the
                    market price of the sound and of the damaged commodities being said to be the
                    scales in which to weigh the depreciation.</p>
