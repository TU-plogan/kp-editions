                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi><hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> or, as some call it,
                    the <hi rend="italic">measure of weight,</hi> is meant the apparent force or
                    tendency which any body or commodity has to descend; and which, owing to the
                    centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation, and the buoyancy of the air or other
                    medium in which the operation of weighing is performed, is somewhat less than
                    its real force, the latter being always proportional to the intensity of gravity
                    multiplied by the mass weighed. Accurate weighing is of great importance, since
                    in general it affords one of the best practical means of ascertaining the
                    quantity of matter in bodies, and thence the values of the greater part of the
                    necessaries of life. But although, in most cases, the buoyancy of the medium may
                    have some effect, however small, it is evident that any difference in the
                    intensities of gravity, or of centrifugal force in different latitudes, or even
                    on different planets, can, <hi rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi> make no
                    difference on the weights of bodies as obtained by counterpoising; but the
                    weight, when indicated by the force or resistance of a spring, will, <hi
                    rend="italic">coeteris paribus,</hi> be proportional to the intensity of
                    gravity. The term <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> in the present article more
                    properly applies to the three following kinds of magnitudes, sometimes called
                    geometrical: 1st, linear extent, such as the length or other linear dimensions
                    of bodies; 2d, area, surface, or superficial extent; 3d, the bulk of bodies, or
                    the solid space occupied by them, and which, when spoken of the vessels which
                    measure or contain them, is called their contents or capacity. This article then
                    is meant to treat of the usual standards of weights and measures, by comparison
                    with which the amount of any article or commodity is ascertained, whether in the
                    ordinary affairs of life, the more extensive transactions of commerce, or where
                    greater nicety is required in the arts and sciences. Anciently standard weights
                    or counterpoises were generally of Stone, though sometimes of metal. At present
                    mostly all the smaller standard weights are made of some metal possessing such a
                    composition and hardness as may be less liable to be worn or corroded,
                    counterfeited or altered; and one of the best is a mixture consisting
                    principally of copper and tin. The larger weights are generally of iron, though
                    sometimes of stone. The more accurate standards of length are likewise of metal,
                    but the larger sort is very generally of wood: chains, cords, and tapes are also
                    used. The nicer measures of capacity are formed of metal or glass, but the
                    larger and more common sort is mostly all of wood. After what immediately
                    follows on the equalization of the standards in the British empire, by the late
                    Dr Thomas Young, and his very compendious general table, we have added a more
                    particular though brief account of the principal weights and measures at present
                    used in different parts of the world.</p>
                <p>The preparation of the bill for ascertaining and establishing Uniformity of
                    Weights and Measures, which passed the Imperial House of Commons in the session
                    of 1823 (though without having been then carried through the House of Lords),
                    had given occasion for a laborious and somewhat painful examination of the
                    historical progress of the measures which have been taken respecting it, and
                    especially of the laws of England respecting uniformity of practice in different
                    parts of the country; for such a uniformity, though generally esteemed by all
                    governments a thing to be encouraged and enforced, had often seemed to be no
                    more subject to the control of legislative enactment than the introduction of a
                    uniformity of language and a grammatical accuracy of speech would be found in
                    every part of an extensive empire.</p>
                <p>Augustus is said to have endeavoured in vain to force a new Latin word into the
                    language of ancient Rome: the <pb break="no"

                    />French, on the other hand, after all their labours to recommend a uniform
                    system of measures, have ended in such a complication, that, for the most simple
                    purposes of practical mechanics and civil life, it is become usual to carry in
                    the pocket a little ruler, in the form of a triangular prism, one of the sides
                    containing the old established lines and inches of the royal foot, a second the
                    millimetres, centimetres, and decimetres of the revolutionary school, and the
                    third the new ultra-royal combination of the Jacobin measure with the royal
                    division, the inches consisting of the 36th part of a metre, or the four
                    millionth of a degree of the meridian of the earth. If such occurrences as these
                    be calmly considered, they will make us more disposed to diminish than to
                    increase the number of penal statutes intended to compel the inhabitants of the
                    different parts of a country to study their own convenience conjointly with that
                    of their neighbours, and to spare themselves the necessity of a few arithmetical
                    operations in the course of every market-day; and we shall feel that it is more
                    incumbent on a wise government to endeavour to facilitate both the attainment of
                    correct and uniform standards of legal existing measures of all kinds, and the
                    ready understanding of all the provincial and local terms applied to measures,
                    either regular or irregular, by the multiplication of glossaries and tables for
                    the correct definition and comparison of such terms.</p>
                <p>Measures have apparently always been derived, in the first instance, from some
                    part of the human person. A foot, a pace, a fathom, the orgyia or stretch of the
                    arms, a cuhit, a palm, and a finger; these have probably all been used in the
                    earlier states of society by each individual from the magnitude of his own
                    person; and afterwards a standard measure has been established by authority from
                    the real or supposed magnitude of the person of some king or hero, in order for
                    the attainment of more perfect uniformity in practice; though it is said, that
                    in some parts of the east the Arabs still measure the cubits of their cloth by
                    the fore arm, with the addition of the breadth of the other hand, which serves
                    to mark the end of the measure, as the thumb which was formerly added at the end
                    of the yard by the English clothiers. It ought not however to be forgotten, that
                    any one of these terms possesses an advantage for popular use, and for the
                    convenience of future ages and of remote countries, which would be lost by the
                    introduction of any more arbitrary measurement. Thus a hand’s breadth, or a
                    foot, is always sufficiently understood, without any definition, to enable us to
                    form to ourselves a tolerably accurate picture of the magnitude intended to be
                    described; and there is scarcely an instance of the caprice of denomination
                    having ever extended so far as to make the measure called a foot in any country
                    so small as half a natural foot, or so great as two feet of an ordinary person,
                    and certainly not of its amounting to three ordinary feet; while a metre, even
                    to those who know that the word implies a measure, might as well have meant a
                    mile, or an inch, or a quart, as a length somewhat greater than a yard.</p>
                <p>The idea of accurately verifying the standard of a country by any other means
                    than that of a comparison with some actually existing original, can scarcely
                    have occurred, except in a very advanced period in the progress of civilization.
                    It was indeed enacted in the time of our Henry the Third, that an ounce should
                    be the weight of 640 dry grains of wheat taken from the middle of the ear, that
                    a pound should be twelve ounces, a gallon of wine eight pounds, and eight
                    gallons of wine a bushel of London; but this seems rather a direction for making
                    a single standard than a mode intended for the continual verification of the
                    standard in case of any minute uncertainty. Again, in a statute of Henry the
                    Seventh, a gallon of corn was mentioned as containing eight pounds of wheat: and
                    this may perhaps serve to explain the origin of the two different gallons. But
                    the substitution of an original standard derived from an object of definite
                    magnitude, exterior to the human person, seems to have been reserved for the
                    days of the French revolution, though it has since been adopted in an improved
                    form by the introduction of a foot equal to <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 33</hi> of the pendulum vibrating seconds, as a
                    representative the customary foot of the kingdom of Denmark. (Quarterly Journal
                    of Science for 1821, <hi rend="italic">Astr. coll.</hi> No. V.)</p>
                <p>The Royal Society, under the presidency of Mr Folkes, made some very accurate
                    comparisons of the English, and French, and old Roman standards, which are
                    recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for 1736, 1742, and 1743; and George
                    Graham, the eminent watchmaker, determined at the same time the length of the
                    pendulum vibrating seconds to be 39∙130 inches; but the standard with which he
                    compared it requiring some reduction, it was afterwards ascertained that the
                    length, as derived from these experiments, ought to have been more nearly 39∙14
                    inches.</p>
                <p>A committee of the House of Commons was appointed in 1758, of which Lord
                    Carysfort was chairman. Their Report contains some important information
                    respecting the standards then in use. They found that the customary ale and beer
                    gallon of the Excise was estimated at 282 cubical inches, while the legal wine
                    gallon of the Exchequer was computed at only 231, though the only existing
                    standard of the wine gallon in 1688, which was kept at Guildhall, contained no
                    more than 224 cubical inches. They suggested the adoption of this smaller gallon
                    for the legal standard, perhaps as being more favourable to the revenue, though
                    the gallon of 231 inches had been previously legalized by the act of the fifth
                    of Queen Anne; and they employed the well-known Mr Bird to prepare two
                    standards, which were to be exact copies of that which was made by Graham for
                    the Royal Society in 1742, from a very careful comparison of the various yards
                    and ells of Henry the Seventh and Elizabeth, which were kept in the Exchequer.
                    One of the copies was marked “Standard Yard, 1758,” and was presented by the
                    committee to the House with the intention that it should be adopted as the legal
                    standard; the other was made “with cheeks” for common use, and proposed to be
                    kept in the Exchequer.</p>
                <p>A subsequent Report of a committee appointed in 1759, consists principally of
                    proposals for some legislative regulations, tending to facilitate the
                    equalization of weights and measures by the establishment of proper methods of
                    checking and authorizing the standards to be employed. In 1765, two bills were
                    brought into the House of Commons by Lord Carysfort, in conformity with the
                    Reports of the committees; but, from some accidental circumstances, they were
                    not passed into laws.</p>
                <p>Another committee was appointed in 1790; but no minutes of their proceedings have
                    been recorded. In 1814 however a very important Report was presented to the
                    House by a new committee, who had called upon Dr W. Hyde Wollaston and Professor
                    Playfair for their opinions on the subject; and it was principally in
                    consequence of these examinations that the committee stated that the length of
                    the pendulum vibrating seconds had been ascertained to be 39·13047 inches, and
                    that the metre of platina measured, at the temperature of 55°, 39∙3828 English
                    inches, representing at 32° the ten millionth part of the quadrant of the
                    meridian. They remarked with great truth, that although in theory the original
                    standard of weight is best derived from the measure of capacity, yet in common
                    practice it will generally be found more convenient to reverse this order; and
                    they recommended, upon the suggestion of Dr Wollaston, that a gallon containing
                    ten pounds of pure water should be adopted as a substitute for the ale and corn
                    gallons, which had become different rather from accident than from any direct
                    legislative authority, the one containing a little more than ten pounds, the
                    other <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=882"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0882-0842"/>a little less, though the standards of the latter
                    were extremely discordant among themselves. It seems to have been intended to
                    abolish the wine gallon, which is also that of the apothecaries; though it was
                    recommended to retain the use of the Troy weight of the goldsmiths, employed
                    also by the apothecaries. It had before been observed, that twelve wine gallons
                    of distilled water weighed exactly 100 pounds avoirdupois; but Dr Wollaston’s
                    proposal to make an ale gallon exactly of ten pounds, afforded a greater
                    facility in the operation of adjusting the measure, since it is not very easy to
                    divide 100 pounds into twelve equal parts, with the weights in common use.</p>
                <p>Some very important experiments on weights and measures had been made a little
                    before the date of this committee, by Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, who had
                    published an elaborate paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions
                    for 1798; and by the ingenious Mr Whitehurst, who obtained the length of the
                    pendulum by measuring the difference of two lengths affording vibrations of
                    different frequency. There were still some minute discordances between the
                    various measurements which appeared to be of the highest authority; and some
                    particulars in the Report of the committee of 1814 are manifestly erroneous.
                    Thus the weight of a cubic foot of water is stated, from a mistake in
                    computation, to be 1000 ounces at 56½° of Fahrenheit, while, in fact, it is less
                    than this even at 39°, the maximum of density; and again, the customary length
                    of the English foot, which has always been adjusted at the ordinary temperature
                    of the atmosphere, and rather at that of the summer than that of the winter, as,
                    for example, in the great trigonometrical operations of General Roy and his
                    successors, at 62° of Fahrenheit, was, in the experiments, copied by the
                    committee from Pictet, compared with the French standard, which was intended to
                    be employed at the freezing point of water, without any correction for this
                    diversity; though Dr Young had long before pointed out the omission both in the
                    Journals of the Royal Institution and elsewhere, and had computed the true
                    length of the metre according to these operations of Professor Pictet, confirmed
                    by some earlier ones of Bird, Maskelyne, andLalande, to be 39∙3710 English
                    inches, instead of 39∙3828.</p>
                <p>In order, therefore, to remove any doubt which might still be reasonably
                    entertained on the subject, Mr Davies Gilbert moved the House of Commons, in the
                    year 1816, to present an humble address to the prince regent, praying that he
                    would give direction that proper measures should be taken for ascertaining the
                    length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, and for comparing the French and
                    English standards with each other. In consequence of this address, the
                    astronomer royal was in the first instance directed to perform the necessary
                    operations; and, upon his asking for some further assistance, the president and
                    council of the Royal Society were requested to appoint a committee to co-operate
                    with him. This committee consisted, besides the president and secretaries, of
                    the late Sir Charles Blagden, Mr Gilbert, Dr Wollaston, Dr Young, Captain Kater,
                    General Mudge, Mr Brown, Mr Rennie, and Mr Troughton. They began by discussing
                    the several modes of making the requisite experiments which occurred to the
                    different members; and it was resolved, that as many of these methods as were
                    preferred by each of them, should be separately carried into execution, in order
                    to obtain collateral determinations of the required length. Mr Pond pursued the
                    method of the French astronomers, and obtained some very satisfactory results,
                    with an apparatus such as they had employed; Dr Young proposed a method derived
                    from that of Whitehurst, and very perfect in theory, but somewhat complicated,
                    and which has never yet been practically executed; Captain Kater invented, with
                    great ingenuity, and employed, with great mechanical skill, an apparatus which
                    does as much credit to his talents in the arrangement as to his perseverance in
                    the experiments which he performed with it, and the accuracy of his
                    determinations has been fully appreciated by mathematicians and practical
                    astronomers throughout the world; and his operations have been repeated by many
                    observers in different countries. Captain Kater’s apparatus has been described
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pendulum.</hi> It owes no inconsiderable
                    part of its advantage to the property supposed to have been subsequently
                    demonstrated by Laplace, that, even if the opposite knife edges were
                    considerably blunted and rounded off, supposing both to be equally affected, the
                    distance between them would still afford the true measure of the length of the
                    pendulum without any further correction for the change of the axis of motion.
                    [But that this celebrated property, after all, is only true within certain
                    limits, has been shewn in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">PeNDuluM,</hi> vol.
                    xvii. p. 210.] It has also been demonstrated in this country by means of the
                    experiments of Chladni on the elasticity of metals, that the temporary change of
                    form depending on the compression of the steel edge, would be too inconsiderable
                    to produce any sensible alteration of the length in question.</p>
                <p>The object of Dr Young’s apparatus was to obtain two or more fine lines, traced
                    at different parts of a scale, which should exhibit between them a certain
                    determinate portion of the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds. He
                    apprehended that the accurate determination of the form and direction of the
                    knife edges, and the measurement of the distance between any such edges, which
                    was necessary in the method proposed by Prony, as well as in that which was
                    subsequently invented by Captain Kater, would require more skill and delicacy in
                    the execution and the observation than could be expected from any common workman
                    or experimenter; and though Captain Kater, by his extreme care in combating
                    every source of error, has, in point of fact, apparently obviated all these
                    difficulties, yet it cannot be expected that so rare a combination of
                    qualifications should again be found, in case of a repetition of the
                    experiments, and Dr Young’s apparatus may still, at some future time, be
                    employed with advantage, at least for a collateral check upon the results.</p>
                <p>The obstacle which prevented the completion of the observations which were made
                    for some time with this apparatus at Greenwich, was the difficulty of obtaining
                    a scapement so delicate as to count the number of vibrations, without sensibly
                    interfering with their frequency. A very ingenious clockmaker was employed to
                    furnish a scapement, of which the intention was to strike the pendulum slightly
                    and instantaneously at the lowest point of its vibration, and then to recoil
                    from it, so that even a considerable impulse might have little or no effect in
                    altering the rate of the pendulum; but it was in fact observed, upon comparison
                    with the clocks of the observatory, that the vibrations in larger arcs were more
                    frequent than those which were performed in smaller; so that the scapement must
                    have exerted a very considerable influence on the time of every vibration. It
                    was therefore found necessary to abandon this method of making the experiment;
                    but there would be no difficulty in conducting it very satisfactorily by means
                    of a journeyman clock, with a wooden or brass pendulum, capable of having its
                    length altered so as to become comparable with the vibrations of Dr Young’s
                    pendulum in its different states; and it might even be found sufficient to
                    observe the pendulum, with the same scapement, so altered as not to give any
                    impulse whatever, but merely to reckon the vibrations by means of the detent
                    during the spontaneous vibrations of the pendulum, which, on account of its
                    great weight, would be continued for a considerable time in consequence of the
                    first impulse, taking care that the detent should be struck exactly at the
                    middle of the vibration, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=883" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0883-0843"/>
                    and that it should rebound in some measure from the pendulum at the moment of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>Before any attempt was made to introduce any legislative regulations upon the
                    foundation of the various scientific experiments which had been so accurately
                    and satisfactorily conducted, it was thought advisable by his majesty’s
                    ministers that the subject at large should be submitted to the deliberate
                    consideration of some competent persons, who might discuss it more minutely than
                    could be done with convenience before a committee of either house of parliament;
                    and that a commission should be appointed for this purpose, by a writ of the
                    privy seal. The commissioners thus nominated in 1818 were, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir
                    George Clerk, Mr Davies Gilbert, Dr W. Hyde Wollaston, Dr Thomas Young, and
                    Captain Henry Kater Some further operations for the comparison of the existing
                    standards of length were undertaken by Captain Kater. [Since this article was
                    first published, Captain Kater has, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826,
                    given a detailed account of these operations; and in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1830 and 1831 he has pointed out a variety of nice adjustments
                    and corrections to be made on them, which fortunately are too minute to affect
                    any ordinary weights or measures. But Mr Sang has lately communicated to the
                    Edinburgh Society of Arts a notice of some defects in these last corrections of
                    Captain Kater.] Dr Wollaston examined some of the authorized measures of
                    capacity, and Dr Young offered his services as secretary to the committee, with
                    the assistance of a clerk who had studied the law, while Sir George Clerk and Mr
                    Gilbert were employed in preparations for carrying into effect, in their
                    legislative capacity, such regulations as the commissioners at large might agree
                    to propose. The first occupation of the clerk was to make copious extracts from
                    the statutes at large, by means of which Dr Young drew up an abstract of the
                    present state of the laws relating to weights and measures; and the next to
                    select from the agricultural reports of the different counties such materials as
                    afforded a glossary of all the terms employed in any part of Great Britain for
                    denominating the irregular weights or measures which have acquired a local
                    currency in the agricultural or other commercial transactions.</p>
                <p>After this sketch of the previous history of the subject, we may now proceed to
                    extract from the Reports of the Commissioners, and from the bills founded on
                    them, such statements as may either serve in the place of canons for the
                    regulation of weights and measures in general, or as documents respecting the
                    actual value of the various standards possessing the highest degree of
                    authenticity; and this article cannot be more properly concluded than by
                    subjoining some further comparative tables of the standards of measures and
                    weights adopted by different countries and at different periods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Report.—</hi> “I. Upon a deliberate consideration of the
                    whole of the system at present existing, we are impressed with a sense of the
                    great difficulty of effecting any radical changes, to so considerable an extent
                    as might in some respects be desirable; and we therefore wish to proceed with
                    great caution in the suggestions which we shall venture to propose.</p>
                <p>“II. With respect to the actual magnitude of the standards of length, it does not
                    appear to us that there can be any sufficient reason for altering those which
                    are at present generally employed. There is no practical advantage in having a
                    quantity commensurable to any original quantity existing or which may be
                    imagined to exist in nature, except as affording some little encouragement to
                    its common adoption by neighbouring nations. But it is scarcely possible that
                    the departure from a standard, once universally established in a great country,
                    should not produce much more labour and inconvenience in its internal relations
                    than it could ever be expected to save in the operations of foreign commerce and
                    correspondence, which always are and always must be conducted by persons to whom
                    the difficulty of calculation is comparatively inconsiderable, and who are also
                    remunerated for their trouble, either by the profits of their commercial
                    concerns, or by the credit of their scientific acquirements.</p>
                <p>“III. The subdivisions of weights and measures at present employed in this
                    country appear to be far more convenient for practical purposes than the decimal
                    scale, which might perhaps be preferred by some persons for making calculations
                    with quantities already determined. But the power of expressing a third, a
                    fourth, and a sixth of a foot in inches without a fraction, is a peculiar
                    advantage in the duodecimal scale; and, for the operation of weighing and
                    measuring capacities, the continual division by two renders it practicable to
                    make up any given quantity with the smallest possible number of standard weights
                    or measures, and is far preferable in this respect to any decimal scale. We
                    would therefore recommend that all the multiples and subdivisions of the
                    standard to be adopted should retain the same relative proportions to each other
                    as are at present in general use.</p>
                <p>“IV. The most authentic standards of length which are now in existence being
                    found, upon a minute examination, to vary in a very slight degree from each
                    other, although either of them might be preferred, without any difference that
                    would become sensible in common cases; we beg leave to recommend for the legal
                    determination of the standard yard that which was employed by General Roy in the
                    measurement of a base on Hounslow Heath, as a foundation for the trigonometrical
                    operations that have been carried on by the Ordnance throughout the country, and
                    a duplicate of which will probably be laid down on a standard scale by the
                    committee of the Royal Society appointed for assisting the astronomer royal in
                    the determination of the length of the pendulum; the temperature being supposed
                    to be 62 degrees of Fahrenheit when the scale is employed.</p>
                <p>“V. We propose also, upon the authority of the experiments made by the committee
                    of the Royal Society, that it should be declared, for the purpose of identifying
                    or recovering the length of this standard, in case that it should ever be lost
                    or impaired, that the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds of mean solar time
                    in London, on the level of the sea, and in a vacuum, is 394372 inches of this
                    scale; and that the length of the metre employed in France, as the 10,000,000th
                    part of the quadrantal arc of the meridian, has been found equal to 39∙3694
                    inches.</p>
                <p>“VI. The definitions of measures of capacity are obviously capable of being
                    immediately deduced from their relations to measures of length; but since the
                    readiest practical method of ascertaining the magnitude of any measure of
                    capacity is to weigh the quantity of water which it is capable of containing, it
                    would, in our opinion, be advisable in this instance to invert the more natural
                    order of proceeding, and to define the measures of capacity rather from the
                    weight of the water they are capable of containing, than from their solid
                    content in space. It will therefore be convenient to begin with the definition
                    of the standard of weight, by declaring that 'nineteen cubic inches of distilled
                    water, at the temperature of 50°,’ must weigh exactly ten ounces troy, or 4800
                    grains, and that 7000 such grains make a pound avoirdupois; supposing, however,
                    the cubic inches to relate to the measure of a portion of brass, adjusted by a
                    standard scale of brass. This definition is deduced from some very accurate
                    experiments of the late Sir George Shuckburgh on the weights and measures of
                    Great Britain; but we propose at a future period to repeat such of them as
                    appear to be the most important.</p>
                <p>“VII. The definitions thus established are not calculated to introduce any
                    variation from the existing standards</p>

                <p>of length and of weight, which may be considered as already sufficiently well
                    ascertained. But with respect to the measure of capacity, it appears from the
                    Report contained in the Appendix (A), that the legal standards of the highest
                    authority are considerably at variance with each other;; the standard gallon,
                    quart, and pint of Queen Elizabeth, which are kept in the Exchequer, having been
                    also apparently employed, almost indiscriminately, for adjusting the measures
                    both of corn and of beer; between which however a difference has gradually, and,
                    as it may be supposed, unintentionally, crept into the practice of the excise;
                    the ale gallon being understood to contain about four and a half per cent. more
                    than the corn gallon, though we do not find any particular act of parliament in
                    which this excess is expressly recognised. We think it right to propose that
                    these measures should again be reduced to their original equality; and at the
                    same time, on account of the great convenience which would be derived from the
                    facility of determining a gallon and its parts, by the operation of weighing a
                    certain quantity of water, amounting to an entire number of pounds and ounces
                    without fractions, we venture strongly to recommend that the standard ale and
                    corn gallon should contain exactly ten pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at
                    62° Fahrenheit, being nearly equal to 277∙2 cubic inches, and agreeing with the
                    standard pint in the Exchequer, which is found to contain exactly twenty ounces
                    of water.</p>
                <p>“VIII. We presume that very little inconvenience would be felt by the public from
                    the introduction of this gallon in the place of the customary ale gallon of 282
                    cubic inches, and of the Winchester corn gallon, directed by a statute of King
                    William to contain 269, and by some later statutes estimated at 272¼ cubic
                    inches; especially when it is considered that the standards by which the quart
                    and pint beer measures used in London are habitually adjusted, do not at present
                    differ in a sensible degree from the standard proposed to be rendered general.
                    We apprehend also that the slight excess of the new bushel above the common corn
                    measure would be of the less importance, as the customary measures employed in
                    different parts of Great Britain are almost universally larger than the legal
                    Winchester bushel.</p>
                <p>“Appendix (A). The standards kept at the Exchequer, for the adjustment both of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">corN</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">beer</hi> measures, are
                    a bushel, a gallon, and a quart, dated 1601, and a pint, dated 1602, all marked
                    with an E and a crown. They were examined by Sir George Clerk and Dr Wollaston,
                    and the weight of Thames water which they held, at the temperature of 52°, was
                    found as in the subjoined table. Now, since, according to Sir George
                    Shuckburgh’s experiments, a cubic inch of distilled water at 60° weighs 252½
                    grains, the specific gravity of the water being to that of distilled water as
                    1·00060 to 1, and the apparent specific gravity of distilled water, in a vessel
                    of brass at 52°, being to that of water at 62° as 1∙00046 to 1, it follows that
                    the apparent specific gravity of the water employed was 1∙00106, and that an
                    ounce avoirdupois corresponded to l∙731 cubic inches. Hence we obtain the
                    contents of the measures in cubic inches, which are compared in the table with
                    the more direct measurement of Mr Bird and Mr Harris, reported to the House of
                    Commons in 1758.</p>
                <p>“The Exchequer standard <hi rend="smallcaps">wine</hi> gallon is dated 1707, and
                    was found to contain 133∙4 ounces, answering to 230∙9 cubic inches. An
                    experiment of Dr Wollaston and Mr Carr, in 1814, gave 230∙8, the mean being
                    230·85; while the measurement of 1758 made it 231·2. A duplicate of this
                    measure, and of the same date, is kept at Guildhall.</p>
                <p>“Dr Wollaston and Mr Carr examined also the three other <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >wine</hi> gallons at Guildhall. The oldest of these seems to be the same that
                    was measured by Halley and Flamsteed in 1688, and was said to contain 224 cubic
                    inches: its actual capacity is 224·4. The wine gallon of 1773, which is in daily
                    use for adjusting other measures, was probably in the first instance a correct
                    copy of the Exchequer gallon, but has been reduced by a bruise and by the wear
                    of the brim to 230·0 cubic inches, having lost <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of a cubic inch, or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                    contains 230·8 cubic inches.</p>
                <p>“The Excise WINE gallon was found by a similar experiment to contain 230∙1 cubic
                    inches, having partaken of the progressive deficiency of the Guildhall gallon,
                    from which it was derived.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Report</hi> —“We have examined, since our last Report,
                    the relation of the best authenticated standards of length at present in
                    existence, to the instruments employed for measuring the base on Hounslow Heath,
                    and in the late trigonometrical operations; but we have very unexpectedly
                    discovered that an error has been committed in the construction of some of those
                    instruments. We are therefore obliged to recur to the originals which they were
                    intended to represent, and we have found reason to prefer the parliamentary
                    standard executed by Bird in 1760, which we had not before received, both as
                    being laid down in the most accurate manner, and as the best agreeing with the
                    most extensive comparisons which have been hitherto executed by various
                    observers, and circulated throughout Europe; and, in particular, with the scale
                    employed by the late Sir George Shuckburgh.</p>
                <p>“We have therefore now to propose that this standard be considered as the
                    foundation of all legal weights and measures, and that it be declared that the
                    length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in a vacuum on the level of the sea, in
                    London, is 39Ί3929 inches, and that of the French metre 39·37079 inches, the

                    bulk of water, with a view to the fixing the magnitude of the standard of
                    weight, that of length being already determined by the experiments related in
                    our former Reports; and we have found by the computations, which will be
                    detailed in the Appendix, that the weight of a cubic inch of distilled water at
                    62° of Fahrenheit is 252·724 grains of the parliamentary standard pound of 1758,

                    the late Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn in the determination of the magnitude of
                    the standard weights, and there being some doubt of the perfect accuracy of his
                    method of measuring the capacity of the bodies employed, it was judged necessary
                    to repeat that measurement with greater precautions; and the results of Captain
                    Kater’s experiments have afforded some slight corrections of the capacities in
                    question.</p>
                <p>“The sides of Sir George Shuckburgh’s cube were found by Captain Kater equal to

                    its length 5∙99600 inches; and the diameter of the sphere 6∙00759 inches. Hence
                    the content of the cube appears to be 124∙1969 inches; that of the cylinder

                    cube of water in a vacuum at 60∙2°. Now this cube is less than the supposed

                    account of the contraction of the brass, and the water is denser than at the
                    standard temperature, according to Mr Gilpin’s experiments, in the ratio of
                    ∙99998 to ·99981, or of 1·00017 to 1; the whole correction for the difference of
                    1∙8° being ·0001133, or 3·55 grains, making 31410·24 for the weight of the cube

                    by reference to some invariable natural standard; and whereas it has been
                    ascertained by the commissioners appointed by his majesty to inquire into the
                    subject of weights and measures, that a cubic inch of distilled water in a
                    vacuum, weighed by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at the temperature of 62° of
                    Fahrenheit’s thermometer, is equal to 252∙72, 1822 [1823, 252∙724] grains, of
                    which, as aforesaid, the imperial standard troy pound contains 5760; Be it
                    therefore enacted, That if at any time hereafter the said imperial standard troy
                    pound shall be lost...it shall and may be restored.... by making, under the
                    directions of the Lord High Treasurer, ...a new standard,”...determined

                <p>“And be it further enacted, That the standard measure of capacity, as well for
                    liquids as for dry goods, shall be the gallon, containing ten pounds avoirdupois
                    weight of distilled water, weighed in air, at the temperature of 62° of

                    such gallons shall be a peck, and eight such gallons shall be a bushel, and
                    eight such bushels a quarter of corn or other dry goods.</p>
                <p>“And be it further enacted, That the standard measure of capacity for coals,
                    culm, lime, fish, potatoes, or fruit, and all other goods and things commonly
                    sold by heaped measure, shall be the aforesaid bushel, containing eighty pounds

                    bushel shall still be used for such goods sold by measure as are neither liquid
                    nor admit of being stricken. But it is obvious, that when there is to be no
                    heap, it is not the outside diameter, but the inside one, that ought to have
                    been fixed for such goods; whereas the statutes have left this so indeterminate,
                    that it may vary an inch or mote according to the thickness of the
                    materials.]</p></note></p>
                <p>“Provided always, and be it enacted, That in all cases of dispute respecting the

                    conveniently be had to any of the aforesaid verified copies or models of the
                    standard measures of capacity, it shall and may be lawful to and for any justice
                    of the peace, or magistrate, having jurisdiction in such place, to ascertain the
                    content of such measure of capacity by direct reference to the weight of pure or
                    rain water which such measure is capable of containing; ten pounds avoirdupois
                    weight of such water, at the temperature of 62° by Fahrenheit’s thermometer,
                    being the standard gallon ascertained by this act, the same being in bulk equal
                    to 277∙276, 1822 [1823, 277∙274] cubic inches, and so in proportion for all
                    parts or multiples of a gallon.”</p>
                <p>The slight discordance between the numbers of the two successive years depends
                    merely on the adoption of a standard troy pound, better authenticated than the
                    two-pound weight particularly employed by Sir George Shuckburgh, which was
                    finally preferred, both as representing a unit, and as being more simple in its
                    form than the two-pound weight.</p>

                <p>The preceding part of this article was furnished by the late Dr Thomas Young, for
                    the Supplement to the former editions, in such a form as not to supersede any
                    thing previously given on the same subject in the body of the work; so that,
                    both for this reason, and on account of the changes which have taken place since
                    Dr Young wrote, some additions are required. Indeed, excepting the comparative
                    table, his supplementary article was almost entirely confined to the then only
                    proposed equalization of the very different weights and measures employed in
                    different parts of the British empire, but on which four successive legislative
                    enactments have since taken place. These are, 5 Geo. IV. c. 74, 6 Geo. IV. c.
                    12, 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 49, and 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 63. The first two of these
                    statutes were exceedingly inert, being little better than mere recommendations
                    or abstract speculations, from the circumstance that every one was still allowed
                    to use whatever weight or measure his fancy, habits, or interest led him to
                    prefer. The third has been repealed or superseded by the fourth; and the latter,
                    which was passed in 1835, besides abolishing heaped measures, declares all
                    bargains or transactions to be illegal, or null and void, which are made by any
                    other weights or measures than the imperial. But although this law, which came
                    into operation 1st January 1836, has certainly placed the matter on a very
                    different footing from what it was before, the equalization is so far from being
                    yet complete, that two, and in some respects three, different sorts of weights
                    are very needlessly allowed; which tends to create confusion, and affords
                    opportunity for fraudulent transactions. This, it seems, was done principally in
                    compliance with the wish of the College of Physicians, who had long been in the
                    habit of using the troy weight in their prescriptions. It seems quite clear,
                    that if any class of the community was to be so indulged, it should have been
                    such as were ready to plead being so far behind the rest that they could not
                    reduce the troy to avoirdupois. There is however no good reason why physicians’
                    prescriptions should in this respect always continue antiquated, and lagging
                    behind every thing else, any more than there is that physicians should always
                    continue to use unclassical Latin instead of their mother tongue.</p>
                <p>The parliamentary commissioners on weights and measures think there is reason to
                    believe that the word Troy has no reference to any town in France, but rather to
                    the monkish name of <hi rend="italic">Troy Novant</hi> given to London, as
                    founded on the legend of Brute. Troy weight would thus mean London weight. But
                    some would derive Troy or Troyes, from <hi rend="italic">trois</hi> (three),
                    alleging it has reference to the three principal divisions of penny, shilling,
                    and pound, or penny, ounce, and pound, used in money weight. The commissioners,
                    with great probability, suppose the avoirdupois weight, by which heavy and bulky
                    goods have very generally been weighed for a long time past throughout this
                    country, to be derived from <hi rend="italic">avoirs (averia),</hi> the ancient
                    name for goods and chattels, and <hi rend="italic">poids,</hi> weight.</p>
                <p>The act 5 and 6 Will. IV. cap. 63, contains several important provisions, the
                    substance of which we shall now endeavour to state briefly. Weights and measures
                    verified and stamped at the exchequer as copies of the imperial standards shall
                    be taken to be legal weights and measures, to be used for comparison, although
                    not similar in shape to those required under the provisions of former acts,
                    except, as will be afterwards explained, those measures used for such articles
                    as were formerly heaped, and now are neither weighed nor stricken; and the
                    comptroller-general, or other duly authorized officer of the exchequer, may
                    compare and verify, and stamp as correct standards, any weights and measures
                    which respectively correspond in weight, length, and capacity, with the
                    standards, or parts, or multiples thereof, deposited in the exchequer, under the
                    5th Geo. IV. cap. 74, although, with the exception above noticed, such weights
                    and measures may not be models or copies in shape or form of the standards so
                    deposited.</p>
                <p>All copies of the imperial standard weights and measures which have become
                    defective, or have been mended, in consequence of wear or accident, shall
                    forthwith be sent to the exchequer, for the purpose of being again compared and
                    verified, and shall be stamped as re-verified copies of such standards, provided
                    the officer appointed for such verification deem them fit for the purposes of
                    standards, and every new comparison and verification shall be indorsed upon the
                    original indenture of verification; and such weights and measures shall be
                    stamped upon fees of verification only, unless they have been found incorrect;
                    for in that case an extra charge is to be made for adjusting them.</p>
                <p>The Winchester bushel, the Scotish ell, and all local or customary measures, are
                    now abolished; and every person who shall sell by any other than one of the
                    imperial measures, or some multiple or aliquot part thereof, shall be liable to
                    a penalty not exceeding 40s. for every such sale; but nothing herein shall
                    prevent the sale of any articles in any vessel, where such vessel is not
                    represented as containing any amount of imperial measure, or of any fixed local
                    or customary measure formerly in use.</p>
                <p>The use of heaped measure is now abolished, and all bargains, sales, and
                    contracts by heaped measure are null and void, under a penalty not exceeding
                    40s. for every such sale.</p>
                <p>Some articles formerly sold by heaped measure do not admit of being stricken, and
                    cannot conveniently be sold by weight. It is enacted that all such articles may
                    in future be sold by the imperial bushel, but as having its form defined by the
                    act 5 Geo. IV. cap. 74, for the sale of heaped measure, the diameter being
                    nineteen and a half inches outside, or any multiple or aliquot part thereof,
                    also defined by the same act, such being filled in all its parts as nearly even
                    with the brim as the size and shape of the articles will admit (see foot-note,
                    p. 846); but nothing herein shall prevent the sale by weight of any article
                    formerly sold by heaped measure. All coals, slack, culm, and cannel of every
                    description, shall be sold by weight and not by measure, under a penalty of 40s.
                    for every sale.</p>
                <p>All articles sold by weight shall be sold by avoirdupois weight, except gold,
                    silver, platina, diamonds, or other precious stones, which may be sold by troy
                    weight; and drugs, which, when sold by retail, may be sold by apothecaries’
                    weight. The weight denominated a stone shall in all cases consist of fourteen
                    standard pounds avoirdupois; the hundredweight of eight such stones, or 112
                    lbs.; and the ton of twenty such hundredweights; but nothing herein shall
                    prevent any bargain, sale, or contract being made by any multiple or aliquot
                    part of the pound weight.</p>
                <p>All weights of one pound avoirdupois, or more, shall have the number of pounds
                    contained in them stamped or cast <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=890" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0890-0850"/>on
                    the top or side, in legible figures or letters; and all measures of capacity
                    shall have their contents stamped or marked on the outside in legible figures
                    and letters.</p>
                <p>The stamping of weights entirely composed of lead or pewter, or of any mixture
                    thereof, is prohibited; but nothing herein shall prevent the use of lead or
                    pewter, or any mixture thereof, in the manufacture of weights, if these are
                    wholly and substantially cased with brass, copper, or iron, and legibly stamped
                    or marked “cased or shall prevent the insertion of such a plug of lead or pewter
                    into the weights as shall be <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> necessary for
                    adjusting them, and receiving the impression of the stamp. Nothing herein shall
                    require any single weight above fifty-six lbs. to be inspected or stamped, nor
                    any wooden or wicker measure used in the sale of lime, or other articles of the
                    like nature; or any glass or earthenware jug or drinking cup, though represented
                    as containing the amount of any imperial measure, or of any multiple thereof;
                    but any person buying by any vessel represented as containing the amount of any
                    imperial measure, or of any multiple thereof, is authorized to require the
                    contents of such vessel to be ascertained by comparison with a stamped measure,
                    to be provided by the person using such wooden or wicker measure, glass jug, or
                    drinking cup, and if such comparison be refused, or the measure be found
                    deficient, the person using the same shall be liable to the penalties imposed on
                    those using unjust weights or measures.</p>
                <p>The following is a tabular view of the weights and measures, according to the
                    present state of the law, throughout the British empire. In some of the
                    colonies, however, and particularly in India, a variety of other weights and
                    measures besides is still in use, as will be noticed in the sequel. It is only
                    necessary to observe, that all the quantities in the same horizontal line of the
                    same table are equal to each other.</p>

                <p>In these two weights the grain, ounce, and pound are the same. The troy is used
                    for the precious metals and for jewels, as also in trying the strength of
                    spirituous liquors, and for comparing different weights with each other. Four
                    grains troy make a carat. But this terra when applied to gold denotes its degree
                    of fineness. Thus, the weight of any quantity or compound of that metal being
                    supposed to be divided into 24 equal parts, if the mass be pure gold, it is said
                    to be 24 carats fine. If it consist of 23 parts of pure gold and 1 of alloy, it
                    is said to be 23 carats fiue, and so on. Diamonds and pearls are also weighed by
                    carats of 4 grains, but 5 diamond grains are only equal to 4 troy grains. This
                    sort of weight is not very different all over the globe. There are 150 diamond
                    carats in the troy ounce. Apothecaries' weight is chiefly used for medical
                    prescriptions; but drugs are mostly bought and sold, especially in wholesale, by
                    avoirdupois weight.</p>

                <p>This measure came first into operation 1st January 1826, but has only been
                    compulsory as the sole legal measure of capacity since 1st January 1836. The
                    peck, bushel, coomb, and quarter are dry measures only.</p>
                <p>In beer measure, the barrel consists of 36 gallons = 4 firkins, and the hogshead
                    contains 1½ barrel or 54 gallons. The anker, tierce, hogshead, puncheon, pipe,
                    butt, and tun, used for wine and spirits, are so vague and variable in their
                    contents, that they are to be considered rather as the names of the casks than
                    as expressing any fixed or definite measures. However, such vessels are usually
                    gauged, and have their contents, whatever they may be, marked on them. But for a
                    great variety of local and customary weights, measures, and packages of a less
                    general nature, we beg to refer to the Second Report of the Parliamentary
                    Commissioners on Weights and Measures, to Buchanan’s Treatise on the same
                    subject, and to Waterston’s Manual of Commerce.</p>
                <p>In the old English wine measure, 32 gills = 8 pints = 4 quarts = 1 gallon = 83311
                    imperial gallon; so that 6 old wine gallons were very nearly equal to 5
                    imperial.</p>
                <p>In the old English ale measure, 8 pints = 4 quarts = 1 gallon = 1·01704 imperial
                    gallon.</p>
                <p>All the denominations of the old English or Winchester dry measure were the same
                    as those of the imperial, but each of the former was less than the latter in the
                    proportion of 32 to 33 nearly, or, more accurately, of ∙969447 to 1. Wherefore,
                    each of the Winchester measures will be reduced to imperial by multiplying it by
                    ·969447.</p>

                <p>In Scotish troyes, or Dutch weight (which, under the name of French troys, was,
                    by the acts of the Scotish parliament of 1617 and 1618, declared to be the only
                    legal weight for Scotland, and the standard of which was committed to the
                    keeping of the borough of Lanark), 4696 drops = 256 ounces = 16 lbs. = 1 stone =
                    17·391885 lbs. avoird., according to the verdict of the Edinburgh jury (4th
                    February 1826), from weighing the original Lanark stone, then in the custody of
                    the Dean of Guild of Edinburgh. But in practice the Dutch stone was more
                    generally reckoned, and probably was adjusted to, 17·5 lbs. avoirdupois; or 4
                    Dutch stones were = 5 imperial stones of 14 lbs. each. In this way although 8
                    Dutch stones were said to form the standard Scotish meal boll, it was commonly
                    reckoned to be just ten imperial stones, or 140 lbs. avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>The tron weight, although condemned to be utterly abolished by the statutes above
                    cited, continued in use, and varied throughout Scotland from 21 to 28 ounces
                    avoirdupois to the pound, which in Edinburgh contained 22 of these ounces. It
                    was generally used for butter, cheese, and in many places for butcher∙meat, hay,
                    &amp;c. Its multiples and subdivisions were similar to those of the Dutch. A
                    stone of 16 lbs. avoirdupois, called customary weight, was also to be met with
                    in many places both in England and Scotland. Nay, in some places this went by
                    the name of Dutch weight, while the Dutch, again, was called Edinburgh
                    weight.</p>
                <p>The Scotish ell was = 37·0598 imperial inches; and 1920 ells = 320 falls = 8
                    furlongs = 1 mile = 1·123024 imperial mile. The Scotish chain for land measure,
                    like the imperial, consisted of 100 links, and though often reckoned to have
                    been just 74 imperial feet, was more correctly = 24 ells = 74·1196 feet; and
                    5760 square ells = 160 falls = 10 square chains = 4 roods = 1 acre = 1∙261183
                    imperial acre. Scotish acres will therefore be reduced to imperial, by
                    multiplying them by 1·261183. Twenty-three Scotish acres made about 29 imperial,
                    or, more nearly, 134 Scotish = 169 imperial.</p>
                <p>In the old Scotish liquid measure, 128 gills = 32 mutchkins = 16 chopins = 8
                    pints = 1 gallon = 3·00651 imperial gallons.</p>
                <p>Although several of the old Scotish dry measures were very different in different
                    districts, most of them were similarly subdivided, having 64 lippies or forpets
                    = 16 pecks = 4 firlots = 1 boll. In some of them, however, the bolls, especially
                    where they were large, had very different sorts of subdivisions. But for an
                    account of these, we must, for brevity’s sake, refer to Mr Buchanan’s very
                    complete treatise on the subject. The proportion of an entire boll of each to
                    the imperial measures, as determined by the verdicts of the juries in the
                    different counties, in terms of the act 5 Geo. IV., cap. 74, will be seen from
                    the following table, which may often be of use in interpreting contracts or
                    leases based on the old measures.</p>

                <p>The old Linlithgow corn measures (which by acts of the Scotish parliament of 1617
                    and 1618 were declared to be the only legal measures for Scotland, the wheat
                    firlot heaped having till then been used for barley and oats, when an equivalent
                    separate firlot for these was first introduced) were also, previously to the
                    imperial measures, used in the counties of Dumfries, Edinburgh, Haddington,
                    Lanark, Peebles, Perth, and Wigton. They differed little from the one of the two
                    bolls used in several other counties, especially that for wheat, as will be seen
                    from the table. The term <hi rend="italic">boll</hi> is still retained, six
                    imperial bushels being generally reckoned to the boll of barley or oats, and
                    four such bushels to the boll of wheat, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the old Irish measures, 11 miles were equal to 14 imperial miles, and 121
                    acres made 196 imperial acres. Twenty imperial stones were reckoned a barrel of
                    wheat, peas, beans, or rye; 16 a barrel of barley, bere, or rapeseed; 14 a
                    barrel of oats; and 12 a barrel of malt. To the Winchester quarter were reckoned
                    41 stones of wheat or rye, 24 of barley, 22 of oats, and 20 of malt. Of the old
                    Irish gallons, 200 made 157 imperial gallons.</p>
                <p>The troy grain is equal to ∙064792 French gramme, the troy lb. = ∙373202
                    kilogramme; the avoirdupois lb. = ∙453544 kilogramme. The British yard = ∙914379
                    metre; the mile = 1∙609305 kilometre; the acre = ∙404667 hectare; the gallon =

                    intelligible to the general reader.</p>
                <p>The metre is then equal to 10 decimetres = 100 centimetres = 1000 millimetres =

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Système Usuel,</hi> or Binary System, of the French, was
                    introduced in 1812, for the accommodation of retail trade, to make a sort of
                    compromise with the common people, who shewed an irreconcileable aversion to the
                    innovations of the metrical or decimal system. It has the metrical standards for
                    its basis; but their divisions, &amp;c. instead of being decimal, are chiefly
                    binary, that is, they proceed principally by continually halving or doubling
                    some of these standards, though partly according to other divisions of the old
                    system; and instead of the metrical vocabulary, the names of ancient weights and
                    measures are employed, annexing the term <hi rend="italic">usuel</hi> to each.
                    Thus, the toise usuelle = 2 metres = 78·74158 Brit. inches. The pied usuel is
                    one sixth of the toise, and is subdivided into twelfths or inches, &amp;c. The
                    aune usuelle = 12 decimetres = 1·2 metre = 47·2449 Brit. inches. The litron
                    usuel = 1 litre = 1·7608 Brit. pint. The Boisseau usuel is one eighth of the
                    hectolitre, and = 2·7512 Brit. gallons. The livre usuelle is half the
                    kilogramme, and = 1·10243 lb. avoird. The halves, quarters, eighths, &amp;c. of
                    the most of the above are also in use. A summary of the ancient French system
                    will be found in the preceding part of this article.</p>
