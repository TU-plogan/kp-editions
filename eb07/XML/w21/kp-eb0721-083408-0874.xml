                    to sketch shortly, and possibly with some novelty, the early history of the
                    invention, which claims attention from the high antiquity it holds among the
                    mechanical arts; and then to furnish descriptive notices of several balances,
                    some of them of recent date, and not described, it is believed, or at least
                    collectively so, in any previous work.</p>

                <p>The most ancient instrument used for ascertaining weight, and the one from which
                    the others were derived, was probably the common or equal-armed balance. It may
                    have been invented much about the same period as the yoke or swing-tree employed
                    to attach two beasts of burden to a common load. Both inventions were nearly
                    allied in construction; and their approximation in the nature of the object to
                    be effected by their instrumentality, leaves little doubt that the one
                    originated the idea of the other. In their first rude formation, they seem to
                    have been indiscriminately used, both for weighing and equably dividing the
                    labour of draft. Accordingly, the Greek words <hi rend="italic">ζυγὸς</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">ζυγὸν,</hi> and their Latin derivative <hi rend="italic"
                    >jugum,</hi> were employed to signify either the balance or yoke. In the Hebrew,
                    the word used in the oldest books of Scripture to denote the balance, is one
                    which is descriptive of the instrument itself, by having reference, through
                    related words, to weighing and the ascertainment of weight; while the word for
                    yoke, without having descriptive reference to any instrument, signifies
                    literally <hi rend="italic">upon;</hi> seemingly in allusion to an already known
                    contrivance being laid as a yoke, over or upon the necks of the two draft
                    cattle; a custom which still prevails in the east, as it anciently did in all
                    countries. From the analogy furnished by the double application of the Greek and
                    Latin terms, it may be concluded, that the beam of the balance was the
                    instrument thus apparently referred to, and that it was therefore the earlier
                    invention of the two.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    peculiar views in regard to the translation of the Greek word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ζυγὸν,</hi> gives priority to the yoke, rather incidentally perhaps than
                    otherwise, since the question of date does not affect his argument.</p></note>
                    '</p>
                <p>That the balance was the first of strictly mechanical contrivances, is not
                    perhaps improbable. Its great antiquity is attested by its being the only
                    machine commemorated among the twelve signs. The name bestowed by the Greeks and
                    Romans on this girdle of constellations was <hi rend="italic">ζωδιαχὸς,</hi>
                    zodiac, a word having reference exclusively to living creatures. The balance
                    being an inanimate object, seems therefore to have been long rejected by them,
                    and its place supplied by giving to <hi rend="italic">Scorpio</hi> a double
                    share of the heavens; the twelve names being then completed by applying the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Chela,</hi> to denote that half of the sign into which the two
                    claws of the animal extended. The introduction of <hi rend="italic">Libra,</hi>
                    or the balance, does not seem to have been fully sanctioned even in Virgil’s
                    time; for although elsewhere named by him, he describes its place as offering a
                    favourable vacancy for the reception of Caesar among the constellations; and
                    poetically figures the scorpion’s claws as already contracting to make room for
                    him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Georgics, i.
                    32.</p></note> The ancient claims of the balance were however revived, and the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Chela</hi> disappeared from the number of the signs.
                    Among other nations, the balance held its place in the zodiac from the highest
                    antiquity. Along with the other signs, it is sculptured on the most ancient
                    monuments of Egypt; but that this was not their birth-place, may be inferred
                    from the contrast between the figures of the signs and those native and
                    strangely fantastical devices with which the Egyptian monuments are otherwise so
                    profusely covered. The Abbé Pluche, arguing from another circumstance, viz. the
                    non-accordance of the seasons in Egypt with those which he considers the signs
                    as marking, traces their invention to the plains of Shinar, and refers it to the
                    near descendants of Noah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Pluche, Histoire du Ciel, Paris, 1739, v. i. pp. 18—30. A short memoir of
                    this author will be found in its proper place in a former volume of the present
                    work.</p></note> The annexed figure represents an ancient and well-formed
                    balance from Egyptian sculpture. For the sake of distinctness, however, it is
                    here shown as off the equilibrium. A line and plummet hang from the beam, to
                    mark when a tongue, which points downward, reaches the vertical position.</p>
                <p>Others, of a much ruder description, and without any contrivance to indicate
                    equilibrium, are given by Rosellini, from ancient Egyptian paintings.</p>
                <p>The steelyard has generally been regarded as of greater antiquity than the common
                    balance; but in point of conception it is less simple, and likely therefore to
                    have been of subsequent invention. The correctness of this inference admits
                    perhaps of being fully established. In Job and the Pentateuch, by much the
                    oldest records extant, the Hebrew term employed to denote the balance is <hi
                    rend="italic">moznaim,</hi> a word of plural, or, as pointed by the Masorites,
                    dual import. The kind of balance intended by it can be no other therefore than
                    the common one; the dual word <hi rend="italic">moznaim</hi> evidently bearing
                    reference to the two scales.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In nine passages of our version of the Bible, <hi
                    rend="italic">mornaim</hi> is translated in the plural <hi rend="italic"
                    >balances,</hi> and in seven passages <hi rend="italic">balance,</hi> Were the
                    term <hi rend="italic">scales</hi> employed for the plural rendering, and <hi
                    rend="italic">pair of scales</hi> for the singular, the English would express
                    the original with much fidelity.</p></note> That it cannot mean the steelyard,
                    appears to be clear, because in it only one scale was required, while in every
                    respect it is destitute of any double member from which a dual name could have
                    arisen. This view, which appears to be decisive, is confirmed by the definition
                    given of the word by Gesenius, who explains it to mean <hi rend="italic">the
                    balance, properly a pair of scales.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Leo’s Gesenius, Cambridge, 1825, p. 386. The argument (in
                    support of which Gesenius is here quoted) receives similar confirmation from the
                    Greek, in which the singulars <hi rend="italic">ζυγὸς</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ζυγὸν.</hi> were generally employed to denote the yoke, and their <hi

                <p>The common balance being therefore the one mentioned in Job, is ascertained to
                    have been in use 2130 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>. or 218 years after
                    the deluge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    chronology here followed is the common one, adopted and specially vindicated in
                    this instance by Townsend (Chronological Arrangement of the Old Testament, 1826,
                    v. i. p, 28). Dr Andrew, in his Scripture Chronology, 1822, p. 33, dates the
                    time of Job 2215 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>. and Dr Hales, in his
                    Analysis, vol. i. p. 185, 2337 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c</hi>.</p></note> How
                    much earlier than this it may have been used, cannot safely be conjectured. The
                    knowledge of it probably came down, through Noah’s family, from antediluvian
                    times; for without some means of ascertaining weight, the ordinary transactions
                    of every-day traffic could not in any age have been carried on.</p>
                <p>From the preceding observations, it appears likely that any allusion to the
                    steelyard in the Bible should be made by a noun possessing a strictly singular
                    termination. The earliest use of such a word having reference to the subject, is
                    in the time of Solomon, about 1014 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> It
                    occurs in Proverbs <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> xvi. 11, where the term <hi
                    rend="italic">pheles</hi> (explained by Gesenius, p. 643, to be <hi
                    rend="italic">a balance, equipoise, properly a steelyard)</hi> is followed by
                    the word <hi rend="italic">moznaim,</hi> already noticed. In the English
                    version, this passage is translated <hi rend="italic">a just weight</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among the Hebrews, as among
                    the Greeks, the shekel, manch, and talent, were names of particular weights, by
                    which their money and other precious articles were weighed. The Hebrew word for
                    commercial or general weight was <hi rend="italic">eben,</hi> literally <hi
                    rend="italic">a stone,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ebenim,</hi> in the plural,
                    <hi rend="italic">stones;</hi> probably the origin of the term stone
                    weight.</p></note><hi rend="italic">and balance,</hi> &amp;c. A more correct
                    rendering would be, <hi rend="italic">a just balance and scales;</hi> first,
                    because <hi rend="italic">pheles</hi> has been preserved in the Arabic to the
                    present day as meaning, not a weight, but a weighing instrument; and, secondly,
                    because the word occurs again in Scripture, viz. Isaiah, xl. 12, where its sense
                    is fixed by the immediate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=876" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0876-0836"
                    />context. In this passage, as in the former instance, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">pheles</hi> precedes <hi rend="italic">moznaim,</hi> both words
                    being brought together, and occurring in a parallelism. The passage referred to
                    is rendered in our version, “who hath weighed the mountains in scales, and the
                    hills in a balance.” The word here rendered scales in the plural, is the
                    singular noun <hi rend="italic">pheles;</hi> while that rendered balance, is the
                    dual word <hi rend="italic">moznaim.</hi> The English therefore would better
                    accord with the original, were the terms in the translation reversed in order,
                    and read thus: “who hath weighed the mountains in a balance, and the hills in
                    scales.”</p>
                <p>Whether <hi rend="italic">pheles,</hi> however, means properly a steelyard, as
                    Gesenius defines it, may be doubted. The reason for supposing it does, seems
                    apparently to rest on the circumstance that <hi rend="italic">kapheles</hi> in
                    the Arabic (most probably a corruption of <hi rend="italic">hapheles,</hi> the
                    definite form of the Hebrew word) is the name of the Arabian weighing instrument
                    of the present day; and because it now is a steelyard, and is known to have been
                    in long and almost exclusive use in Arabia, and indeed in all Asia, that
                    therefore the related or parent word <hi rend="italic">pheles</hi> must denote
                    the steelyard. But this rests on the assumption that the common balance had
                    never been known to the Arabians. Job, however, who is shewn to have been an
                    Idumaean Arab, and to have resided in the north of Arabia,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Horne’s Critical Stud, of the Scriptures,
                    1825, v. iv. pp. 74, 75.</p></note> does not use <hi rend="italic">pheles,</hi>
                    but <hi rend="italic">moznaim,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Job, vi. 2, and xxxi. 6.</p></note> to express the balance;
                    a word which, as already shewn, denotes the common or equal-armed one, and at
                    that period of course undoubtedly used in Arabia.</p>
                <p>Perhaps both words may therefore be regarded as synonymous terms for the common
                    balance; the one descriptive of it by reference to its beam or balance-rod, and
                    the other by reference to its pair of scales. This view receives further
                    confirmation from the circumstance that there is one Hebrew word in the Bible
                    which may be shewn to refer with some distinctness to the steelyard. Isaiah, in
                    a passage subsequent to that above quoted, when describing the construction of
                    idol images, says, “they (the Babylonians) weigh silver in the balance,” &amp;c.
                    (chap, xlvi. 6); and here makes use of the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic"
                    >kaneh</hi> to denote the kind of balance meant. Gesenius, p. 699, explains this
                    word to be <hi rend="italic">a cane, or measuring reed, or scale for measure; a
                    beam or lever of a balance, or balance itself</hi> The word has thus evident
                    reference to a graduated staff or beam,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this sense it occurs in many passages. Thus, Ezekiel, xl.
                    3-5: " With a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed...and in the man’s
                    hand a measuring reed of six cubits long; so be measured the breadth of the
                    building,” &amp;c.</p></note> and probably therefore when used, as in the
                    present instance, to express a weighing instrument, denotes rather the graduated
                    steelyard, of which it is thus descriptive, than an ordinary balance or pair of
                    scales. As it is not used to express a weighing instrument in any other passage
                    of the Bible, and as Isaiah is here giving a minutely graphic picture of the
                    process observed by the Babylonians in the manufacture and correct adjustment of
                    the weight of their gods, it is probable that the instrument named was an
                    eastern invention, constructed in all likelihood of the sugar or “sweet cane,” a
                    sense in which the word <hi rend="italic">kaneh</hi> is also used.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus, in Jeremiah, vi. 20:
                    “To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >the sweet cane from a far country</hi>; your burnt-offerings are not
                    acceptable, nor your sacrifices <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> unto
                    me.”</p></note> These remarks appear to receive some illustration from the fact,
                    that in China and the East Indies a small steelyard (described in our article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance,</hi> p. 306) is employed to weigh precious metals,
                    gems, &amp;c.; and to this day is made of wood or ivory, and not improbably also
                    of cane, a substance which, from its combined lightness and strength, is well
                    suited for the purpose.</p>
                <p>This is probably the first mention of the steelyard on record, viz. in Isaiah’s
                    time, or about 780 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>; at which f&gt;eriod it
                    thus appears to have been in use among the Baby-onians. It seems to have
                    superseded the common balance in Asia; and, through the Romans, to have come
                    into extensive use in Europe. The annexed figure is a representation of one made
                    in the first century, and not long since recovered from the ruins of Pompeii,
                    which town, with many of its inhabitants and their utensils, lay buried, for
                    nearly eighteen centuries, in the shower of volcanic matter thrown out by
                    Vesuvius, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 79. Like some of our steelyards, this
                    ancient one is provided with two different centres of suspension. It wants
                    however the knife-edged bearers now universally used. In the progress of
                    invention, the modifications of the steelyard have become numerous in the form
                    of compound machines; but these are of comparatively modern date, and do not
                    require successive detail. Descriptions of the most useful varieties of the
                    balance will be found here, and under our previous articles on the subject; and
                    as it is intended to embrace the present opportunity of classifying their
                    different kinds under distinct heads, references to those already described will
                    be introduced in their proper place.</p>

                <p>This is a compound steelyard, and is used for ascertaining the weight of loaded
                    carts. The apparatus, of which a ground-plan is here given, is arranged in a box
                    ABCD, which is about twelve inches deep, and is sufficiently sunk in the ground
                    to place the highest part of the completed machine on a level with the line of
                    road.</p>
                <p>A fixed wooden bridge, by which the horse may pass across the machine, is laid
                    over the middle part of the box. At each side of this bridge is a metal
                    wheel-track. On these the cart is rested by its two wheels and a prop-staff. The
                    tracks are fixed to and borne up by a platform (or skeleton frame) placed below
                    the wooden bridge, but above the works. The platform has four short feet, the
                    lower ends of which are formed into small hemispherical cavities. These cavities
                    rest at E, F, G, H, on pointed studs about an inch long. The two studs at E and
                    F are fixed on the crooked lever AKB, with their points upward, and the two at G
                    and H are similarly fixed on the companion-lever DIC. Sharpened studs, also
                    about an inch long, project downward from the four extremities of the crooked
                    levers. The points of these studs rest in small hemispherical cavities, formed
                    at the upper ends of blocks which are fixed as bearers for them in each corner
                    of the box. The short parts of the crooked levers parallel to OL, and near the
                    middle of the box, have their under edges sharpened, and rest on the angle of a
                    sustaining fulcrum IK, which passes through, and is fixed to the lever OM. This
                    lever is also crossed at L by the fulcrum which forms the common centre of
                    movement for the whole machine. The angle of the fulcrum points downward, and
                    rests, as in the ordinary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=877" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0877-0837"
                    />balance, on concave arcs, situated one on each side of the lever OM. These
                    arcs are formed on the upper end of a block, which rises from and is fixed to
                    the bottom of the box. The lever is again crossed at M, by a fulcrum having its
                    angle pointing upward; and from this angle a receiving scale for the weights is
                    hung by a shears or double ring. In cases where it is wished that the machine
                    when unloaded should preserve equilibrium, the lever OM is prolonged to the
                    left, and loaded at that end, to the extent requisite to balance the weight of
                    the levers.</p>
                <p>A side view of BK, one of the limbs of the crooked lever AKB is here given, in
                    the direction of the diagonal BD. The lever, as shewn in the figure, is kneed to
                    an extent sufficient to admit of the angular points of the fulcra being placed
                    in the same horizontal line. The other limb AK is of the same shape. The form of
                    the entire lever AKB is thus easily understood. Its companion lever DIC is of
                    the same construction. The limbs of the levers are therefore so shaped that the
                    fourteen sharp bearing parts of all the fulcra are situated, during equilibrium,
                    in one horizontal plane. These bearing parts, and the parts they bear against,
                    are all formed of polished steel.</p>
                <p>If now EA be supposed a tenth part of the length of EK, then 100 pounds placed on
                    the platform, or on the wheel-tracks, and pressing therefore on the studs E, F,
                    G, H, will be sustained by ten pounds of an upward pressure at IK. And if,
                    again, OL be a tenth part of LM, the ten pounds of upward pressure will be given
                    by one pound placed in the receiving scale at Μ. These proportions are assumed,
                    for easy arithmetical illustration; but in the practical construction of the
                    machine, the distance between the resting points at E, A, and at O, L, is made
                    to bear a greater ratio to the distance between the resting points at E, K, and
                    at L, M, than has here been supposed. Instead of using a receiving scale, the
                    lever OM may be prolonged to the right, and graduated as a steelyard. And in
                    machines where an upward instead of a downward pressure is given at M, the lever
                    OM is prolonged to the left, and the fulcrum L and its resting-block removed to
                    N.</p>
                <p>Machines consisting of variously modified systems of levers have been used for a
                    considerable period. The one above described is that generally employed. The
                    arrangement of the levers is well conceived, and exactly suited for the purpose
                    to which the machine is now chiefly applied. Its first contrivance and
                    employment is said to have been for weighing the riders of race-horses.</p>
                <p>The beam of this balance consists of two rods, at some distance apart, but united
                    so as to move together. The scales are supported above this rectangular beam;
                    the rising and sinking of the frames in which they rest, and by which they bear
                    on the knife-edges at each extremity of the beam, being regulated by a parallel
                    movement, the levers of which are placed in the stand of the balance. It is
                    understood to have been of French invention, and is a convenient form of
                    machine; but the bearings, which are numerous, and liable to be somewhat
                    displaced, give rise to considerable friction, and occasionally to slight
                    derangements of the leverage. Some improvements on it in these respects were
                    patented by Mr Poupard of London. In his machine there are still however three
                    parallel knife-edge bearings, three circular ones, and other sources of
                    friction, which, from the construction necessary for the proper ascent and
                    descent of the scales, cannot be avoided. The working parts of the machine are
                    mostly cased up to protect from dust. In the annexed figure, some of these
                    casings are omitted, that the representation may be properly intelligible.</p>

                    progressive Resistance from Properties strictly mechanical.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head we place Ludlam’s balance, introduced about 1760, and an improved
                    modification of it, named the bent lever. Ludlam’s is described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> p. 371, and the bent lever under the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance.</hi></p>
                <p>This balance, by Mr Brady of London, is provided with different points of
                    suspension for the scale, and is a modification of the bent lever one. In the
                    upper end of its lever are three cavities, at different distances from the
                    centre of movement, from any of which the scale may be hung. For each cavity
                    there is a separately graduated arc. The three arcs are placed one above
                    another, and move through an opening in the bar or shears which carries the
                    receiving scale, the edge of the bar serving the purpose of a pointer. When the
                    scale is hung from the cavity next the upper end of the lever, the beam becomes
                    horizontal, each ounce, as far as two pounds, being indicated on the upmost arc.
                    When hung from the middle cavity, each alternate ounce, as far as eleven pounds,
                    is indicated on the middle arc; and when hung from the remaining cavity, each
                    quarter pound, as far as thirty pounds, is indicated on the lowest arc. In point
                    of principle it differs from the bent lever thus far, that the acting mass of
                    the counterpoise is altered (for the most part increased) by the accumulating
                    weight of the graduated arcs and their strengthening stays as they pass the
                    vertical line from the centre.</p>
                <p>The balance by Mr Dampier of Ware is in this respect the reverse of Mr Brady’s.
                    Here a circular disc or wheel is employed, which, as it turns on its centre, is
                    balanced in any position, and therefore neither adds to nor diminishes the
                    acting mass of the counterpoise, which is hinged on a round stud placed in the
                    rim of the disc. The scale is similarly attached to the rim of the disc, a
                    little more than a quarter circumference intervening between the two studs. The
                    pointer is formed in the suspending frame or stand which supports the axis, and
                    the graduations are marked on the upper part of the circle. This construction is
                    a modification both of the bent lever and Ludlam’s balance, and, in cases where
                    the weights to be examined are of small amount, is preferable to the former.</p>
                <p>The foregoing self-adjusting balances are placed together, as being nearly
                    allied, and having a similar extent of movement, viz. something short of a
                    quadrant.</p>
                <p>In this balance (manufactured by Messrs Milne, Edinburgh), the opposing arms are
                    formed of grooved eccentric, or spiral curves. These are acted on by the cords
                    or flat chains which suspend the counterpoise and receiving scale, and are thus
                    caused to move round on their common axis, which is placed in the pole of the
                    curves. In the annexed figure the dial is supposed to be transparent, and being
                    fixed in front to the curved balance, moves along with it. The pointer is
                    stationary, and is fastened to the shears or fork which suspends the balance,
                    and indicates on the dial as it passes round. By the changes of leverage which
                    occur in the course of revolution, the counterpoise rises from a small power to
                    a greater; while the scale, in proportion as it becomes loaded, contracts
                    throughout from a greater leverage to a less. This general <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=878" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0878-0838"
                    />principle of combined changes of leverage affords a favourable means of
                    employing an unchanging weight to balance others, both greater and less than
                    itself; and at the same time admits of the parts necessary to produce powerful
                    and sustained resistance being practically formed within convenient compass. The
                    self-adjusting power thus generally obtained is regulated in the rate of its
                    increase by a definite construction of the curves, which are formed to cause
                    equable as well as progressive resistance, by which means the balance is moved
                    through equal angles by equal weights. The graduated scale extends to three
                    quadrants, more or less. The chief advantage of the balance is, that it combines
                    this lengthened primary movement with equable graduation and unyielding
                    mechanical construction. The different sizes of which it is made have each an
                    appropriate form of curve. The least is fitted for the minute subdivision of
                    small weights; the next indicates to four or sixteen ounces; and larger sizes
                    range to twenty, fifty, 100 pounds and upward. In the adjoining figure, the
                    spiral arms, which before are in the same vertical plane, and merge into one
                    continuous curve, here occupy different planes; but being united by an
                    intermediate rod, which passes through the upright of the stand, they have
                    simultaneous movement The dial is fixed to the bearing-frame, and the pointer is
                    carried round by the axis. The graduation, which in this form may be prolonged
                    to any desirable extent, occupies a full circuit. In other respects, the
                    description already given is alike explanatory of both balances. There are some
                    minutiae which give refinement to their action; but as these are used only in
                    particular machines, they are not represented, and need not be described in
                    detail. A delicately constructed modification of the instrument is also arranged
                    to shew, on inspection, and without the use of eke-weights, the specific
                    gravities and weights per cubic inch of different fluids.</p>

                <p>The spring is supposed to have been applied to the purposes of weighing about the
                    year 1690 or 1700. About this period the dynanometers of Graham and Desaguliers
                    were superseded, first by Monsieur Leroy’s of the Academy of Sciences, who
                    applied to the purpose the compression of a spiral spring; and next by Monsieur
                    Regnier’s, in which the distention of an elliptical one was adapted to the same
                    end, both springs being then also in use as balances. The spring-balance is
                    constructed in a variety of modified forms; but in all of them the weights under
                    examination are caused either to bend a plain spring, or to compress or extend
                    an elliptical, semi-elliptical, or spiral one; or both to compress and extend
                    the spring when formed to admit of this. The amount to which any of these
                    descriptions of spring yields to different stated weights, is shewn on a
                    graduated scale properly situated for the purpose. The principle of extension is
                    preferable to the other, inasmuch as it is put in operation by simpler and less
                    complex means; and when the weights to be examined are large, the elliptical
                    spring should be adopted; but when these are of a moderate amount, the spiral
                    form is best. For many purposes the spring-balance is a convenient instrument,
                    but not a lasting one. The spring, when fresh and unused, is equable in its
                    successive yieldings, but is liable to variations, which cause it gradually to
                    lose correspondence with the divisions. It is affected by temperature, and
                    weakened by use; and if overstrained or corroded, its power and quality are
                    materially changed. In some balances an extra spring is introduced to adjust
                    these irregularities; but this should be omitted, as its operation increases the
                    chance of error, without removing the cause; for though the pointer, when
                    displaced, may he restored by it to zero, there are then two acting springs
                    changed in position, quality, and strain, while the line of graduations remains
                    as it was derived from the original elasticity of the leading spring.</p>
                <p>In this balance, by Mr Marriott of London, the spring is formed into an arbitrary
                    curve, and is placed in a shallow brass box behind the dial, which latter is
                    here supposed to be transparent; one end of the spring is fixed to the upper
                    side of the box, and the other end to the head of the rod which carries the
                    hook. Near the same point of this rod is also attached the head of the
                    rack-plate, which, as the hook becomes loaded, is lowered by the spring and
                    turns the pinion, and with it the pointer, which indicates the weight.</p>
                <p>When in use, the portion of the spring to the left is extended, and that to the
                    right compressed; and during descent, the rack is kept in gear with the pinion
                    by a screw-pin at its right side.</p>
                <p>This balance, by Mr Salter of London, is represented in the annexed figure, the
                    index-plate in front being supposed transparent. It is formed of a spiral
                    spring, which is contained in the upper part of a cylindrical case, behind the
                    index-plate. One extremity of the spring is fastened at the head of the
                    instrument, and the other extremity is fixed to the rod which carries the
                    pointer and the hook or scale. The spring extends in proportion as the hook is
                    loaded; the pointer at the same time shewing the weight on the graduated front.
                    Mr Salter subsequently made some alterations, which he patented; most of them
                    however relate to minor details, and need not be described.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Self-adjusting Balances, whose progressive Indications are
                    regulated by the Properties of Fluids.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head may be included several of the various instruments for
                    ascertaining specific gravities, which are described under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hydrodynamics,</hi> p. 22-25. Although most of these require eke-weights to
                    complete their range of indications, they are nevertheless of self-adjusting
                    character; their principle of adjustment depending on the different depths to
                    which fluids of varied density permit the graduated stem of the instruments to
                    sink. Here also may be mentioned Mr Harris’s electrometer, described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> p. 658, a balance in which the resistance is
                    obtained by the accumulating power which an elongated counterpoise acquires when
                    caused to emerge from a fluid; the same principle being further illustrated
                    under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Gas-Light,</hi> p. 353—54, where its
                    application to the progressive balancing of the gasometer is explained.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=879"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0879-0839"/>
                <p>This balance, by Mr Hawkins of London, consists of a cylindrical vessel open at
                    top, on the face of which is a vertical glass tube also open above, and entering
                    the cylinder near its base. Within this outer case is another hollow cylindrical
                    drum, of rather smaller diameter, on the top of which is placed the receiving
                    scale. The inner cylinder floats on the water which the outer one contains. In
                    proportion as the scale is loaded, the water rises between the cylinders and in
                    the glass tube, beside which is a graduated scale, the weight being indicated by
                    the height which the fluid attains in the tube. The water carried off by
                    evaporation should be replaced, as much being poured in from time to time as is
                    required to preserve its surface at zero when the scale is empty. The continual
                    effort of the inner cylinder to escape to the sides of the outer one is,
                    however, a source of considerable friction; a slight displacement of the
                    cylinder from the horizontal position, or the loading of the scale more on one
                    side of its centre than another, contributing to augment the evil.</p>
                <p>This balance, by Mr Bursill of Islington, is formed in a variety of different
                    modifications; some of them depending on a stem or piston being caused to sink
                    in a fluid, and others on its being caused to rise from one. It may however be
                    generally described as consisting of two cylinders of different diameter united
                    by a connecting tube. From the top of the smaller cylinder rises a glass tube,
                    at the side of which is a moveable index-plate, on which the graduations are
                    marked. Mercury is poured to some depth into the cylinders, the smaller of
                    which, together with the lower part of the glass tube, is then filled up with
                    oil or coloured water, which rests on the surface of the mercury. A piston or
                    stem, guided by a parallel movement, rises and falls in the larger mercurial
                    holder. A counterpoise on one of the parallel rods balances the weight of the
                    scale; and when the latter is loaded, the displacement of mercury in the larger
                    cylinder causes the water to rise in the tube by more perceptible gradations,
                    and indicate the weight. The balance is likewise arranged in various
                    combinations with the steelyard, and two contrivances (one of which may be added
                    to the machine) are provided with the view of compensating the irregularities
                    caused by change of temperature. The cylinders for the mercury are formed of
                    pipe-clay; and a stop-cock is placed at the head of the tube, to be opened
                    during use to admit air, and closed afterwards to exclude dust and diminish
                    evaporation.</p>
                <p>This machine, by Captain Ericson of London, is represented in the annexed figure.
                    It consists of a shallow circular box of cast iron, formed of two portions, an
                    upper and under one; the interior diameters of which are somewhat different. The
                    lower half of the box contains a piston, the neck of which passes freely through
                    an aperture in the bottom, and is screwed to the horizontal bar of the
                    triangular suspending frame. A circular piece of India rubber cloth is laid over
                    the face of the piston, and continued through between the joining rims of the
                    iron box, the halves of which are then screwed together upon it. From the upper
                    half of the box rises a hollow iron stem, sufficiently laid open to expose to
                    view a glass tube, which it encloses in a bed of Paris plaster. Mercury is then
                    introduced through the tube into the upper half of the box; and its escape being
                    prevented by the cloth, and the distention of this resisted by the piston, the
                    box and stem are set afloat, and are kept from capsizing by a small pin from the
                    top of the triangular frame, which enters into the bore of the upright stem. The
                    hook is connected with the box, and, on being loaded, draws it down, thereby
                    causing the ring of cloth exterior to the circumfe rence of the piston to
                    descend below the piston’s surface; —in effect thus contracting the space in the
                    box, and forcing the mercury up the tube till it indicates the weight on the
                    graduated scale. Two safety-screws in the lower bar are adjusted to prevent the
                    box from descending so far as to eject the mercury from the tube; and, as in Mr
                    Bur-sill’s, a stop-cock is placed at the mouth, to be opened during use to admit
                    air, and shut after it to exclude dust and diminish evaporation. In this
                    machine, the primary movement must necessarily be extremely confined (about the
                    50th or 100th part of an inch), otherwise the cloth, by being overstretched,
                    would give way. Any deviation from uniform action, however arising, and however
                    trifling, is thus apt to occasion a magnified irregularity in the indication.
                    The admission of dust and evaporation of mercury; the effort made by this fluid
                    at all points to draw into globular formations, and avoid the minuter recesses
                    of the holder; the change of temperature, and progressive distention and
                    wrinkling of the cloth, are among the more immediate and least controllable
                    sources of variation.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Letter and Post-Packet Balances.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this general title are enumerated such of the preceding as are applied to
                    the purpose of weighing letters; descriptions of the balances not yet noticed
                    being subjoined.</p>
                <p>1. The Common, the Roman, and Danish balances; 2. the Bent-lever, Brady’s,
                    Dampier’s, and Lothian’s balances; 3. Salter’s and other Spring-balances; 4.
                    Bursill’s balance, all as above described, are constructed also of sizes suited
                    for letter-weights.</p>
                <p>In this balance, which was devised for letter-weighing by Sir John Robison,
                    secretary to the Royal Society, Edinburgh (and made by Mr Forbes there), the
                    letter is placed on a circular ivory disc, which is supported by a steel wire,
                    that passes freely through a small orifice in the ivory cap of a glass tube
                    filled about a third of its depth with mercury. To the lower end of the wire is
                    screwed a cylindrical ivory stem of larger diameter than the wire, and marked
                    with circular graduations. This sinks in the fluid in proportion as the disc is
                    loaded; and the vertical movement is preserved by guide-pins, which diverge from
                    the lower extremity of the stem. A loose ring of ivory serves the purpose of a
                    floating pointer, while it prevents the eye being deceived by the glance of the
                    fluid, or the images occasioned by its reflecting powers. Shortly afterwards,
                    letter-balances of similar description were made by Messrs Miller, Dundee; Lund,
                    Fleet Street; Osler, Birmingham; and Bursill, Islington; the three latter being
                    registered designs.</p>
                <p>The remaining balances may properly be arranged by themselves, as a class formed
                    to indicate periodical amounts of weight, but not their intermediate
                    subdivisions.</p>
                <p>In the balance by Mr Riddle of London, weights of an ounce each are rested on the
                    successive steps of a pyramidal support. A ring attached to one arm of a balance
                    lifts the lowest, and proceeds to the others in their order; the postage
                    corresponding to the number of weights raised being indicated by a pointer. In
                    Mr Gye’s balance three rings fixed at proper heights give support to as many
                    weights, which are attached by a small chain to the arm of a balance, each
                    weight being lifted in succession, and the postage known by the number of
                    weights raised. Mr Riddle’s arrangement, however, provides for a more exact
                    movement.</p>
                <p>This balance, by Professor Willis, Cambridge (made by Messrs HotzapffeD, is
                    formed of two beams joined at some distance apart, so as to form a rectangular
                    frame, which the: figure of Poupard’s balance above described will serve to
                    illustrate. Here also, as in that balance, the receiving scale <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=880" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0880-0840"/>is
                    placed above the beam, and is similarly guided in its descent by a parallel
                    movement placed in the stand. The two beams are angularly notched in the manner
                    shewn in the adjoining figure, which represents a side plan of the balance. Five
                    cylindrical bars of adjusted weight rest in the arms of a rack, which supports
                    them horizontally across each pair of notches, and at increasing elevations from
                    the stand. These bars successively take their appropriate place on the double
                    beam, and are each lifted by, and become as it were a part of it, so soon as the
                    load placed on the scale exceeds the stated amount. Thus, when a letter exceeds
                    half an ounce, the beam rises to, but does not lift, the first bar; when it
                    exceeds an ounce, it lifts the first, and rises to, but does not raise, the
                    second; and so on to the fifth. When it exceeds this, an eke-weight which
                    accompanies the machine is placed in the square-shaped notches at the extremity
                    of the beam, and five ounces or their corresponding postage are added to the
                    subsequent indications of the balance, which anew traces the same progression.
                    The weights or postages are marked on an upright which is fixed at one end of
                    the stand, and are pointed out by a wire extended between the two beams of the
                    balance.</p>
                <p>In this balance, by Mr Freeman, Sutton-Common, there are various fixed angular
                    fulcra and a constant weight. The beam, which is loaded at one end, rests on the
                    angular fulcrum nearest the weight. The fulcrum is supported at each end by a
                    frame which rises from the top of a pillar. The upper surfaces of the two
                    supporting frames are obtusely rounded, and notched at intervals suited to
                    receive each fulcrum in its turn. When a letter exceeds a half ounce, the beam
                    turns on, but does not quit, the first fulcrum. When it exceeds an ounce, it
                    turns on, but does not quit, the second, and so on; the resting extremities of
                    each successive fulcrum taking their appropriate place in a new pair of notches,
                    and a pointer below shewing the result. This balance in general conception is a
                    counterpart, or very nearly so, to Mr Willis’s, but is one which perhaps
                    scarcely admits of being practically formed for very effective operation.</p>
