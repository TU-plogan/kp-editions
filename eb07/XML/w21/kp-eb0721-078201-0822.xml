                <p><label type="entry">WARWICKSHIRE</label>, an inland county of England, and nearly
                    in the centre of the kingdom. It is bounded on the western side, from north to
                    south, by Staffordshire, Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire; and on the eastern
                    side by Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Oxfordshire. Its greatest length
                    from north to south is about forty-eight, and its breadth across the middle
                    thirty-two miles. It contains 902 square miles, or 577,280 statute acres. It is
                    divided into four hundreds, besides the city of Coventry, which, with its
                    liberties, extends over about 18,000 acres. The hundreds are subdivided into
                    several smaller portions, for the local administration of the law, in which
                    petty sessions courts are held.</p>
                <p>In no part of England has the population increased of late years in a greater
                    ratio than in this county, the numbers at the several decennial censuses having
                    been as follows, viz., in 1801, 208,130; in 1811, 228,733; in 1821, 274,392; in
                    1831, 336,610. If the augmentation has proceeded with the same rapidity as in
                    the ten years from 1821 to 1831, it will be found at the enumeration of 1841,
                    that the inhabitants have been doubled in forty years.</p>
                <p>The number of inhabited houses in 1831 was 68,253, comprising 72,357 families. Of
                    those families, 15,880 were chiefly employed in agriculture; 43,291 were chiefly
                    occupied in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and 13,186 were not comprised
                    in either of the two preceding classes. The number of males twenty years of age
                    was 83,239; the occupiers of land employing labourers were 2838; the occupiers
                    of land not employing labourers, 1142; the labourers employed in agriculture
                    were 15,644. The persons employed in manufacture or in making manufacturing
                    machinery were 11,357; in retail trade, or in handicraft as masters or workmen,
                    32,579; the capitalists, bankers, professional or other educated men, 4012; the
                    labourers in employments not agricultural, 10,358; the other males twenty years
                    of age (except servants), 3729; male servants under twenty years of age, 3729;
                    male servants more than twenty years of age, 1562; those under twenty years of
                    age, 884; and female servants of all ages, 13,089.</p>
                <p>Although Warwickshire is an elevated district, it is in general level. The rivers
                    flow with a languid course, and the undulations of the surface are rare and
                    gentle. It is generally enclosed, and the fields are of moderate extent. The
                    fences are for the most part high and umbrageous, being thickly planted with
                    forest-trees, so that, though woods are rare, the face of the country seems, at
                    a distance, to be one continued tract of woodland. There are but few common
                    fields, and very little waste or barren land. The extent of pasture land is
                    greater than in most parts of England, and is estimated to be more than half of
                    the whole. The pasture land, calculated at 300,000 acres, may be said wholly to
                    be appropriated to the sustenance of the different species of animals. 100,000
                    acres are annually mowed for hay, and the other two thirds are used for feeding.
                    The agriculture of the country is well conducted. The cultivation of turnips is
                    practised to a great extent, with much skill, and with very productive effects.
                    The crops of wheat, barley, oats, pease, beans, and tares, are quite as
                    luxuriant as in any portion of England. The cows are generally of the long-homed
                    kind, but among them there are many varieties. The ancient breed of Warwickshire
                    sheep has been crossed with the Leicester breed, and this mixture has produced
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> kind adapted to the land, and equal to any race in the
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>The streams of this county are numerous, out, with the exception of the Avon, are
                    inconsiderable; though, by the means of irrigation which they furnish, they are
                    of great value to its rural economy. The whole of them run directly or
                    indirectly to the Severn. The Avon is navigable for barges from Stratford to its
                    junction with that river near Tewkesbury. The intercourse of the county is much
                    facilitated by the numerous canals that intersect and connect it with every part
                    of England; supply every part with cheap fuel; and serve to convey its heavy
                    productions to the exporting towns, London, Liverpool, and Bristol. These canals
                    are the Birmingham Old Canal, the Birmingham and Fazeley, the Warwick and
                    Birmingham, the Worcester and Birmingham, the Coventry, the Warwick and Napton,
                    the Stratford, the Ashby de la Zeuch, and, above all, the Grand Junction. This
                    county, as it is the central one of the kingdom, is become also a focal point
                    for the most easy access from any one part of England to all the others. This
                    has arisen from the magnificent railroad completed since 1834. A daily
                    communication is by this great work kept up between London and the most distant
                    cities of the kingdom. It enters the county near Rugby, and passes through
                    Coventry to Birmingham, where it enters into Staffordshire; but in its passage
                    sends out, or will soon do so, branches to the midland counties, as well as by
                    Nottingham and Derby to York, from whence other branches will be formed to the
                    most distant parts of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The minerals and fossils of this county are coal, iron, limestone, and freestone.
                    At Leamington Priors are mineral springs, whose celebrity has made that place
                    one of the resorts of fashionable company, as well as invalids. The waters
                    contain neutral and sulphureous salts, with carbonate of iron. Owing to the
                    growing reputation of these waters, the town, which in 1801 contained only 500
                    inhabitants, is said now to have increased its population to 12,000, and its
                    beauty has similarly increased. The numerous objects of attraction near to it,
                    and the fertility and salubrity of the neighbourhood, have added to the growth
                    and prosperity of the place.</p>
                <p>This county possesses considerable manufactories, of which the greatest are those
                    in metals of all kinds, conducted upon a stupendous scale at Birmingham, and the
                    towns and villages in its vicinity. The minute divisions and subdivisions of
                    labour, the various mechanical inventions, the discoveries in chemistry, and the
                    industrious and economical habits of the people, have rendered this part of the
                    country the principal reservoir from whence the world is supplied with domestic
                    utensils, ornaments, and a thousand minute articles which add much to the
                    comfort of civilized life. The city of Coventry has long been celebrated for its
                    manufactures of ribbons, and other goods of silk, which now give occupation, in
                    that place and its vicinity, to more than 15,000 persons. There are also at
                    Coventry large undertakings for making watches; a trade that has of late been
                    much extended. Mills for spinning cotton and wool have been erected at Warwick;
                    and to them is attributed the great increase which has lately taken place in the
                    population of that town. At Tamworth very large works are constructed for
                    printing calicoes. At Alcester, several hundred persons are employed in making
                    needles. In several parts of the county much linen yarn is spun.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable objects in the county are Kenilworth Castle, now in a
                    dilapidated state; Maxstoke Castle, a most extensive pile; Comb Abbey, a
                    Cistertian convent; the school-house at Rugby; and the house at Stratford in
                    which Shakspeare was born.</p>

                <p>This county has furnished titles to two British peers, the earl of Warwick and
                    the earl of Coventry; and one Irish peer, Baron Arden. For election purposes,
                    the county is divided into two parts, distinguished as the northern and
                    southern. The election for the northern division is held at the town of
                    Coleshill; and the other polling places are Nuneaton, Coventry, Birmingham, and
                    Dunchurch. The election for the southern division is held at Warwick; and the
                    other polling places are Kineton, Stratford, Henley, and Southam. Two members
                    from Warwick, two from Coventry, and since the reform act two from Birmingham,
                    are sent to the House of Commons. Two are also sent from Tamworth, the largest
                    part of which is in the adjoining county of Stafford.</p>
