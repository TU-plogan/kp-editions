                <p><label type="entry">WOOD-ENGRAVING</label> is the art of representing objects on
                    wood, by lines and points, in order to their being impressed on paper. This art
                    is of very ancient date, having been practised by the Egyptians. Some bricks
                    found on the site of ancient Babylon are preserved in the British Museum, with
                    characters upon them which have plainly been indented from engraved blocks of
                    wood. It appears also, from specimens that are extant, that the Greeks and
                    Romans were acquainted with methods of wood-cutting for impressing letters and
                    characters on various substances. The probability of the art being known to the
                    Chinese, or actually having been carried to the extent of delineating figures,
                    in the thirteenth century, has been successfully disproved by Mr Jackson, in his
                    able and learned Treatise on Wood-Engraving. The art was however used in the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries for attesting documents, and about the
                    commencement of the fifteenth century, by the Germans, for marking figures on
                    playing-cards.</p>
                <p>The most ancient wood-cut of which there is any authentic account, is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">St Christopher</hi> carrying an infant Christ through the water,
                    now in the possession of Earl Spencer. It is eleven and a quarter inches high,
                    and eight and one eighth inches wide. The impression is dated in 1423; and the
                    figures of the saint and the youthful Saviour are executed with very
                    considerable spirit and feeling. W∞d-cuts of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annunciation</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">St Bridget of Sweden</hi> appear to
                    belong to this period, when tire art began to be much encouraged by the church.
                    Heineken, in allusion to this, tells us, that “having visited in my last tour a
                    great many convents in Franconia, Suabia, Bavaria, and in the Austrian states, I
                    everywhere discovered in their libraries many of those kinds of figures,
                    engraved on wood, and pasted either at the beginning or the end of old volumes
                    of the fifteenth century. I have indeed obtained several of them. These facts,
                    taken altogether, have confirmed me in my opinion, that the next step of the
                    engraver in wood after playing-cards, was to engrave figures of saints, which,
                    being distributed and lost among the laity, were in part preserved by the monks,
                    who pasted them in the earliest printed books with which they furnished their
                    libraries.”</p>
                <p>Between 1430 and 1450, several works technically called block-books, chiefly
                    illustrative of the Scriptures, appeared. The most remarkable among these is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Apocalypse, or History of St John,</hi> which was probably
                    engraved in 1434, and is reputed to have been the production of Laurence Coster,
                    a Dutchman. According to Heineken, there have been six editions of this book.
                    “Though some of the designs,” Jackson observes, “are very indifferent, yet there
                    are others which display considerable ability, and several of the single figures
                    are decidedly superior to any that are contained in the other block-books. They
                    are drawn with greater vigour and feeling.” The figures in another of these
                    block-books, called the <hi rend="italic">History of the Virgin,</hi> are also
                    very gracefully delineated, and the style in which the cuts are engraved
                    exhibits a more advanced stage of the art than we find in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocalypse.</hi> Another specimen of block-books is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Βiblia Pauperum</hi> (see Plate CCCCXIII. art. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Printing</hi>), the figures it contains having, it is
                    conjectured, been executed for the purpose of imparting a knowledge of sacred
                    history to those who could not afford to purchase a manuscript copy of the
                    Scriptures. Several of the cuts in this work, though rude, are not inexpressive
                    of the scenes which they represent. The <hi rend="italic">Alpha-</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=957"

                    figures from wood-engravings, was probably executed about the middle of the
                    fifteenth century; and Jackson, judging from their style, thinks that they are
                    the work of a native of France.</p>
                <p>Wood-engraving began to be combined with printing after the invention of the
                    latter art, in the fifteenth century. In the <hi rend="italic">Psalter,</hi>
                    printed by Faust and Schoeffer at Mentz in 1457, the large initial letters
                    engraved in wood are so beautiful that they have never been excelled. From the
                    perfection which these letters exhibit, it is evident that the workmen were
                    trained to the art. The practice of introducing wood-cuts became general in
                    Germany, and was known in Italy, towards the end of the fifteenth century. The
                    first books in the English language containing wood-engravings were those
                    printed by Caxton about 1476. The use of cross hatchings (which are black lines
                    crossing each other generally diagonally) produced a great change in the art,
                    giving colour and shadow to the subjects.</p>
                <p>The next attempt at improvement in this art was by Hugo da Carpi, to whom is
                    attributed the invention of <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro.</hi> Carpi was an
                    Italian; but the Germans also claim the invention, and produce in evidence
                    several engravings by Mair, a disciple of Martin Schoen. His mode of performing
                    this was very simple. He first engraved the subject upon copper, and finished it
                    as much as the artists of his time usually did. He next prepared a block of
                    wood, upon which he cut out the extreme lights, and then impressed it upon the
                    print; by which means a faint tint was added to all the rest of the piece,
                    excepting only in those parts where the lights were meant to predominate, which
                    appear on the specimens extant to be coloured with white paint. The drawings for
                    this species of engraving were made with a pen on tinted paper, and the lights
                    were drawn upon the paper with white paint.</p>
                <p>But there is a material difference between the chiaroscuro of the old German
                    masters and that of the Italians. Mair and Cranach engraved the outlines and
                    deep shadows upon copper. The impression taken in this state was tinted over by
                    means of a single block of wood, with those parts hollowed out which were
                    designed to be left white upon the print. On the contrary, the mode of engraving
                    by Hugo da Carpi was, to cut the outline on one block of wood, the dark shadows
                    upon a second, and the light shadows, or half-tint, upon a third. The first
                    being impressed upon the paper, the outlines only appeared. This block being
                    taken away, the second was put in its place, and being also impressed on the
                    paper, the dark shadows were added to the outlines; and the third block being
                    put in the same place upon the removal of the second, and also impressed upon
                    the paper, made the dim tints, when the print was completed. In some instances
                    the number of blocks was increased, but the operation was still the same, the
                    print receiving an impression from every block.</p>
                <p>Albert Durer, towards the end of the fifteenth and commencement of the sixteenth
                    century, was the great promoter of wood-engraving. It is supposed that many of
                    the wood-cuts, though bearing his name, were only engraved from drawings made on
                    the block by him. “One of the peculiar advantages of wood-engraving,” Mr Jackson
                    observes, “is the effect with which strong shades can be represented; and of
                    this Durer has generally availed himself with the greatest skill. On comparing
                    his works engraved on wood with all those previously executed in the same
                    manner, we shall find that his figures are not only much better drawn and more
                    skilfully grouped, but that, instead of sticking, in hard outline, against the
                    back-ground, they stand out with the natural appearance of rotundity. The rules
                    of perspective are more attentively observed, the back-grounds better filled,
                    and a number of subordinate objects introduced, such as trees, herbage, flowers,
                    ani mals, and children, which at once give a pleasing variety to the subject,
                    and impart to it the stamp of truth. Though the figures in many of his designs
                    may not indeed be correct in point of costume,—for though he diligently studied
                    nature, it was only in her German dress,—yet their character and expression are
                    generally appropriate and natural. Though incapable of imparting to sacred
                    subjects the elevated character which is given to them by Raffaele, his
                    representations are perhaps no less like the originals than those of the great
                    Italian master.”</p>
                <p>Besides Durer, there were Burgmair, Cranach, Schauf-flein, and other German
                    artists of celebrity, who engraved on wood. At this period the best
                    wood-engravings were of considerable size, and designed in a bold and free
                    manner; and at no time was the art more encouraged and esteemed. Hans Holbein,
                    in 1538, produced the <hi rend="italic">Dance of Death,</hi> in a series of
                    wood-cuts, which for truth and freedom of execution has never been surpassed.
                    “The manner,” Mr Jackson remarks, “in which they are engraved is comparatively
                    simple; there is no laboured and unnecessary cross-hatching where the same
                    effect might be obtained by simpler means; no display of fine work merely to
                    show the artist’s talent in cutting delicate lines. Every line is expressive,
                    and the end is always obtained by the simplest means. In this the talent and
                    feeling of the engraver are chiefly displayed. He wastes not his time in mere
                    mechanical execution, which in the present day is often mistaken for excellence;
                    he endeavours to give to each character its appropriate expression; and in this
                    he appears to have succeeded better, considering the small size of the cuts,
                    than any other wood-engraver, either of times past or present.”</p>
                <p>Wood-engraving now made considerable progress in Italy, particularly in Venice;
                    and the engravings of this period in that country were little inferior to the
                    German works. The art rather declined on the continent about the end of the
                    sixteenth century, when copperplate engraving came into use. In England, it
                    continued to flourish, as several works of the time show. Jegher of Antwerp, who
                    was born in 1578, was so eminent in the art, that he was employed by Rubens to
                    work under his inspection; and he executed several pieces which are held in much
                    estimation. They are particularly distinguished for boldness and spirit. Towards
                    the end of the seventeenth century, wood-engraving was greatly neglected, and
                    was employed only for common decorations, and never almost to delineate any
                    subject of interest.</p>
                <p>About the year 1723, John Michael Papillon produced many successful works in
                    wood-engraving, particularly ornamental foliage, flowers, and shells. In 1766,
                    he published his History of Wood-Engraving, the cuts in which are his own
                    workmanship. The book, although deficient in many respects, evinces a laudable
                    diligence in bringing the art into more extended employment.</p>
                <p>Wood-engraving was for many years in a very degenerate state, and almost wholly
                    lost, till it was revived in England by the celebrated Thomas Bewick. This
                    artist was born in the parish of Ovingham, in Northumberland, in 1753. Having
                    shown a taste for drawing, he was entered apprentice with Mr Ralph Beilby,
                    engraver, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne; and in 1775 he had made such progress as to
                    obtain a premium from the Society of Arts for his wood-engraving of the “old
                    hound.” He afterwards produced his well-known History of Quadrupeds, which was
                    succeeded by his History of British Birds and other standard works, which
                    brought him so much celebrity, that he was universally hailed as the reviver as
                    well as improver of the art. His great excellence was the singular fidelity of
                    his designs. “It needs only to glance at the works of Bewick,” observes an
                    anonymous writer, “to convince ourselves with what wonderful facility the very
                    countcnance <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=958"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0958-0918"/> and air of his animals are marked and
                    distinguished. There is the grave owl; the silly, wavering lapwing; the pert
                    jay; the impudent, overfed sparrow; the airy lark; the sleepy-headed gourmand
                    duck; the restless titmouse; the insignificant wren; the clean, harmless gull;
                    the keen, rapacious kite; every one has character. There are no ‘ muffin faces.’
                    This is far beyond the mere pencilling of fur or feathers; it is the seizure and
                    transfusion of countenance. In this Bewick’s skill seems unapproached, and
                    unapproachable, by any other artist who has ever attempted this line.” This was
                    written in 1825, during the lifetime of Bewick; and since that time, although he
                    has perhaps been surpassed by some of his pupils in mechanical skill, none has
                    equalled him in his truthful conception and delineation of nature.</p>
                <p>John Bewick, brother to Thomas, acquired the art from him, and practised it in
                    London for several years. His abilities, though respectable, were not so
                    brilliant as those of his brother. His cuts have not the same interest, and his
                    style of engraving is not considered very good. He died in 1795, aged
                    thirty-five. His more illustrious brother Thomas lived till 1828, and continued
                    to ply his art till within a short time of his death. Wood-engraving is much
                    indebted to this famous artist, not only for the excellence to which he brought
                    it, but for the taste he created for such productions; a taste which has been
                    maintained by the many admirable works of his pupils, and other artists of the
                    present day. Of late, wood-engraving has made considerable progress in Germany
                    and France.</p>
                <p>The wood generally used by wood-engravers is box, which, from its hardness and
                    toughness, bears the action of the press better than any other; and the smallest
                    kinds, being the most compact, are preferred. The blocks are cut directly across
                    the grain. Before the drawing is made, the block is rubbed over with Bath-brick
                    and a little water. If the drawing is a delicate one, the block, except the
                    place where the artist commences, is covered with paper. The habit of using
                    magnifying glasses is not recommended to beginners.</p>
                <p>There are four kinds of cutting tools used in wood-engraving, <hi rend="italic"
                    >gravers, tint tools, gouges</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scoopers,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">flat tools</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chisels.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">gravers</hi> are of various sizes, and are employed for the
                    principal part of the work. What are called <hi rend="italic">tint-tools</hi>
                    are chiefly for cutting parallel lines. <hi rend="italic">Gouges</hi> are for
                    scooping out the wood towards the centre of the block, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >chisels</hi> for cutting away the wood towards the edges. The printing press is
                    employed in taking impressions from an engraved block of wood. “The block,”
                    according to Mr Jackson, “is inked by being beat with the pressman’s balls or
                    roller, in the same manner as type; and the paper being turned over upon it from
                    the <hi rend="italic">tympan,</hi> it is then run in under the <hi rend="italic"
                    >platten,</hi> which being acted on by the lever, presses the paper <hi
                    rend="italic">on to</hi> the raised lines of the block, and thus produces the
                    impression. Impressions from wood are thus obtained by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >on-pression</hi> of the paper against the raised or prominent lines.”</p>
                <p>Wood-engraving is now generally used in illustrating publications of all kinds.
                    “In the child’s first book,” Mr Jackson observes, “wood-cuts are introduced, to
                    enable the infant mind to connect words with things. The youth gains his
                    knowledge of the forms of foreign animals from wood-cuts; and the mathematician
                    avails himself of wood-engraving to execute his diagrams. It has been employed,
                    in the representation of religious subjects, as an aid to devotion; to celebrate
                    the triumphs of kings and warriors; to illustrate the pages of the historian,
                    the traveller, and the poet; and, by its means, copies of the works of the
                    greatest artists of former times have been afforded, at a price which enabled
                    the very poorest classes to become purchasers. As at least one hundred thousand
                    good impressions can be obtained from a wood-cut, if properly engraved and
                    carefully printed, and as the additional cost of printing wood-cuts with
                    letter-press is inconsiderable when compared with the cost of printing steel or
                    copper plates separately, the art will never want encouragement, nor again sink
                    into neglect, so long as there are artists of talent to furnish designs, and
                    good engravers to execute them.” The great utility of wood-engraving will
                    indeed, in all probability, prevent the art from ever again declining. Within
                    these few years it has attained a very high degree of perfection; and every day,
                    works are issuing from the press, adorned with the most varied specimens of this
                    valuable art. <hi rend="italic">(z.</hi> z.)</p>
