                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">WIT</label> is a quality of certain thoughts and expressions,
                    more easily perceived than defined. According to Locke, wit lies in the
                    assemblage of ideas, and putting these together with quickness and variety,
                    wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant
                    pictures and agreeable visions to the fancy. Addison limited this definition
                    considerably, by observing, that every resemblance of ideas does not constitute
                    wit, but those <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=946"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0946-0906"/>only which produce delight and surprise. Pope
                    defined wit to be a quick conception and an easy delivery; while, according to a
                    more recent writer, it consists in an assimilation of distant ideas.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">wit</hi> originally signified <hi rend="italic"
                    >wisdom.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">witte</hi> was anciently a <hi rend="italic"
                    >wise man;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">wirtenagemot,</hi> or Saxon parliament, an
                    assemblage of wise men. So late as the reign of Elizabeth, a man of pregnant <hi
                    rend="italic">wit,</hi> of great <hi rend="italic">wit</hi>, was a man of vast
                    <hi rend="italic">judgment.</hi> We still say, <hi rend="italic">in his wits,
                    our of his wits,</hi> for in or out of sound mind. The word however is now
                    applied in a more limited sense.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to expose the insufficiency of the definitions above
                    mentioned, or hazarding a new definition of our own, we shall endeavour to point
                    out the varieties or different sorts of wit.</p>
                <p>It is evident that wit excites in the mind an agreeable surprise, and that this
                    is owing entirely to the strange assemblage of related ideas presented to the
                    mind. This end is effected, 1. by debasing things pompous or <hi rend="italic"
                    >seemingly</hi> grave; 2. by aggrandizing things little or frivolous; 3. by
                    setting ordinary objects in a particular and uncommon point of view, by means
                    not only remote, but apparently contrary. Of so much consequence are surprise
                    and novelty, that nothing is more tasteless, and sometimes disgusting, than a
                    joke that has become stale by frequent repetition. For the same reason, even a
                    pun or happy illusion will appear excellent when thrown out extempore in
                    conversation, which would be deemed execrable in print. In like manner, a witty
                    repartee is infinitely more pleasing than a witty attack; for though in both
                    cases the thing may be equally new to the reader or hearer, the effect on him is
                    greatly injured, when there is access to suppose that it may be the slow
                    production of study and premeditation. This however holds most with regard to
                    the inferior tribes of witticism, of which their readiness is the best
                    recommendation. We shall illustrate these observations by subjoining a specimen
                    or two of each of these sorts of wit.</p>
                <p>Of the first sort, which consists in the debasement of things great and eminent,
                    Butler, amongst a thousand other instances, has given us those which follow.</p>
                <p>And now had Pboebus in the lap</p>
                <p>Of Thetis taken out his nap;</p>
                <p>And, like a lobster boil’d, the morn From black to red began to turn.</p>
                <p>Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> part ii. canto ii.</p>
                <p>Here the low allegorical style of the first couplet, and the simile used in the
                    second, afford us a just notion of this lowest species, which is distinguished
                    by the name of the <hi rend="italic">ludicrous.</hi> Another specimen from the
                    same author we have in these lines:</p>
                <p>Great on the bench, great in the saddle, That could as well bind o’er as swaddle,
                    Mighty he was at both of these, And styl’d of <hi rend="italic">war,</hi> as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">peace:</hi> So some rats of amphibious nature, Are
                    either for the <hi rend="italic">land</hi> or <hi rend="italic">water.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> part i. canto i.</p>
                <p>In this coarse kind of drollery, those laughable translations or paraphrases of
                    heroic and other serious poems, in which the authors are said to be travestied,
                    chiefly abound.</p>
                <p>The second kind, consisting in the aggrandisement of little things, which is by
                    far the most splendid, and displays a soaring imagination, these lines of Pope
                    will serve to illustrate:</p>
                <p>As Berecynthia, while her offspring vie</p>
                <p>In homage to the mother of the sky. Surveys around her in the blest abode, An
                    hundred sons, and every son a god: Not with less glory, mighty Dulness crown'd,
                    Shall take thro’ Grubstreet her triumphant round; And her Parnassus glancing
                    o’er at once, Behold a hundred sons, and each a dunce.</p>
                <p>This whole similitude is spirited. The parent of the celestials is contrasted by
                    the daughter of night and chaos; heaven by Grubstreet; gods by dunces. Besides,
                    the parody it contains on a beautiful passage in Virgil adds a particular lustre
                    to it This species we may term <hi rend="italic">thrasonical,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">the mock majestic.</hi> It affects the most pompous language and
                    sonorous phraseology, as much as the other affects the reverse, the vilest and
                    most grovelling dialect.</p>
                <p>To this class also we must refer the application of grave reflections to mere
                    trifles. For that <hi rend="italic">great</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >serious</hi> are naturally associated by the mind, and likewise little and
                    trifling, is sufficiently evinced by the common modes of expression on these
                    subjects used in every tongue. An apposite instance of such an application we
                    have from Philips.</p>
                <p>My galligaskins, that have long withstood The winter’s fury and encroaching
                    frosts, By time subdued, <hi rend="italic">(what will not time tubdue</hi> An
                    horrid chasm disclose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Splendid Shilling.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the third species of wit, which is by far the most multifarious, and which
                    results from what may be called the queerness or singularity of the imagery, we
                    shall give a few specimens that will serve to mark some of its principal
                    varieties. To illustrate all would be impossible. The first shall be where there
                    is an apparent contrariety in the things exhibited in connection. This kind of
                    contrast we have in these lines of Garth:</p>
                <p>Then Hydrops next appears amongst the throng;</p>
                <p>Bloated and big she slowly sails along: But like a miser in excess she’s poor,
                    And pines for thirst amidst her wat’ry store.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dispensary.</hi></p>
                <p>A second sort is, where the things compared are what with dialecticians would
                    come under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">disparates,</hi> being such as
                    can be ranked under no common genus. Of this we shall subjoin an example from
                    Young.</p>
                <p>Health chiefly keeps an Atheist in the dark;</p>
                <p>A fever argues better than a Clarke: Let but the logic in his pulse decay, The
                    Grecian he’ll renounce, and learn to pray.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Universal al Pastion.</hi></p>
                <p>A third variety in this species springs from confounding artfully the proper and
                    the metaphorical sense of an expression. In this way, one will assign as a
                    motive what is discovered to be perfectly absurd when but ever so little
                    attended to; and yet, from the ordinary meaning of the words, has a specious
                    appearance on a single glance. Of this kind we have an instance in the
                    subsequent lines.</p>
                <p>While thus the lady talk’d, the knight Turn’d th' outside of his eyes to white,
                    As men of inward light are wont To turn their optics in upon't.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> part iii. canto i.</p>
                <p>A fourth variety, much resembling the former, is when the argument or comparison
                    (for all argument is a kind of comparison) is founded on the supposal of
                    corporeal or personal attributes in what is strictly not susceptible of them, as
                    in the following passage.</p>
                <p>But Hudibras gave him a twitch</p>
                <p>As quick as lightning in the breech,</p>
                <p>Just in the place where honour’s lodg’d,</p>
                <p>As wise philosophers have judg’d; Because a kick in that place more Hurts honour
                    than deep wounds before.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> part ii. canto iii.</p>
                <p>The fifth and only other variety which we shall mention, is that which arises
                    from a relation, not in the things signified, but in the signs, of all relations
                    no doubt the slightest. Identity here gives rise to puns and clinches;
                    resemblance<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=947"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0947-0907"/> to quibbles, cranks, and rhimes. Of these it is
                    quite unnecessary to exhibit specimens.</p>
