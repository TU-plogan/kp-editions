                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">WOLOGDA</label>, one of those large divisions into which the
                    European part of the Russian empire is formed, and commonly denominated a
                    government or stadtholdership. The extent is given differently by several
                    authors; but as Storch seems the preferable authority, it is here given
                    according to his representation, at 151,074 square miles. It extends in north
                    latitude from 58° 23’ to 64° 56', and in east longitude from 38° 47’ to 57° 10'.
                    It is bounded on the north by Archangel, on the north-east by Tobolsk, on the
                    south-east by Perm and by Wiatka, on the south by Kostroma, on the south-west by
                    Jaroslaw, on the west by Novogorod, and on the north-west by Olonetz.</p>
                <p>The surface of this province is a most extensive plain, on the eastern side
                    touching the Ural Mountains, a few branches or spurs from which penetrate into
                    the north-east part. Besides these, no hills are to be seen, and but few
                    elevations, but immeasurable woods, broad heaths and morasses, small lakes, and
                    especially a most abundant supply of water in streams of all dimensions. The
                    soil is of various qualities, clayey, loamy, and sandy, and in some parts there
                    is good marl. There are however some tracts of good alluvial soil to be found
                    over the worst subsoils. In most parts it is capable of cultivation, but the
                    best portions are the south-west parts of the province. Cultivation in the whole
                    province requires watchfulness with respect both to the weather, the nature of
                    the soil, the rotation of crops, and the nature and quantity of manure; but,
                    with the greatest attention to them, it is not common to obtain more than five
                    times the quantity of the seed that is sown, even of rye, which is the most
                    extensive crop; whereas in barley and oats not three times the seed are commonly
                    obtained. Besides those kinds of grain, a little winter wheat is sown, and some
                    pease. It is only in very good years that sufficient corn for the consumption is
                    grown. According to Storch, the annual quantity of rye and wheat together does
                    not exceed four English bushels for each person. Flax and hemp succeed better
                    than either kind of grain. In some of the divisions beyond the Dwina, no other
                    corn but barley is attempted to be raised. In the northeast part no fruit is
                    grown; but in the south-west, in the gardens, apples and cherries come to a
                    tolerable degree of ripeness. The cultivation of potatoes has of late years been
                    introduced or extended, and affords a prospect of increasing the means of
                    subsistence.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing industry is not considerable, and only extends to common
                    necessaries, such as woollen and linen goods, from their own sheep and flax. A
                    little paper, some glass and earthenware, and a few metal articles, form the
                    chief part of the products, exclusive of the leather, and of the brandy, which
                    is distilled from corn in prodigious quantities. During the long nights of
                    winter, spinning flax or wool is the constant occupation of the females, and
                    hence much yarn is produced and sold to other districts.</p>
                <p>The trade is chiefly in domestic articles; and these are sent by the rivers or
                    canals in summer, or on sledges in winter, to St Petersburg or Moscow, by
                    merchants residing in the large towns. They are tallow candles, tar, peltry,
                    feathers, isinglass, marts, hogs’ bristles, turpentine, potash, and some wooden
                    furniture. There is a transit-trade, by which the productions of Siberia are
                    exchanged with those of Archangel. The number of persons employed in internal
                    navigation is very great; and besides these, others, living on the rivers that
                    are not navigable, are employed in summer in forming rafts of timber, which are
                    floated down by the stream till they reach the barges destined to convey them to
                    the places where the timber is wanted.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are, lst, The Dwina, which is composed of several rivulets,
                    which, when united, first receives that name within the province. It then
                    receives the waters of the Wytschegda, the Sysola, the Wym, the Keltma, and the
                    Ustjuga. After leaving the province, it is increased by the great stream of the
                    Vaga and its tributary brooks, and runs to the sea at Archangel. 2d, The
                    Petschora, a considerable river rising from the Ural Mountains, and forming a
                    means of intercourse between Tobolsk, Wologda, and Perm. It is navigable during
                    the whole summer, with a depth of from twelve to fourteen feet. There is also a
                    canal, constructed in 1786, which connects the waters of the rivers that run to
                    the Caspian with those that run to the Frozen Ocean. There arc many lakes, some
                    of them <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=955"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0955-0915"/>very extensive. The largest are the Kubenskoe, the
                    Piati-sorskoi, the Sandor, and the Rondas. This vast province, which in extent
                    is greater than Britain and Ireland, does not contain more than 940,000
                    inhabitants. These are divided into nobility, civil officers, clergy, colonists,
                    merchants, citizens, and peasants; the last being by far the most numerous. They
                    are in fact slaves, one third of whom belong to the nobility, and two thirds to
                    the crown. The whole of the inhabitants profess the Greek religion, and are
                    under the spiritual government of a bishop, whose see is in the city of Wologda.
                    'The capital of the province, and also of a circle, is the city from which it
                    takes its name. It stands on both sides the river Wologda, which divides it into
                    two nearly equal parts, and is without fortifications. It contains fifty-one
                    churches, of which six only are of stone, and the others wooden structures. It
                    has a monastery, a nunnery, an ecclesiastical seminary, some charitable
                    institutions, and public schools for 600 sons of the clergy. The dwellings are
                    1664, of which all but forty-five are of wood. The inhabitants are 12,100, among
                    whom are many tanners, tallow-chandlers, and some makers of silk, linen, and
                    woollen goods. The commerce chiefly consists of the produce of the soil, or of
                    such manufactured goods as are of the simplest fabrication, which are sent to
                    the seaports in exchange for the few foreign commodities which the condition of
                    society may render desirable. The city is 870 miles from St Petersburg. Long.
