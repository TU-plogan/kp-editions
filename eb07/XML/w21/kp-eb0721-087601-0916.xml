                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">WHITEHAVEN</label>, a large seaport and market town in the
                    parish of St Bees and ward of Allerdale, on the west coast of the county of
                    Cumberland. It is situated at the upper end of a small creek of the Irish Sea,
                    and comprises a number of handsome straight wide streets, which intersect each
                    other at right angles, and are well paved, and lighted with gas. The town has
                    advanced to its present state of prosperity from being, in 1566, a small place,
                    containing six fishermen’s huts. For this progress it is indebted to the family
                    of Killigrew, and more particularly to their successors the Lowthers, who,
                    having large estates around the town, and valuable possessions of coal
                    underneath it, have liberally come forward, when opportunities occurred, to
                    promote its prosperity. There are three churches, and various places of worship
                    belonging to dissenters. The institutions for educational purposes are numerous,
                    and educate more than 1700 children. There are also an infirmary, a fever
                    hospital, a dispensary, and a house of industry. The public buildings, including
                    a theatre and news-room, are well adapted for the instruction and amusement of
                    the inhabitants, as well as for the business of the port. Its harbour is
                    spacious and commodious, having seven piers extending into the sea in different
                    directions, and affording ample security to the shipping. There is attached to
                    the harbour a patent slip, erected at the expense of Lord Lonsdale. There are
                    two light-houses at the entrance of the harbour, and a third is situated on the
                    promontory of St Bees’ Head, three miles to the south-west. The commerce of this
                    port is very extensive; the principal export articles being coal, iron and lead
                    ore, grain, and lime. The chief manufactures are coarse linens, and articles
                    connected with the fitting out of vessels. The town contains iron and brass
                    founderies, and breweries. The coal-works are, next to those of Newcastle and
                    Sunderland, the most important in the kingdom, and are the principal source of
                    wealth to the town. There are five principal shafts or entrances to the mines,
                    called Bearmouths, three on the north and two on the south side of the town.
                    They are 320 yards in depth, and extend to a considerable distance under the
                    sea; and such vast quantities have been excavated that the mines have the
                    appearance of a subterranean city. In 1837 the quantity of coals shipped from
                    this port amounted to 405,593 tons, and in 1838 to 389,188 tons, exclusive of
                    the cinders and culm. The net amount of customs-duties, after deducting all
                    expenses, paid into the treasury, was, in 1837, L.95,895, and in 1838, L.97,300.
                    There are upwards of 450 vessels belonging this port, engaged in the American,
                    West Indian, Baltic, and coasting trade. Steam-vessels sail regularly to
                    Liverpool, Carlisle, Dublin, the Isle of Man, Annan, Dumfries, Wigton, and
                    Kirkcudbright. The town and port are governed by trustees appointed by the
                    trading community and Lord Lonsdale. Whitehaven returns a member to parliament.
                    The population in 1821 amounted to 12,438, and in 1831 to 11,393.</p>
