                <p><label type="entry">WYCLIFFE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, who was
                    born about the year 1324, derived his name from the place of his nativity, a
                    village six miles from Richmond in Yorkshire. From the era of the Norman
                    conquest, the family to which he is supposed to have belonged had been lords of
                    the manor, and patrons of the rectory of Wycliffe; and it is to be inferred that
                    his parents were able and willing to give him the best education which the
                    kingdom then afforded. In due time he became a commoner of Queen’s College,
                    Oxford, a seminary of very recent institution; but he speedily removed to Merton
                    College, which then enjoyed a higher reputation than any other house of
                    learning: the scholastic celebrity of Duns, Ockham, and Bradwardine, was alone
                    sufficient to consecrate its walls. Having been duly initiated in logic and
                    rhetoric, he directed his attention to other branches of knowledge. His
                    proficiency in the civil, the canon, and the municipal law, has been noticed by
                    Lewis, and other biographers; but his greatest efforts were devoted to the study
                    of theology, not merely that barren art which was then taught in the schools,
                    but that divine science which is derived from the spirit as well as the letter
                    of the Scriptures. In the prosecution of his inquiries, he had to contend with
                    numerous and formidable difficulties: the genius of the age was hostile to any
                    plan of study or mode of investigation which the church had not sanctioned; the
                    text of the sacred writings was in a great measure neglected, while its place
                    was supplied by systems of scholastic divinity; the original language of the
                    New, as well as the Old Testament, was almost totally unknown in the kingdom;
                    the inhabitants of the western world had almost universally surrendered their
                    understanding to the control of a body of priests, who reduced spiritual tyranny
                    and delusion to a complete system; and the student eagerly bent on the search of
                    divine truth, was left without encouragement and without a guide. But in spite
                    of all these disadvantages, Wycliffe pursued his course with alacrity and
                    perseverance. He arrived at a degree of scriptural knowledge which had not been
                    equalled for many centuries; and his veneration for the sacred writings procured
                    him the honourable appellation of the Evangelic Doctor.</p>

                    the age of thirty-two. In 1347, England had been visited by a pestilence, which
                    first made its appearance in Tartary, and after ravaging various countries of
                    Asia, proceeded by the shores of the Nile to the islands of Greece, and carried
                    devastation to almost every nation of Europe. So prodigious was the waste of
                    human life, that this quarter of the globe is supposed to have lost a fourth
                    part of its inhabitants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    "It may therefore be assumed, without exaggeration, that Europe lost during the
                    Black Death 25,000,000 of inhabitants.”</p></note> The direful distemper was
                    even communicated to the brute creation, and the land was covered with putrid
                    carcasses. These portentous signs of the times filled the pious mind of Wycliffe
                    with gloomy apprehensions, and led him to indulge in speculations respecting the
                    last age of the church. He arrived at the conclusion that the day of judgment
                    was not to be deferred beyond the close of the century in which he himself
                    lived. Many individuals of a visionary turn of mind, and some possessed of the
                    most vigorous understanding, have in various ages hazarded similar predictions.
                    It is stated by Dr Vaughan, that “the opinions and the feeling disclosed in this
                    production, though but imperfectly developed, are such as to prepare the reader
                    to anticipate in Wycliffe a devout opponent of the corruptions which it
                    describes with such solemnity and pathos. It is important to know, that even at
                    this period of his history, the nefarious practices connected with the
                    appointment of the clergy to the sphere of their duties, had so far shocked his
                    piety, as to dispose him to expect a speedy and signal manifestation of the
                    displeasure of heaven.” After an interval of a few years, he distinguished
                    himself by his strenuous opposition to the mendicant orders, who then infested
                    the best parts of Europe, and, under the pretext of betaking themselves to a
                    life of poverty and devotion, consumed the fruits of the earth, and too often
                    set an example which did not tend to edification. In 1360 he published his
                    Objections to the Friars, which were long afterwards committed to the press by
                    Dr James. The errors and vices of the mendicants, it has been remarked, had
                    never been so generally or so forcibly assailed; and while those who preceded
                    aimed only at the removal of particular abuses, he perceived that the
                    institution itself was unnecessary and pernicious. The friars were a class of
                    men whom it was dangerous to provoke; nor is it to be doubted that he thus made
                    a large addition to the catalogue of his enemies. His friends however were
                    likewise numerous. In 1361 the society of Balliol College presented him to the
                    rectory of Fillingham, in the diocese of Lincoln; and he became master of that
                    college in the course of the same year. In 1368, he exchanged this living for
                    Lutger-shall, in the archdeaconry of Bucks; a benefice of inferior value, but
                    situated at. a more convenient distance from Oxford. After retaining his
                    mastership for the space of four years, he was appointed warden of Canterbury
                    Hall, recently founded in the same university by Simon Islep, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, with a provision for twelve scholars, eight of whom were to be
                    secular clerks, and the remaining four, including the warden, were to be chosen
                    from the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury. The warden first nominated by the
                    founder, was one Wodehall, a fierce and turbulent monk, whom he soon found it
                    necessary to remove from his office. Wycliffe was invited to supply his place,
                    and the archbishop did not long survive. His successor in the primacy was
                    Langham, bishop of Ely, who had previously been abbot of Weslminster, and still
                    retained the spirit of a monk. Wodehall appealed to this new visitor, and found
                    the support which he expected. The appointment of Wycliffe having, with little
                    regard to law or fact, been pronounced null and void, a person named Radyngate
                    was first substituted in his place, and in the course of a few weeks Wodehall
                    resumed the office of warden. From this arbitrary sentence, Wycliffe appealed to
                    the sovereign pontiff; and, after an interval of several years, found it was
                    vain to expect that justice should flow from so polluted a fountain. The
                    decision of the pope was confirmed by the authority of the king, who did not
                    however pronounce an unbribed judgment.</p>
                <p>About the time when Wycliffe was appointed warden of Canterbury Hall, a
                    controversy had arisen between Urban the Fifth and Edward the Third, in
                    consequence of the renewed demand of an annual tribute of a thousand marks, as
                    an acknowledgment of the feudal superiority of the pontiff over the kingdoms of
                    England and Ireland. The payment of this degrading tribute had never been
                    regular, and it had been entirely discontinued for thirty-three years; but on
                    the renewal of the papal claim, the king thought it necessary to consult both
                    houses of parliament. “The prelates solicited a day for private deliberation;
                    but assembling on the morrow, the lords spiritual and temporal, and the members
                    of the commons, w ere unanimous in stating, that neither King John, nor any
                    other sovereign, had power thus to subject the realm of England, without consent
                    of parliament; that this consent was not obtained; and that, passing over other
                    difficulties, the whole transaction, on the part of the king, was in violation
                    of the oath <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=990"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0990-0950"/>which he had taken on receiving the crown. By the
                    temporal nobility, and the popular representatives, it was farther determined,
                    that should the pontiff commence his threatened process against the monarch of
                    England, as his vassal, the strength of the nation should be instantly called to
                    the king’s aid.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    sufficient number of defenders, when the usurpers have the power of bestowing a
                    sufficient number of rewards. The claims of the pope were maintained by some
                    nameless monk, who on this subject published a tract, in which he called upon
                    Wycliffe to refute his arguments. In this appeal to him by name, we discover an
                    obvious proof that his character had already become very conspicuous; and
                    although it was apparently the writer’s intention to do him an injury rather
                    than an honour, he did not decline the challenge which had thus been given. He
                    published a work in which he endeavoured to circumscribe the arrogant claims of
                    the church, and to fix the legitimate extent of civil authority: he maintained
                    the right of the king and his parliament to refuse the tribute claimed by the
                    court of Rome, to subject all ecclesiastics to the secular jurisdiction in all
                    civil cases, and even to alienate the property of the church. Some of his
                    opinions are so much at variance with the doctrines of the canon law, that he
                    had evidently made no inconsiderable progress in his retrograde motions from the
                    popish standard of orthodoxy.</p>
                <p>The question respecting the wardenship was finally decided in the year 1372, when
                    the king confirmed the sentence of the pope. Wycliffe now found other employment
                    in the university. Having taken the degree of D. D., says Lewis, he “publickly
                    professed divinity, and read lectures in it; which he did with very great
                    applause, having such an authority in the schools, that whatever he said was
                    received as an oracle. In these lectures he frequently took notice of the
                    corruptions of the begging friars, which at first he did in a soft and gentle
                    manner, till finding that his detecting their abuses was what was acceptable to
                    his hearers, he proceeded to deal more plainly and openly with them.” It is more
                    than probable that the influence which he exercised over his own age, is in some
                    degree to be ascribed to the circumstance of his occupying a theological chair
                    in this university, which about that period was frequented by a great multitude
                    of students. The invention of printing had not yet afforded the means of
                    disseminating knowledge with great facility, and with great rapidity: books,
                    which could only be multiplied by the slow process of transcription, were
                    necessarily sold at a high price; and the number of individuals capable of
                    reading them was surprisingly small. But the voice of the public teacher was
                    raised with living energy; and his opinions, inculcated with learning and
                    fervour, could not fail to influence those who in their turn were to become
                    public teachers.</p>
                <p>In the year 1374, he was employed in an embassy to the pope, Gregory the
                    Eleventh, whose residence was at Avignon. The first person named in the
                    commission is the bishop of Bangor, and the second is Dr Wycliffe. Their mission
                    had a reference to one of the flagrant abuses of that period, the papal
                    reservation of benefices in the English church. The ecclesiastical revenues, to
                    a very great amount, were appropriated in this manner, and in many instances
                    were most unworthily bestowed upon foreigners who were entirely unacquainted
                    with the language of the country, and who were sometimes of too tender an age to
                    be intrusted with the cure of souls. Against this branch of pontifical
                    usurpation, the statute of provisors had been enacted in the year 1350. The
                    embassy was not received at Avignon, but at Bruges; and with most of the
                    pontiffs it would have been an act of wisdom to keep all strangers at a distance
                    from their ordinary place of residence, which was too commonly the fountain-head
                    of all iniquity. John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, had at the same period
                    repaired to Bruges on another diplomatic mission; nor is it improbable that
                    Wycliffe may thus have had a favourable opportunity of recommending himself to
                    his powerful protection. The duke, as Dr Vaughan has remarked, is “the only son
                    of Edward the Third, whose name is connected with the religion of that period,
                    and who is known as the patron of Chaucer and Wycliffe.” It is not certain that
                    the latter returned to England before the year 1376; but in the mean time he
                    received different marks of the royal favour. He had formerly been nominated one
                    of the king’s chaplains. In the month of November 1370, the king presented him
                    to the prebend of Aust, in the collegiate church of Westbury, in the diocese of
                    Worcester, and about the same period to the rectory of Lutterworth in
                    Leicestershire, the presentation to this benefice having devolved upon the
                    crown, in consequence of the minority of the patron, Lord Ferrars.</p>
                <p>Wycliffe had now risen to high distinction, and if his views had been directed to
                    the ordinary objects of a mere churchman’s ambition, it is probable that he
                    might have obtained much higher preferment. Many individuals of the middle
                    classes were gradually added to the number of his converts; nor was the duke of
                    Lancaster the only man of rank and influence who regarded his person and
                    doctrines with a favourable eye. But his proceedings must for a long time have
                    excited the watchful jealousy of those who enjoyed the principal emoluments of
                    the church, and were suspicious of all spiritual innovations, lest they might
                    eventually lead to some encroachment on their own temporalities; for it has been
                    remarked in every age, that those well-beneficed clergymen who, by the general
                    tenor of their conduct, indicate the most perfect indifference as to the vital
                    interests of religion, are yet the most loud and vehement in proclaiming the
                    danger to which their “excellent establishment” must be exposed by the slightest
                    change or concession. Being accused of heresy, he was summoned to appear before
                    the convocation, which commenced its sittings in the month of February 1377, and
                    in which Courtenay, bishop of London, made the most conspicuous figure. This
                    prelate was son to the earl of Devonshire, by a grand-daughter of Edward the
                    First, and added the pride of royal descent to the arrogance of priestly
                    elevation. Wycliffe made lus appearance at St Paul’s on the 19th of the same
                    month, and, to the no small dissatisfaction of the bishop and his partisans, was
                    accompanied by the duke of Lancaster, and by Lord Percy, earl-marshal of
                    England. So great was the concourse of people, that it was not without
                    considerable difficulty that the marshal could procure him an avenue to the
                    presence of his judges, Archbishop Sudbury, and other prelates, who were
                    assembled in our Lady’s chapel, behind the high altar. “Dr Wicliffe, according
                    to custom, stood before the commissioners, as one cited to appear there to hear
                    what things they had to lay to his charge; but the earl-marshal, out of
                    tenderness for Dr Wicliffe, and having but little regard to a court which owed
                    all its authority to a foreign power, bid him sit down, telling him he had many
                    things to answer to, and therefore had need of a soft seat to rest him upon
                    during so tedious an attendance. The bishop of London, hearing that, answered, ’
                    he should not sit there ;’ for, says he, ‘ it is neither according to law nor
                    reason, that he who was cited here to answer before his ordinary, should sit
                    downe during the time of his answer adding, ‘ that if he could have guessed <pb

                    master there, or been so troublesome, he would not have suffered him to come
                    into the court.' On which many angry words passed betwixt the bishop and the
                    earl-marshal. The duke of Lancaster took the earl-marshal’s part, and told the
                    bishop that ‘ the earl-marshal’s motion was but reasonable, and that as for him,
                    who was grown so proud and arrogant, he would bring down the pride, not only of
                    him, but of all the prelacy of England; that he depended upon the greatness of
                    his family, but that they should have enough to do to support themselves.”<note

                <p>The duke of Lancaster did not then stand high in the popular favour; and his
                    magnificent palace of the Savoy was attacked during the tumults which followed
                    this stormy discussion. A clergyman, who had the misfortune of being mistaken
                    for Lord Percy, was put to death by the populace. The decease of the aged king
                    ensued on the 21st of June 1377, and he was succeeded by his grandson Richard,
                    who had not completed the twelfth year of his age. A parliament was summoned
                    soon after his accession, and the subject of the papal encroachments was again
                    resumed. By this parliament, a question was submitted to the judgment of
                    Wycliffe, whether a kingdom might not, in a case of necessity, prevent its
                    treasures from being conveyed to a foreign country, although it should even be
                    demanded by the pope himself. Here we have a sufficient proof that the charge of
                    heresy, however it might expose him to resentment from the rulers of the church,
                    had not diminished his credit with the rulers of the state. What answer the
                    professor of divinity returned to this question, no reader can fail to
                    anticipate. His opinions as to the temporalities of the church must have been
                    thought fully as dangerous as his theological doctrines; and on the same day no
                    fewer than four different bulls had been issued against him by Gregory the
                    Eleventh; three of which were directed to the archbishop of Canterbury and the
                    bishop of London, and a fourth to the chancellor and university of Oxford. All
                    these documents, together with an apostolical epistle addressed to King Edward
                    on the same subject, are dated on the 22d of May. The bulls of this “servant of
                    the servants of God,” enjoin the parties to whom they are addressed to commit
                    John Wycliffe to prison, and, having transmitted to Rome a full account of his
                    heretical tenets, to detain him in custody until they should receive further
                    instructions; but should they fail in their endeavours to seize his person, they
                    are required to affix in suitable places a citation for his appearance before
                    the pontiff within three months from the date of such citation. These pastoral
                    mandates were not however very effectually executed; but during the earlier part
                    of the year 1378, he appeared before a meeting of papal delegates in the
                    archiepiscopal chapel at Lambeth. His doctrines were rapidly extending their
                    influence, not merely among the people, but even at court. The populace were now
                    alarmed for his personal safety, and, having surrounded the chapel, many of them
                    forced their way into it, and gave sufficient indications of the part which they
                    were prepared to act; nor was the mortification of the delegates diminished by
                    the appearance of Sir Lewis Clifford, who, in the name of the queen mother, the
                    widow of the Black Prince, prohibited them from proceeding to any definite
                    sentence respecting the doctrine or conduct of Wycliffe.</p>
                <p>He therefore returned to his former occupations, and by his pulpit discourses,
                    his academical lectures, and his various writings, laboured to promote the cause
                    of truth. The great and glorious labour of his declining years was his complete
                    version of the Bible. It has always been one of the chief arts of priestcraft to
                    keep mankind in a state of ignorance; and it may easily be conceived that an
                    attempt to render the sacred books intelligible to every person capable of
                    reading his mother-tongue, could not fail to kindle the fiery rage of the old
                    Red Dragon. In our own time, we have heard divers denunciations from
                    high-churchmen as to the danger of circulating the Bible without the Book of
                    Common Prayer. According to their estimate, it is better to withhold the one,
                    unless it can be duly qualified by the other. Are we then to conclude that there
                    is no safety beyond the precincts of their own church; that the religion of
                    protestants is only a safe way to salvation, when that way is paced in certain
                    trammels, and swept with a white surplice? Or is the spiritual improvement of
                    mankind of real importance in so far only as it may be circumscribed within the
                    boundaries of episcopacy? The spirit of popery is not confined to professed
                    papists. To translate the Bible was in Wycliffe regarded as an act of heresy,
                    and his version continued to be a proscribed book till the era of the
                    Reformation. Being ignorant of the Hebrew and Greek languages, which he had no
                    opportunity of learning, he was under the necessity of translating from the
                    Vulgate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jablonski bas
                    described Wycliffe as “vir excellenti ingenio, magno animo, et pietate solida
                    praestans, sed quem linguarum sacrarum peritia, literarumque elegantiorum studia
                    deficiebant.” (Institutiones Historiae Christianae, tom. i. p. 329.)</p></note>
                    What aid he may have received from others in the prosecution of his laborious
                    undertaking, it is impossible to ascertain; but it is commonly understood that
                    he was not without coadjutors. In a theological point of view, the value of his
                    translation is far from being inconsiderable, and its value is still more
                    conspicuous in illustrating the history of the English tongue. Wycliffe may
                    indeed be regarded as the father of English prose. His version affords a very
                    ample specimen of the language, as it existed in the fourteenth century; nor is
                    it a little curious to remark, in very many instances, how immaterially his
                    phraseology differs from that of the authorized version executed in the reign of
                    King James. Of his translation of the New Testament, an edition was published by
                    Mr Lewis in the year 1731, and another by Mr Baber in the year 1810; but it is
                    not very creditable to his countrymen, who have derived so much benefit from his
                    pious labours, that his translation of the Old Testament still remains in
                    manuscript. This great deficiency however is at last to be supplied: Mr Forshall
                    and Sir Frederic Madden, both of the British Museum, are now engaged in
                    preparing an edition, which is to issue from the university press at Oxford. Of
                    the influence of Wycliffe’s biblical labours, no person seems to have obtained a
                    clearer view than Dr Lingard. He made, says this historian, “a new
                    translation,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the
                    researches of Mr Baber, who has bestowed much attention on the subject, it
                    clearly appears that no entire translation into the English language had
                    preceded that of Wycliffe. This editor has prefixed memoirs of the translator,
                    including a long catalogue of his works. See likewise Dr Vaughan’s Life of
                    Wycliffe, vol. ii. p. 379.</p></note> multiplied the copies with the aid of
                    transcribers, and by his poor priests recommended it to the perusal of their
                    hearers. In their hands it became an engine of wonderful power. Men were
                    flattered with the appeal to their private judgment; the new doctrines
                    insensibly acquired partisans and protectors in the higher classes, who alone
                    were acquainted with the use of letters; a spirit of enquiry was generated; and
                    the seeds were sown of that religious revolution, which, in little more than a
                    century, astonished and convulsed the nations of Europe.”</p>
                <p>Wycliffe had at first exposed the discipline of the church, and the scandalous
                    lives of churchmen; but he at length raised his voice against several of its
                    doctrines, and particularly against the doctrine of transubstantiation. Wher <pb

                    completely debased as to admit this portentous doctrine, the dominion of the
                    priest must be absolute: he is thus invested with a creative power; after the
                    admission of such a dogma, no other can be found of very hard digestion; and he
                    who exercises so much influence over a future world, must not be left without an
                    ample share of what belongs to this. A persecution was again excited against the
                    reformer; and the duke of Lancaster, who had hitherto befriended him, and who
                    was well aware of the secular corruptions of the clergy, was not however
                    prepared to support him in his attack on what was considered as a fundamental
                    doctrine of the church. Courtenay, who had now become archbishop of Canterbury,
                    was endowed with the spirit of an inquisitor, and appears to have wanted no
                    inclination to confer upon Wycliffe the honour of martyrdom. This venerable man
                    was summoned before a convocation held at Oxford; but although he made no
                    recantation of his supposed errors, they did not venture to treat him as an
                    obstinate heretic. A letter was however procured from the king, commanding him
                    to banish himself from the university. About the same period, he was cited to
                    appear before the pope; but, in return, he gave his holiness some salutary
                    advice, and informed him that he neither felt strength nor inclination for so
                    long a journey. His constitution was indeed exhausted by his multifarious
                    exertions, and he had already been affected with a paralysis, which at length
                    proved fatal. But after his final retirement to Lutterworth, he still continued
                    to labour in the same great cause. He died on the last day of December 1384,
                    when, according to the computation of his biographers, he had attained the age
                    of sixty.</p>
                <p>The grain of mustard-seed which was now sown became a great tree. The doctrines
                    which Wycliffe propagated with so much zeal and ability, could not again be
                    suppressed: the scat of Antichrist was gradually shaken from its old foundation;
                    and the impulse which he gave to religious enquiry is apparently destined to
                    reach the distant ages of futurity. His theological opinions cannot be detailed
                    in this brief and imperfect notice. It may however be remarked, that he clearly
                    anticipated the most distinguishing doctrines of the protestants, and that his
                    opinions on certain points present an obvious coincidence with those of Calvin.
                    Of the simplicity of primitive times, he was too devoted an admirer to secure
                    the unqualified approbation of modern churchmen; and one biographer is not a
                    little scandalized, because it seems perfectly clear that he did not consider
                    the episcopal order as at all essential to the legitimate constitution of a
                    Christian church. We find Wycliffe “zealously inculcating the lessons of
                    inspiration on the fall of man, and the consequent depravity of human nature; on
                    the excellence and perpetual obligation of the moral law; on the exclusive
                    dependence of every child of Adam, for the remission of his sins, on the
                    atonement of Christ; and for victory over temptation, and the possession of
                    holiness, on the aids of divine grace.” We have already had occasion to state,
                    that the influence of his opinions extended to persons of various ranks and
                    denominations. Lord Cobham, the most illustrious of his followers, sealed his
                    testimony with his blood, and many individuals of inferior condition were
                    likewise brought to the stake. The religion of the people was to be purified by
                    fire and fagot; and Henry the Fifth, endeavouring to atone for the follies of
                    his youth by the bigotry of his manhood, rendered himself a willing instrument
                    of persecution in the hands of an unholy and unrelenting priesthood.</p>
                <p>The influence of Wycliffe’s doctrines soon extended from England to the
                    continent, and their connexion with the subsequent progress of the reformation
                    may very easily be traced. The next conspicuous stage was the kingdom of
                    Bohemia. The king of Bohemia’s sister was the consort of Richard the Second, and
                    she came to England in the year 1382. She was a religious princess, and
                    constantly studied the four gospels in English, explained by the expositions of
                    the doctors. The Bohemians who had frequented her court, returned to their own
                    country, and carried along with them some of the works of the great reformer,
                    which, being written in Latin, were intelligible to the learned of all the
                    European nations. Jerom of Prague, who had studied in the university of Oxford,
                    is said to have translated many of his works into the Bohemian language; but,
                    according to another and a more probable account, be only copied some of them in
                    England, and carried the transcripts to Bohemia.<note anchored="true"

                    John Huss, the writings and character of Wycliffe were held in the highest
                    veneration; and they endeavoured to follow his footsteps, by contributing to
                    remove the corruptions of the church. Their earthly career was however
                    terminated in a more tragical manner. The council of Constance, which condemned
                    them both to the flames, added gross perfidy to inhuman cruelty, by violating
                    the safe conduct which Huss had obtained from the emperor Sigismund, and which
                    that prince had not the honour or the resolution to enforce.<note

                    assemblage of those who acted as the representatives of the Christian community,
                    pronounced sentence of condemnation on the whole of Wycliffe’s writings; and
                    having decided that he had died an obstinate heretic, and that his memory should
                    be held as infamous, they further decreed that his bones, which had now reposed
                    in the dust for the space of thirty years, should be removed from consecrated
                    ground, and scattered on the dunghill. But the cardinals, archbishops, bishops,
                    abbots, and doctors, who were permitted to play such fantastic tricks before
                    high Heaven, are themselves mingled with the vilest earth, while the name and
                    memory of John Wycliffe continue to be held in unimpaired veneration. (x.)</p>
