                <p><label type="entry">WICK</label>, a royal borough, situate on the bay of the same
                    name, in the county of Caithness. It is distant from Inverness by Beauly and
                    Tain 137½ miles. Wick is a town of considerable antiquity, and was erected into
                    a royal borough in 1589. It stands in a low situation, and its streets are
                    irregularly built and crowded together. Fever of a typhoid type is seldom
                    absent, arising from the filthy state of the streets, shores, and houses, the
                    putrescent effluvia which steam from the fish offals, and the over-crowded state
                    of the houses, more particularly during the fishing season. The river Wick,
                    which passes through the town, and divides it from Pulteneytown, tends in some
                    degree to keep it clean. Contiguous to Wick are Louisburgh and Pulteneytown,
                    which are both included in the parliamentary borough. The latter was commenced
                    under the auspices of the British Fishery Society; and being built on higher
                    ground, and well planned, is a regular and handsome addition to the original
                    town. It is indeed three times larger, and in it are all the dwelling-houses of
                    the better class of inhabitants. The public buildings are in good order, and
                    well adapted for the purposes for which they were erected. The revenue of the
                    borough is about L.75 a year, and its expenses are nearly the same. It is
                    governed by a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, a dean of guild, and seven
                    councillors. With Cromarty, Dingwall, Dornoch, Tain, and Kirkwall, it returns a
                    member to parliament. The trade of Wick consists in the herrings, which are here
                    cured and exported. The live-stock and grain trade are also carried on to a
                    considerable extent; and, from the number of people assembled here from various
                    quarters during the fishing season, an increased trade is then maintained for
                    supplying their wants. The average number of boats employed in this fishery for
                    the last ten years is about 900, and the average annual quantity of fish taken
                    for the last twenty years is 88,500 barrels; but within a recent period the
                    number of both has decreased. In 1829 the number of boats employed was 955;
                    persons employed in all the branches, 11,780. In 1840 the number of boats
                    employed was 765; persons 7882; barrels cured, 63,495, of which were exported
                    55,711. For a further account of the fisheries, see the article under that head
                    in this work. In 1810 a harbour was completed for L.14,000; but, from the
                    increase of the trade and herring fishery, it was found inadequate, and another
                    having been commenced, was completed in 1831, at an expense of L.40,000; but
                    unfortunately it is exposed to the swell of the sea. Besides the parish church,
                    there are places of worship for the Seceders, Independents, Roman Catholics, and
                    other five dissenting bodies. There are several rope-works, a distillery, a
                    brewery, an iron-foundery, a gas-work, a ship-building yard, and various
                    boat-building yards, in Wick and Pulteneytown. In the year 1840 the number of
                    vessels belonging to the port was twenty-one, with a registered tonnage of 1154.
                    The custom-duty collected in 1837 amounted to L.696, and in 1838 to L.1034. In
                    1831 the stationary population of the parish amounted to 9850; but during the
                    fishing season it is increased by an influx of about 10,000 strangers.</p>
