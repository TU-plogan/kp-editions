                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">WYCHERLEY, W <hi rend="smallcaps">illiam</hi></label>, a
                    comic writer who occupied a very conspicuous place among the wits of his age,
                    was born about the year 1640. He was the eldest son of Daniel Wycherley, Esq., a
                    gentleman possessed of a considerable estate near the town of Shrewsbury.
                    Wycherley was probably a cavalier by descent, for during the last years of the
                    commonwealth he was sent by his father, at the susceptible age of fifteeen, to
                    prosecute his studies in France; a country which an old puritan was not likely
                    to select as the most eligible place of instruction for his offspring. While in
                    France, he passed some time on the banks of the Charente, and was a frequent and
                    acceptable guest of the duke of Montausier; and in compliment to the duchess,
                    the accomplished Julie d’Angennes de Rambouillet, who is celebrated in the
                    letters of Voiture, the young Englishman became a convert to the Romish faith.
                    From the bosom of that infallible church he was afterwards recalled by the
                    eloquence of Dr Barlow; but to what visible communion a man so profligate, both
                    in practice and speculation, belonged, is a matter of no great moment.</p>
                <p>Upon the eve of the Restoration he returned to England, and, from Wood’s Athenae
                    Oxonienses, it appears that he lived for some time in the provost’s lodge at
                    Queen’s College, Oxford, but left that university without being matriculated. He
                    now proceeded to London, and entered himself of the Middle Temple; but if he had
                    acquired in France too keen an appetite for pleasure to submit to academic
                    restraint, it was not probable that he would apply himself with much earnestness
                    to voluntary drudgery. The gayeties of the metropolis soon converted the student
                    of law into a man of wit and gallantry; nor did any one experience less
                    difficulty in assuming that ostentatious profligacy which was regarded as the
                    true badge of loyalty, in 1672 he produced a comedy entitled “Love in a Wood, or
                    St James’s Park,” which was acted at the Theatre Royal with great applause.
                    Among the admirers of the author’s genius was the duchess of Cleveland, the
                    mistress of the king, and one of the most celebrated beauties of her time. Love
                    in a Wood is dedicated to that lady; a compliment for which she manifested the
                    sincerity of her gratitude by the most signal tokens. Dennis relates, that when
                    Wycherley was taking the air in that place of fashionable resort which had given
                    a name to his play, his carriage came in contact with that of her grace, who
                    threw herself half out of the window, and rallied him with a freedom and gayety
                    that cannot well be repeated. The result of this rencontre was, that Wycherley
                    became the successful rival of his sovereign, and incurred the displeasure of
                    the haughty Buckingham. In this emergency, he solicited the good offices of
                    Rochester and Sedley, who had such confidence in his colloquial powers that they
                    hurried him off to sup at the apartments of the duke. The event justified this
                    bold proceeding, for, like a noble bard of modern times, who should have been
                    the contemporary of his grace, he was always most “strongly acted on by what was
                    nearest ;” and after some irresistible sally of his guest, he exclaimed with an
                    oath, “My cousin’s in the right on’t!” But Charles could be as fickle as
                    herself.</p>

                <p>“This year, 1672,”says Burnet, “the king declared a new mistress, and made her
                    duchess of Portsmouth.”</p>
                <p>He now rose to high favour with Buckingham, who, as master of the horse,
                    appointed him one of his equerries, and, as colonel of a regiment,
                    captain-lieutenant of his own company. He is likewise said to have conferred
                    upon him many other advantages. But the poet had not yet reached the height of
                    his good fortune. His next patron was the merry monarch himself, who thought no
                    reward too great for a jest, and no recompense too inconsiderable for those who
                    had shed their blood in his service. Such devotion indeed was strongly
                    indicative of folly, and Charles admired none but men of wit. Wycherley was
                    fortunate enough to inspire the king with excessive fondness, which was crowned
                    by the very singular condescension of paying him a visit at his lodgings, when
                    he was ill of a fever. When he became somewhat convalescent, his majesty advised
                    him to try the air of Montpellier, and furnished him with five hundred pounds to
                    defray his travelling expenses.</p>
                <p>In 1673 was acted at the Duke’s Theatre Wycherley’s second comedy, “The Gentleman
                    Dancing-Master.” The incidents of this play are quite farcical, and the
                    catastrophe is obvious from the commencement. It appears to have been coldly
                    received, for in the prologue to' his next comedy, the Country Wife, occurs the
                    following line:</p>
                <p>The late so baffl’d scribbler of the day.</p>
                <p>“The Country Wife” was acted in 1675, and was followed in 1677 by “The Plain
                    Dealer.” Wycherley’s first play made him the paramour of a woman who wanted only
                    the name of a queen, and his last made him the husband of a countess. Being on a
                    visit to Tunbridge, he entered a bookseller’s shop, and while he remained there
                    a lady came and inquired for the Plain Dealer. “There he is for you, Madam,”
                    said a friend of his, one Mr Fairbeard, by whom he was accompanied, pushing
                    Wycherley towards her. This lady was the countess of Drogheda; and an
                    acquaintance, thus ludicrously commenced, soon ripened into an intimacy that
                    terminated in a matrimonial union. Wycherley’s splendid marriage was the most
                    disastrous incident of his life. His lady’s outrageous jealousy, for which it
                    was not improbable that be gave her some cause, imbittered his existence, for
                    she became infuriated whenever he disappeared from her sight. Sometimes, by
                    special favour, he was permitted to dine at the Cock Tavern, opposite their
                    lodgings in Bow Street; but upon these occasions he was compelled to leave the
                    windows open, that she might be satisfied there was no woman present. She did
                    not live long to torment him, and left him her whole fortune at her death; but
                    her will was contested, and he found himself heir to nothing but a suit at law.
                    Being unable to pay the expenses of litigation, and some other debts which he
                    had contracted when he thought himself beyond the reach of poverty, he was
                    thrown into a jail, where he was suffered to languish for the space of seven
                    years. From giddy splendour to unpitied destitution there was an easy and
                    natural transition. To the king it is not likely that he had the assurance to
                    apply; but his father would do nothing for him, and he was refused a loan of
                    twenty pounds from his bookseller, who had made large sums of money by his
                    works. From this abyss of misery he was rescued at last by a hand that was soon
                    afterwards deprived of the power to do either good or evil. Charles was now
                    dead, and his luckless successor happening to see the Plain Dealer acted, was
                    touched with compassion for its author, and assigned him a pension of’ two
                    hundred pounds a year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Among his Posthumous Works is a poem “On a Sea Fight which the author was
                    in, betwixt the English and Dutch,” p. 235. James’s kindness for him may have
                    been prompted by the remembrance of mutual danger. It is possible that Wycherley
                    served under him upon one or other of the occasions when he commanded the red
                    squadron against the Dutch. Some nautical knowledge, however acquired, is
                    displayed in the Plain Dealer.</p></note> He also gave orders for the immediate
                    payment of his debts, and sent Lord Mulgrave to ascertain their amount; but
                    Wycherley was ashamed to tell that nobleman how much he owed. He was now
                    restored to liberty, but continued to be harassed by his creditors till near the
                    close of his life, when he devised an expedient to satisfy their demands, which
                    at such a solemn crisis could scarcely have occurred to any one but himself. By
                    the will of his father, to whom he seems to have owed little but his birth, he
                    was deprived of the power of alienating the family estate; and not wishing to
                    quit the world in debt, a feeling which deserves commendation, he married a
                    young woman possessed of fifteen hundred pounds.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For this act another motive has been
                    assigned, the wish to disinherit a nephew whom he disliked.</p></note> With
                    odious indelicacy, this creature was induced to give her hand to the expiring
                    debauchee by the inducement of a handsome jointure. Having discharged his other
                    debts with part of his wife’s fortune, he paid the debt of nature on the 1st of
                    January 1715, eleven days after the celebration of his nuptials. A little while
                    before he closed his eyes for the last time, he is said to have requested his
                    wife, with Cervantic gravity, not to take an old man for her second husband.
                    Thus was a life of frolics closed with perfect consistency. Major Pack says that
                    he died a papist. He was a great admirer of Dryden, in whose honour he wrote
                    some indifferent verses: perhaps the melodious reasoning in the Hind and Panther
                    had some share in the merit of his reconversion to the Romish faith.</p>
                <p>Wycherley is eminent only as a writer for the stage, but he is the author of a
                    large volume entitled “Miscellany Poems, as Satyrs, Epistles, Love-Verses,
                    Songs, Sonnets, &amp;c.” Lond. 1704, fol. The times had changed since Charles’s
                    days, but Wycherley continued the same. The public ear had become habituated to
                    gracefully-expanded sentiments which he wanted the skill to supply, and if not
                    to more severe morality, to less inharmonious impurity than his; and the
                    dissonant and licentious crudities of the veteran rake excited little attention.
                    The versification of Wycherley is scarcely more felicitous than that of Dr
                    Donne. Several years after his death appeared “The Posthumous Works of William
                    Wycherley, Esq. in prose and verse: faithfully publish’d from his original
                    manuscripts, by Mr Theobald. In two parts. To which are prefixed, some Memoirs
                    of Mr Wycherley’s life, by Major Pack.” Lond. 1728, 8vo. By appealing to the
                    avarice of one Captain Shrimpton, who had married his relict, the booksellers
                    obtained the possession of the papers which formed this collection, in which
                    there is nothing that can add to the reputation of Wycherley, either in a moral
                    or intellectual point of view. His folio volume is curious, as containing the
                    pieces alluded to in the following passage in Johnson’s Life of Pope: “His
                    esteem of Pope was such that he submitted some poems to his revision, and when
                    Pope, perhaps proud of such confidence, was sufficiently bold in his criticisms
                    and liberal in his alterations, the old scribbler was angry to see his pages
                    defaced, and felt more pain from the detection than content from the amendment
                    of his faults. They parted; but Pope always considered him with kindness, and
                    visited him a little time before he died.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Lady Μ. W. Montagu says that Pope paid his court to him with a view to a legacy;
                    but this calumny is sufficiently refuted in the state of Wycherley’s affairs. At
                    this period Pope was about sixteen, and Wycherley had passed his grand
                    climacteric.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The letters
