                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    our ideas to others, by letters or characters visible to the eye.</p>
                <p>The most ancient remains of writing which have been transmitted to us are upon
                    hard substances, such as stones and metals, which were used by the ancients for
                    edicts and matters of public notoriety. The decalogue was written on two tables
                    of stone; but this practice was not peculiar to the Jews, for it was used by
                    most of the eastern nations, as well as by the Greeks and Romans; and therefore
                    the ridicule which Voltaire attempts to cast upon that part of the book of
                    Genesis, where the people are commanded to write the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=984" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0984-0944"
                    />law on stones, is absurd; for what is there said by no means implies that
                    other materials might not be used on common occasions. The laws penal, civil,
                    and ceremonial, among ’ the Greeks, were engraven on tables of brass, which were
                    called <hi rend="italic">cgrbes.</hi></p>
                <p>We find that wood was also used for writing on in different countries. The
                    Chinese, before the invention of paper, wrote or engraved with an iron tool upon
                    thin boards or on bamboo. Pliny says that table-books of wood were in use before
                    the time of Homer. These table-books were called by the Romans <hi rend="italic"
                    >pugillares.</hi> The wood was cut into thin slices, and finely plained and
                    polished. The writing was at first upon the bare wood, with an iron instrument
                    called a <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> In latter times these tables were usually
                    waxed over, and written upon with that instrument. The matter written upon the
                    tables which were thus waxed over was easily effaced, and by smoothing the wax
                    new matter might be substituted in the place of what had been written before.
                    The Greeks and Romans continued the use of waxed table-books long after the use
                    of papyrus, leaves, and skins became common, because they were so convenient for
                    correcting extemporary compositions.</p>
                <p>Table-books of ivory are still used for memorandums, but they are commonly
                    written upon with black-lead pencils. The practice of writing on table-books
                    covered with wax was not. entirely laid aside till the commencement of the
                    fourteenth century.</p>
                <p>The bark of trees was also used for writing by the ancients, and is so still in
                    several parts of Asia. The same thing may be said of the leaves of trees. It is
                    needless to observe the use of parchment and vellum, papyrus and paper, for
                    writing; it is too well known. The method of fabricating these substances has
                    been already described as they occurred in the order of the alphabet.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that when men wrote, or rather engraved, on hard substances,
                    instruments of metal were necessary, such as the chisel and the stylus; but the
                    latter was chiefly used for writing upon boards, waxed tablets, or on bark.</p>
                <p>When the ancients wrote on softer materials than wood or metal, other instruments
                    were used for writing with, of which reeds and canes seem to have been the
                    first. Reeds and canes are still used as instruments for writing with by the
                    Tartars, the Indians, the Persians, the Turks, and the Greeks. Pencils made of
                    hair are used by the Chinese for their writing: they first liquefy their ink,
                    and dip their pencils into it. Hair-pencils have likewise been used for writing
                    in Europe. Large capital letters were made with them from the time of the Roman
                    emperors till the sixteenth century. After the invention of printing they were
                    drawn by the illuminators. Quills of geese, swans, peacocks, crows, and other
                    birds, have been used in these western parts for writing with, but how long is
                    not easy to ascertain. Isidorus Hispalensis, or Isidore of Seville, who lived
                    about the middle of the seventh century, describes a pen made of a quill as used
                    in his time. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps"
