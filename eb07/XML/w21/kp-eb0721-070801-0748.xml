                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">WAKES</label>. Mr Whitaker, in his History of Manchester, has
                    given a particular account of the origin <hi rend="italic">of</hi> wakes and
                    fairs. He observes, that every church at its consecration received the name of
                    some particular saint; that this custom was practised among the Roman Britons,
                    and continued among the Saxons; and that in the council of Cealchythe, in 816,
                    the name of the denominating saint was expressly required to be inscribed on the
                    altars, and also on the walls of the church, or a tablet within it. The feast of
                    this saint became of course the festival of the church. Thus Christian festivals
                    were substituted in the room of the idolatrous anniversaries of heathenism.
                    Accordingly, at the first introduction of Christianity among the Jutes of Kent,
                    Pope Gregory the Great advised, what had been previously done among the Britons,
                    viz. Christian festivals to be instituted in the room of the idolatrous, and the
                    suffering day of the martyr whose relics were reposited in the church, or the
                    day on which the building was actually dedicated, to be the established feast of
                    the parish. Both were appointed and observed; and at first they were clearly
                    distinguished among the Saxons, as appears from the laws of the Confessor, where
                    the <hi rend="italic">dies dedicationis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >dedicatio,</hi> is repeatedly discriminated from the <hi rend="italic">propria
                    festivitas sancti,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">celebratio sancti.</hi> They
                    remained equally distinct till the Reformation. In 1536 the dedication-day was
                    ordered for the future to be kept on the first Sunday in October, and the
                    festival of the patron saint to be celebrated no longer. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=749" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0749-0709"
                    />latter was, by way of pre-eminence, denominated the <hi rend="italic">church’s
                    holiday,</hi> or its peculiar festival; and while this remains in many parishes
                    at present, the other is so utterly annihilated in all, that Bishop Kennet, says
                    Mr Whitaker, knew nothing of its distinct existence, and has attributed to the
                    day of dedication what is true only concerning the saint’s day. Thus instituted
                    at first, the day of the tutelar saint was observed, most probably by the
                    Britons, and certainly by the Saxons, with great devotion. And the evening
                    before every saint’s day, in the Saxon Jewish method of reckoning the hours,
                    being an actual hour of the day, and therefore, like that, appropriated to the
                    duties of public religion, as they reckoned Sunday from the first to commence at
                    the sunset of Saturday, the evening preceding the church’s holiday would be
                    observed with all the devotion of the festival. The people actually repaired to
                    the church, and joined in the services of it; and they thus spent the evening of
                    their greater festivities, in the monasteries of the north, as early as the
                    conclusion of the seventh century.</p>
                <p>These services were naturally denominated, from their late hours, <hi
                    rend="italic">woecan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wakes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vigils</hi> or <hi rend="italic">eves.</hi> That of the anniversary at Ripon,
                    as early as the commencement of the eighth century, is expressly denominated the
                    <hi rend="italic">vigil.</hi> But that of the church’s holiday was named <hi
                    rend="italic">cyric woecan,</hi> or church-wake, the church-vigil, or
                    church-eve. And it was this commencement of both with a wake, which has now
                    caused the days to be generally preceded with vigils, and the church-holiday
                    particularly to be denominated the <hi rend="italic">church-wake.</hi> So
                    religiously were the eve and festival of the patron saint observed for many ages
                    by the Saxons, even as late as the reign of Edgar, the former being spent in the
                    church, and employed in prayer. And the wakes, and all the other holidays in the
                    year, were put upon the same footing with the octaves of Christmas, Easter, and
                    of Pentecost. When Gregory recommended the festival of the patron saint, he
                    advised the people to erect booths of branches about the church on the day of
                    the festival, and to feast and be merry in them with innocence. Accordingly, in
                    every parish, on the returning anniversary of the saint, little pavilions were
                    constructed of boughs, and the people indulged in them to hospitality and mirth.
                    The feasting of the saint’s day, however, was soon abused; and even in the body
                    of the church, when the people were assembled for devotion, they began to mind
                    diversions, and to introduce drinking. The growing intemperance gradually
                    stained the service of the vigil, till the festivity of it was converted, as it
                    now is, into the rigour of a fast. At length they too justly scandalized the
                    Puritans of the seventeenth century, and numbers of the wakes were disused
                    entirely, especially in the east and some western parts of England; but they are
                    commonly observed in the north, and in the midland counties.</p>
                <p>This custom of celebrity in the neighbourhood of the church, on the days of
                    particular saints, was introduced into England from the continent, and must have
                    been familiar equally to the Britons and Saxons; being observed among the
                    churches of Asia in the sixth century, and by those of the west of Europe in the
                    seventh. And equally in Asia and Europe, on the continent and in the islands,
                    those celebrities were the causes of those commercial marts which we denominate
                    <hi rend="italic">fairs.</hi> The people resorted in crowds to the festival, and
                    a considerable provision would be wanted for their entertainment. The prospect
                    of interest invited the little traders of the country to come and offer their
                    wares; and thus among the many pavilions for hospitality in the neighbourhood of
                    the church, various booths were erected for the sale of different commodities.
                    In larger towns, surrounded with populous districts, the resort of the people to
                    the wakes would be great, and the attendance of traders numerous; and this
                    resort and attendance constitute a fair. Basil expressly mentions the numerous
                    appearance of traders at these festivals in Asia, and Gregory notes the same
                    custom to be common in Europe. And as the festival was observed on a feria or
                    holiday, it naturally assumed to itself, and as naturally communicated to the
                    mart, the appellation of <hi rend="italic">feria</hi> or fair. Indeed several of
                    our most ancient fairs appear to have been usually held, and have been continued
                    to our time, on the original church-holidays of the place: besides, it is
                    observable, that fairs were generally kept in church-yards, and even in the
                    churches, and also on Sundays, till the indecency and scandal were so great as
                    to need reformation.</p>
