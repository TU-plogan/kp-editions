                <p><label type="entry">WATERFORD</label>, a maritime county of the province of
                    Munster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the counties of Tipperary and
                    Kilkenny, on the east by that of Wexford, on the south by the Atlantic, and on
                    the west by the county of Cork. It lies between 51° 55' and 52° 20' north
                    latitude, and 6° 58' and 8° 10' west longitude; extending twenty-eight miles in
                    its greatest length from north to south, and fifty-two in breadth from east to
                    west, and comprehending an area of 736 square miles, or 471,281 acres, of which
                    353,247 are cultivated land, and 118,034 uncultivated mountain or bog. It ranks
                    as the twenty-first county in superficial extent, and the twentieth in that of
                    its cultivated land.</p>
                <p>In the time of Ptolemy the geographer, it was inhabited by the tribe of the
                    Brigantes, whose territory’ extended from Carnsore Point in Wexford, westward
                    along the coast to the Blackwater. It was afterwards peopled by the Desii, who
                    are supposed to have emigrated from a tribe of the same name in Meath; and
                    having spread themselves also over the plain country of Tipperary, those settled
                    in Waterford were distinguished by the name of South Desii, and the others by
                    that of North Desii. Here the Danes established a permanent settlement in the
                    ninth century, making the city of Waterford their chief seat of government; and
                    though frequently involved in wars with the surrounding natives, they retained
                    possession of the city and district until their subjugation by the English, who,
                    in 1170, under Strongbow, stormed Waterford, took their chieftain or prince
                    prisoner, and brought the whole of the Decies into the possession of the
                    English. Shortly after, Henry II. granted the greater part of the county to
                    Robert le Poer, and the remainder, with that of Cork, then a petty kingdom, to
                    Milo de Cogan, two of his followers. In 1210, King John erected the territory
                    into a county, from which the city was excepted, being under a separate
                    jurisdiction. In 1444 the county, together with the greater part of the rest of
                    Munster, was granted to James earl of Desmond. A few years after, both county
                    and city were granted to John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who was then created
                    earl of Waterford; but both lands and title were resumed by the king under the
                    statute 28th Hen. VIII., which vested the lands of absentee proprietors in the
                    crown. The county suffered severely in the reign of Elizabeth, through the
                    rebellion of the earl of Desmond, and the Spanish invasion; and also in the wars
                    of 1641, during the first years of which, its possession was the subject of
                    continued sanguinary contention between the English and Irish forces, until it
                    was ultimately reduced under the authority of the English parliament by
                    Cromwell. During the war of the Revolution, it took part with King James, and
                    was reduced by King William’s forces under General Kirk, after the decisive
                    battle of the Boyne.</p>
                <p>The general character of the county is mountainous. The Knockmeledown ridge, the
                    highest point of which is 2598 feet above the sea-level, ranges along its
                    north-western boundary, forming the line of demarcation on the side of
                    Tipperary. The Cummeragh and Monevolagh Mountains lie in a direction nearly
                    north and south from the east of Clonmel to Dungarvan; their loftiest summit,
                    Knockanafrian, is 2469 feet high. On several of the summits of these mountains
                    arc large piles of stones, apparcnt-ly of artificial construction, but of
                    unknown origin. To the south of Dungarvan are the Drum Mountains, much lower
                    than the preceding, but rugged and difficult of passage. They form the division
                    between two of the baronies. The south-eastern district is low, of alluvial
                    formation, and <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=850"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0850-0810"/> forms a kind of peninsula, cut off from the
                    remainder of the county by a line of marshy land, which has the appearance of
                    having been once under water. There are no large rivers in the interior. The
                    Suir forms its northern boundary, from beyond Clonmel, to the estuary formed by
                    its junction with the combined waters of the Barrow and Nore. Vessels of 800
                    tons come up to the city of Waterford, where they can discharge their cargoes at
                    the quay; barks and large lighters can proceed upwards to Carrick-on-Suir, and
                    boats of fifty tons to Clonmel. The Blackwater, called also the Owenduff and
                    Owenmore, “the black and the great river,” after flowing through the western
                    part of the county, forms part of the boundary on the side of Cork county, and
                    discharges itself into Youghal harbour. It is navigable for vessels under 100
                    tons to its confluence with the Bride, a smaller stream which joins it from the
                    west. The Brickey empties itself into Dungarvan harbour. The Neir, in the west
                    of the county, is a small tributary of the Suir. There are no lakes, except a
                    few of very small size in the Cummeragh Mountains, the largest, called
                    Cumme-loughs, are but six or eight acres in extent, the others, called
                    Stilloughs, smaller. A tract at Ballyscanlan, in Middlethird barony, covered
                    with water during winter, subsides into a small lake in the dry season. The
                    county enjoys the benefit of an extensive line of sea-coast. Two miles east of
                    the city is the Little Island, of triangular shape: after which the coast takes
                    a southern direction, forming the western side of Waterford harbour, at the
                    entrance of which is the pier harbour of Dunmore, with a lighthouse exhibiting a
                    fixed light, red towards the sea and bright inland. The harbour, in which
                    vessels of fifteen feet draught may lie afloat, covers a cove of six acres. West
                    of Dunmore are the small islands of Fileskirt. Farther westward, between
                    Brownstown and Newtown-heads, is Tramore Bay, notorious for shipwrecks. A vessel
                    caught in it finds it almost impossible to work out by plying to windward. The
                    ground is so foul and rocky, that cables are frequently cut and ships lost. The
                    north-west is the only part which affords a possibility of escape, the east
                    being so shoal and rocky that vessels driven on that side are involved in
                    terrible breakers at a considerable distance from shore. Proceeding westward are
                    the small grassy rocks called the Islands of Jeane, and the inlets called
                    Bonmahon, Clonea, and Rineshark. Dungarvan harbour affords shelter to vessels of
                    ten feet water. Ardmore Bay and Whiting Bay are still farther west. Youghal
                    harbour forms the western boundary of the county. Off the coast, and extending
                    along that of the southern part of the adjoining county of Wexford, is the Nymph
                    Bank, long looked upon as an inexhaustible source of supply of round fish, but,
                    according to late reports, much less productive than had been represented; the
                    fish not being abundant, and of a poorer description than those taken on other
                    banks.</p>
                <p>The eastern part of the county consists of clay-slate, interrupted by small
                    patches of primitive limestone, susceptible of a high polish, and by
                    conglomerate and basalt, which latter appears in a columnar form on the cliffs
                    over the sea. A copper mine at Knockmahon has been worked for several years,
                    with good profit, by the Mining Company of Ireland. The ore is sent in a crude
                    state to Swansea to be smelted. The average annual produce is stated at 4500
                    tons, valued at L.40,000. Lead was formerly raised in large quantities in the
                    same district. The veins in the hill of Cruach and on the shore at Kilmurrin are
                    said to have given out a large quantity of silver. The western part of the
                    county is old conglomerate, with red, purple, green, and gray clay-slate. It is
                    bordered in many parts by a band of millstone grit and white sandstone, which
                    also constitutes the fringe of a broad bed of carbonated or mountain limestone,
                    that passes through a great part of the interior from east to west Slates from
                    the quarries south of Lismore are raised at an average of 2800 tons annually,
                    value L.4200. Mineral veins are also found in this district. At Ardmore an iron
                    mine was formerly wrought from which steel of superior quality was said to have
                    been fabricated. The sandstone in many places is wrought into millstones.
                    Ochres, boles, and clays, fit for the manufacture of earthenware, are found in
                    various places.</p>

                    periods, was as follows:</p>

                <p>The number of electors is, according to the last of these returns, to that of the
                    number of inhabitants, as 1 to 123, and to that of families of six individuals
                    each, as 1 to 20. The county is included in the Leinster circuit. The assizes
                    are held in the city of Waterford, where the county prison is fixed. General
                    sessions of the peace are held four times in the year in that city; twice a year
                    at Dungarvan, and twice at Lismore; in each of which towns there are a
                    court-house and a bridewell. The local government is vested in a lieutenant,
                    fourteen deputy-lieutenants, fifty-nine other unpaid magistrates, and a
                    stipendiary magistrate. The constabulary force consists of a county inspector,
                    five sub-inspectors, six head constables, and 150 constables and sub-constables.
                    The county infirmary and the lunatic asylum for the county and city are in
                    Waterford city, where also is a fever hospital; and there are others in
                    Dungarvan, Lismore, and Tallow. There are twelve dispensaries in various towns.
                    Waterford, Dungarvan, and Lismore, have been fixed on as sites for the
                    workhouses of poor-law unions.</p>
                <p>Though the land is in general coarse, there is a considerable tract of rich soil,
                    particularly in the south-eastern quarter; and the mountainous districts afford
                    good pasturage for cattle. The estates are in general very large: that of the
                    duke of Devonshire is the most extensive. Tillage has increased very rapidly
                    within the present century. In 1779, not one thirtieth part was under the
                    plough. At present, nearly two thirds are under tillage. The change has arisen
                    in some degree from the custom of dividing farms. When the eldest daughter of a
                    farmer married, the father divided the land with his son-in-law; the next
                    daughter got half of his remaining share for her portion, the system of
                    subdivision being continued as long as there were any daughters to be thus
                    provided for. The sons were left to shift for themselves as best they could. But
                    the attention latterly paid to introduce the most approved agricultural
                    practices, has contributed in a much greater degree to this effect. The lands of
                    resident gentry are now specimens worthy of imitation. The settlement of the
                    religious fraternity of St Bernard la Trappe, near Cappoquin, the members of
                    which devote much attention to the reclamation and improvement of a large
                    mountainous tract granted to them for their residence, has still further
                    stimulated the spirit of industrious exertion, and given it a judicious
                    direction. Wheat is largely raised, clover very generally grown; but other kinds
                    of green crops are not yet so general as in England. Lime for manure is abundant
                    in the western parts, and large quantities of coralline sea-sand are carried
                    into the interior for the same purpose. The fences are mostly banks of earth
                    topped with furze in the flat country, and dry stone walls in the mountainous
                    parts. The best breeds of cattle are to be seen on the pastures. Sheep are not a
                    common stock; swine, raised chiefly for export, are very numerous, as are goats
                    in the higher lands. Waterford is the principal dairy county in the island. The
                    chief produce of these farms is butter, the export of which has increased
                    considerably for several years. Very little cheese is made. The want of timber,
                    both for ornamental and useful purposes, is much felt; but the deficiency is
                    yearly diminished by the increased attention to plantations. There is but little
                    bog. The extensive range of sea-coast, indented by numerous creeks and inlets,
                    holds out great inducements for profitable employment in the fisheries. During
                    the ten years’ continuance of the system of bounties, and of grants and loans
                    for the building and repairs of boats and the purchase of fishing gear, adopted
                    by the Board of Fisheries instituted in 1819, the sea-fishery was carried on
                    with much spirit, and caused a large circulation of money, particularly in
                    Dungarvan, the centre of the system. Some working fishermen accumulated capital;
                    some became boat-owners, and some boat-owners masters of trading vessels. But on
                    the termination of the bounties and grants, the business declined rapidly. The
                    boats fell into decay, and were laid up. Those fishermen who had no land, but
                    depended wholly on the success of their occupation at sea, were reduced to
                    poverty, and, in seasons when the fishery wholly failed, to a state of utter
                    destitution. Yet the market is so far from being overstocked, that the quantity
                    of fish taken on the coast never equals the demand in the local markets, Scotish
                    and Newfoundland fish being sold in very large quantities. A company formed in
                    Waterford between thirty and forty years ago, for supplying the English markets
                    with round fish from the Nymph Bank by well-boats, failed, owing, it is alleged,
                    to mismanagement. The following summary exhibits the number of vessels employed
                    in the last year in which the bounty and loan system was in operation, and in
                    that when a second board of commissioners repeated the inquiries as to the state
                    of the Irish fisheries.</p>

                <p>The coasts abound with shell-fish. Salmon, and other species of river-fish, are

                    streams.</p>
                <p>Carrick-on-Suir was once the centre of a very extensive woollen manufacture,
                    which branched out into most parts of this county. It has been for many years
                    almost extinct, the supply at present serving only for the domestic consumption
                    of the peasantry. Linen is made in the farm-houses, but only for family use. A
                    cotton factory has been established at Portlaw, to the west of Waterford city,
                    which gives employment to a large number of workers. There are distilleries,
                    breweries, and paper-mills. Flour is also extensively manufactured, and largely
                    exported. Some glass is made at Waterford, and coarse earthenware in several
                    places; but Waterford is not a manufacturing county. The inland trade chiefly
                    centres in Waterford city, which is also a good emporium for the export of grain
                    and salted provisions. Some business in both departments is also done at
                    Dungarvan and Youghal. The exports and imports in 1838 were stated in a

                    northern side of the Suir, by Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel, to join the great
                    southern line near Cahir. There are six banking establishments in the county; of
                    which one is a branch of the Bank of Ireland, two of the Provincial Bank, and
                    the other three of the National Bank. There are eight loan companies,

                <p>Among the mansions of the nobility and gentry of large estates, the most
                    remarkable are Lismore Castle, the seat of the duke of Devonshire, and
                    Curraghmore, that of the marquis of Waterford. The habitations, dress, and
                    manners of the peasantry in the rural districts, resemble those similarly
                    circumstanced in other parts of the province, being distinguished chiefly by the
                    difference of their modes of life, as residing on the sea-coast, the rich
                    pasture-lands, the mountain districts, or the vicinity of a populous town. The
                    county contains numerous remains of ancient structures. A pillar-tower at
                    Ardmore is in a state of high preservation. Near the same place is a large rath,
                    and several others in various parts. The remains of small circular
                    intrenchments, mostly at short distances from each other, can also be traced.
                    Cromlechs are also numerous, and some very large. The names of upwards of twenty
                    monastic establishments have been preserved, but the sites of few of them are
                    now discernible. The same may be said of the numerous castles erected in many
                    parts of this county, long the theatre of petty wars. Natural caves are to be
                    seen, both on the coast and in the interior, as well as others which have every
                    appearance of owing their origin to human ingenuity. There are several mineral
                    springs, chiefly chalybeate.</p>
                <p>The city of Waterford is situate on the northern verge of the county, and on the
                    southern bank of the Suir, about twenty miles from the mouth of the harbour. It
                    was founded by the Danes, according to some authorities, as early as the middle
                    of the second century, but, as stated by others with more probability, in the
                    ninth century. It continued in the possession of these settlers, wholly
                    independent of the surrounding native princes, and generally at variance with
                    them, till the arrival of the English under Strongbow, who took it by storm, and
                    was in the act of consummating his victory by an indiscriminate massacre of the
                    inhabitants, when he was prevented by the interference of his ally and protector
                    Dermott M'Murrough, king of Leinster, whose daughter Eva he soon after married
                    in the city. Henry II. afterwards landed here, and from that period it long
                    continued to be one of the principal places of communication with England, and a
                    considerable mart for foreign trade. King John, when earl of Morton, landed here
                    in 1183. On his accession to the throne, he granted its first charter, and again
                    visited the city the year after. In the next century it suffered twice by
                    conflagrations, the latter time so severely, that it remained several years in a
                    decayed state. In 1368, the citizens, under the command of the mayor, suffered a
                    severe defeat from the Poers and O’Driscolls. At the close of the same century,
                    Richard II. landed here on both the occasions on which he visited this part of
                    his dominions. Money was coined here by the Danes, and a mint established by
                    John; a privilege confirmed by Edward IV. when he abolished all the mints in
                    Ireland except those of this city, Dublin, and Drogheda. Waterford signalized
                    itself by its steady attachment to the royal interests during the attempts of
                    Simnel and Warbeck, in the reign of Henry VII. The latter of these pretenders
                    laid siege to it, but was forced to withdraw his forces, in commemoration of
                    which the city obtained its motto, “Urbs intacta manet.” At the close of the
                    longcontinued warfare which had devastated Ireland during the latter part of
                    Elizabeth’s reign, the citizens objected to having James proclaimed, and refused
                    admission to Lord Mountjoy, then lord-deputy, and his forces, until compelled by
                    his threats to submit. In the wars of 1641, they sided with the confederate
                    Catholics, and after several vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately capitulated to
                    the parliamentary army under lreton. In the subsequent war in 1688, they took
                    part with King James, who here embarked for France after his defeat at the
                    Boyne; and the city shortly afterwards surrendered, upon terms, to King
                    William’s forces under General Kirk.</p>
                <p>The walls of the Danish city enclosed a triangular area of about fifteen acres.
                    The only remaining vestige of them is a round tower, built by one of the Danish
                    sovereigns, and from him named Reginald’s Tower, which has been rebuilt from its
                    ruins, and is now occupied as a barrack. The county of the city extends along
                    the river from Carrick-on-Suir to Passage, and on the north side beyond the
                    river into Kilkenny county. This portion is connected with the main body by a
                    wooden bridge. It comprehends an area of 9683 acres, including 822 on which the
                    city stands, and contains twelve parishes, three of which are rural. The
                    corporation consists of a mayor, who has a sword borne before him, two sheriffs,
                    eighteen aldermen, and eighteen assistants, with a recorder and inferior civic
                    officers. The city returns two members to the imperial parliament. The
                    constituency, since the passing of the reform act, consists of the resident
                    freemen, the L.10 freeholders, the L.20 and L.10 leaseholders for a term of
                    years, and the 40 shilling freeholders during the continuance of the existing
                    lives. The numbers registered have been,</p>

                <p>The municipal courts are, a court of record twice in the week; a civil bill
                    court, for debts from forty shillings to ten pounds; a court of conscience, for
                    debts under forty shillings; the mayor’s court, for disputes as to servants’
                    wages; and a court leet and court of admiralty, both now obsolete. The city
                    business is transacted in the town-hall, an elegant modern building. Besides the
                    county court-house and prison already noticed, there is a city gaol, and a
                    penitentiary or house of correction. The ecclesiastical buildings are, the
                    cathedral, founded in 1076, but since taken down and rebuilt; several parochial
                    churches, Roman Catholic chapels, and dissenting meeting-houses. There are
                    several endowed schools, the principal of which are the blue-coat schools for
                    boys and girls. Among the charitable institutions are, the Widows’ Houses; the
                    Leper House, now a general infirmary; the Hospital of the Holy Ghost; the Fever
                    Hospital, the first founded in Ireland; and the District Lunatic Asylum,
                    confined to the county and city, and maintaining at present 101 patients, of
                    whom eighteen are idiots, and eighty-three lunatics, of whom thirty-four are
                    supposed to be curable. The literary and scientific institutions are, the
                    Waterford Institution, with a library and museum; the Literary and Scientific
                    Society, where lectures are delivered; an Agricultural, and a Horticultural
                    Society. There are cattle-markets twice in the week, and chartered fairs three
                    times in the year.</p>
                <p>The quay, which extends along the bank of the river from one end of the town to
                    the other, and from which most of the other streets branch out, is the most
                    ornamented part of the city. The custom-house is in its centre. Waterford
                    derives its wealth and importance from its commerce, which is now chiefly with
                    Great Britain. So early as the commencement of last century, it adopted the
                    liberal policy of admitting foreign traders to the freedom of the city, which
                    induced several intelligent merchants from the continent to settle here. The
                    exports are mostly cattle, sheep, pigs, grain, flour, and salted and dried
                    provisions. Mercantile affairs are superintended by the Chamber of Commerce,
                    incorporated in 1815, and by the Board of Harbour Commissioners, established by
                    act of parliament in 1816 for the improvement of the port. Under their
                    management a dock-yard has been constructed, capable of receiving vessels of
                    very large dimensions, and the main passages of the river have been cleansed and
                    deepened. The <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=853"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0853-0813"/> consequence has been a rapid and extensive
                    increase of trade. Steamers of the first class have for several years plied
                    regularly to Liverpool and Bristol.</p>
                <p>The population of the county of the city amounted in 1821 to 28,679, in 1831 to
                    28,821, and in 1834 to 29,352. Of the last-named number, 4427 were members of
                    the established church, 429 Protestant dissenters, and 24,433 Roman Catholics.
                    The population of the other towns containing more than 2000 souls each, was, in
                    1831, Dungarvan, 6519; Tallow, 2998; Lismore, 2894; Carrickbeg (a suburb of
                    Carrick-on-Suir), 2704; Cappoquin, 2289; and Tramore, 2224. (c. P.)</p>
