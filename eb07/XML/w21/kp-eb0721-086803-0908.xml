                    nobleman of the most brilliant parts, but of the most whimsical, extravagant,
                    and inconsistent turn of mind, was the son of Philip marquis of Wharton. He was
                    educated at home; and his father’s great aim was to render him a complete
                    orator. At a very early age he married a young lady, the daughter of
                    Major-general Holmes, which disappointed his father’s views of disposing of him
                    in such a marriage as would have been a considerable addition to the fortune and
                    grandeur of his illustrious family; yet that amiable lady deserved infinitely
                    more felicity than she met with by this alliance. This precipitate marriage is
                    thought to have hastened the death of his father; after which the son, being
                    free from paternal restraints, and possessing a fortune of L.16,000 a year,
                    plunged into those excesses which rendered him, as Pope expresses it,</p>
                <p>A tyrant to the wife his heart approv'd,</p>
                <p>A rebel to the very king he lov’d.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1716 he began his travels; and as he was designed to
                    be educated in the strictest Whig principles, Geneva was thought a proper place
                    for <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=909"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0909-0869"/>his residence. He first passed through Holland,
                    and visited several courts of Germany; and being arrived at Geneva, conceived
                    such a disgust against his governor, that he left him, and set out post for
                    Lyon, where he wrote a letter to the Chevalier de St George, who then resided at
                    Avignon, and presented him with a very fine stout horse; which the chevalier no
                    sooner received than he sent a man of quality to him, who took him privately to
                    his court, where he was entertained with the greatest marks of esteem, and had
                    the title of duke of Northumberland conferred upon him. He however remained
                    there but one day, and then returned to Lyon, whence he set out for Paris. He
                    likewise paid a visit to the dowager of James II. then residing at St Germains.
                    During his stay at Paris, his winning address and abilities gained him the
                    esteem and admiration of all the British subjects of rank of both parties.</p>
                <p>About the latter end of December 1716, he arrived in England, whence he soon
                    after set out for Ireland, where, though still under age, he was allowed the
                    honour to take his seat in the House of Peers, as earl of Rathfarnham and
                    marquis of Catherlough. Notwithstanding his former conduct, he immediately
                    distinguished himself as a violent partisan for the ministry; and in consequence
                    of his zeal the king created him a duke. He no sooner came of age than he was
                    introduced to the House of Lords in England with the same blaze of reputation.
                    In a little time he opposed the court, and appeared one of the most vigorous in
                    defence of the bishop of Rochester; and soon afterwards he printed his
                    lucubrations twice a week, in a paper called “The True Briton,” several thousand
                    copies of which were circulated.</p>
                <p>The duke’s boundless profusion had by this time so burdened his estate, that by a
                    decree of Chancery it was vested in the hands of trustees for the payment of his
                    debts, allowing him a provision of L.1200 per annum for his subsistence. This
                    being insufficient to support his title with suitable dignity, he went abroad,
                    and appeared to great advantage at the imperial court. From thence he made a
                    tour to Spain. The English minister was alarmed at his arrival, fearing that his
                    grace was received in the character of an ambassador. The duke received a
                    summons under the privy seal to return home; but instead of obeying it, he
                    endeavoured to inflame the Spanish court against that of Great Britain, for
                    exercising an act of power, as he calls it, within the jurisdiction of his
                    Catholic majesty. He then acted openly in the service of the Pretender, and was
                    received at his court with the greatest marks of favour.</p>
                <p>While his grace was thus employed, his neglected duchess died in England on the
                    14th of April 1726, without issue. He soon afterwards fell violently in love
                    with Miss Obyrne, one of the maids of honour to the queen of Spain, the daughter
                    of an Irish colonel, whose fortune chiefly consisted in her personal
                    accomplishments. All his friends, and particularly the queen of Spain, opposed
                    the match; but he falling into a lingering fever, occasioned by his
                    disappointment, the queen gave her consent, and they were soon after married. He
                    then spent some time at Rome, where he accepted of a blue garter, assumed the
                    title of duke of Northumberland, and for a while enjoyed the confidence of the
                    exiled prince. But not always keeping within the bounds of Italian gravity, it
                    became necessary for him to remove from hence; when, going by sea to Barcelona,
                    he wrote a letter to the king of Spain, acquainting him that he would assist at
                    the siege of Gibraltar as a volunteer. Soon after he wrote to the Chevalier de
                    St George, expressing a desire to visit his court; but the chevalier advised him
                    to draw near to England.</p>
                <p>The duke seemed resolved to follow his advice; and setting out with his duchess,
                    arrived in Paris in May 1728, whence he soon after proceeded to Rouen, where he
                    took up his residence; and was so far from making any conces sion to the
                    government of England, that he did not give himself the least trouble about his
                    estate, or any other concern there, though, on his arrival at Rouen, he had only
                    about L.600 in his possession, and a bill of indictment was preferred against
                    him in England for high treason. Soon after, the chevalier sent him L.2000,
                    which he squandered away in a course of extravagance, when, to save the charges
                    of travelling by land, he went from Orleans to Nantz by water, and staid there
                    till he got a remittance from Paris, which was squandered almost as soon as
                    received. At Nantz he was joined by his ragged servants, and from hence took
                    shipping with them for Bilboa, when the queen of Spain took the duchess to
                    attend her person. About the beginning of the year 1731, the duke, who commanded
                    a regiment, was at Lerida, but declined so fast that he could not move without
                    assistance, yet when free from pain did not lose his gaiety. He however received
                    benefit from some mineral waters in Catalonia; but soon after relapsed at a
                    small village, where he was utterly destitute of all the necessaries of life,
                    till some charitable fathers of a Bernardine convent removed him to their house,
                    and gave him all the relief in their power. Under their hospitable roof he
                    languished a week, and died on the 31st of May, without one friend or
                    acquaintance to close his eyes; and his funeral was performed in the same manner
                    in which the fathers inter the members of their own fraternity. He died without
                    issue, and his titles became extinct. The duchess survived till February
                    1777.</p>
                <p>Two octavo volumes, published under the title of his Life and Writings, include
                    seventy-four papers of the True Briton, and his speech in defence of Atterbury.
                    Other two duodecimo volumes likewise bear his name; and the same life occurs in
                    a publication called “The Poetical Works of Philip late Duke of Wharton, and
                    others of the Wharton Family, and of the duke’s intimate acquaintance,” &amp;c.
                    Lond. 1731, 2 vols. 8vo. On such a collection as this no reliance can be placed.
                    Ritson intended to publish an edition of the duke’s genuine poems, accompanied
                    with an account of his life.</p>
