                <p><label type="entry">WASHINGTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, the
                    first president of the United States, was born in the year 1732, in the parish
                    of Washington, in Virginia. He was descended from an ancient family in Cheshire,
                    of which a branch was established in Virginia about the middle of the
                    seventeenth century. Little is known concerning his education, or the early
                    years of his life. Before he was twenty years of age, he was appointed a major
                    in the colonial militia, and had then an opportunity of displaying those
                    military and political talents which have since rendered his name so famous
                    throughout the world. In the disputes which arose between the French and English
                    officers, about settling the limits of Canada and Louisiana, Major Washington
                    was employed by the governor of Virginia as a negotiator, and he succeeded in
                    preventing a threatened invasion of the English frontiers by tire French and
                    their Indian allies; but in the following year, when hostilities seemed
                    inevitable, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel, and soon after to the command
                    of a regiment raised by the colony for its own defence. In 1755, Colonel
                    Washington served as a volunteer in the unfortunate expedition of General
                    Braddock; and in that expedition, which was attended with great difficulty, he
                    exhibited so much calmness and intrepidity, that the utmost confidence was
                    reposed in his talents, and perfect obedience paid to his commands, by the whole
                    army. After having been employed in a different and more successful expedition,
                    to the river Ohio, the state of his health required him, about the year 1758, to
                    resign his military situation; and in the sixteen following years, durring which
                    period he married Mrs Custis, a Virginian lady of amiable character and
                    respectable connections, it would appear that he resided chiefly at his
                    beautiful seat of Mount Vernon, and was occupied in the cultivation of his
                    estate.</p>

                <p>When the disaffection of the Americans to the British government had become
                    pretty general, and had at last spread to the colony of Virginia, Colonel
                    Washington was appointed a delegate from that state to the congress which met at
                    Philadelphia on the 26th October 1774; and soon after he was appointed to the
                    command of the American army, which had assembled in the provinces of New
                    England. The conduct of Washington during the whole of the war, as well as
                    during the period when he presided in the government of the United States, has
                    been so fully detailed in other parts of this work, that it would be unnecessary
                    repetition even to give a general outline of it in this place.</p>
                <p>Washington resigned the presidency in 1796, after having published a farewell
                    address to his countrymen. This address was remarkably distinguished for the
                    simplicity and ingenuousness, moderation and sobriety, the good sense, prudence,
                    and honesty, as well as sincere affection for his country and for mankind, which
                    the author of it had always exhibited. It seemed to be a perfect picture of his
                    whole life. From the time of his resignation till the month of July 1798, he
                    lived in retirement at his seat of Mount Vernon. At this period, when the
                    unprincipled actors in the French revolution were carrying on their wicked
                    machinations in every part of the world to which their influence extended, the
                    United States resolved to arm by land and sea in their own defence. General
                    Washington was called from his retirement, and the command of the army was
                    bestowed upon him. This he accepted, because he considered, as he himself
                    expressed it, “every thing we hold dear and sacred was seriously threatened,
                    although he had flattered himself that he had quitted for ever the boundless
                    field of public action, incessant trouble, and high responsibility, in which he
                    had long acted so conspicuous a part.” In this situation he continued during the
                    remaining short period of his life. On Thursday the 12th of December 1799, he
                    was seized with an inflammation in the throat, and was carried off on Saturday
                    the 14th of the same month, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. In his dying
                    moments he displayed the same calmness, simplicity, and regularity, which had
                    uniformly marked his conduct through life. He saw the approaches of death
                    without fear, and he met them without parade. The well-ordered state of his
                    private affairs bore the stamp of that constant authority of prudence and
                    practical reason over his actions which was always the most prominent feature of
                    his character. His name will ever be remembered by, and precious to, all
                    wellwishers of mankind and of liberty, as that of the most prudent commander and
                    the most virtuous ruler that history has recorded. His life has been written by
                    Marshall, chief justice of America, and by Mr Sparks; and his state-papers have
                    been published, with an eloquent eloge, by Μ. Guizot.</p>
