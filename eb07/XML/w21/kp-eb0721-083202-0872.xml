                <p><label type="entry">WEBER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carl Maria Von</hi></label>, was
                    born at Eutin, in Holstein, on the 18th<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>According to Weber’s own account, he was born on the 18th;
                    according to another account, on the 16th of December.</p></note> of December
                    1786. His father, a lover of music and a skilful violinist, not only had him
                    carefully educated, but encouraged his musical pursuits, as well as his fondness
                    for painting, in which last art it appears that he made considerable progress.
                    The retired habits of his family threw him early upon his own resources for
                    amusement, and his passion for music speedily became predominant, and exclusive
                    of all other occupations. As his father often changed his place of residence,
                    Weber’s music-teachers were likewise often changed; and with this disadvantage,
                    that as they did not agree in their methods and opinions, what one of them had
                    taught, his successor untaught. This forced Weber to reflect, and to become his
                    own instructor. In 1796-7 he received valuable lessons in pianoforte playing
                    from Hauschkel of Hildburghausen. He was next placed under the care of Michael
                    Haydn at Salzburg for composition, but made little progress under that master,
                    who was then very old. In 1798 his first work of six <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fughetti</hi> was published at Salzburg, and was well received. Weber then
                    proceeded to Munich, where Valesi became his master in singing, and Kalcher in
                    composition. From Kalcher he acquired much knowledge of the art of
                    counter-point, which laid a solid foundation for his future studies. While under
                    Kalcher’s tuition, he composed his first opera, <hi rend="italic">Die Macht der
                    Liebe und des Weins</hi> (the Power of Love and Wine); besides a mass, sonatas,
                    and variations for the pianoforte, violin trios, songs, &amp;c. all of which he
                    afterwards destroyed. His next opera, <hi rend="italic">Das Waldmadchen</hi>
                    (the Wood GirD, was performed in November 1800, and met with more success at
                    Vienna and St Petersburg than he himself was pleased with afterwards, when his
                    judgment had become more matured. In 1801 he composed at Salzburg his opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn</hi> (Peter Schmoll and his
                    Neighbours), which was performed at Augsburg, but with indifferent success. In
                    1802 he went on a musical tour with his father to Leipzig, Hamburg, and
                    Holstein, and during this time studied a number of theoretical works, from
                    which, it seems, he derived little benefit. Dissatisfied with these, he
                    endeavoured to form a system of his own, and to apply it to an analysis of the
                    works of the old composers. In this he succeeded to his own satisfaction. The
                    next important step in his career was his visit to Vienna, where he became
                    acquainted with several eminent musicians, among others Haydn and Vogler, under
                    the latter of whom he studied hard for about two years, enriching his mind and
                    developing his powers by a close examination of various masterpieces of
                    composition. Meyerbeer, Gansbacher, and G. Weber, were at this time his
                    fellow-pupils under Vogler. During these studies he only published some
                    variations and a pianoforte arrangement of Vogler’s opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samori.</hi> Being called to Breslau as music-director, he availed himself of
                    his new position to obtain a knowledge of choral and orchestral effects. At
                    Breslau he composed the greater part of the opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rübezahl</hi> (Number Nip). In 1806 he was invited<pb break="no"

                    by Prince Eugene of Würtemberg to his court at Carlsruhe in Silesia, and there
                    composed two symphonies, some concertos, and other pieces. War having driven him
                    from this asylum, he resolved to abandon his public career till more favoured by
                    circumstances; and he resided for some time in private tranquillity in the house
                    of Duke Louis of Würtemberg. There he composed his opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Silvana,</hi> on the basis of his <hi rend="italic">Die Waldmadchen,</hi> and
                    also wrote a piece named <hi rend="italic">Der erste Ton</hi> (the First Tone),
                    besides some overtures, choral pieces, and pianoforte works. In 1810 he again
                    set out on a professional tour through Germany, and from this time devoted
                    himself entirely to his art. At Frankfort, Munich, Berlin, Vienna, &amp;c. he
                    and his works were most favourably received. His opera of <hi rend="italic">Abu
                    Hassan</hi> was composed at Darmstadt in the same year. Between 1813 and 1816,
                    he was opera-director at Prague; but giving up that post in 1816, he ceased from
                    his musical occupations for a time, contenting himself with visiting various
                    places, and quietly waiting till he should be called to new and greater
                    exertions. At Prague he produced his celebrated cantata, <hi rend="italic">Kampf
                    und Sieg</hi> (Battle and Victory). He declined various liberal offers that were
                    made to him, until he was induced to accept an invitation to form a German opera
                    at Dresden. There he composed his opera, <hi rend="italic">Der Freyschütz,</hi>
                    which was first performed at Berlin in 1822, with extraordinary applause. At
                    Dresden he produced in 1822 a drama called <hi rend="italic">Preciosa,</hi>
                    which was most favourably received. His opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euryanthe</hi> was also composed at Dresden, but first brought out under his
                    direction at Vienna in 1823, where, as he himself says, “it was received with
                    indescribable enthusiasm.” At Berlin his Euryanthe was rather coldly received,
                    and was there nicknamed by some musical critics <hi rend="italic"
                    >L'Ennuyante.</hi> It has been said that the <hi rend="italic">Libretto</hi> of
                    this opera was so confused and ill-constructed, as to overpower the beauty of
                    the music. A three-act comic opera, <hi rend="italic">Die drei Pinto</hi> (the
                    Three Pintos), which Weber had begun at Dresden, remained unfinished, and was
                    bequeathed by its author to his friend Meyerbeer, with a request that he would
                    complete it. In 1822 Weber suffered from pulmonary illness, and still more
                    severely in 1825. He appears, from some expressions in his letters, to have
                    anticipated a premature death; and, unhappily, his prognostics were too speedily
                    verified. In 1824 he began his opera of <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> for
                    London, which he appears to have finished about the end of 1825 or the beginning
                    of 1826. At the end of February 1826 he set out for London, where he made his
                    first appearance on the 8th of March at Covent Garden, as conductor of a
                    selection from <hi rend="italic">Der Frey schütz,</hi> and was received in the
                    most enthusiastic manner. At this time his countenance betrayed the deep impress
                    of mortal disease. On the 12th of April 1826 his opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oberon, or the Elf-king’s Oath,</hi> was performed at Covent Garden Theatre,
                    and conducted by Weber himself, who was again greeted with the strongest
                    testimonies of public favour. We now approach the melancholy close of this
                    eminent artist’s career. On the 26th May his benefit concert took place in the
                    Argyll Rooms, but was very thinly attended. On this occasion, bodily illness and
                    mental vexation so affected him that he was Barely able to go through his duties
                    as conductor. After the performance he sunk upon a sofa in an alarming state of
                    exhaustion. Ten days afterwards, at seven o’clock in the morning of the 5th of
                    June, he was found dead in his bed at Sir George Smart’s house, where he had
                    resided from the time of his arrival in London. On opening the body the same
                    afternoon, the three physicians and the surgeon in attendance found the larynx
                    and the lungs so diseased as sufficiently to indicate the cause of his death.
                    Weber left a widow and two children. Unhappily he had no relative near him to
                    close his eyes. His remains were interred in the vaults of the Catholic chapel,
                    Moorfields.</p>
                <p>While writing this article, we observe that the Oldenburg government has ordered
                    a bronze statue of Weber to be erected in Eutin; and also, that his works shall
                    be engraved on copper, and the plates preserved in the ducal library.
                    Impressions are to be sent as presents only to the different sovereigns of
                    Europe. The artists of the King’s Chapel at Dresden have, it is said, raised a
                    subscription for removing Weber’s body from London, to a tomb which they propose
                    to erect for it in the public cemetery of that city.</p>
                <p>Weber was an excellent pianist, but does not seem to have pushed himself forward
                    in that capacity. He expressed himself most vehemently against all those who
                    composed music by the aid of any instrument. He is described as a man of small
                    stature, very thin, with an intelligent countenance; sensible, well informed,
                    and very unobtrusive. His temper seems to have been amiable, and we do not find
                    any traces of its being seriously ruffled, except on the occasion of Castil
                    Blaze’s piracy of the <hi rend="italic">Freyschiitz</hi> for the Odéon at Paris.
                    Then indeed he wrote two very sharp letters to Blaze, dated 15th December 1825,
                    and 4th January 1826, but without obtaining answer or redress. A number of
                    interesting particulars regarding him is to be found in some his own letters and
                    other papers, published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Hinterlassene
                    Schriften von Carl Maria von Weber</hi> (Posthumous Writings of C. Μ. von
                    Weber), in 2 vols. 8vo, 1828. Among these are, his Autobiography, and “The Life
                    of a Composer.”</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned his principal works, and their very favourable
                    reception. It has been said that, in his Freyschütz and other operas, he
                    borrowed largely from old popular German airs, and that he has no great claims
                    to originality. If he adopted much from others, the children of his adoption
                    were at least splendidly clothed and richly entertained. Still there is much of
                    originality and beauty in Weber’s works, though it may be granted that he more
                    frequently depends upon bold effects of harmony and modulation than upon melodic
                    invention and expression. The example of Mozart, extended by Beethoven, Rossini,
                    and Weber, led to that system of unlimited modulation which has now become more
                    familiarized to the musical public, though not yet relished except by the
                    initiated. The whole history of music shows that the public ear is only
                    gradually trained to innovations in harmony and modulation; and even at this
                    day, some of the most elaborate works of Sebastian Bach, and his son Emanuel,
                    are <hi rend="italic">caviare</hi> to the multitude, from their extreme
                    abstruseness.</p>
                <p>Beethoven’s magnificent opera of Fidelio, produced in 1805, gave a new impulse
                    and direction to the German opera. The powerful influence of this great work is
                    very perceptible in the operas of Weber and other German composers within the
                    last thirty-five years. So is the influence of Beethoven’s pianoforte music upon
                    that of Weber and others. Although Weber cannot be compared with Beethoven for
                    original and powerful genius, fertility and sublimity of invention, still he
                    must be considered as a great master, possessed of much dramatic talent, great
                    knowledge of his art and of orchestral effect, and a high degree of brilliancy
                    and gracefulness in composition. His faults are, occasional dry and harsh
                    construction, want of unity in melody and of determinate rhythm, and the
                    occurrence of what are technically termed <hi rend="italic">strangled
                    modulations.</hi> Indeed, violent contrasts in harmony and modulation;
                    fragmentary snatches of melody, often hard and dry, without leading and
                    sustained subjects; the abuse of chromatic passages; vague and disjointed
                    rhythm; are the faulty characteristics of too many composers of the modem German
                    school when carrying license to extremes. This style may be called the
                    transcendental dithyrambic of music; wild, disorderly, heterogeneous,
                    anti-rhythmical<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=874"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0874-0834"/>. Weber however redeems his occasional faults by a
                    profusion of beauties. His printed works are numerous. Besides the operas
                    mentioned above, they consist of concertos, concertinos, pots-pourris, for the
                    pianoforte, the clarinet, the oboe, the bassoon, and the violoncello; sonatas,
                    variations, polonaises, &amp;c.; symphonies and overtures, among which last the
                    overture <hi rend="italic">Der Beherrscher der Geister</hi> (the Ruler of the
                    Spirits) is remarkably characteristic of Weber’s peculiar style. Many of his
                    songs published in collections are trifling; but his four-part songs, with
                    pianoforte accompaniment, named <hi rend="italic">Leger und Schwerdt</hi> (Lyre
                    and Sword), words by Körner, are excellent. A posthumous work of Weber’s, a
                    Stabat Mater for two soprano voices and one alto, was in 1826 intrusted by his
                    widow to the music-director Rungenhagen of Berlin for publication. In his
                    autobiography, he says that the following words may with justice be inscribed
                    upon his tombstone: “Here lies one who meant honestly, and wished to act
                    uprightly, both towards his art and towards his fellow-men.” <hi
