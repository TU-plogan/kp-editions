                <p><label type="entry">WHYTT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, an eminent
                    physician, born at Edinburgh on the 6th September 1714, was the son of Robert
                    Whytt, Esq. of Bennochy, advocate. This gentleman died six months before the
                    birth of this son, who had also the misfortune to be deprived of his mother
                    before he had attained the seventh year of his age. After receiving the first
                    rudiments of school-education, he was sent to the university of St Andrews; and
                    after the usual course of instruction there, in classical, philosophical, and
                    mathematical learning, he came to Edinburgh, where he entered upon the study of
                    medicine under those eminent medical teachers Monro, Rutherford, St Clair,
                    Plummer, Altson, and Innes. After learning what was to be acquired at this
                    university, in the prosecution of his studies he visited foreign countries; and
                    after attending the most eminent teachers at London, Paris, and Leyden, he took
                    the degree of doctor of physic at Reims in 1736, being then in the twenty-second
                    year of his age. Upon his return to his native country, he had the same degree
                    conferred upon him by the university of St Andrews, where he had before taken,
                    with applause, the degree of master of arts.</p>
                <p>Not long afterwards, in the year 1737, he was admitted a licentiate by the Royal
                    College of Physicians of Edinburgh; and the year following he was raised to the
                    rank of a fellow. From the time of his admission as a licentiate, he entered
                    upon the practice of physic at Edinburgh; and the reputation which he acquired
                    for medical learning, pointed him out as a fit successor in the first vacant
                    chair in the university. Accordingly, when Dr St Clair resigned his academical
                    appointments, Dr Whytt was elected his successor on the 20th of June 1746, and
                    began his first course of the institutions of medicine at the commencement of
                    the next winter session. In 1752, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
                    of London; in 1761, he was appointed first physician to the king in Scotland;
                    and in 1764, he was chosen president of the Royal College of Physicians at
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>But the fame which Dr Whytt acquired as a practitioner and teacher of medicine,
                    was not a little increased by the information which he communicated to the
                    medical world in different publications. His celebrity as an author was still
                    more extensive than his reputation as a professor. His first publication, “An
                    Essay on the Vital and other Involuntary Motions of Animals,” although it had
                    been begun soon after he had finished his course of medical education, did not
                    come from the press till 1751, an interval of fifteen years from the time when
                    he had finished his academical course, and taken his doctor’s degree; but the
                    delay of this publication was fully compensated by the matter which it
                    contained, and the improved form under which it appeared. The next subject which
                    employed the pen of Dr Whytt was one of a nature more immediately practical. His
                    “Essay on the Virtues of Lime-Water and Soap in the Cure of the Stone” first
                    made its appearance in a separate volume in 1752. His third work, entitled
                    “Physiological Essays,’’ was first published in the year 1755. This treatise
                    consisted of two parts: lst, “An Inquiry into the Causes which promote the
                    Circulation of the Fluids in the very small Vessels of Animals;” and 2dly,
                    “Observations on the Sensibility and Irritability of the Parts of Men and other
                    Animals, occasioned by Dr Haller’s treatise on that subject.” The former of
                    these may be considered as an extension and farther illustration of the
                    sentiments which he had already delivered in his Essay on the Vital Motions,
                    while the latter was on a subject of a controversial nature. In both he
                    displayed that acuteness of intellect and strength of judgment which appeared in
                    his former writings.</p>
                <p>From the time when his Physiological Essays were published, several years were
                    probably employed by the author in preparing for the press a larger and perhaps
                    a more important work than any yet mentioned, his “Observations on the Nature,
                    Causes, and Cure of those Disorders which are commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >nervous, hypochondriac,</hi> and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=918" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0918-0878"
                    /><hi rend="italic">hysteric”</hi> The elaborate and useful work was published
                    in the year 1764. The last of Dr Whytt’s writings is entitled “Observations on
                    the Dropsy in the Brain.” This treatise did not appear till two years after his
                    death, when all his other works were collected and published in one quarto
                    volume, under the direction of his son and of his intimate friend the late Sir
                    John Pringle. Besides these five works, he wrote many papers, which appeared in
                    different publications; particularly in the Philosophical Transactions, the
                    Medical Essays, the Medical Observations, and the Physical and Literary
                    Essays.</p>
                <p>At an early period of life, soon after he had settled as a medical practitioner
                    in Edinburgh, he entered into the married state. His first wife was Miss
                    Robertson, sister to General Robertson, governor of New York. By her he had two
                    children, both of whom died in early infancy, and their mother did not long
                    survive them. A few years after the death of his first wife, he married Miss
                    Balfour, sister to James Balfour, Esq. of Pilrig. By her he had fourteen
                    children, six of whom only survived him, three sons and three daughters. But his
                    course of happiness was terminated by the death of his wife, which happened in
                    the year 1764; and it is not improbable that this event had some share in
                    hastening his own death, for in the beginning of the year 1765 his health was so
                    far impaired that he became incapable of his former exertions. A tedious
                    complication of chronical ailments at length terminated his life, on the 15th of
                    April 1766, in the fifty-second year of his age.</p>
