                <p><label type="entry">WÜRTEMBERG</label>, a kingdom in the interior of Germany,
                    formed, within the last few years, out of the ancient duchy of the same name,
                    with the addition of several smaller territories progressively combined with it,
                    in the reigns of the last two sovereigns, by an accommodating policy, and a
                    sedulous regard to their own interest during the progress and conclusion of the
                    French revolution. By an armistice made with France in 1796, all the territories
                    on the left bank of the Rhine were ceded to that power; but by the opportune
                    peace of Luneville in 1801, and a separate treaty which followed as a
                    consequence of it, Würtemberg was raised to the dignity of a grand duchy, and
                    obtained several districts which had either been portions of small independent
                    states or ecclesiastical dominions. Among these were the cities of Heilbron,
                    Gmünd, Hall, Rothweil, and some others, with the districts around them. The
                    whole of these acquisitions extended over 633 square miles, and contained
                    115,000 inhabitants. In December 1805, in consequence of the part taken in the
                    war between France and Austria, the kingly dignity was assumed, and the
                    possession of several other portions was guaranteed by the former power. These
                    acquisitions comprehended several districts on the Danube, whose inhabitants
                    were estimated to be 158,000. In 1806, when the confederation of the Rhine was
                    formed, Würtemberg joined it, and stipulated to contribute to its support 12,000
                    men; in consequence of which, other considerable additions to its territory were
                    made. Several exchanges of dominion took place with Baden and Bavaria, but
                    rather for the sake of rendering the limits more distinct than to increase
                    possessions. The part taken by Würtemberg in the wars declared by France against
                    Prussia in 1806, and against Austria in 1809, led to a further augmentation; and
                    by choosing the precise moment for deserting the cause of Bonaparte in 1813, the
                    king was enabled, at the subsequent congress of Vienna, to obtain the sanction
                    of all the great European powers to the title which he had assumed, and to the
                    territory which had been acquired. The kingdom of Würtemberg was thus fixed in
                    the condition described in the following pages.</p>
                <p>The whole is nearly enclosed between Baden and Bavaria; the former bounding it on
                    the western and northern sides, and the latter on the eastern and southern,
                    except that on one part of its southern frontier the Lake of Constance separates
                    it from Switzerland. It is of an irregular form, extending from 47° 35' to 49°
                    35' north latitude. On a very small portion of its northern boundary it comes in
                    contact with the grand duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Its whole extent is 7573 square
                    miles, or 4,846,720 English statute acres.</p>
                <p>The ancient divisions of the duchy of Würtemberg were various, according to their
                    position and feudal claims; and the additional territories that had been
                    recently acquired were in very irregular and unequal allotments. Of late, a new
                    division has taken place into circles, which are again subdivided into <hi
                    rend="italic">Oberamts</hi> or bailiwicks. Besides these circles, the capital,
                    the city of Stuttgart, forms by itself a separate division, though its
                    inhabitants are included in the population returns of the Neckar circle.</p>
                <p>The circles, with their extent and population, are,</p>

                <p>By a subsequent enumeration taken at the end of the year 1835, the result, no
                    account of each circle being given, appears to shew that the males of the
                    kingdom were <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=985"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0985-0945"/>786,619, and the females 825,180, making thus
                    1,611,799. As the increase of the population seems still to be progressive, it
                    may probably at this time (1841) exceed 1,750,000 persons.</p>
                <p>This population is found in 130 cities (having or formerly having had walls), 128
                    market-towns, 1115 parishes, 558 hamlets, 2591 farms, and 269 castles or seats
                    of the nobility. The increase of population, calculated by the excess of births
                    over deaths, has been about 10,000 on an average of several years.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are partly of Swabian and partly of Franconian origin, and retain
                    the peculiar pronunciation of the races from which they are descended. There are
                    likewise some settlements of the Waldenses. The Swabians make use of many words
                    very different from the other German people, and adopt many variations in the
                    idioms not known elsewhere. These may be observed to alter at every ten or
                    twelve miles in travelling through the country.</p>
                <p>The prevailing religion in old Wurtemberg was the Lutheran, for which it suffered
                    most severely during the thirty years’ war. No toleration was granted to any
                    other sect except to the Waldenses, and they were confined within prescribed
                    limits, and even in those spots were under some strict regulations, and excluded
                    from the rights of citizenship. Since 1806, the three religious parties have
                    enjoyed the free exercise of their modes of worship, and a participation in all
                    civic rights, with eligibility to all public offices. The Lutherans and
                    Calvinists, now united, are distinguished by the name of the Evangelical Church.
                    Their number in 1833 was 1,087,413, and that of the Romish church 489,025. There
                    are many sectaries, such as Separatists, Baptists, Hernhutters, and others, who
                    are neither favoured nor persecuted by the government. Through the whole of
                    protestant Würtemberg there is a great number of persons distinguished by the
                    appellation of Pietists, who hold their private meetings for devotion, but do
                    not in other respects separate from their churches. The Lutheran church is under
                    the direction of six superintendents, whose dioceses are divided into fifty
                    deaconries, and supplied with 818 pastors. The Catholics are governed by a vicar
                    general, who is assisted by a council consisting of clerical and lay members;
                    the priests under them are about 640. The Lutheran clergy are in general better
                    supported, and taken from a somewhat higher class of people than in most of the
                    other parts of protestant Germany. The Jews, who have established themselves
                    chiefly in the new provinces of Würtemberg, amount to about 10,766 persons.</p>
                <p>Few parts of Germany have exhibited more or better specimens of knowledge and
                    talent than have been produced from the institutions for education in
                    Würtemberg. The state has, for its population, more means for acquiring
                    learning. The endowed classical schools are fifty-five, from which the
                    theological pupils are transferred to the university of Tübingen, where they are
                    maintained from the funds of the institution. In these establishments the pupils
                    are not confined to mere professional pursuits, but have their attention
                    directed to general knowledge. The university of Tübingen has long been
                    considered one of the best in Germany. There are, besides, the gymnasium at
                    Stuttgart, and seminaries for the protestant clergy at Maulbroun, Schoenthal,
                    Ulm, Heilbron, and Ochriengen; and for Catholics at Rothenburg, Rothweil, and
                    Ellwang. Schools for instructing the poorer classes of the people are amply
                    provided in every part of the kingdom, so that the knowledge of reading,
                    writing, and arithmetic is almost universal. No village is without its school,
                    and scarcely a market-town without a classical instructor.</p>
                <p>The kingdom may be considered as hilly, if not mountainous. On the eastern part
                    is the group of the Swabian Alps, and on the western the Black Forest, a
                    continuation of the Swiss Alps. The highest points of these two groups of
                    elevations are from 2500 to 2800 feet. The eastern are not so lofty as the
                    western ranges of hills, but they are more bleak, raw, and unhealthy. There are
                    no plains, but some extensive and beautiful valleys, highly fruitful, of which
                    that of the Neckar with its branches, and that of the Danube from Tutlingen to
                    Ulm, are the most celebrated. The various smaller valleys, running between the
                    hills, and terminating on the banks of the several rivers, present rich and
                    beautiful prospects. The woods are extensive, and contain almost every kind of
                    forest-tree; but the absence of hedge-rows is a great drawback to the beauty of
                    the country in most parts of the kingdom. The scenery is much indebted to the
                    rivers and the several tributary streams which run through all the valleys. The
                    Neckar rises in the southern extremity of Würtemberg, and, with many windings,
                    leaves the kingdom on its northern frontier, in its course to join the Rhine. It
                    collects the waters of the Kocker, the Jaxt, the Rems, the Ens, the Erms, and
                    the Zaber. The Danube rises in this kingdom, from the mountains of the Black
                    Forest, and leaves it at Ulm, on the frontiers of Bavaria. It is increased by
                    the several streams of the Iller and the Brentz. The Tauber, in the north, is
                    one of those streams which contribute to the waters of the Maine. The Schussen
                    and the Argen are two small rivers that empty themselves into the Lake of
                    Constance. That lake borders a small part of the kingdom. The Feder Lake, about
                    three miles in length and breadth, and those of Laufen and Pfaffen, which are
                    smaller, he within its boundaries.</p>
                <p>The land of Würtemberg has been recently classed thus: meadows 640,000, arable
                    1,620,000, woods and forests 1,520,000, and vineyards 61,000 acres; the
                    remainder is either waste or occupied by the lakes, rivers, cities, and towns.
                    In no part of Germany is so much attention directed to agriculture as in this
                    kingdom, and in no part of it are the practices so generally good. The
                    cultivation of green crops is much diffused. Turnips, but more especially mangel
                    wurzel, are grown to clear the land from weeds, and to a great extent have
                    superseded the former mode of fallowing. Potatoes are very extensively
                    cultivated, and not only form the chief food of the working classes, but are
                    used for the purpose of making brandy, as well as feeding cattle. The rape and
                    poppy plants are grown for making oil; and that which is expressed from the
                    latter is found to be equal, if not superior, for the use of the table, to the
                    oil of olives. Hemp and flax are raised in abundance, the former chiefly in the
                    middle provinces, and the latter most extensively in the district of the Black
                    Forest. The harvests of corn are tolerably productive of wheat, rye, oats, and,
                    in some of the warmer districts, of maize. The supply of grain is estimated for
                    the whole kingdom at about 23,000,000 bushels; of which, as potatoes are
                    extensively used for food, some is every year sent to supply the wants of the
                    neighbouring states. The woods afford more fuel and building materials than are
                    demanded for domestic consumption; and the surplus, by means of the rivers, is
                    conveyed to the countries lower down the several streams. The vineyards produce
                    abundance of wine, and, though generally not of a good quality, and much of it
                    very bad, its culture is found very beneficial. The best wines usually
                    comprehended in the general class of Neckar wine are those made on the hills
                    near the old castle of Wurtemberg, at Uhlbach, Fehlbach, Upper and Lower
                    Turkheim, Lichtenberg, Rosswag, Maulbroun, and Tauberthal. The most productive
                    vineyards are those on the western borders of the eastern Alps, where a single
                    acre has been known to yield more than 2000 gallons; but it more resembles
                    vinegar than wine. It is generally remarked that the Neckar wines have much
                    deteriorated of late years; which is attributed to negligence ir. the choice of
                    the most proper plants, and to attention being principally paid to such as yield
                    much, rather than to such as yield the best wine. The wine made in the year
                    1811, <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=986"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0986-0946"/>as was the case on the banks of the Rhine, and in
                    most parts of Germany, was of an unusually good quality; and such of it as now
                    remains sells for 300 florins the emir, while the wines of later years are not
                    worth more than 139 florins. The annual value of the wines made in the kingdom
                    on an average is L.400,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>The cattle in Würtemberg have been carefully attended to, and the cows especially
                    are of a very good description, which is attributed to the care in improving the
                    breed, and to their being generally stall-fed, or soiled with green food. The
                    butter is excellent, and in many districts good cheese is made, but the last
                    less extensively than with due pains it might be. The sheep have been much
                    improved by constant crossings between the old races of the country and those of
                    the Rousillon and Merino breeds, and now the greater part of the flocks are of
                    the fine-woolled kind. The breed of horses was at one time much improved by the
                    introduction of Holstein and English stallions. Of late years they have been
                    retrograding, but the government has now been induced to take steps, by
                    introducing studs of the best horses, for improving them again. The number of
                    cattle in the year 1820 was thus enumerated: horses 80,870, cows 599,490, sheep
                    488,940, swine 114,200, goats 16,620, asses 1008. There is however good reason
                    to conclude, from what is known of the prosperous state of the country, that the
                    increase in the live-stock has kept advancing in a degree similar to that of the
                    human beings.</p>
                <p>The fisheries are very productive both in the lakes and the rivers. The Lake of
                    Constance affords abundance of salmon trout, perch, carp, and barbel; the other
                    lakes and the rivers yield trout, eels, barbel, pike, and several other kinds of
                    fish; and in the Feder Lake the shad is found of a very large size.</p>
                <p>The only mines that are extensively worked are those of iron, at Neuhausen,
                    Fluorn, Neuenberg, Aalen, and Wasseralfingen. The ore from these mines is
                    prepared both by smelting and the hammer, and supplies the manufacturers of
                    Fredicksthal, Christophsthal, Ludwigsthal, Harras, and Heidenheim, with minerals
                    for their cutlery and ironmongery. There are saline springs at Hall, Sultz,
                    Offenau, and Weisbach, from whence are annually made about 8000 tons of culinary
                    salt; and a new spring, lately opened at Kochendorf, promises to afford a more
                    copious supply, so as to dispense with the quantity of that commodity now
                    purchased from the kingdom of Bavaria.</p>
                <p>Since the conclusion of war, some valuable mineral springs, before unknown or
                    neglected, have been used for medicinal purposes; and accommodations have been
                    provided in a style of elegance and convenience which attracts to them a great
                    number of visitors in the summer months, when the power of the waters is deemed
                    most efficacious. The principal of these are at Kannstadt, on the right bank of
                    the Neckar, a few miles from Stuttgart. There are more than thirty springs in
                    and about the town. The waters are cold; they contain Glauber, Epsom, and common
                    salts, mixed with a small portion of iron, and are found of great efficacy in
                    curing disorders of the digestive powers. At Wildbad in the Black Forest, nearer
                    to the capital of Baden than to the capital of Würtemberg, the springs are hot,
                    varying from the temperature of 65° to 100° of Fahrenheit. The water is
                    colourless, and has neither taste nor smell, but it gives out much carbonic acid
                    gas. Few ingredients of a medicinal nature have been detected in it; but the use
                    of the baths has been found by experience highly salutary in gouty and rheumatic
                    complaints, and the temperature being nearly the same as that of the human
                    blood, the use of them is highly pleasant to the feelings. The baths are hollows
                    scooped out from the granite rock, some large enough to hold many persons at
                    once, who, however, when bathing in company, have bathing gowns provided for
                    them. The supply of water is so copious that it is constantly flowing, and never
                    allowed to stagnate in the baths. Rippoldsau is also in the Black Forest, and on
                    the confines of Baden, to which duchy it formerly belonged. The accommodations
                    are tolerably settled, and gradually improving, but scarcely yet adapted for
                    more than 150 or 200 visitors. The water is alkali-saline, is pleasant to take
                    as a common drink, and is as effervescent as the celebrated water of the Selzer
                    well.</p>
                <p>The chief manufactory of Würtemberg is that of linen. The inhabitants of the
                    eastern Alps and of the Black Forest are employed in this branch of industry. In
                    those districts almost every female is occupied during the winter in spinning,
                    and every peasant is a weaver. Both fine and coarse linen is produced, and also
                    diaper and sail-cloth. In Münsengen there is a manufactory for damask
                    table-linen, which produces most excellent goods. In some parts of the kingdom
                    the females find employment in making a coarse kind of bone-lace. The
                    cloth-manufactures are inconsiderable, and seem to be far from flourishing; and
                    much of the wool clipped within the kingdom is either exported in the raw state,
                    or, after being spun, to the neighbouring countries. Cotton spinning and weaving
                    have been introduced at several places, but those establishments are in a
                    languishing state. Leather, glass, paper, snuff, beer, hardware, cutlery, with
                    oil, pitch, tar, and potash, are all made in different parts of the kingdom. The
                    breweries, and especially the distilleries, are numerous. In the large village
                    of Mossingen there are no less than 280 stills for making brandy and whiskey.
                    This is the country for making wooden clocks; and those works produced in
                    Würtem-berg, or from natives of it who have transferred their labour to other
                    countries, are to be seen in almost every part of Europe.</p>
                <p>The chief commerce of Wiirtemberg consists in the exchange of its commodities
                    with the adjoining states. It sells to them 18,000 oxen, 12,000 cows, 75,000
                    sheep and lambs, and 550,000 lbs. of wool, more than it buys. The usual export
                    of corn beyond the import is 80,000 quarters. The corn exported chiefly consists
                    of rye, most of which is sent to Switzerland from the Würtemberg ports of
                    Frede-rickshaven and Mersburg, on the Lake of Constance. The other sales include
                    linens, leather, snuff, pitch, tar, potash, oil. and wood, and wooden toys of
                    various descriptions. The imports are silk, cotton, wool, East and West India
                    productions, flax, hemp, hides, and salt. The balance of payments is usually in
                    favour of Würtemberg.</p>
                <p>The government of Würtemberg is at present an hereditary limited monarchy. The
                    king is the sole sovereign, and acts without control by his ministers, in every
                    executive department. He appoints to all offices, makes war and peace, commands
                    the forces, distributes rewards, confers dignities and honours, executes
                    justice, and dispenses pardons. Under the ancient dukes, within the original
                    territories of Würtemberg there existed a feudal constitution. The states,
                    consisting of fourteen prelates and seventy-one deputies from the cities,
                    exercised some legislative authority; but on the assumption of the kingly
                    dignity, and the addition of the acquired provinces in 1806, the monarch assumed
                    unlimited power, until the termination of the war, and the end of the congress
                    of Vienna, when a new constitution was promulgated. Two legislative chambers
                    were instituted. The upper was composed of the mediatized princes, the high
                    nobility, and the prelates of the Protestant and Catholic churches; the lower
                    consisted of the deputies from the cities of Stuttgart, Tubingen, Ludwigsburg,
                    Ellwang, Ulm, Heilbron, and Reutlingen, from the learned institutions, and from
                    the several bailiwicks. The privileges of the nobles were thought by themselves
                    to be invaded, and they did not concur in this constitution. Difficulties arose
                    in reducing to practice the project, and how far it may be realized, or how it
                    may eventually work, cannot<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=987" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0987-0947"/>
                    yet be fully ascertained. The citizens and the peasants enjoy equal rights, and
                    the feudal slavery of the latter is universally abolished. All have equal
                    pretensions to public employments, and all the Christian sects enjoy the same
                    rights. The feudal tenures are destroyed, and the estates formerly subject to
                    them are converted into freehold properties.</p>
                <p>The administration is executed by six ministers, whose departments are thus
                    denominated: justice, foreign affairs, domestic affairs, war, finance, and
                    police. Each of these ministers is at the head of the board which regulates his
                    own branch of the executive government. The law is founded upon the ancient
                    feudal principles which prevailed in Würtemberg at the earliest period, but in
                    some instances is tempered by the addition or intermixture of the Roman law. The
                    administration of justice in smaller matters is executed by provincial judges.
                    There are four superior courts for the four circles, and a supreme tribunal of
                    appeal and revision is established at Stuttgart.</p>
                <p>The finances of the kingdom are in an improving condition. The income, according
                    to the latest budget, amounted to 10,794,114 florins, of which about 4,000,000
                    are derived from the royal domains, and the remainder from direct and indirect
                    taxes. The expenditure was 9,150,460, thus leaving a surplus of 1,643,654
                    florins, which was applied to the payment of the interest and to the reduction
                    of the public debt. That debt has been reduced during the long peace, and now
                    amounts to about ‘23,000,000 florins, bearing interest at the average rate of
                    four per cent. The florin there is equal to twenty pence sterling. To the honour
                    of the kingdom, it is to be observed, that the expenditure on the church and on
                    education (chiefly for the iatter object) is greater than for the war department
                    by 350,000 florins.</p>
                <p>The army consists chiefly of what may be called skeleton regiments, and, though
                    now not exceeding 5000 men, can be instantly augmented in case of need to
                    16,000, by calling into service those on furlough. It would then consist of four
                    regiments of cavalry, eight regiments of infantry, a corps of guards, of horse
                    and of foot artillery, a small corps of riflemen, and another of sappers. The
                    contingent to the German league is fixed at 13,955 men.</p>
                <p>The cities whose population exceeds 6000 are the following. Stuttgart, including
                    the military, 35,000; Ulm, 12,500; Heilbron, 10,500; Reutlingen, 10,400;
                    Tübingen, 7500; Esslingen, 6500; Hall, 6300; Ludwigsburg, 6200; Rothenburg,
                    6150; Gmünd, 6050.</p>
