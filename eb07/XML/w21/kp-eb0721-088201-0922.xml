                <p><label type="entry">WIGTON</label>, a county situated at the south-west corner of
                    Scotland, is bounded on the west by the Irish Channel, on the north by Ayrshire,
                    on the east by Wigton Bay and the river Cree, and on the south by the Irish Sea.
                    It is consequently bounded by water on all sides except the north. No part of
                    the county is above thirteen miles from the sea. Its length from east to west is
                    thirty-four miles; its mean breadth is twenty-four. It is divided into three
                    districts, the Machers (flat country), lying between Wigton and Luce Bays; the
                    Rhinns (peninsula), which comprehends the portion lying west of a line drawn
                    between Luce Bay and Lochryan; and the Moors, which include the remainder, being
                    more than a third of the whole county.</p>

                <p>The increase in the number of the inhabitants between 1755 and 1831 has been
                    19,792; in other words, the population has been considerably more than doubled.
                    The number of square miles in the county being 459, there are seventy-nine
                    inhabitants to each square mile; the average of the whole of Scotland being
                    about eighty. The number of families in 1831 was 7514; of inhabited houses,
                    6404; the number of persons to each family being 4·825; to each house,
                    5∙66l.</p>
                <p>Wigton being a remote county, and having little intercourse with any other
                    portion of the kingdom, the greater part of the present inhabitants can trace
                    their descent through many generations; the only exception being in regard to
                    Irish settlers, who are somewhat numerous, particularly in the towns and
                    villages, and who, including their families, form about a fifth of the entire
                    population of the county. The Gallovidians are of Celtic origin; and so late as
                    the time of Queen Mary, Gaelic was their vernacular language. The surnames,
                    which prevailed in the county four and five centuries ago, and even at a more
                    remote period, still predominate, such as Macdowall, Mackerlie, Maculloch,
                    Mackie, Macklcllan, Macguffie, Mackinnell, Macgowan, Macgeoch, Macgill,
                    Macracken, Macnish, Adair, Dunbar, Agnew, Stewart, Gordon, Hannay, Broadfoot,
                    Donnan, Milroy, Milwain. While old names and old families thus obtain, very few
                    new ones, except so far as emigration from Ireland prevails, have been
                    introduced. But not a few of the oldest and best families were originally of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=923"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0923-0883"/> Irish descent. From these circumstances it may be
                    presumed, what is really the case, that the feudal feeling exists more strongly
                    and generally in Wigtonshire than in any other county in the south of Scotland.
                    Superstitious observances and traditionary legends abound. Belief in witches, in
                    ghosts, in lucky and unlucky days, and other similar hereditary notions, are
                    common throughout the county, particularly in the more remote and thinly
                    inhabited parishes.</p>
                <p>Poor-rates are unknown in this county, with the exception of one parish. Out of
                    the whole population, there are only about 700 receiving parochial aid; that is,
                    only one person in fifty-two is a pauper, being less than a third of the average
                    of England. The aggregate annual amount distributed among these 700 persons is
                    about L.1375, being rather less than L.2 for each pauper, or at the
                    extraordinary low rate of 6d. per head of population. The lowness of this rate
                    will be better appreciated when we state, that, previously to the new poor-law
                    amendment act in 1834, the average burden in England was thirty-three times
                    greater.</p>
                <p>The climate, though characterized by considerable variations, and though, on the
                    whole, subject to moisture, is regarded as salubrious. The instances of persons
                    being able to follow their usual occupations, even at the age of eighty, are
                    common. Alexander Credie, a native of the Machers, died in 1824, at the
                    venerable age of 108.</p>
                <p>The physical appearance of Wigtonshire is not varied. Even the district called
                    the Moors is not distinguished by any considerable hills or eminences; and it
                    has been remarked that there is no county in Scotland that rises so little above
                    the level of the sea. Nor are there any important rivers; at least none of them
                    is navigable except the Cree and the Bladenoch, both of which flow into Wigton
                    Bay; the former being navigable for six miles, the latter for two. But, though
                    not possessed of large and navigable rivers, this county abounds with spacious
                    bays and harbours, namely, Lochryan on the north-west, which stretches about
                    nine miles inland till it reaches Stranraer, where it terminates, its breadth
                    varying from two to four miles; Luce Bay on the south, stretching inward about
                    fifteen miles, its breadth regularly graduating from twenty miles at its mouth;
                    and Wigton Bay, varying from eight miles in width, till it reaches the Cree, a
                    distance of about ten miles. These two latter bays form two remarkable
                    promontories, the Borough Head on the south-east, and the Mull of Galloway on
                    the south-west, the two most southerly points in Scotland; the latter being
                    about one mile and a half south of the former. The most important harbours are
                    Carty on the Cree, Wigton on the Bladenoch, Garlieston on Wigton Bay, Isle of
                    Whithorn near the Borough Head, Glenluce and Sandhead on Luce Bay, Port Logan
                    and Portpatrick on the Irish Channel, and Stranraer and Cairnryan on Lochryan.
                    The fresh-water lochs, though numerous, only occupy an aggregate of seven and a
                    half square miles.</p>
                <p>The county abounds with towns and villages along the coast, but none of them is
                    of great importance. Of Wigton, Whithorn, and Stranraer, a separate account has
                    been given. Portpatrick, with a population of 1010, is situated on the Irish
                    Channel, nearly opposite to Donaghadee, between which places two government mail
                    steamers ply daily. The harbour is undergoing great repairs, and two piers are
                    erecting by act of parliament; the estimated expense is L.150,000. Glenluce,
                    population 821, is situated within 500 yards of the river Luce, and at the head
                    of the bay of that name. Newton-Stewart, population 2241, lies on the banks of
                    the Cree, eight miles north of Wigton. Garlieston, population 587, and the Isle
                    of Whithorn, population 697, are both situated on the west coast of Wigton Bay,
                    the latter being the port of Whithorn. Port-William, population 510, on Luce
                    Bay, possesses a good harbour.</p>
                <p>The soil of the three districts into which Wigtonshire is divided, the Rhinns,
                    the Machers, and the Moors, is very different. The soil of the first two is for
                    the most part a hazelly loam, dry, and well adapted for turnip husbandry; but in
                    the barony of Baldoon, which is regarded as the Carse of Gowrie of the south of
                    Scotland, and in the low-lying lands between Wigton and Newton-Stewart, there is
                    a great extent (above 25,000 acres) of rich alluvial soil; while the remaining
                    district (the Moors) is bleak and barren, chiefly devoted to pasture, with few
                    spots fit for tillage, great portions of it being mossy land, partially covered
                    with water, such as the <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> of Glenluce. The most
                    approved system of agriculture has been everywhere introduced, particularly in
                    the Rhinns and Machers. Of the relative proportions of land in crop and in
                    pasture, a correct idea may be formed from the fact, that out of 288,960 English
                    acres which the county contains, 101,136, or about thirty-five per cent., are
                    under cultivation; while 187,824, or about sixty-five per cent., are in pasture,
                    including 4265 under wood. Property in land in Wigtonshire is very little
                    subdivided. There are four or five large proprietors whose united estates
                    embrace about the half of the county. There are comparatively few proprietors
                    whose estates are under L.500. The average rent of land in 1810 was 8s. 6d. per
                    acre; the aggregate rent in 1837 was L. 175,000, being about 12s. an acre. The
                    valued rental of the county is L.67,642 Scotish, old valuation. Leases generally
                    extend to nineteen years. Two agricultural societies have long existed in the
                    county; and the class of farmers, in point of general intelligence and
                    professional skill, is highly respectable.</p>
                <p>Wigtonshire is devoid of mineral wealth, nor can it be said to possess any
                    considerable manufactures. There is a whiskey distillery at the Bridge of
                    Bladenoch, within a mile of Wigton, which consumes yearly about 16,000 bushels
                    of barley, and gives employment to between twenty and thirty persons. A woollen
                    manufactory was established in the parish of Kirkowan in 1822, which in 1838
                    employed thirty-nine hands. There are several small breweries scattered
                    throughout the county. The salmon and white fishery is carried on at the mouths
                    of some of the rivers and along various places on the coast, but to no very
                    considerable extent. Exclusively of fishing boats and steamers, the county has
                    ninety-six vessels; tonnage, 5371.</p>
                <p>But Wigtonshire, from the general progress of the arts of peace, now enjoys
                    advantages unknown there even a few years ago. Remote as is her situation, she
                    is reaping all the advantages which steam navigation is calculated to confer.
                    Two steam-boats regularly ply between her leading ports and Whitehaven and
                    Liverpool, so that a ready and advantageous market is opened for her sheep,
                    black cattle, and agricultural produce. A farmer can now send his stock and his
                    corn to Liverpool, and get them disposed of in the shortest time, at the market
                    price, and for ready money. Formerly the case was quite otherwise; corndealers
                    and drovers travelled the country, buying grain and cattle, with the view of
                    shipping them to an English market. Their purchases were seldom if ever made
                    with cash: on the contrary, it was almost the invariable practice to grant bills
                    for payment, at four or six months. These were not always men of capital, and
                    the business which they followed was, from its very nature, a most precarious
                    one; so that, in proportion to their numbers, a greater proportion of such
                    provincial dealers is known to have become bankrupt than of any other class of
                    men. Hence the great risk and eventual losses to which (as is known to the
                    present writer) the farmers in Wigtonshire were continually exposed, and the
                    general bankruptcy and distress that periodically ensued. In addition to the
                    steamers which regularly ply between Wigtonshire and England, there are two
                    steam-boats which sail weekly between Stranraer and Glasgow, so that the
                    inhabitants of this remote county have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=924" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0924-0884"
                    />now the ready and frequent command of the best markets both in Scotland and
                    England, either for buying or selling. We have already referred to the two
                    government steamers that daily ply between Portpatrick and Donaghadee. But while
                    steam-navigation has been productive of such important. advantages as we have
                    described, it has been attended with other results, which, though favourable in
                    a national point of view, are unfavourable to the district. The traffic and
                    travelling that had formerly prevailed between Ireland and England <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Portpatrick, through Galloway, have been in a great
                    measure turned into a new channel, and this county has in consequence
                    proportionally suffered. There is now very little travelling by this route; and
                    the steamers plying from almost every Irish port to Liverpool or Holyhead,
                    engross almost the whole of the travelling of which Galloway formerly enjoyed
                    the advantage. Nor is this all; the importation of Irish horses and black cattle
                    at Portpatrick has diminished to a similar extent. It appears from the New
                    Statistical Account of Scotland, No. 22, p. 153, that whereas the number of such
                    stock imported at Portpatrick was 17,275 in 1790, and 20,000 in 1812; it was
                    only 1080 in 1837. We may here mention, that the mail-coach was first introduced
                    into Galloway in 1804, and that it has since continued to run daily between
                    Dumfries and Portpatrick. There is not, and never was, an opposition coach in
                    Wigtonshire.</p>
                <p>This county is distinguished for the antiquity and number of its religious
                    houses. The oldest church built of stone in Scotland was situated at Whithorn,
                    as mentioned in our account of that borough; and in the 12th century a monastery
                    of the Premonstratensian order was founded there by Fergus, Lord of Galloway.
                    The same individual established another abbey of the same order called Saulseat
                    <hi rend="italic">(Sedes Animarum)</hi> near Stranraer. Roland, grandson of
                    Fergus, founded, in 1190, the abbey of Glenluce, for monks of the Cistertian
                    order; and the abbey of Wigton was established in 1262, for Black Friars, by
                    Lady Dervorgille of Galloway. (Murray’s Literary History of Galloway, pp. 12,
                    24, 26, 30, 2d edit. Edinb. 1822, 8vo.) There are also the remains of numerous
                    subsidiary churches and chapels, built either for the use of some baron, or for
                    the advantage of the remote inhabitants of a large parish. At the Reformation,
                    Wigtonshire contained twenty-one parish churches, exclusive of the various
                    subsidiary chapels referred to. Parishes have now been more judiciously
                    arranged: in some cases three have been united into one; and though three <hi
                    rend="italic">new</hi> parishes have been erected, the total number is reduced
                    to seventeen.</p>
                <p>Several eminent characters were natives of this county, namely, St Ninian, who
                    founded at Leucophibia, now Whithorn, the bishopric of Candida Casa, or
                    Galloway, and who died in the fifth century; Gavin Dunbar, tutor to James V. and
                    afterwards archbishop of Glasgow, and lord chancellor of the kingdom; Sir
                    Patrick Vans, ambassador to Denmark in the time of James Vl., and a lord of
                    session; Patrick Hannay the poet, son to Hannay of Sorbie; Andrew Macdowall,
                    Lord Bankton, author of Institutes of the Law of Scotland; Dr Macgill of Ayr,
                    and Dr Mackenzie of Portpatrick, two eminent divines, the latter author of
                    Ocean, Stella, and other poems; and Major Stewart Maxwell, author of the Battle
                    of the Bridge. Some distinguished men, both laymen and clergymen, such as
                    Archbishop Beaton, prior of Whithorn; Bishop Cowper; Lord Stair, the famous
                    lawyer; his son, the first earl of Stair; and grandson, Marshal Stair, were
                    connected with the county, either by office or the possession of property.</p>
                <p>The history of Wigtonshire, as part of Galloway, is not uninteresting. The
                    aborigines, who were of Celtic origin, were the <hi rend="italic">Novantes</hi>;
                    their chief towns <hi rend="italic">Leucophibia,</hi> the present Whithorn, and

                    >Promon</hi><hi rend="italic">torium Novantium.</hi> Galloway was invaded by the
                    Romans. On the retirement (448) of that warlike people, it was successively
                    overrun by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumbria, and by the Picts. But
                    notwithstanding their falling successively under the dominion of these various
                    people, the original Celtic inhabitants of Galloway were never entirely
                    displaced; their characteristic customs and manners continued to predominate,
                    and remains of such may be traced even at this day. They were distinguished for
                    daring heroism and intrepidity, insomuch that they obtained the appellation of
                    the wild Scots of Galloway, and obtained from the Scotish kings the privilege of
                    forming the van in every battle at which they were present. The province was for
                    upwards of a century an independent province, governed by its own princes or
                    lords. Alan, who died in 1234, was the last of the ancient Lords of Galloway.
                    John Balliol was grandson of Alan by his daughter Lady Dervorgille, and thus
                    possessed extensive estates both in Wigtonshire and the stewartry of
                    Kirkcudbright. The county of Wigton, with the title of earl, was conferred
                    (1341) by David II. on Sir Malcolm Fleming; but Fleming, amid the distraction of
                    the times, was obliged, in 1372, to dispose of his estates (though he retained
                    the title) to Archibald Douglas. From this date the Douglases reigned supreme
                    till their forfeiture in 1453. The county was then parcelled out among different
                    families, many of which still remain; and the Agnews of Lochnaw were created
                    heritable sheriffs. This office remained in their family till the abolition of
                    hereditary jurisdictions in 1747, with the exception of seventeen years previous
                    to the revolution, when Graham of Claverhouse and his brother Colonel David
                    Graham were appointed joint-sheriffs. (Chalmers’s Caledonia, vol. i. <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">WigtoN,</hi> a royal borough, and the capital of the county
                    of the same name, is situated on a detached eminence about 200 feet above the
                    level of the sea, at the confluence of the Bladenoch with Wigton Bay, and 105
                    miles south-south-west from Edinburgh. It consists mainly of one street about
                    600 yards in length, and, though narrow at the two extremities, so wide in the
                    centre as to admit of a square containing a bowling-green and spacious walks.
                    The houses are well built and substantial; some of them are old, and the town
                    altogether has a respectable and venerable appearance. It can boast, however,
                    neither of trade nor manufactures. The harbour is within a quarter of a mile of
                    the borough, and the dues are let for the small sum of L.26 per annum. There are
                    fourteen vessels belonging to Wigton, the aggregate tonnage being about 880. A
                    steam-boat plies between this port and Whitehaven and Liverpool once a fortnight
                    during the year. A branch bank has been established here since 1784. A packet
                    plies daily between Wigton and Creetown, on the opposite side of the bay, a
                    distance of about four miles. The population, which has long been nearly
                    stationary, was 1837 in 1831. In addition to the parish church, there is a
                    dissenting chapel; the only other public building is the town-hall, which also
                    includes a jail. Wigton was created a royal borough in the time of David II. The
                    number of councillors is eighteen. The municipal revenue is about L.350. The
                    borough unites with Whithorn, Stranraer, and New Galloway in sending a
                    representative to the House of Commons. The number of registered voters in
                    Wigton in 1840-1 was 102.</p>
                <p>The town can boast of great antiquity. The first church here was consecrated to
                    St Machute, an obscure saint, who died in 554. It originally belonged to the
                    priory of Whithorn, but was afterwards a free rectory, the minister of it being
                    a member of the chapter of the cathedral. The eastern gate of the present parish
                    church is supposed to have formed part of St Machute’s church. In the churchyard
                    there are monuments to the memory of several martyrs <pb break="no"

                    those in honour of two female martyrs, who were drowned in the Bladenoch in
                    1685. Wigton was the site of a monastery, founded in 1267, for Dominican friars,
                    by Dervorgille, daughter of Alan, the last lord of Galloway, and mother of John
                    Balliol the Scotish king. This monastery never attained to eminence, and no
                    remains of its ruins can now be traced. This latter remark is also applicable to
                    the castle of Wigton, once a place of great importance. It fell into the hands
                    of Edward I. in 1291. (c. I.)</p>
