                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">WIGHT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isle of</hi></label>. This
                    island, on the southern coast of England, in the British channel, is for most
                    purposes a portion of the county of Southampton, or Hampshire. It is separated
                    from it by a channel varying in breadth from two to six miles. In this channel,
                    though it contains no harbour of importance, there are many places of perfect
                    security, where ships may ride at anchor. The best of these is Spithead, the
                    great rendezvous of the British fleet in time of war; but in most other parts
                    the ground is good, and the vessels are well sheltered from storms. The entrance
                    to this arm of the sea from the west is by the Needles, some lofty rocks, five
                    in number; but two of them are nearly covered at high water. These obtained
                    their name from one which rose to the height of 120 feet, resembling that
                    implement of industry. It was undermined by the waves, and at length, in 1764,
                    fell down with a concussion that was felt at the distance of many miles. The
                    group has now an impressive appearance, especially when the agitated sea breaks
                    on their sides. The passage between them is generally free from danger.</p>
                <p>The island∙is divided into two hundreds, indicated by the principal river, and
                    called East and West Medina. East Medina comprehends fourteen parishes, and West
                    Medina sixteen. The whole land is calculated to be 105,000 acres, of which
                    75,000 are under the plough, 20,000 are devoted to pasture, and the remainder is
                    either waste or woods, or the sites of towns or villages, or occupied by roads
                    and rivers. It is said to have been formerly covered with woods, but to have
                    been in a great measure denuded by its vicinity to Portsmouth, and the great
                    demand of that naval arsenal for timber.</p>

                <p>The face of the country may be rather described as undulating than as hilly,
                    though there is a range of hills, or rather downs, running from east to west
                    through the island, with a few points of considerable elevation. There is a
                    great variety of rural scenery, adorned with a great diversity of foliage; and
                    though there are few or no woods, yet, as the fields are enclosed within
                    hedge-rows, among which fine trees, and especially stately elms, grow most
                    luxuriantly, these, added to the beauty of the verdant fields, present to the
                    eye of the traveller a succession of most pleasing prospects. The two sides of
                    the island present each a peculiar character. The northern side is marked by
                    every thing that is rich, lovely, and picturesque; the southern, or the part
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Back of the Island,</hi> abounds in bold wild
                    rocks, precipitous projections, ravines, fearful chasms, and other features of
                    the imposing, and a few even of the sublime. In some parts these opposite
                    characters are greatly mingled. There is a peculiar scenery on the south side of
                    the island, which is so striking to all strangers as to require a special
                    notice. It is a continued sinking of a tract of land, about seven "miles in
                    length, and from a half to a quarter of a mile in breadth. This singular
                    district consists of a series of terraces, formed by fragments of rocks, chalk,
                    and sandstone, which have been detached from the cliffs and hills above, and
                    deposited upon a substratum of white marl. This whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >undercliff,</hi> for such is its common name, is completely sheltered from the
                    north, north-west, and west winds, by the range of lofty downs or hills of chalk
                    or sandstone which rise boldly from the upper termination of these terraces, on
                    elevations varying from four to six and seven hundred feet in height. The two
                    extremities of the range are indeed higher, as St Boniface Down is 800 feet
                    above the level of the sea, and St Catherine’s Hill on the west nearly 900 feet.
                    The protection afforded by this mountain barrier is greatly increased by the
                    very singular and striking abruptness with which it terminates on its southern
                    aspect. This in many places consists of the bare perpendicular rock of
                    sandstone; in others of chalk, assuming its characteristic rounded form, covered
                    with a fine turf and underwood.</p>
                <p>The chief industry of the island is applied to its agriculture. The soil is for
                    the most part clay, with a mixture of loam, and in some parts of a very cold and
                    tenacious kind; it is however generally fertile, and the meadows produce very
                    great crops of hay. The grain sown, whether wheat, barley, or oats, yields good
                    crops, and affords more corn than is needed for home consumption; and hence much
                    flour is exported. As the harvest is ready to be gathered earlier by a few weeks
                    on the island than in the neighbouring counties of Dorset and Hants, the
                    labourers from them flock to reap the corn, and return sufficiently early to
                    reach their own homes, and there also to assist in the harvest-work. The manures
                    of the island, besides what the farm-yards and stables supply, consist of
                    sea-weed, marl, and lime, the latter of which is copiously supplied from the
                    chain of calcareous elevations which has been already noticed. There is little
                    foreign trade, though a great number of ships of all nations have intercourse
                    with the towns of Cowes and Ryde. Vessels from America, bound in search of a
                    market, especially during war, commonly touch at the former place to ascertain
                    the state of the different markets, and to communicate with London for
                    intelligence to direct their destination. Between the Isle of Wight and
                    Portsmouth is the great rendezvous of outward-bound ships from London; and in
                    war large fleets of East and West India ships are there collected to wait for
                    convoy. The demand for fresh sea-stores is consequently very great, and the
                    supply of it very advantageous. Fowls, live sheep, milch goats, milch cows,
                    pigs, and potatoes, are cheaper than in the Thames; and most outward-bound
                    vessels trust to obtaining such provisions at the anchorage of the Motherbank or
                    Spithead. During the long hostilities, by this description of trade the wealth
                    of the island increased very rapidly; and though, since the return of peace,
                    these sources of prosperity have been much curtailed, yet others have opened or
                    been extended. Ryde, as well as Cowes and several other spots, have become
                    places of great resort for sea-bathing, and have gradually acquired all the
                    accommodations to be found in the more ancient bathing places on the shore. Of
                    late, too, it has become the point of union for the vessels and members of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Royal Yacht Club,</hi> who have built a house at Cowes, and
                    made that place the resort of some of the most distinguished persons who take
                    pleasure in maritime adventures and expeditions. The population of the island at
                    the enumeration of 1831 was found to consist of 17,205 males, and 18,226
                    females. The chief town, Newport, at that period, contained 4081 inhabitants.
                    The other towns are, Brading, with 2277 persons; Cowes, in the parish of
                    Northwood, the population of which parish was 4491; and Ryde, in the parish of
                    Newchurch, whose inhabitants were 4928.</p>
                <p>The town of Newport returns two members to the House of Commons, as before the
                    reform act, by which the boroughs of Newton and Yarmouth were disfranchised. The
                    freeholders of the island used to vote for the members of the county of
                    Hampshire, but they now elect one member for the island.</p>
