                <p><label type="entry">WILSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi></label>, the
                    American ornithologist, was born at Paisley, in Scotland, on the 6th of July
                    1766. His father was a hand-loom weaver, and he himself followed the same trade.
                    His education was more liberal than that of many in similar circumstances. Some
                    poems which he published, especially those written in the Scotish dialect,
                    possess great merit. In 1794 he emigrated to the United States, where, after
                    working for some time as a weaver, he betook himself to the not less laborious
                    but more refined employment of schoolmaster. For <hi rend="italic">a</hi> series
                    of years his time was occupied in that country with various studies, such as
                    mathematics, the German language, music, drawing, and, above all, natural
                    history. At length he resolved to devote himself entirely to ornithology, and,
                    at whatever hazard, to form a collection of all the birds of the United States.
                    For this he was eminently qualified. In the words of his American biographer,
                    “he was not only an enthusiastic admirer of the works of creation, but he was
                    consistent in research, and permitted no dangers or fatigues to abate his ardour
                    or relax his exertions. He inured himself to hardships by frequent and laborious
                    exercise, and was never more happy than when employed in some enterprise which
                    promised, from its difficulties, the novelties of discovery. Whatever was
                    obtained with ease appeared to him comparatively uninteresting: the acquisitions
                    of labour alone seemed worthy of his ambition. He was no closet philosopher; he
                    was indebted for his ideas, not to books, but to nature....His powers of
                    observation were acute, and his judgment seldom erred. That his industry was
                    great, his work will ever testify; and our astonishment may well be excited that
                    so much should have been performed in so short a time. A single individual,
                    without patron, fortune, or recompense, accomplished, in the short space of
                    seven years, as much as the combined body of European naturalists have taken a
                    century to achieve. The collection and discovery of these birds were the fruits
                    of many months of unwearied research amongst forests, swamps, and morasses,
                    exposed to all the dangers, privations, and fatigues incident to such an
                    undertaking. What but a remarkable passion for the pursuit, joined with an
                    ardent desire of fame, could have supported a solitary individual in labours of
                    body and mind, compared to which the bustling avocations of common life are mere
                    holiday activity or recreation ?” With regard to the literary merit of his
                    “American Ornithology,” passages occur in the prefaces and descriptions, which,
                    for elegance of language, graceful ease, and graphic power, can scarcely be
                    surpassed. In America he composed various poetical pieces. The longest of these,
                    “The Foresters,” a narrative in verse of a pedestrian journey performed by
                    himself and two friends to the Falls of Niagara, is decidedly superior to any of
                    a descriptive kind which he had written in Scotland, manifesting great
                    improvement both in his taste and his power of composition. In personal
                    appearance Wilson was tall, handsome, and vigorous; but adapted as his frame was
                    for a life of activity, it gradually gave way under the accumulated and
                    harassing toils to which he was subjected, and he died of dysentery at
                    Philadelphia on the 23d of August 1813, in the forty-eighth year of his age,
                    when the publication of his great work, which appeared in volumes, was nearly
                    completed. Strong good sense, high moral worth, and a lofty spirit of
                    independence, were the characteristic features of his mind. With the feelings of
                    a poet, he had few of the defects that often cling to the poetic character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wilson</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Florence,</hi> better known
                    by his classical appellation of <hi rend="italic">Florentius Volusenus,</hi> was
                    born about the year 1500. He is supposed to have been born on the banks of the
                    river Lossie, near Elgin, and to have received a part of his education in the
                    university of Aberdeen. He afterwards prosecuted his studies at Paris, and was
                    there employed as tutor to a son of Cardinal Wolsey’s brother. Such an
                    appointment might have led to much higher honour and emolument; but the death of
                    the cardinal, which took place in 1530, compelled him to search for new
                    employment. Another cardinal, Jean de Lorraine, encouraged him in the pursuit of
                    learning, by assigning to him an annual pension, of which however the amount was
                    probably small, nor does it appear to have been punctually paid. He likewise
                    obtained the favour of Jean du Bellay, bishop of Paris; and in the year 1534,
                    when that prelate was employed on an embassy to Rome, Wilson was included in his
                    train, and had proceeded as far as Avignon, when he was detained by a malady
                    which compelled him to relinquish his engagement. In addition to his bodily
                    ailments, he had now to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=930" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0930-0890"
                    />complain of the exhausted state of his purse; and thus he was again left to
                    seek a new path of preferment. He appears to have been personally known to
                    Cromwell, then secretary of state, as well as to Gardiner bishop of Winchester,
                    Fisher bishop of Rochester, and Fox bishop of Hereford. On reaching Avignon, he
                    was informed that the bishop of the diocese was anxious to find some person
                    properly qualified to teach the public school of Carpentras. This prelate was
                    the celebrated Cardinal Sadoleto, who was himself distinguished for his
                    Latinity. Wilson lost no time in proceeding to the episcopal residence, where he
                    experienced a very gracious reception. The cardinal, as we learn from one of his
                    letters, was impressed with a most favourable opinion of his character and
                    attainments. His nice ear was gratified with Wilson’s classical Latinity; nor
                    was he a little surprised on learning that his visitor was a native of a country
                    so wild and remote as Scotland. He was speedily appointed master of the school,
                    with an annual salary of seventy crowns, which at that period was no
                    inconsiderable sum. At Carpentras he appears to have fixed his residence in the
                    month of November 1535. To the vocation of teaching grammar he would evidently
                    have preferred that of teaching philosophy. He did not abandon his philosophical
                    studies, nor did he neglect the study of theology. His earliest publication was
                    a theological tract, printed at Lyon in 1539. He next published the elegant work
                    which has chiefly recommended him to the notice of posterity: “De Animi
                    Tranquillitate Dialogus, Florentio Voluseno autore.” Lugduni, 1543, 4to. Wilson
                    probably continued to reside at Carpentras till the year 1546, when he had
                    formed the resolution of returning to his native country. He seems to have
                    cherished no antipathy towards the cause of reformation. The increasing
                    defection from the Romish church he imputes, in terms sufficiently plain, to the
                    pride, luxury, and negligence of the prelates; and three of the Italian
                    reformers, Martyr, Ochino, and La-cisio, he mentions, not merely without
                    censure, but even with undissembled approbation. Having proceeded on his journey
                    as far as Vienne in Dauphiny, he was there arrested by the stroke of death,
                    before the termination of the year 1546.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wilson</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> bishop of Sodor
                    and Man, was born in 1663, at Burton, in Cheshire. He received the rudiments of
                    his education at the county town, and from thence was removed to the university
                    of Dublin. His allowance at the university was L.20 a year; a sum, small as it
                    may now appear, which was in those days sufficient for a sober youth in so cheap
                    a country as Ireland. His first intention was to apply himself to the study of
                    physic; but from this he was diverted by Archdeacon Hewet-son, by whose advice
                    he dedicated himself to the church. He continued at college till the year 1686,
                    when, on the 29th of June, he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Kildare.</p>
                <p>The exact time of his leaving Dublin is not known, but, on account of the
                    political and religious disputes of those days, it was sooner than he intended.
                    On the 10th of December in the same year he was licensed to the curacy of New
                    Church in Winwick, of which Dr Sherlock, his maternal uncle, was rector. His
                    stipend was no more than L.30 a year; but being an excellent economist, and
                    having the advantage of living with his uncle, this small sum was not only
                    sufficient to supply his own wants, but it enabled him to supply the wants of
                    others; and for this purpose he set apart one tenth of his income. In 1692 he
                    was appointed domestic chaplain to William earl of Derby, and tutor to his son
                    James Lord Strange, with a salary of L.30 a year. He was soon after elected
                    master of the alms-house at Latham, which brought him L.20 a year more. Having
                    now an income far beyond his expectations or his wishes, except as it increased
                    his ability to do good, he set apart one fifth of it for pious uses, and
                    particularly for the poor. In short, as his income increased he increased the
                    portion of it which was allotted to the purposes of charity. At first he set
                    apart a tenth, then a fifth, afterwards a third, and lastly, when he became a
                    bishop, he dedicated the full half of his revenues to pious and charitable
                    uses.</p>
                <p>He had not been long in the family of Lord Derby before he was offered the
                    valuable living of Buddesworth in Yorkshire, which he refused to accept, as
                    being inconsistent with the resolves of his conscience against non-residence,
                    the earl choosing still to retain him as chaplain, and tutor to his son. In 1697
                    he was promoted, not without some degree of compulsion on the part of his
                    patron, to the bishopric of Man, a preferment which he held fifty-eight years.
                    In 1698 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Patten, Esq. of Warrington. By this
                    lady, who survived her marriage above six years, he had four children, none of
                    whom survived him except the late Dr Wilson, prebendary of Westminster.</p>
                <p>So great was the bishop’s attachment to his flock, that no temptation could
                    seduce him from their service. He more than once refused the offer of an English
                    bishopric. There is an anecdote of Bishop Wilson and Cardinal Fleury, which
                    reflects great credit on both. The cardinal wanted much to see him, and sent
                    over on purpose to inquire after his health, his age, and the date of his
                    consecration, as they were the two oldest bishops, and he believed the poorest,
                    in Europe; at the same time inviting him to France. The bishop sent the cardinal
                    an answer which gave him so high an opinion of him that the cardinal obtained an
                    order that no French privateer should ravage the Isle of Man. This good prelate
                    lived till the year 1755, dying at the advanced age of ninety-three. His Works
                    were collected by his son in 1780, 2 vols. 4to. Another edition was published in
                    2 vols. fol. by the Rev. Clement Cruttwell, who likewise published an edition of
                    the Bible in 3 vols. 4to, with notes by Bishop Wilson.</p>
