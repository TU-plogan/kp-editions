                <p><label type="entry">WATER-WORKS</label>.</p>
                <p>UNDER this name may be comprehended almost every hydraulic structure or
                    contrivance; such as canals, conduits, locks, mills, water-engines, &amp;c. But
                    they may be conveniently classed under two general heads, 1st, works which have
                    for their object the conducting, raising, or otherwise managing, of water; and,
                    2dly, works which derive their efficacy from the impulse or other action of
                    water. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> class comprehends the methods of simply
                    conducting water in aqueducts or in pipes for the supply of domestic consumption
                    or the working of machinery. It comprehends the methods of procuring the
                    supplies necessary for these purposes, by means of pumps, water or fire engines.
                    It also comprehends the subsequent management of the water thus conducted,
                    whether in order to make the proper distribution of it according to the demand,
                    or to employ it for the purpose of navigation, by lockage, or other
                    contrivances. And in the prosecution of these things many subordinate problems
                    will occur, in which practice will derive great advantages from a scientific
                    acquaintance with the subject The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> class of
                    water-works is of much greater variety, comprehending almost every kind of
                    hydraulic machine; and would of itself fill volumes. Many of these have already
                    occurred in various articles of this work, particularly in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hydrodynamics,</hi> part iii.— <hi rend="italic">On Hydraulic Machinery.</hi>
                    In describing or treating them, we have tacitly referred the discussion of their
                    general principles, in which they all resemble each other, to some article where
                    they could be taken in a connected body, susceptible of general scientific
                    discussion, independent of the circumstances which of necessity introduced the
                    particular modifications required by the uses to which the structures were to be
                    applied. That part of the present article, therefore, which embraces these
                    common principles, will chiefly relate to the theory of water-mills, or rather
                    of water-wheels; because, when the necessary motion is given to the axis of the
                    water-wheel, this may be set to the performance of any task whatever.</p>
                <p>CLASS I.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the conducting of Water.</hi></p>
                <p>This is undoubtedly a business of great importance, and forms a principal part of
                    the practice of the civil engineer: it is also a business so imperfectly
                    understood, that we believe that very few engineers can venture to say, with
                    tolerable precision, what will be the quantity of water which his work will
                    convey, or what plan and dimensions of conduit will convey the quantity which
                    may be proposed.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">RIver</hi> we have given a sort of history of
                    the progress of our knowledge in hydraulics, a branch of mechanical philosophy
                    which seems to have been entirely unknown to the ancients. Even Archimedes, the
                    author of almost all we know in hydrostatics, seems to have been entirely
                    ignorant of any principle by which he could determine the motion of water. The
                    mechanical science of the ancients seems to have reached no farther than the
                    doctrine of equilibrium among bodies at rest. Guglielmini first ventured to
                    consider the motion of water in open canals and in rivers. Its motion in pipes
                    had been partially considered in detached portions by others, but not so as to
                    make a body of doctrine. Sir Isaac Newton first endeavoured to render hydraulics
                    susceptible of mathematical demonstration: but his fundamental proposition has
                    not yet been freed from very serious objections; nor have the attempts of his
                    successors, such as the Bernoullis, Euler, D’Alembert, and others, been much
                    more successful: so that hydraulics may still be considered as very imperfect,
                    and the general conclusions which we are accustomed to receive as fundamental
                    propositions are not much better than matters of observation, little supported
                    by principle, and therefore requiring the most scrupulous caution in the
                    application of them to any hitherto untried case. When experiments are
                    multiplied so as to include as great a variety of cases as possible, and when
                    these are cleared of extraneous circumstances, and properly arranged, we must
                    receive the conclusions drawn from them as the general laws of hydraulics. The
                    experiments of the Abbé Bossut, narrated in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrodynamique,</hi> are of the greatest value, having been made in the cases
                    of most general frequency, and with great care. The greatest service, however,
                    has been done by the Chevalier du Buat, who saw the folly of attempting to
                    deduce an accurate theory from any principles that we have as yet learned, and
                    the necessity of adhering to such a theory as could be deduced from experiment
                    alone, independent of any more general principles. Such a theory must be a just
                    one, if the experiments are really general, unaffected by the particular
                    circumstances of the case, and if the classes of experiment are sufficiently
                    comprehensive to include all the cases which occur in the most important
                    practical questions. Some principle was however necessary for connecting these
                    experiments. The sufficiency of this principle was not easily ascertained. Du
                    Buat’s way of establishing it was judicious. If the principle is ill-founded,
                    the results of its combination in cases of actual experiments must be irregular;
                    but if experiments, seemingly very unlike, and in a vast variety of dissimilar
                    cases, give a train of results which is extremely regular and consistent, we may
                    presume that the principle, which in this manner harmonizes and reconciles
                    things so unlike, is founded on the nature of things; and if this principle be
                    such as is agreeable to our clearest notions of the internal mechanism of the
                    motions of fluids, our presumption approaches to conviction.</p>
                <p>Proceeding in this way, the Chevalier du Buat has collected a prodigious number
                    of facts, comprehending almost every case of the motion of fluids. He first
                    classed them according to their resemblance in some one particular, and observed
                    the differences which accompanied their differences in other circumstances; and
                    by considering what could produce these differences, he obtained general rules,
                    deduced from fact, by which these differences could be made to fall into a
                    regular series. He then arranged all the experiments under some other
                    circumstances of resemblance, and pursued the same method; and by following this
                    out, he has produced a general proposition, which applies to the whole of this
                    numerous list of experiments with a precision far exceeding our utmost
                    hopes.</p>
                <p>We must however observe, that of this list of experiments there is a very large
                    class which is not direct, but requires a good deal of reflection to enable us
                    to draw a confident conclusion; and this is in cases which are very frequent and
                    important, viz. where the declivity is exceedingly small, as in open canals and
                    rivers. The experiments were of the following forms. Two large cisterns were <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=826"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0826-0786"/> made to communicate with each other by means of a
                    pipe. The surfaces of the water in these cisterns were made to differ only by a
                    small fraction of an inch; and it is supposed that the motion in the
                    communicating pipe will be the same as in a very long pipe, or an open canal,
                    having this very minute declivity. We have no difficulty in admitting the
                    conclusion; but we have seen it contested, and it is by no means intuitive. We
                    had entertained hopes that this important case would have been determined by
                    direct experiments, which the writer of this article was commissioned to make by
                    the Board for Encouraging Improvements and Manufactures in Scotland; but the
                    infirm state of his health was always an effectual bar to the accomplishment of
                    this desirable object. This however need not occasion any hesitation in the
                    adoption of the Chevalier du Buat’s general proposition, because the experiments
                    which we are now criticising fall in precisely with the general train of the
                    rest, and show no <hi rend="italic">general,</hi> deviation which would indicate
                    a fallacy in principle.</p>
                <p>We apprehend it to be quite unnecessary to add much to what has been already
                    delivered on the motion of waters in an open canal. Their <hi rend="italic"
                    >general progressive</hi> motion, and consequently the quantity delivered by an
                    aqueduct of any slope and dimension, are sufficiently determined; and all that
                    is wanted is the tables referred to in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >River,</hi> by which any person who understands common arithmetic may compute
                    the quantity of water which will be delivered by the aqueduct, canal, conduit,
                    or pipe. These tables, which with great labour have been computed for this work,
                    here follow.</p>

                <p>This velocity is considerably smaller than what was observed by Mr Watt. And
                    indeed we observe, that in the very small declivities of rivers and canals, the
                    formula is a little different. We have made several comparisons with a formula
                    which is essentially the same with Du Buat’s, and comes nearer in these cases.
                    Instead of taking the hyperbolic logarithm of <hi rend="italic">√s</hi> +16,
                    multiply its common logarithm by 2¼, or multiply it by 9, and divide the product
                    by 4; and this process is vastly easier than taking the hyperbolic
                    logarithm.</p>
                <p>We have not however presumed to calculate tables on the authority of our own
                    observations, thinking too respectfully of this gentleman’s labours and
                    observations. But this subject will ere long be fully established on a series of
                    observations on canals of various dimensions and declivities, made by several
                    eminent engineers during the execution of them. Fortunately the Chevalier du
                    Buat’s formula is chiefly founded on observations on small canals; and is
                    therefore most accurate in works where it is most necessary, viz. in
                    mill-courses, and other derivations for working machinery.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to take notice of a few circumstances which deserve attention, in
                    the construction of canals, in addition to those delivered in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">River.</hi></p>
                <p>When a canal or aqueduct is brought off from a basin or larger stream, it ought
                    always to be widened at the entry, if it is intended for drawing off a continued
                    stream of water; for such a canal has a slope, without which it can have no
                    current. Suppose it filled to a dead level to the farther end: take away the
                    bar, and the water immediately begins to flow off at that end; but it is some
                    time before any motion is perceived at the head of the canal, during all which
                    time the motion of the water is augmenting in every part of the canal;
                    consequently the slope is increasing in every part, this being the sole cause of
                    its stream. When the water at the entry <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to move,
                    the slope is scarcely sensible there; but it sensibly steepens every moment with
                    the increase of velocity, which at last attains its maximum relative to the
                    slope and dimensions of the whole canal; and this regulates the depth of water
                    in every point down the stream. When all has attained a state of permanency, the
                    slope at the entry <hi rend="italic">remains</hi> much greater than in any other
                    part of the canal; for this slope must be such as will produce a velocity
                    sufficient for supplying its <hi rend="smallcaps">train.</hi> And it must be
                    remembered, that the velocity which must be produced greatly exceeds the mean
                    velocity corresponding to the train of the canal. Suppose that this is
                    twenty-five inches: there must be a velocity of thirty inches at the surface, as
                    appears by the table in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">River,</hi> p. 273.
                    This must be produced by a real fall at the entry.</p>
                <p>In every other part the slope is sufficient if it merely serves to give the water
                    (already in motion) force enough for overcoming the friction and other
                    resistances. But at the entry the water is stagnant if in a basin, or it is
                    moving past laterally if the aqueduct is derived from a river; and having no
                    velocity whatever in the direction of the canal, it must derive it from its
                    slope. The water therefore which has acquired a permanent form in such an
                    aqueduct, must necessarily take that form which exactly performs the offices
                    requisite in its different portions. The surface remains horizontal in the
                    basin, as KC (fig. 1), till it comes near the entry of the canal AB, and there
                    it acquires the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=829"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0829-0789"/>form of an undulated curve CDE, and then the
                    surface acquires an uniform slope EF, in the lower part of the canal, where the
                    water is in train. If this is a drain, the discharge is much less than might be
                    produced by the same bed if this sudden slope could be avoided. If it is to be
                    navigated, having only a very gentle slope in its whole length, this sudden
                    slope is a very great imperfection, both by diminishing the depth of water which
                    might otherwise be obtained along the canal, and by rendering the passage of
                    boats into the basin very difficult, and the coming out very hazardous.</p>
                <p>All this may be avoided, and the velocity at the entry may be kept equal to that
                    which forms the train of the canal, by the simple process of enlarging the
                    entry. Suppose that the water could accelerate along the slopes of the canal, as
                    a heavy body would do on a finely polished plane. If we now make the width of
                    the entry in its different parts inversely proportional to the fictitious
                    velocities in those parts, it is plain that the slope of the surface will be
                    made parallel to that of the canal which is in train. This will require a form
                    somewhat like a bell or speaking trumpet, as may easily be shown by a
                    mathematical discussion. It would however be so much evasated at the basin as to
                    occupy much room, and it would be very expensive to make such an excavation; but
                    we may, at a very moderate expense of money and room, make the increase of
                    velocity at the entry almost insensible. This should always be done, and it is
                    not all expense; for if it be not done, the water will undermine the banks on
                    each side, because it is moving very swiftly, and will make an excavation for
                    itself, leaving all the mud in the canal below. We may observe this enlargement
                    at the entry of all natural derivations from a basin or lake. It is a very
                    instructive experiment to fill up this enlargement, continuing the parallel
                    sides of the drain quite to the side of the lake. We shall immediately observe
                    the water grow shallower in the drain, and its performance will diminish.
                    Supposing the ditch carried on with parallel sides quite to the side of the
                    basin, if we build two walls or dikes from the extremities of those sides,
                    bending outwards with a proper curvature (and this will often be less costly
                    than widening the drain), the discharge will be greatly increased. We have seen
                    instances where it was nearly doubled.</p>
                <p>The enlargement at the mouths of rivers is generally owing to the same cause. The
                    tide of flood up the river produces a superficial slope opposite to that of the
                    river, and this widens the mouth. This is most remarkable when the tides are
                    high, and the river has little slope.</p>
                <p>After this great fall at the entry of the canal, in which all the filaments are
                    much accelerated, and the inferior ones most of all, things take a contrary
                    turn. The water, by rubbing on the bottom and the sides, is retarded; and
                    therefore the section must, from being shallow, become a little deeper, and the
                    surface will be convex for some distance, till all comes into train. When this
                    is established, the filaments nearest the bottom and side are moving slowest,
                    and the surface, in the middle especially, retains the greatest velocity,
                    gliding over the rest. The velocity in the canal, and the depth of the section,
                    adjust themselves in such a manner that the difference between the surface of
                    the basin and the surface of the uniform section of the canal corresponds
                    exactly to the velocity. Thus, if this be observed to be two feet in a second,
                    the difference of height will be <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> ths of an inch.</p>
                <p>All the practical questions that are of considerable importance respecting the
                    motion of water in aqueducts, may be easily, though not elegantly, solved by
                    means of the tables.</p>
                <p>But it is to be remembered, that these tables relate only to uniform motion, that
                    is, to water that is in train, and where the velocity suffers no change by
                    lengthening the conduit, provided the slope remain the same. It is much more
                    difficult to determine what will be the velocity, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
                    in a canal of which nothing is given but the form, and slope, and depth of the
                    entry, without saying how deep the water runs in it. And it is here that the
                    common doctrines of hydraulics are most in fault, and unable to teach us how
                    deep the water will run in a canal, though the depth of the basin at the entry
                    be perfectly known. Between the part of the canal which is in train and the
                    basin, there is an interval where the water is in a state of acceleration, and
                    is afterwards retarded.</p>
                <p>The determination of the motions in this interval is exceedingly difficult, even
                    in a rectangular canal. It was one great aim of Du Buat’s experiments to
                    ascertain this by measuring accurately the depth of the water. But he found that
                    when the slope was but a very few inches in the whole length of his canal, it
                    was not in train for want of greater length; and when the slope was still less,
                    the small fractions of an inch, by which he was to judge of the variations of
                    depth, could not be measured with sufficient accuracy. It would be a most
                    desirable point to determine the length of a canal, whose slope and other
                    dimensions are given, which will bring it into train; and what is the ratio
                    which will then obtain between the depth at the entry, and the depth which will
                    be maintained. Till this be done, the engineer cannot ascertain by a direct
                    process what quantity of water will be drawn off from a reservoir by a given
                    canal. But as yet this is out of our reach. Experiments however are in view
                    which will promote the investigation.</p>
                <p>But this and similar questions are of such importance that we cannot be said to
                    have improved hydraulics unless we can give a tolerably precise answer. This we
                    can do by a sort of retrograde process, proceeding on the principles of uniform
                    motion established by the Chevalier du Buat. We may suppose a train maintained
                    in the canal, and then examine whether this train <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be
                    produced by any fall that is possible at the entry. If it can, we may be certain
                    that it is so produced, and our problem is solved.</p>
                <p>We shall now point out the methods of answering some chief questions of this
                    kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quest.</hi> 1. Given the slope <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and the
                    breadth <hi rend="italic">w</hi> of a canal, and the height H of the surface of

                    which is discharged.</p>
                <p>The chief difficulty is to find the depth of the stream where it is in train. For
                    this end, we may simplify the hydraulic theorem of uniform motion in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">River;</hi> making V = <hi rend="superscript"> √N</hi><hi

                    of the canal, and it may in most common cases be taken = 244; so that √N <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> may be somewhat less than 307. To find it, we may begin by
                    taking for our depth of stream a quantity A, somewhat smaller than H the height
                    of the surface of the basin above the bottom of the canal. With this depth, and
                    the known width <hi rend="italic">w</hi> of the canal, we can find the hydraulic
                    depth <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">River,</hi> p. 265).
                    Then with √ <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and the slope find V by the table: make
                    this V = <hi rend="superscript"> √N</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> gd</hi> /

                    rend="italic">g</hi> is sufficiently exact; for a small error of depth hardly
                    affects the hydraulic mean depth.</p>

                <p>Having thus obtained the depth <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the stream, we obtain

                    and the velocity V.</p>
                <p>But as this was but an approximation, it is necessary to examine whether the
                    velocity V be possible. This is very easy. It must be produced by the fall H —
                    <hi rend="italic">h. We</hi> shall have no occasion for any correction of our
                    first assumption, if <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has not been extravagantly
                    erroneous, because a small mistake in <hi rend="italic">h</hi> produces almost
                    the same variation in <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The test of accuracy however is,
                    that <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, together with the height which will produce the
                    velocity V, must make up the whole height H. Assuming <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    too small, leaves H — <hi rend="italic">h</hi> too great, and will give a small
                    velocity V, which requires a small value of H — <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The
                    error of H — <hi rend="italic">h</hi> therefore is always greater than the error
                    we have committed in our first assumption. Therefore when this error of H — <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> is but a trifle, such as one fourth of an inch, we may rest
                    satisfied with our answer.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the easiest process may be the following: Suppose the whole stream in
                    train to have the depth H. The velocity V obtained for this depth and slope by
                    the table requires a certain depth <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> Make √H + <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi>: H = H: <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> will be exceedingly near the truth. The reason is obvious.</p>

                <p>This will give an equation containing only <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and known
                    quantities. But it will be very complicated, and we must have recourse to an
                    approximation. This will be best understood in the form of an example.</p>
                <p>Suppose the depth at the entry to be 18 inches, and the slope <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1000</hi>. Let 1200 cubic
                    feet of water per minute be the quantity of water to be drawn off for working
                    machinery, or any other purpose; and let the canal be supposed of the best form
                    recommended in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">River,</hi> where the base of
                    the sloping side is four thirds of the height.</p>
                <p>***V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>The slightest consideration will show us, that if be taken for the height
                    producing the velocity, it cannot exceed three inches, nor be less than one.
                    Suppose it two inches, and therefore the depth of the stream in the canal to be
                    sixteen inches; find the mean width of the canal by the *****Q . ,. , <hi
                    rend="subscript"> λ</hi>.</p>
                <p>equation <hi rend="italic">w — —</hi>, in which Q is</p>
                <p>A(√d-0∙Dg¾-0∙s)</p>
                <p>twenty cubic feet (the sixtieth part of 1200), √S is = 28·153 = √1000—L√1000+1∙6,
                    and <hi rend="italic">h=</hi> 16. This gives <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = 5∙52
                    feet. The section <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 7∙36 feet, and V = 32∙6 inches.
                    This requires a fall of 1∙52 inches instead of two inches. Take this from
                    eighteen, and there remains 16∙48, which we shall find not to differ one tenth
                    of an inch from the exact depth which the water will acquire and maintain. We
                    may therefore be satisfied with assuming 5∙36 feet as the mean width, and 3∙53
                    feet for the width at the bottom.</p>
                <p>This approximation proceeds on the consideration, that when the width diminishes
                    by a small quantity, and in the same proportion that the depth increases, the
                    hydraulic mean depth remains the same, and therefore the velocity also remains,
                    and the quantity discharged changes in the exact proportion of the section. Any
                    minute error which may result from this supposition, may be corrected by
                    increasing the fall producing the velocity, in the proportion of the first
                    hydraulic mean depth to the mean depth corresponding to the new dimensions found
                    for the canal. It will now become 1∙53, and V will be 32∙72, and the depth will
                    be 16∙47. The quantity discharged being divided by V, will give the section =
                    7∙335 feet, from which, and the new depth, we obtain 5·344 for the width.</p>
                <p>This and the foregoing are the most common questions proposed to an engineer. We
                    asserted with some confidence that few of the profession are able to answer them
                    with tolerable precision. We cannot offend the professional gentlemen by this,
                    when we inform them that the Academy of Sciences at Paris were occupied during
                    several months with an examination of a plan proposed by M. de Parcieux, for
                    bringing the waters of the Yvette into Paris, and after the most mature
                    consideration, gave in a report of the quantity of water which Μ. de Parcieux’s
                    aqueduct would yield; and that their report has been found erroneous in the
                    proportion of at least two to five; for the waters have been brought in, and
                    exceed the report in this proportion. Indeed, long after giving in the report,
                    M. Perronet, the most celebrated engineer in France, affirmed that the
                    dimensions proposed were much greater than were necessary, and said that an
                    aqueduct of five and a half feet wide and three and a half deep, with a slope of
                    fifteen inches in a thousand fathoms, would have a velocity of twelve or
                    thirteen inches per second, which would bring in all the water furnished by the
                    proposed sources. The great diminution of expense occasioned by the alteration
                    encouraged the community to undertake the work. It was accordingly begun, and a
                    part executed. The water was found to run with a velocity of near nineteen
                    inches when it was three and a half feet deep. M. Perronet founded his
                    computation on his own experience alone, acknowledging that he had no theory to
                    instruct him. The work was carried no farther, it being found that the city
                    could be supplied at a much smaller expense by steam-engines erected by Boulton
                    and Watt. But the facts which occurred in the partial execution of the aqueduct
                    are very valuable. If M. Perronet’s aqueduct be examined by our general formula,
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> will be found = and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = 18·72,
                    from which we deduce the velocity = 18 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, agreeing with the observation with astonishing
                    precision.</p>
                <p>The experiments at Turin by Michelotti on canals were very numerous, but
                    complicated with many circumstances which would render the discussion too long
                    for this place. When cleared of these circumstances, which we have done with
                    scrupulous care, they are also abundantly conformable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=831" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0831-0791"/>to
                    our theory of the uniform motion of running waters. But to return to our
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Should it be required to bring off at once from the basin a mill-course having a
                    determined velocity for driving an undershot wheel, the problem becomes easier,
                    because the velocity and slope combined determine the hydraulic mean depth at
                    once; and the depth of the stream will be had by means of the height which must
                    be taken for the whole depth at the entry, in order to produce the required
                    velocity.</p>
                <p>In like manner, having given the quantity to be discharged, and the velocity and
                    the depth at the entry, we can find the other dimensions of the channel; and the
                    mean depth being found, we can determine the slope.</p>
                <p>When the slope of a canal is very small, so that the depth of the uniform stream
                    differs but a little from that at the entry, the quantity discharged is but
                    small. But a great velocity, requiring a great fall at the entry, produces a
                    great diminution of depth, and therefore it may not compensate for this
                    diminution, and the quantity discharged may be smaller. Improbable as this may
                    appear, it is not demonstrably false; and hence we see the propriety of the
                    following question.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Question</hi> 3. Given the depth H at the entry of a

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the unknown depth of the stream. H — <hi

                    give the equation <hi rend="underline">2 H</hi> =3 <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or

                    With these data the slope is easily had by the formula for uniform motion.</p>
                <p>If the canal is of the trapezoidal form, the investigation is more troublesome,
                    and requires the resolution of a cubic equation.</p>
                <p>It may appear strange that increasing the slope of a canal beyond the quantity
                    determined by this problem can diminish the quantity of water conveyed. But one
                    of these two things must happen; either the motion will not acquire uniformity
                    in such a canal for want of length, or the discharge must diminish. Supposing,
                    however, that it could augment, we can judge how far this can go. Let us take
                    the extreme case by making the canal vertical. In this case it becomes a simple
                    weir or waste-board. Now the discharge of a waste-board is ****§ √2 Gw (∕i"—(A
                    A)^)∙ The maximum determined by the preceding problem is to that of the
                    waste-board of the same dimensions as ***H√ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    asH√⅜HtH√H-⅜H√⅜H = 5773: 6465, nearly = 9:10.</p>
                <p>Having given the dimensions and slope of a canal, we can discover the relation
                    between its expenditure and the time: or we can tell how much it will sink the
                    surface of a pond in twenty-four hours, and the gradual progress of this effect;
                    and this might be made the subject of a particular problem, but it is
                    complicated and difficult. In cases where this is an interesting object, we may
                    solve the question with sufficient accuracy, by calculating the expenditure at
                    the beginning, supposing the basin kept full. Then, from the known area of the
                    pond, we can tell in what time this expenditure will sink an inch; do the same
                    on the supposition that the water is one third lower, and that it is two thirds
                    lower (noticing the contraction of the surface of the pond occasioned by this
                    abstraction of its waters). Thus we shall obtain three rates of diminution, from
                    which we can easily deduce the desired relation between the expenditure and the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Aqueducts derived from a basin or river are commonly furnished with a sluice at
                    the entry. This changes exceedingly the state of things. The slope of the canal
                    may be precisely such as will maintain the mean velocity of the water which
                    passes under the sluice; in which case the depth of the stream is equal to that
                    of the sluice, and the velocity is produced at once by the head of water above
                    it. But if the slope is less than this, the velocity of the issuing water is
                    diminished, and the water must rise in the canal. This must check the efflux at
                    the sluice, and the water will be as it were stagnant above what comes through
                    below it It is extremely difficult to determine at what precise slope the water
                    will begin to check the efflux. The contraction at the lower edge of the board
                    hinders the water from attaining at once the whole depth which it acquires
                    afterwards, when its velocity diminishes by the obstructions. While the
                    regorging which these obstructions occasion does not reach back to the sluice,
                    the efflux is not affected by it. Even when it does reach to the sluice, there
                    will be a less depth immediately behind it than farther down the canal, where it
                    is in train; because the swift moving water which is next the bottom drags with
                    it the regorged water which lies on it: but the canal must be rapid to make this
                    difference of depth sensible. In ordinary canals, with moderate slopes and
                    velocities, the velocity at the sluice may be safely taken as if it were that
                    which corresponds to the difference of depths above and below the sluice, where
                    both were in train.</p>
                <p>Let therefore H be the depth above the sluice, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the
                    depth in the canal. Let <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be the elevation of the sluice

                    only uncertainty is in the quantity G, which expresses the velocity competent to
                    the passage of the water through the orifice, circumstanced as it is, namely,
                    subjected to contraction. This may be regulated by a proper form given to the
                    entry into this orifice. The contraction may be almost annihilated by making the
                    masonry of a cycloidal form on both sides, and also at the lower edge of the
                    sluice-board, so as to give the orifice a form resembling fig. 5, D, in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">River.</hi> If the sluice is thin in the face of a
                    basin, the contraction will reduce 2 G to 296. If the sluice be as wide as the

                <p>The performance of aqueduct drains is a very important object, and merits our
                    attention in this place. While the art of managing waters, and of conducting
                    them so as to answer our demands, renders us very important service, by
                    embellishing our habitations, or promoting our commercial intercourse, the art
                    of draining creates as it were new riches, fertilizing tracts of bog or marsh,
                    which were not only useless, but hurtful by their unwholesome exhalations, and
                    converting them into rich pastures and gay meadows. A wild country, occupied by
                    marshes which are inaccessible to herds or flocks, and serve only for the haunts
                    of water-fowls, or the retreat of a few poor fishermen, when • once it is freed
                    from the waters in which it is drowned, opens its lap to receive the most
                    precious seeds, is soon clothed in the richest garb, gives life and abundance to
                    numerous herds, and never fails to become the delight of the industrious
                    cultivator who has enfranchised it, and is attached to it by the labour which it
                    cost him. In return, it procures him abundance, and supplies him with the means
                    of daily augmenting its fertility. No species of agriculture exhibits such
                    long-continued and progressive improvement. New families flock to the spot, and
                    there multiply; and there nature seems the more eager to repay their labours, in
                    proportion as she has been obliged, against her will, to keep her treasures
                    locked up for a longer time, chilled by the waters. The countries newly
                    inhabited by the human race, as is a great part of America, especially to the
                    southward, are still covered to a great extent with marshes and lakes; and they
                    would long remain in this condition, if population, daily making new advances,
                    did not increase industry, by multiplying the cultivating hands, at the same
                    time that it increases their wants. The Author of this beautiful world has at
                    the beginning formed the great masses of mountain, has scooped out the dales and
                    sloping hills, has traced out the courses, and even formed the beds, of the
                    rivers; but he has left to man the care of making his place of abode, and the
                    field which must feed him, dry and comfortable. For this task is not beyond his
                    powers, as the others are. Nay, by having this given to him in charge, he is
                    richly repaid for his labour by the very state in which he finds those countries
                    into which he penetrates for the first time. Being covered with lakes and
                    forests, the juices of the soil are kept for him as it were in reserve. The air,
                    the burning heat of the sun, and the continual washing of rains, would have
                    combined to expend and dissipate their vegetative powers, had the fields been
                    exposed in the same degree to their action as the inhabited and cultivated
                    countries, the most fertile moulds of which are long since lodged in the bottom
                    of the ocean. All this would have been completely lost through the whole extent
                    of South America, had it not been protected by the forests which man must cut
                    down, by the rank herbage which he must burn, and by the marsh and bog which he
                    must destroy by draining. Let not ungrateful man complain of this. It is his
                    duty to take on himself the task of opening up treasures, preserved on purpose
                    for him with so much judgment and care. If he has discernment and sensibility,
                    he will even thank the Author of all good, who has thus husbanded them for his
                    use. He will co-operate with his beneficent views, and will be careful not to
                    proceed by wantonly snatching at present any partial good, and by picking out
                    what is most easily procured, regardless of him who is to come afterwards to
                    uncover and extract the remaining riches of the ground. A wise administration of
                    such a country will think it their duty to leave a just share of this
                    inheritance to their descendants, who are entitled to expect it as the last
                    legatees. National plans of cultivation should be formed on this principle, that
                    the steps taken by the present cultivators for realizing part of the riches of
                    the infant country shall not obstruct the works which will afterwards be
                    necessary for obtaining the remainder. This is carefully attended to in Holland
                    and in China. No man is allowed to conduct the drains, by which he recovers a
                    piece of marsh, in such a way as to render it much more difficult for a
                    neighbour, or even for his own successor, to drain another piece, although it
                    may at present be quite inaccessible. There remain in the middle of the most
                    cultivated countries many marshes, which industry has not yet attempted to
                    drain, and where the legislature has not been at pains to prevent many little
                    abuses which have produced elevations in the beds of rivers, and rendered the
                    complete draining of some spots impossible. Administration should attend to such
                    things, because their consequences are great. The sciences and arts, by which
                    alone these difficult and costly jobs can be performed, should be protected,
                    encouraged, and cherished. It is only from science that we can obtain principles
                    to direct these arts. The problem of draining canals is one of the most
                    important, and yet has hardly ever occupied the attention of the hydraulic
                    speculatist. We apprehend that the Chevalier du Buat’s theory will throw great
                    light on it; and regret that the very limited condition of our present work will
                    hardly afford room for a slight sketch of what may be done on the subject. We
                    shall, however, attempt it by a general problem, which will involve most of the
                    chief circumstances which occur in works of that kind.</p>

                    best effects. It is evident that there are many circumstances to determine the
                    choice, and many conditions to be attended to.</p>

                    they are not for this reason equivalent. The long canal AE may drain the marsh
                    completely, while the short one AC will only do it in part; because the
                    difference of level between A and C is but inconsiderable. Also the freshes of
                    the river may totally obstruct the operation of AC, while the canal AE cannot be
                    hurt by them, E being so much lower than C. Therefore the canal must be carried
                    so far down the river, that no freshes there shall ever raise the waters in the
                    canal so high as to reduce the slope in the upper part of it to such a level
                    that the current shall not be sufficient to carry off the ordinary produce of
                    water in the marsh.</p>
                <p>Still the problem is indeterminate, admitting many solutions. This requisite
                    discharge may be accomplished by a short but wide canal, or by a longer and
                    narrower. Let us first see what solution can be made, so as to accomplish our
                    purpose in the most economical manner, that is, by means of the smallest
                    equation. We shall give the solution in the form of an example.</p>
                <p>Suppose that the daily produce of rains and springs raises the water 1½ inch on
                    an area of a square league, which gives about 120,000 cubic fathoms of water.
                    Let the bottom of the basin be three feet below the surface of the freshes in
                    the river at B in winter. Let the slope of the river be two inches in 100
                    fathoms, or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1600</hi>,
                    and the canal six feet deep.</p>
                <p>The canal being supposed nearly parallel to the river, it must be at least 1800
                    fathoms long before it can be admitted into the river, otherwise the bottom of
                    the bog will be lower than the mouth of the canal; and even then a hundred or
                    two more fathoms added to this will give it so little slope, that an immense
                    breadth will be necessary to make the discharge with so small a velocity. On the
                    other hand, if the slope of the canal be made equal to that of the river, an
                    extravagant length will be necessary before its admission into the river, and
                    many obstacles may then intervene; and even then it must have a breadth of
                    thirteen feet, as may easily be calculated by the general hydraulic theorem. By
                    receding from each of these extremes, we shall diminish the expense of
                    excavation. Therefore,</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> be the breadth and
                    length, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the depth (six feet), of the canal. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> be the depth of the bog below the surface of the river,
                    opposite to the basin, D the discharge in a second, and - the slope of the
                    river. We must make <hi rend="italic">h</hi> x <hi rend="italic">y</hi> a
                    minimum, or <hi rend="italic">x d y + y d x =</hi> 0 <hi rend="italic"

                    term renders it very complicated. We may make use of the simple form y _ <hi

                    sufficiently exact for all cases which do not deviate far from this, because the
                    velocities are very nearly in the subduplicate ratio of the slopes.</p>
                <p>To introduce these data into the equation, recollect that ******D <hi
                    rend="italic">h ∙c</hi><hi rend="italic">V = —, d~</hi> Γ7∙ As to S, recollect
                    that the canal <hi rend="italic">h X</hi> a: + 2 A being supposed of nearly

                    <hi rend="italic">— q</hi> is the difference of height for the canal. This
                    quantity being divided y by y, gives the value of ι =- ∙ Therefore the equation

                <p>Ä <hi rend="italic">x</hi></p>
                <p>V = 18-36 inches. Now putting these values in the exact formula for the velocity,
                    we obtain the slope of the canal, which is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 11664</hi>, nearly 0∙62 inches in 100 fathoms.</p>
                <p>Let Z be the length of the canal in fathoms. As the river has two inches fall in
                    100 fathoms, the whole fall is <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="subscript"> 100</hi>. The difference of these two must be three feet,
                    which is the difference between the river and the entry of the canal. We have
                    therefore ***(9 0 ’ 62∖</p>
                <p>——j-- <hi rend="italic">j l</hi> = 36 inches. Hence Z = 2604 fathoms; and this
                    multiplied by the section of the canal gives 14,177 cubic fathoms of earth to be
                    removed.</p>
                <p>This may surely be done, in most cases, for eight shillings each cubic fathom,
                    which does not amount to L.6000, a very moderate sum for completely draining
                    nine square miles of country.</p>
                <p>In order to judge of the importance of this problem, we have added two other
                    canals, one longer and the other shorter, having their widths and slopes so
                    adjusted as to insure the same performance.</p>

                <p>We have considered this important problem in its most simple state. If the basin
                    is far from the river, so that the drains are not nearly parallel to it, and
                    therefore have less slope attainable in their course, it is more difficult.
                    Perhaps the best method is to try two very extreme cases and a middle one, and
                    then a fourth, nearer to that extreme which differs least from the middle one in
                    the quantity of excavation. This will point out on which side the minimum of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=834"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0834-0794"/> excavation lies, and also the law by which it
                    diminishes and afterwards increases. Then draw a line, on which set off from one
                    end the lengths of the canals. At each length erect an ordinate representing the
                    excavation, and draw a regular curve through the extremities of the ordinates.
                    From that point of the curve which is nearest to the base line, draw another
                    ordinate to the base. This will point out the best length of the canal with
                    sufficient accuracy. The length will determine the slope, and this will give the
                    width, by means of the general theorem. These draining canals must always come
                    off from the basin with evasated entries. This will prevent the loss of much
                    fall at the entry.</p>
                <p>Two canals may sometimes be necessary. In this case expense may frequently be
                    saved, by making one canal flow into the other. This however must be at such a
                    distance from the basin, that the swell produced in the other by this addition
                    may not reach back to the immediate neighbourhood of the basin, otherwise it
                    would impede the performance of both. For this purpose, recourse must be had to
                    Problem III. p. 283, of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">River</hi>. We must
                    here observe, that in this respect canals differ exceedingly from rivers: rivers
                    enlarge their beds, so as always to convey every increase of waters; but a canal
                    may be gorged through its whole length, and will then greatly diminish its
                    discharge. In order that the lower extremity of a canal may convey the waters of
                    an equal canal admitted into it, their junction must be so far from the basin
                    that the swell occasioned by raising its waters nearly ½ more (viz. in the
                    subduplicate ratio of I to 2) may not reach back to the basin.</p>
                <p>This observation points out another method of economy. Instead of one wide canal,
                    we may make a narrower one of the whole length, and another narrow one reaching
                    part of the way, and communicating with the long canal at a proper distance from
                    the basin. But the lower extremity will now be too shallow to convey the waters
                    of both, therefore raise its banks by using the earth taken from its bed, which
                    must at any rate be disposed of. Thus the waters will be conveyed, and the
                    expense, even of the lower part of the long canal, will scarcely be
                    increased.</p>
                <p>These observations must suffice for an account of the management of open canals;
                    and we proceed to the consideration of the conduct of water in pipes.</p>
                <p>This is much more simple and regular, and the general theorem requires very
                    trifling modifications for adapting it to the cases or questions that occur in

                    it by the consideration that the velocity is very small in comparison of that
                    arising from the height H; consequently <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is very small.
                    Also, in the same pipe, the resistances are nearly in the duplicate ratio of the

                    error by computing the quantity delivered by the pipe, which will differ a
                    little from the quantity proposed. Then observing, by this equation, that two
                    pipes having the same length and the same slope give quantities of water, of
                    which the squares are nearly as the fifth powers of the diameter, we form a new
                    diameter in this proportion, which will be almost perfectly exact.</p>

                <p>It may be observed that the height assumed for determining the slope in these two
                    questions, will seldom differ more than an inch or two from the whole height of
                    the reservoir above the place of delivery; for in conduits of a few hundred feet
                    long, the velocity seldom exceeds four feet per second, which requires only a
                    head of three inches.</p>
                <p>As no inconvenience worth minding results from making the pipes a tenth of an
                    inch or so wider than is barely sufficient, and as this generally is more than
                    the error arising from even a very erroneous assumption of <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> the answer first obtained may be augmented by one or two tenths of an
                    inch, and then we may be confident that our conduit will draw off the intended
                    quantity of water.</p>
                <p>We presume that every person who assumes the name of engineer knows how to reduce
                    the quantity of water measured in gallons, pints, or other denominations, to
                    cubic inches, and can calculate the gallons, &amp;c. furnished by a pipe of
                    known diameter, moving with a velocity that is measured in inches per second. We
                    further suppose that all care is taken in the construction of the conduit, to
                    avoid obstructions occasioned by lumps of solder hanging in the inside of the
                    pipes; and particularly that all the cocks and plugs by the way have waterways
                    equal to the section of the pipe. Undertakers are most tempted to fail here, by
                    making the cocks too small, because large cocks are very costly; but the
                    employer should be scrupulously attentive to this, because a simple contraction
                    of this kind may be the throwing away of many hundred pounds in a wide pipe,
                    which yields no more water than can pass through the small cock.</p>
                <p>The chief obstructions arise from the deposition of sand or mud in the lower
                    parts of pipes, or the collection of air in the upper parts of their bendings.
                    The velocity being always very moderate, such depositions of heavy matters are
                    unavoidable. The utmost care should therefore be taken to have the water freed
                    from all such things at its entry by proper filtration; and there ought to be
                    cleansing plugs at the lower parts of the bendings, or rather a very little way
                    beyond them. When these are opened, the water issues with greater velocity, and
                    carries the depositions with it.</p>
                <p>It is much more difficult to get rid of the air which chokes the pipes by lodging
                    in their upper parts. The air is sometimes taken in along with the water at the
                    reservoir, when the entry of the pipe is too near the surface. This should be
                    carefully avoided, and it costs no trouble to do so. If the entry of the pipe is
                    two feet under the surface, no air can ever get in. Floats should be placed
                    above the entries, having lids hanging from them, which will shut the pipe
                    before the water runs too low.</p>
                <p>But air is also disengaged from spring-water by merely passing along the pipe.
                    When pipes are supplied by an engine, air is very often drawn in by the pumps in
                    a disengaged state. It is also disengaged from its state of chemical union when
                    the pumps have a suction-pipe of ten or twelve feet, which is very common. In
                    whatever way it is introduced, it collects in all the upper parts of bendings,
                    and chokes the passage, so that sometimes not a drop of water is delivered. Our
                    cocks should be placed there, which should be opened frequently by persons who
                    have this in charge. Desaguliers describes a contrivance to be placed on all
                    such eminences, which does this of itself. It is a pipe with a cock, terminating
                    in a small cistern. The key of the cock has a hollow ball of copper at the end
                    of a lever. When there is no air in the main pipe, water comes out by this
                    discharger, fills the cistern, raises the ball, and thus shuts the cock. But
                    when the bend of the main contains air, it rises into the cistern, and occupies
                    the upper part of it. Thus the floating ball falls down, the cock opens and lets
                    out the air, and the cistern again filling with water, the ball rises, and the
                    cock is again shut.</p>
                <p>A very neat contrivance for this purpose was invented by the late Professor
                    Russell of Edinburgh. The cylindrical pipe BCDE (fig. 3), at the upper end of a
                    bending of the main, is screwed on, the upper end of which is a flat plate
                    perforated with a small hole F. This pipe contains a hollow copper cylinder G,
                    to the upper part of which is fastened a piece of soft leather H. When there is
                    air in the pipe, it comes out by the hole A, and occupies the discharger, and
                    then escapes through the hole F. The water follows, and, rising in the
                    discharger, lifts up the hollow cylinder G, causing the leather H to apply
                    itself to the plate CD, and shut the hole. Thus the air is discharged without
                    the smallest loss of water.</p>
                <p>It is of the most material consequence that there be no contraction in any part
                    of a conduit. This is evident; but it is also prudent to avoid all unnecessary
                    enlargements. For when the conduit is full of water moving along it, the
                    velocity in every section is inversely proportional to the area of the section:
                    it is therefore diminished wherever the pipe is enlarged; but it must again be
                    increased where the pipe contracts. This cannot be without expending force in
                    the acceleration, which consumes part of the impelling power, whether this be a
                    head of water, or the force of an engine. See what is said on this subject in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pump.</hi> Nothing is gained by any
                    enlargement; and every contraction, by requiring an augmentation of velocity,
                    employs a part of the impelling force precisely equal to the weight of a column
                    of water whose base is the contracted passage, and whose height is the fall
                    which would produce a velocity equal to this augmentation. This point seems to
                    have been quite overlooked by engineers of the first eminence, and has in many
                    instances greatly diminished the performance of their best works. It is no less
                    detrimental in open canals, because at every contraction a small fall is
                    required for restoring the velocity lost in the enlargement of the canal, by
                    which the general slope and velocity are diminished. Another point which must be
                    attended to in the conducting of water is, that the motion should not be
                    subsultory, but continuous. When the water is to be driven along a main by the
                    strokes of a reciprocating engine, it should be forced into an air-box, the
                    spring of which may preserve it in motion along the whole subsequent main. If
                    the water is brought to rest at every successive stroke of the piston, the whole
                    mass must again be put in motion through the whole length of the main. This
                    requires the same useless expenditure of power as to communicate this motion to
                    as much dead matter; and this is over and above the force which may be necessary
                    for raising the water to a certain height, which is the only circumstance that
                    enters into the calculation of the power of the pump-engine.</p>
                <p>An air-box removes this imperfection, because it keeps up the motion during the
                    returning stroke of the piston. The compression of the air by the active stroke
                    of the piston must be such as to continue the impulse in opposition to the
                    contrary pressure of the water (if it is to be raised to some height), and in
                    opposition to the friction or other resistances which arise from the motion that
                    the water really acquires. Indeed a very considerable force is also employed
                    here in changing the motion of the water, which is forced out of the capacious
                    air-box into the narrow pipe; and when this change of motion is not judiciously
                    managed, the expenditure of power may be as great as if all were brought to rest
                    and again put in motion. It may even be greater, by causing the water to move in
                    the opposite direction to its former motion. Of such consequence is it to have
                    all these circumstances scientifically considered. It <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=836" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0836-0796"/>is
                    in such particulars, unheeded by the ordinary herd of engineers or pump-makers,
                    that the superiority of an intelligent practitioner is to be seen.</p>
                <p>Another material point in the conduct of water in pipes is the distribution of it
                    to the different persons who have occasion for it. This is rarely done from the
                    rising main. It is usual to send the whole into a cistern, from which it is
                    afterwards conducted to different places in separate pipes. Till the discovery
                    of the general theorem by the Chevalier du Buat, this has been done with great
                    inaccuracy. Engineers think that the different purchasers from waterworks
                    receive in proportion to their respective bargains when they give them pipes
                    whose areas are proportional to these payments; but we now see that when these
                    pipes are of any considerable length, the waters of a larger pipe run with a
                    greater velocity than those of a smaller pipe having the same slope. A pipe of
                    two inches diameter will give much more water than four pipes of one inch
                    diameter; it will give as much as five and a half such pipes or more; because
                    the squares of the discharges are very nearly as the fifth powers of the
                    diameters. This point ought therefore to be carefully considered in the bargains
                    made with the proprietors of water-works, and the payments made in this
                    proportion. Perhaps the most unexceptionable method would be to make a double
                    distribution. Let the water be first let off in its proper proportions into a
                    second series of small cisterns, and let each have a pipe which will convey the
                    whole water that is discharged into it. The first distribution may be made
                    entirely by pipes of one inch in diameter; this would leave nothing to the
                    calculation of the distributor, for every man would pay in proportion to the
                    number of such pipes which runs into his own cistern.</p>
                <p>In many cases, however, water is distributed by pipes derived from a main; and
                    here another circumstance comes into action. When water is passing along a pipe,
                    its pressure on the sides of the pipe is diminished by its velocity; and if a
                    pipe is now derived from it, the quantity drawn off is also diminished in the
                    subduplicate ratio of the pressures. If the pressure is reduced to one fourth,
                    one ninth, one sixteenth, &amp;c. the discharge from the lateral pipe is reduced
                    to one half, one third, one fourth, &amp;c. It is therefore of great importance
                    to determine what this diminution of pressure is which arises from the motion
                    along the main.</p>
                <p>It is plain, that if the water suffered no resistance in the main, its velocity
                    would be that with which it entered, and it would pass along without exerting
                    any pressure. If the pipe were shut at the end, the pressure on the sides would
                    be the full pressure of the head of water. If the head of water remain the same,
                    and the end of the tube be contracted, but not stopped entirely, the velocity in
                    the pipe is diminished. If we would have the velocity in the pipe with this
                    contracted mouth augmented to what it was before the contraction was made, we
                    must employ the pressure of a piston, or of a head of water. This is propagated
                    through the fluid, and thus a pressure is immediately excited on the sides of
                    the pipe. New obstructions of any kind, arising from friction or any other
                    cause, produce a diminution of velocity in the pipe: but when the natural
                    velocity is checked, the particles re-act on what obstructs their motion; and
                    this action is uniformly propagated through a perfect fluid in every direction.
                    The resistance therefore which we thus ascribe to friction, produces the same
                    lateral pressure which a contraction of the orifice, which equally diminishes
                    the velocity in the pipe, would do. Indeed this is demonstrable from any
                    distinct notions that we can form of these obstructions. They proceed from the
                    want of perfect smoothness, which obliges the particles next the sides to move
                    in undulated lines. This excites transverse forces in the same manner as any
                    constrained curvilineal motion. A particle in its undulated path tends to escape
                    from it, and acts on the lateral particles in the same manner that it would do
                    if moving singly in a capillary tube having the same undulations; it would press
                    on the concave side of every such undulation. Thus a pressure is exerted among
                    the particles, which is propagated to the sides of the pipe; or the diminution
                    of velocity may arise from a viscidity or want of perfect fluidity. This obliges
                    the particle immediately pressed to drag along with it another particle which is
                    withheld by adhesion to the sides. This requires additional pressure from a
                    piston, or an additional head of water; and this pressure also is propagated to
                    the sides of the pipe.</p>
                <p>Hence it should follow, that the pressure which water in motion exerts on the
                    sides of its conduit is equal to that which is competent to the head of water
                    which impels it into the pipe, diminished by the head of water competent to the
                    actual velocity with which it moves along the pipe. Let H represent the head of
                    water which impels it into the entry of the pipe, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    the head which would produce the actual velocity; then H — <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> is the column which would produce the pressure exerted on its sides.</p>
                <p>This is abundantly verified by very simple experiments. Let an upright pipe be
                    inserted into the side of the main pipe. When the water runs out by the mouth of
                    the main, it will rise in this branch till the weight of the column balances the
                    pressure that supports it; and if we then ascertain the velocity of the issuing
                    water by means of the quantity discharged, and compute the head or height
                    necessary for producing this velocity, and subtract this from the height of
                    water above the entry of the main, we shall find the height in the branch
                    precisely equal to their difference. Our readers may see this by examining the
                    experiments related by Gravesande, and still better by examining the experiments
                    related by Bossut, which are detailed with great minuteness. The results
                    corresponded accurately with this proposition. The experiments indeed were not
                    heights of water supported by this pressure, but water expelled by it through
                    the same orifice. Indeed the truth of the proposition appears in every way we
                    can consider the motion of water. And as it is of the first importance in the
                    practice of conducting water (for reasons which will presently appear), it
                    merits a particular attention. When an inclined tube is in train, the
                    accelerating power of the water (or its weight diminished in the proportion of
                    the length of the oblique column to its vertical height, or its weight
                    multiplied by the fraction -, which expresses the slope) is in equilibrio with
                    the obstructions; and therefore it exerts no pressure on the pipe but what
                    arises from its weight alone. Any part of it would continue to slide down the
                    inclined plane with a constant velocity, though detached from what follows it.
                    It therefore derives no pressure from the head of water which impelled it into
                    the pipe. The same must be said of a horizontal pipe infinitely smooth, or
                    opposing no resistance. The water would move in this pipe with the full velocity
                    due to the head of water which impels it into the entry. But when the pipe
                    opposes an obstruction, the head of water is greater than that which would impel
                    it into the pipe with the velocity that it actually has in it; and this
                    additional pressure is propagated along the pipe, where it is balanced by the
                    actual resistance, and therefore excites a <hi rend="italic">guoguaversum</hi>
                    pressure on the pipe. In short, whatever part of the head of water in the
                    reservoir, or of the pressure which impels it along the tube, is not employed in
                    producing velocity, is employed in acting against some obstruction, and excites,
                    by the re-action of this obstruction, an equal pressure on the tube. The rule
                    therefore is general, but is subject to some modifications which deserve our
                    attention.</p>
                <p>In the simply inclined pipe BC (fig.4), the pressure on any point S is equal to
                    that of the head of water AB which impels<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=837" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0837-0797"/>
                    the water into the pipe, wanting or <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> that of the
                    head of water which would communicate to it the velocity with which it actually
                    moves. This we shall call <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and consider it as the
                    weight of a column of water whose length also is <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> In
                    like manner H may be the column AB which impels the water into the pipe, and
                    would communicate a certain velocity; and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> may represent
                    the column which would communicate the actual velocity. We have therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">x =</hi> H — <hi rend="italic">h</hi>.</p>
                <p>In the pipe HIKL, the pressure at the point I is AH — <hi rend="italic">h —</hi>
                    IO= H — <hi rend="italic">h</hi> — IO; and the pressure at K is H — A + PK.</p>
                <p>And in the pipe DEFG, the pressure on E is = AR — <hi rend="italic">h</hi> — EM =
                    H — <hi rend="italic">h —</hi> EM; and the pressure at F is H — <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> 4+ FN.</p>
                <p>We must carefully distinguish this pressure on any square inch of the pipe, from
                    the obstruction or resistance which that inch actually exerts, and which is part
                    of the cause of the pressure. The pressure, by the laws of hydrostatics, is the
                    same with that exerted on the water by a square inch of the piston or forcing
                    head of water. This must balance the united obstructions of the whole pipe, in
                    as far as they are not balanced by the relative weight of the water in an
                    enclosed pipe. Whatever be the inclination of a pipe, and the velocity of the
                    water in it, there is a certain part of this resistance which may not be
                    balanced by the tendency which the water has to slide along it, provided the
                    pipe be long enough; or if the pipe is too short, the tendency down the pipe may
                    more than balance all the resistances that obtain helow. In the first case, this
                    overplus must be balanced by an additional head of water; and in the latter case
                    the pipe is not in train, and the water will accelerate. There is something in
                    the mechanism of these motions which makes a certain length of pipe necessary
                    for bringing it into train; a certain portion of the surface which acts in
                    concert in obstructing the motion. We do not completely understand this
                    circumstance, but we can form a pretty distinct notion of its mode of acting.
                    The film of water contiguous to the pipe is withheld by the obstruction, but
                    glides along; the film immediately within this is withheld by the outer film,
                    but glides through it: and thus all the concentric films glide within those
                    around them, somewhat like the sliding tubes of a spy-glass when we draw it out
                    by taking hold of the end of the innermost. Thus the second film passes beyond
                    the first and outermost, and becomes the outermost, and rubs along the tube. The
                    third does the same in its turn; and thus the central filaments come at last to
                    the outside, and all sustain their greatest possible obstruction. When this is
                    accomplished the pipe is in train. This requires a certain length, which we
                    cannot determine by theory. We see however that pipes of greater diameter must
                    require a greater length, and this in a proportion which is probably that of the
                    number of filaments, or the square of the diameter. Du Buat found this
                    supposition agree well enough with his experiments. A pipe of one inch in
                    diameter sustained no change of velocity by gradually shortening it till he
                    reduced it to six feet, and then it discharged a little more water. A pipe of
                    two inches diameter gave a sensible augmentation of velocity when shortened to
                    twenty-five feet. He therefore says that the square of the diameter in inches,
                    multiplied by seventy-two, will express, in inches, the length necessary for
                    putting any pipe in train.</p>
                <p>The resistance exerted by a square inch of the pipe makes but a small part of the
                    pressure which the whole resistances occasion to be exerted there before they
                    can be overcome. The resistance may be represented by -, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is the hydraulic depth (one fourth of the diameter), and <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> the length of a column whose vertical height is one inch,
                    and it is the relative weight of a column of water whose base is a square inch,
                    and height is <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> For the resistance of any length <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> of pipe which is in train is equal to the tendency of the
                    water to slide down (being balanced by it); that is, is equal to the weight of
                    this column multiplied by -. The magnitude of this column is had by multiplying
                    its length by its section. The section is the product of the border <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> or circumference multiplied by the mean depth <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> or it is <hi rend="italic">bd.</hi> This multiplied by the
                    length is <hi rend="italic">bds;</hi> and this multi plied by the slope <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">bd,</hi> the relative weight of the column whose length is <hi
                    rend="italic">s.</hi> The relative weight of one inch is therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">bd</hi> / <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and this is in equilibrio with
                    the resistance of a ring of the pipe one inch broad. This, when unfolded, is a
                    parallelogram <hi rend="italic">b</hi> inches in length. One inch of this
                    therefore is the relative weight of a column of water having <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> for its height and a square inch for its base. Suppose the pipe four
                    inches in diameter, and the slope = 253, the resistance is one grain, for an
                    inch of water weighs 253 grains.</p>
                <p>This knowledge of the pressure of water in motion is of great importance. In the
                    management of rivers and canals it instructs us concerning the damages which
                    they produce in their beds by tearing up the soil: it informs us of the strength
                    which we must give to the banks, but it is of more consequence in the management
                    of close conduits. By this we must regulate the strength of our pipes; by this
                    also we must ascertain the quantities of water which may be drawn off by lateral
                    branches from any main conduit.</p>
                <p>With respect to the first of these objects, where security is our sole concern,
                    it is proper to consider the pressure in the most unfavourable circumstances,
                    viz. when the end of the main is shut. The case is not unfrequent. Nay, when the
                    water is in motion, its velocity in a conduit seldom exceeds a very few feet in
                    a second. Eight feet per second requires only one foot of water to produce it.
                    We should therefore estimate the strain on all conduits by the whole height of
                    the reservoir.</p>
                <p>In order to adjust the strength of a pipe to the strain, we may conceive it as
                    consisting of two half cylinders of insuperable strength joined along the two
                    seams, where the strength is the same with the ordinary strength of the
                    materials of which it is made. The inside pressure tends to burst the pipe by
                    tearing open these scams; and each of those two seams is equal to the weight of
                    a column of water whose height is the depth of the seam below the surface of the
                    reservoir, and whose base is an inch broad and a diameter of the pipe in length.
                    This follows from the common principles of hydrostatics.</p>
                <p>Suppose the pipe to be of lead, one foot in diameter and 100 feet under the
                    surface of the reservoir. Water weighs 62½ pounds per foot. The base of our
                    column is therefore <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    12</hi> th of a foot, and the tendency to burst the pipe is 100 × 62½ × <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 6250</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> = 521 pounds
                    nearly. There fore an inch of one seam is strained by 260½ pounds. A rod of lead
                    one inch square is pulled asunder by 860 pounds (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Strength of Materials).</hi> Therefore, if the thickness of the seam is = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 260</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 860</hi> inches, or one
                    third of an inch, it will just withstand this strain. But we must make it much
                    stronger than this, especially if the pipe leads from an engine which sends the
                    water along it by starts. Belidor and Desaguliers have given tables of the
                    thickness and weights of pipes which experience has found sufficient for <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=838"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0838-0798"/> the different materials and depths. Desaguliers
                    says, that a leaden pipe of three fourths of an inch in thickness is strong
                    enough for a height of 140 feet and diameter of seven inches. From this we may
                    calculate all others. Belidor says, that a leaden pipe twelve inches diameter
                    and sixty feet deep should be half an inch thick. But these things will be more
                    properly computed by means of the list given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Strength of Matertials.</hi></p>
                <p>The application which we are most anxious to make of the knowledge of the
                    pressure of moving waters, is the derivation from a main conduit by lateral
                    branches. This occurs very frequently in the distribution of waters among the
                    inhabitants of towns; and it is so imperfectly understood by the greater part of
                    those who take the name of engineers, that individuals have no security that
                    they shall get even one half of the water they bargain and pay for; yet this may
                    be as accurately ascertained as any other problem in hydraulics by means of our
                    general theorem. The case therefore merits our particular attention.</p>
                <p>It appears to be already determined, when we have ascertained the pressures by
                    which the water is impelled into these lateral pipes, especially after we have
                    said that the experiments of Bossut on the actual discharges from a lateral pipe
                    fully confirm the theoretical doctrine. But much remains to be considered. We
                    have seen that there is a vast difference between the discharge made through a
                    hole, or even through a short pipe, and the discharge from the far end of a pipe
                    derived from a main conduit. And even when this has been ascertained by our new
                    theory, the discharge thus modified will be found considerably different from
                    the real state of things: for when water is flowing along a main with a known
                    velocity, and therefore exerting a known pressure on the circle which we propose
                    for the entry of a branch, if we insert a branch there, water will go along it;
                    but this will generally make a considerable change in the motion along the main,
                    and therefore in the pressure which is to expel the water. It also makes a
                    considerable change in the whole quantity which passes along the anterior part
                    of the main, and a still greater change on what moves along that part of it
                    which lies beyond the branch: it therefore affects the quantity necessary for
                    the whole supply, the force that is required for propelling it, and the quantity
                    delivered by other branches. This part therefore of the management of water in
                    conduits is of considerable importance and intricacy. We can propose in this
                    place nothing more than a solution of such leading questions as involve the
                    chief circumstances, recommending to our readers the perusal of original works
                    on this subject. Μ. Bossut’s experiments are fully competent to the
                    establishment of the fundamental principle. The hole through which the lateral
                    discharges were made was but a few feet from the reservoir. The pipe was
                    successively lengthened, by which the resistances were increased, and the
                    velocity diminished: but this did not affect the lateral discharges, except by
                    affecting the pressures; and the discharges from the end of the main were
                    supposed to be the same as when the lateral pipe was not inserted. Although this
                    was not strictly true, the difference was insensible, because the lateral pipe
                    had but about the eighteenth part of the area of the main.</p>
                <p>Suppose that the discharge from the reservoir remains the same after the
                    derivation of this branch, then the motion of the water all the way to the
                    insertion of the branch is the same as before; but beyond this the discharge is
                    diminished by all that is discharged by the branch, with the head <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> equivalent to the pressure on the side. The discharge by
                    the lower end of the main being diminished, the velocity and resistance in it
                    are also diminished. Therefore the difference between <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and the head employed to overcome the friction in this second case, would be a
                    needless or inefficient part of the whole load at the entry, which is
                    impossible; for every force produces an effect, or it is destroyed by some
                    re-action. The effect of the forcing head of water is to produce the greatest
                    discharge corresponding to the obstructions; and thus the discharge from the
                    reservoir, or the supply to the main, must be augmented by the insertion of the
                    branch, if the forcing head of water remains the same. A greater portion
                    therefore of the forcing head was employed in producing a greater discharge at
                    the entry of the main, and the remainder, less than <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    produced the pressure on the sides. This head was the one competent to the
                    obstructions resulting from the velocity beyond the insertion of the branch; and
                    this velocity, diminished by the discharge already made, was less than that at
                    the entry, and even than that of the main without a branch. This will appear
                    more distinctly by putting the case into the form of an equation. Therefore let
                    H — <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the height due to the velocity at the entry, of
                    which the effect obtains only horizontally. The head <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    the only one which acts on the sides of the tube, tending to produce the
                    discharge by the branch, at the same time that it must overcome the obstructions
                    beyond the branch. If the orifice did not exist, and if the force producing the
                    velocity on a short tube be represented by 2 G, and the section of the main be
                    A, the supply at the entry of the main would be A√2G √H— <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi>; and if the orifice had no influence on the value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> the discharge by the orifice would be ***D^/jE., D being its discharge
                    by means of the head H, when the end of the main is shut; for the discharges are
                    in the subduplicate ratio of the heads of water by which they are expelled; and
                    therefore ***√ ’ H: <hi rend="italic">y/x =</hi> D: D <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> ^∕jL= <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> But we have seen that <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> must diminish; and we know that the obstructions are nearly as the
                    square roots of the velocities, when these do not differ much among themselves.
                    Therefore, calling <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the pressure or head which balances
                    the resistances of the main without a branch, while <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    the head necessary for the main with a branch, we may institute this proportion,
                    ***y: H — <hi rend="italic">y = x:</hi> ~ ’ (~—~; and this fourth term will
                    express the head producing the velocity in the main beyond the branch (as H— <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> would have done in a main without a branch). This velocity
                    beyond the branch will be ***√2G ⅛∕~&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> ^</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">-</hi> ∕∙x ’ ( H ?/)</p>
                <p>the discharge at the end will be A √2 G√ — ——. If to this we add the discharge of
                    the branch, the sum will be the whole discharge, and therefore the whole supply.
                    Therefore we have the following equation, ***A√2G √H — <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    = A√2G, ^∕ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> * —— +D^∕∩. From this we deduce the

                <p>This value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> being substituted in the equation of the

                <p>H</p>
                <p>discharges required, and they will differ so much the more from the discharges
                    calculated according to the simple theory, as the velocity in the main is
                    greater. By the simple theory, we mean the supposition that the lateral
                    discharges are such as would be produced by the head H— <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> where H is the height of the reservoir, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    the head due to the actual velocity in the main.</p>
                <p>And thus it appears that the proportion of the discharge by a lateral pipe from a
                    main that is shut at the far end, and the discharge from a main that is open,
                    depends not only on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=839" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0839-0799"
                    />the pressures, but also on the size of the lateral pipe, and its distance from
                    the reservoir. When it is large, it greatly alters the train of the main, under
                    the same head, by altering the discharge at its extremity, and the velocity in
                    it beyond the branch; and if it be near the reservoir, it greatly alters the
                    train, because the diminished velocity takes place through a greater extent, and
                    there is a greater diminution of the resistances.</p>
                <p>When the branch is taken off at a considerable distance from the reservoir, the
                    problem becomes more complicated, and the head <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    resolved into two parts, one of which balances the resistance in the first part
                    of the main, and the other balances the resistances beyond the lateral pipe,
                    with a velocity diminished by the discharge from the branch. A branch at the end
                    of the main produces very little change in the train of the pipe.</p>
                <p>When the lateral discharge is great, the train may be so altered, that the
                    remaining part of the main will not run full, and then the branch will not yield
                    the same quantity. The velocity in a very long horizontal tube may be so small
                    (by a small head of water and great obstructions in a very long tube) that it
                    will just run full. An orifice made in its upper side will yield nothing, and
                    yet a small tube inserted into it will carry a column almost as high as the
                    reservoir; so that we cannot judge in all cases of the pressures by the
                    discharges, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>If there be an inclined tube, having a head greater than what is competent to the
                    velocity, we may bring it into train by an opening on its upper side near the
                    reservoir. This will yield some water, and the velocity will diminish in the
                    tube till it is in train. If we should now enlarge the hole, it will yield no
                    more water than before.</p>
                <p>And thus we have pointed out the chief circumstances which affect these lateral
                    discharges. The discharges are afterwards modified by the conduits in which they
                    are conveyed to their places of destination. These, for the sake of economy,
                    being generally of small dimensions, the velocity is much diminished. But, at
                    the same time, it approaches nearer to that which the same conduit would bring
                    directly from the reservoir, because its small velocity will produce a less
                    change in the train of the main conduit.</p>
                <p>We should now treat of jets of water, which still make an ornament in the
                    magnificent pleasure-grounds of the wealthy. Some of these are indeed grand
                    objects, such as the two at Peterhoff in Russia, which spout about sixty feet
                    high a column of nine inches diameter, that falls again, and shakes the ground
                    with its blow. Even a spout of an inch or two inches diameter, lancing to the
                    height of 150 feet, is a gay object, and greatly enlivens a pleasure-ground,
                    especially when the changes of a gentle breeze bend the jet to one side. But we
                    have no room left for treating this subject, which is of some nicety; and must
                    conclude this article with a very short account of the management of water as an
                    active power for impelling machinery.</p>
                <p>CLASS II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Machinery driven by Water.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a very comprehensive article, including almost every possible species of
                    mill. It is no less important, and it is therefore matter of regret that we
                    cannot enter into the detail which it deserves. The mere description of the
                    immense variety of mills which are in general use would fill volumes, and a
                    scientific description of their principles and maxims of construction would
                    almost form a complete body of mechanical science. But this is far beyond the
                    limits of a work like ours. Many of these machines have been already described
                    under their proper names, or under the articles which give an account of their
                    manufactures; and for others we must refer our readers to the original works,
                    where they are described in minute detail. The great academical collection <hi
                    rend="italic">Des Arts et Metiers,</hi> published in Paris in many folio
                    volumes, contains a description of the peculiar machinery of many mills; and the
                    volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> which
                    particularly relate to the mechanical arts, contain many more. All that we can
                    do in this place is, to consider the chief circumstances that are common to all
                    water-mills, and from which all must derive their efficacy. These circumstances
                    are to be found in the manner of employing water as an acting power, and most of
                    them are comprehended in the construction of water-wheels. When we have
                    explained the principles and the maxims of construction of a water-wheel, every
                    reader conversant in mechanics knows that the axis of this wheel may be employed
                    to transmit the force impressed on it to any species of machinery. Therefore
                    nothing subsequent to this can with propriety be considered as <hi rend="italic"
                    >water-works.</hi></p>
                <p>Water-wheels are of two kinds, distinguished by the manner in which water is made
                    an impelling power, viz. by its weight, or by its impulse. This requires a very
                    different form and manner of adaptation; and this forms an ostensible
                    distinction, sufficiently obvious to give a name to each class. When water is
                    made to act by its weight, it is delivered from the spout as high on the wheel
                    as possible, that it may continue long to press it down; but when it is made to
                    strike the wheel, it is delivered as low as possible, that it may have
                    previously acquired a great velocity. And thus the wheels are said to be <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">overshot</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">undershot.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Of Overshot Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p>This is nothing but a frame of open buckets, so disposed round the rim of a wheel
                    as to receive the water delivered from a spout; so that one side of the wheel is
                    loaded with water, while the other is empty. The consequence must be, that the
                    loaded side must descend. By this motion the water runs out of the lower
                    buckets, while the empty buckets of the rising side of the wheel come under the
                    spout in their turn, and are filled with water.</p>
                <p>If it were possible to construct the buckets in such a manner as to remain
                    completely filled with water till they come to the very bottom of the wheel, the
                    pressure with which the water urges the wheel round its axis would be the same
                    as if the extremity of the horizontal radius were continually loaded with a
                    quantity of water sufficient to fill a square pipe whose section is equal to
                    that of the bucket, and whose length is the diameter of the wheel. For let the
                    buckets BD and EF, fig. 5, be compared together, the arches DB and EF are equal.
                    The mechanical energy of the water contained in the bucket BD, or the pressure
                    with which its weight urges the wheel, is the same as if all this water were
                    hung on that point T of the horizontal arm CF, where it is cut by the vertical
                    or plumb-line BT. This is plain from the most elementary principles of
                    mechanics. Therefore the effect of the bucket BD is to that of the bucket EF as
                    CT to CF or CB. Draw the horizontal lines PB <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> QD <hi
                    rend="italic">d d.</hi> It is plain, that if BD is taken very small, so that it
                    may be considered as a straight line, BD: BO=CB: BP, and EF: <hi rend="italic"
                    >bd =</hi> CF: CT, and EF×CT = <hi rend="italic">b d</hi> ×CF. Therefore, if the
                    prism of water whose vertical section is <hi rend="italic">b b d d,</hi> were
                    hung on at F, its force to urge the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=840" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0840-0800"
                    />wheel round would be the same as that of the water lying in the bucket BD. The
                    same may be said of every bucket; and the effective pressure of the whole ring
                    of water A <hi rend="italic">f</hi> HKFI, in its natural situation, is the same
                    with the pillar of water <hi rend="italic">a h ha</hi> hung on at F. And the
                    effect of any portion BF of this ring is the same with that of the corresponding
                    portion <hi rend="italic">b</hi> F <hi rend="italic">f ♭ of</hi> the vertical
                    pillar. We do not take into account the small difference which arises from the
                    depth B♯ or F <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> because we may suppose the circle
                    described through the centres of gravity of the buckets. And in the further
                    prosecution of this subject, we shall take similar liberties, with the view of
                    simplifying the subject, and saving time to the reader.</p>
                <p>But such a state of the wheel is impossible. The bucket at the very top of the
                    wheel may be completely filled with water; but when it comes into the oblique
                    position BD, a part of the water must run over the outer edge ∂, and the bucket
                    will only retain the quantity ZBD 3; and if the buckets are formed by partitions
                    directed to the axis of the wheel, the whole water must be run out by the time
                    that they descend to the level of the axis. To prevent this, many contrivances
                    have been adopted. The wheel has been surrounded with a hoop or sweep,
                    consisting of a circular board, which comes almost into contact with the rim of
                    the wheel, and terminates at H, where the water is allowed to run off. But
                    unless the work is executed with uncommon accuracy, the wheel made exactly
                    round, and the sweep exactly fitting it, a great quantity of water escapes
                    between them; and there is a very sensible obstruction to the motion of such a
                    wheel, from something like friction between the water and the sweep. Frost also
                    effectually stops the motion of such a wheel. Sweeps have therefore been
                    generally laid aside, although there are situations where they might be used
                    with good effect.</p>
                <p>Mill-wrights have turned their whole attention to the giving a form to the
                    buckets which shall enable them to retain the water along a great portion of the
                    circumference of the wheel. It would be endless to describe all these
                    contrivances; and we shall therefore content ourselves with one or two of the
                    most approved. The intelligent reader will readily see that many of the
                    circumstances which concur in producing the ultimate effect (such as the
                    facility with which the water is received into the buckets, the place which it
                    is to occupy during the progress of the bucket from the top to the bottom of the
                    wheel, the readiness with which they are evacuated, or the chance that the water
                    has of being dragged beyond the bottom of the wheel by its adhesion, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.) are such as do not admit of precise calculation on reasoning about
                    their merits; and that this or that form can seldom be evidently demonstrated to
                    be the very best possible. But, at the same time, he will see the general
                    reasons of preference, and his attention will be directed to circumstances which
                    must be attended to in order to have a good bucketed wheel.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 is the outline of a wheel having forty buckets. The ring of board
                    contained between the concentric circles QDS and PAR, making the ends of the
                    buckets, is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Shrouding,</hi> in the language of
                    the art, and QP is called the <hi rend="italic">depth of shrouding.</hi> The
                    inner circle PAR is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">sole</hi> of the wheel, and
                    usually consists of boards nailed to strong wooden rings of compass-timber of
                    considerable scantling, firmly united with the <hi rend="smallcaps">arms</hi> or
                    radii. The partitions which determine the form of the buckets consist of three
                    different planes or boards AB, BC,</p>
                <p>CD, which are variously named by different artists. We have heard them named the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">start</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">shoulder,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">arm,</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">wrest</hi> (probably for
                    wrist, on account of a resemblance of the whole line to the human arm); B is
                    also called the <hi rend="smallcaps">elbow.</hi> Fig. 7 represents a small
                    portion of the same bucketing on a larger scale, that the proportions of the
                    parts may be more distinctly seen. AG, the sole of one bucket, is made about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th more than the depth
                    GH of the shrouding. The start AB is ½ of AI. The plane BC is so inclined to AB
                    that it would pass through H; but it is made to terminate in C, in such a manner
                    that FC is <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> ths of
                    GH or AI Then CD is so placed that HD is about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of IH.</p>
                <p>By this construction, it follows that the area FABC is very nearly equal to DABC;
                    so that the water which will fill the space FABC will all be contained in the
                    bucket when it shall come into such a position that AD is a horizontal line; and
                    the line AB will then make an angle of nearly 35° with the vertical, or the
                    bucket will be 35° from the perpendicular. If the bucket descend so much lower
                    that one half of the water runs out, the line AB will make an angle of 25°, or
                    24° nearly, with the vertical. Therefore the wheel, filled to the degree now
                    mentioned, will <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to lose water at about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of the diameter
                    from the bottom, and <hi rend="italic">half of the water will be discharged</hi>
                    from the lowest bucket, about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 24</hi> th of the diameter farther down. These situations of
                    the discharging bucket are marked at T and V in fig. 6. Had a greater proportion
                    of the buckets been filled with water when they were under the spout, the
                    discharge would have begun at a greater height from the bottom, and we should
                    lose a greater portion of the whole fall of water. The loss by the present
                    construction is less than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> th (supposing the water to be delivered into the wheel at the very top),
                    and may be estimated at about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> th; for the loss is the versed sine of the angle which
                    the radius of the bucket makes with the vertical. The versed sine of 35° is
                    nearly ]th of the radius (being 0∙18085), or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of the diameter. It is evident that if only ½
                    of this water were supplied to each bucket as it passes the spout, it would have
                    been retained for 10° more of a revolution, and the loss of fall would have been
                    only about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi>
                    th.</p>
                <p>These observations serve to show, in general, that an advantage is gained by
                    having the buckets so capacious that the quantity of water which each can
                    receive as it passes the spout may not nearly fill it. This may be accomplished
                    by making them of a sufficient length, that is, by making the wheel sufficiently
                    broad between the two shroudings. Economy is the only objection to this
                    practice, and it is generally very ill placed. When the work to be performed by
                    the wheel is great, the addition of power gained by a greater breadth will soon
                    compensate for the additional expense.</p>
                <p>The third plane CD is not very frequent, and mill-wrights generally content
                    themselves with continuing the board all the way from the elbow B to the outer
                    edge of the wheel at H; and AB is generally no more than one third of the depth
                    AI. But CD is a very evident improvement, causing the wheel to retain a very
                    sensible addition to the water. Some indeed make this addition more
                    considerable, by bringing BC more outward, so as to meet the rim of the wheel at
                    H, for instance, and making HD coincide with the rim. But this makes the entry
                    of the water somewhat more difficult during the very short time that the opening
                    of the bucket passes the spout. To facilitate this as much as possible, the
                    water should get a direction from the spout, such as will send it into the
                    buckets in the most perfect manner. This may be obtained by delivering water
                    through an aperture that is divided by thin plates of board or metal, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=841"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0841-0801"/> placed in the proper position, as we have
                    represented in fig. 6. The form of bucket last mentioned, having the wrest
                    concentric with the rim, is unfavourable to the ready admission of the water;
                    whereas an oblique wrest conducts the water which has missed one bucket into the
                    next below.</p>
                <p>The mechanical consideration of this subject also shows us that a deep shrouding,
                    in order to make a capacious bucket, is not a good method: it does not make the
                    buckets retain their water any longer, and it diminishes the effective fall of
                    water; for the water received at the top of the wheel immediately falls to the
                    bottom of the bucket, and thus shortens the fictitious pillar of water, which we
                    showed to be the measure of the effective or useful pressure on the wheel: and
                    this concurs with our former reasons for recommending as great a breadth of the
                    wheel, and length of buckets, as economical considerations will permit.</p>
                <p>A bucket-wheel was some time ago executed by Mr Robert Burns, at the cotton-mills
                    of Houston, of a construction entirely new, but founded on a good principle,
                    which is susceptible of great extension. It is represented in fig. 8. The bucket
                    consists of a start AB, an arm BC, and a wrest CD, concentric with the rim. But
                    the bucket is also divided by a partition LM, concentric with the sole and rim,
                    and so placed as to make the inner and outer portions of nearly equal capacity.
                    It is evident, without any further reasoning about it, that this partition will
                    enable the bucket to retain its water much longer. When they are filled one
                    third, they retain the whole water at 18° from the bottom, and they retain one
                    half at 11°. They do not admit the water quite so freely as buckets of the
                    common construction; but by means of the contrivance mentioned a little ago for
                    the spout (also the invention of Mr Bums, and furnished with a rack-work, which
                    raised or depressed it as the supply of water varied, so as at all times to
                    employ the whole fall of the water), it is found that a slow moving wheel allows
                    one half of the water to get into the inner buckets, especially if the partition
                    do not altogether reach the radius drawn through the lip D of the outer
                    bucket.</p>
                <p>This is a very great improvement of the bucket-wheel; and when the wheel is made
                    of a liberal breadth, so that the water may be very shallow in the buckets, it
                    seems to carry the performance as far as it can go. Mr Burns made the first
                    trial on a wheel of twenty-four feet diameter; and its performance is manifestly
                    superior to that of the wheel which it replaced, and which was a very good one.
                    It has also another valuable property: when the supply of water is very scanty,
                    a proper adjustment of the apparatus in the spout will direct almost the whole
                    of the water into the outer buckets, which, by placing it at a greater distance
                    from the axis, makes a very sensible addition to its mechanical energy.</p>
                <p>We said that this principle is susceptible of considerable extension; and it is
                    evident that two partitions will increase the effect, and that it will increase
                    with the number of partitions; so that when the practice now begun, of making
                    water-wheels of iron, shall become general, and therefore very thin partitions
                    are used, their number may be greatly increased without any inconvenience, and
                    it is obvious that this series of partitions must greatly contribute to the
                    stiffness and general firmness of the whole wheel.</p>
                <p>There frequently occurs a difficulty in the making of bucket-wheels, when the
                    half-taught mill-wright attempts to retain the water a long time in the buckets.
                    The water gets into them with a difficulty which he cannot account lor, and
                    spills all about, even when the buckets are not moving away from the spout. This
                    arises from the air, which must find its way out to admit the water, but is
                    obstructed by the entering water, and occasions a great spluttering at the
                    entry. This may be entirely prevented by making the spout considerably narrower
                    than the wheel, which will leave room at the two ends of the buckets for the
                    escape of the air. This obstruction is vastly greater than one would imagine,
                    for the water drags along with it a great quantity of air, as is evident in the
                    <hi rend="italic">water-blast</hi> described by many authors.</p>
                <p>There is another and very serious obstruction to the motion of an overshot or
                    bucketed wheel. When it moves in back-water, it is not only resisted by the
                    water when it moves more slowly than the wheel, which is very frequently the
                    case, but it lifts a great deal in the rising buckets. In some particular states
                    of back-water, the descending bucket fills itself completely with water, and in
                    other cases it contains a very considerable quantity, and air of common density;
                    while in some rarer cases it contains less water, with air in a condensed state.
                    In the first case the rising bucket must come up filled with water,' which it
                    cannot drop till its mouth get out of the water. In the second case, part of the
                    water goes out before this, but the air rarefies, and therefore there is still
                    some water dragged or lifted up by the wheel, by suction, as it is usually
                    called. In the last case there is no such back-load on the rising side of the
                    wheel, but (which is as detrimental to its performance) the descending side is
                    employed in condensing air; and although this air aids the ascent of the rising
                    side, it does not aid it so much as it impedes the descending side, being (by
                    the form of the bucket) nearer to the vertical line drawn through the axis.</p>
                <p>All this may be completely prevented by a few holes made in the start of each
                    bucket. Air being at least 800 times rarer than water, will escape through a
                    hole almost thirty times faster with the same pressure. Very moderate holes will
                    therefore suffice for this purpose; and the small quantity of water which these
                    holes discharge during the descent of the buckets, produces a loss which is
                    altogether insignificant. The water which runs out of one runs into another, so
                    that there is only the loss of one bucket. We have seen a wheel of only fourteen
                    feet diameter working in nearly three feet of back-water. It laboured
                    prodigiously, and brought up a great load of water, which fell from it in abrupt
                    dashes, rendering the motion very hobbling. When three holes of an inch diameter
                    were made in each bucket (twelve feet long), the wheel laboured no more, there
                    was no more plunging of water from its rising side, and its power on the
                    machinery was increased more than one fourth.</p>
                <p>These practical observations may contain information that is new even to several
                    experienced mill-wrights. To persons less informed they cannot fail of being
                    useful. We now proceed to consider the action of water thus lying in the buckets
                    of a wheel, and to ascertain its energy as it may be modified by different
                    circumstances of fall, velocity, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>With respect to variations in the fall, there can be little room for discussion.
                    Since the active pressure is measured by the pillar of water reaching from the
                    horizontal plane where it is delivered on the wheel, to the horizontal plane
                    where it is spilled by the wheel, it is evident that it must be proportional to
                    this pillar, and therefore we must deliver it as high and retain it as long as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>This maxim obliges us, in the first place, to use a wheel whose diameter is equal
                    to the whole fall. We shall not gain any thing by employing a larger wheel; for
                    although we should gain by using only that part of the circumference where the
                    weight will act more perpendicularly to the radius, we shall lose more by the
                    necessity of discharging the water at a greater height from the bottom: for we
                    must suppose the buckets of both the wheels equally well constructed; in which
                    case, the heights above the bottom where <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=842" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0842-0802"
                    />they will discharge the water, will increase in the proportion of the diameter
                    of the wheel. Now, that we shall lose more by this than we gain by the more
                    direct application of the weight, is plain, without any further reasoning, by
                    taking the extreme case, and supposing our wheel enlarged to such a size that
                    the useless part below is equal to the whole fall. In this case the water will
                    be spilled from the buckets as soon as it is delivered into them. All
                    intermediate cases therefore partake of the imperfection of this.</p>
                <p>When the fall is exceedingly great, a wheel of an equal diameter becomes
                    enormously large and expensive, and is of itself an unmanageable load. We have
                    however seen wheels of fifty-eight feet diameter, which worked extremely well;
                    but they are of very difficult construction, and extremely apt to warp and go
                    out of shape by their weight. In cases like this, where we are unwilling to lose
                    any part of the force of a small stream, the best form of a bucket-wheel is an
                    inverted chain-pump. Instead of employing a chainpump of the best construction,
                    ABCDEA (fig. 9), to raise water through the upright pipe CB, by means of a force
                    applied to the upper wheel A, let the water be delivered from a spout F, into
                    the upper part of a pipe BC, and it will press down the plugs in the lower and
                    narrower bored part of it with the full weight of the column, and escape at the
                    dead level of C. This weight will urge round the wheel A without any
                    defalcation; and this is the most powerful manner in which any fall of water
                    whatever can be applied, and it exceeds the most perfect overshot wheel. But
                    though it excels all chains of buckets in economy and in effect, it has all the
                    other imperfections of this kind of machinery. Though the chain of plugs be of
                    great strength, it has so much motion in its joints that it needs frequent
                    repairs; and when it breaks, it is generally in the neighbourhood of A, on the
                    loaded side, and all comes down with a great crash. There is also a loss of
                    power by the immersion of so many plugs and chains in the water; for there can
                    be no doubt but that if the plugs were large enough and light enough, they would
                    buoy and even draw up the plug in the narrow part at C. They must therefore
                    diminish, in all other cases, the force with which this plug is pressed
                    down.</p>
                <p>The velocity of an overshot wheel is a matter of very great nicety; and authors,
                    both speculative and practical, have entertained different, nay opposite,
                    opinions on the subject. Μ. Belidor, whom the engineers of Europe have long been
                    accustomed to regard as sacred authority, maintains that there is a certain
                    velocity related to that obtainable by the whole fall, which will procure to an
                    overshot wheel the greatest performance. Desaguliers, Smeaton, Lambert, De
                    Parcieux, and others, maintain that there is no such relation, and that the
                    performance of an overshot wheel will be the greater, as it moves more slowly by
                    an increase of its load of work. Belidor maintains that the active power of
                    water lying in a bucket-wheel of any diameter is equal to that of the impulse of
                    the same water on the floats of an undershot wheel when the water issues from a
                    sluice in the bottom of the dam. The other writers whom we have named assert
                    that the energy of an undershot wheel is but one half of that of an overshot,
                    actuated by the same quantity of water falling from the same height.</p>
                <p>To a manufacturing country like ours, that derives astonishing superiority, by
                    which it more than compensates for the impediments of heavy taxes and luxurious
                    living, chiefly from its machinery, in which it leaves all Europe far behind,
                    the decision of this question, in such a manner as shall leave no doubt or
                    misconception in the mind even of an unlettered artist, must be considered as a
                    material service, and we think that this is easily attainable.</p>
                <p>When any machme moves uniformly, the accelerating force or pressure actually
                    exerted on the impelled point of the machine is in equilibrio with all the
                    resistances which are exerted at the working point, with those arising from
                    friction, and those that are excited in different parts of the machine by their
                    mutual actions. This is an incontestable truth, and though little attended to by
                    the mechanicians, is the foundation of all practical knowledge of machines.
                    Therefore, when an overshot wheel moves uniformly, with <hi rend="italic">any
                    velocity whatever,</hi> the water is acting with its whole weight, for gravity
                    would accelerate its descent, if not completely balanced by some re-action; and
                    in this balance gravity and the re-acting part of the machine exert equal and
                    opposite pressures, and thus produce the uniform motion of the machine. We are
                    thus particular on this point, because we observe mechanicians of the first name
                    employing a mode of reasoning on the question now before us which is specious,
                    and appears to prove the conclusion which they draw, but is nevertheless
                    contrary to true mechanical principles. They assert that the slower a heavy body
                    is descending (suppose in a scale suspended from an axis <hi rend="italic">in
                    peritrochea),</hi> the more does it press on the scale, and the more does it
                    urge the machine round; and therefore the slower an overshot wheel turns, the
                    greater is the force with which the water urges it round, and the more work will
                    be done. It is very true that the machine is more forcibly impelled, and that
                    more work is done; but this is not because a pound of water presses more
                    strongly, but because there is more water pressing on the wheel, for the spout
                    supplies at the same rate, and each bucket receives more water as it passes by
                    it.</p>
                <p>Let us therefore examine this point by the unquestionable principles of
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p>Let the overshot wheel A <hi rend="italic">f</hi> H (fig. 5) receive the water
                    from a spout at the very top of the wheel; and in order that the wheel may not
                    be retarded by dragging into motion the water simply laid into the uppermost
                    bucket at A, let it be received at B, with the velocity (directed in a tangent
                    to the wheeD acquired by the head of water AP. This velocity therefore must be
                    equal to that of the rim of the wheel. Let this be <hi rend="italic">υ,</hi> or
                    let the wheel and the water move over <hi rend="italic">v</hi> inches in a
                    second. Let the buckets be of such dimensions, that all the water which each
                    receives as it passes the spout is retained till it comes to the position R,
                    where it is discharged at once. It is plain that, in place of the separate
                    quantities of water lying in each bucket, we may substitute a continued ring of
                    water, equal to their sum, and uniformly distributed in the space BER <hi
                    rend="italic">gfβ</hi>. This constitutes a ring of uniform thickness. Let the
                    area of its cross section <hi rend="italic">β</hi> B and F <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> called <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. We have already demonstrated, that the
                    mechanical energy with which this water on the circumference of the wheel urges
                    it round, is the same with what would be exerted by the pillar <hi rend="italic"
                    >brrb</hi> pressing on F <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> or acting by the lever CF.
                    The weight of this pillar may be expressed by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × <hi
                    rend="italic">br</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × PS; and if we call the
                    radius CF of the wheel R, the momentum or mechanical energy of this weight will
                    be represented by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × PS × R.</p>
                <p>Now, let us suppose that this wheel is employed to raise a weight W, which is
                    suspended by a rope wound round the axis of the wheel. Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> be the radius of this axle. Then W × <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the
                    momentum of the work. Let the weight rise with the velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> when the rim of the wheel turns with the velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> that is, let it rise <hi rend="italic">u</hi> inches in a second. Since
                    a perfect equilibrium obtains between the power and the work when the motion is
                    uniform, we must have W × <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ×
                    PS X R. But it is evident that R: <hi rend="italic">r = v: u.</hi> Therefore W ×
                    <hi rend="italic">u = a × v</hi> × PS.</p>
                <p>Now the performance of the machine is undoubtedly measured by the weight and the
                    height to which it is raised in a second, or by W × <hi rend="italic">u</hi>.
                    Therefore the machine is in its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=843" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0843-0803"
                    />best possible state when <hi rend="italic">a × v</hi> × PS is a maximum. But
                    it is plain that <hi rend="italic">a × υ</hi> is an invariable quantity, for it
                    is the cubic inches of water which the spout supplies in a second. If the wheel
                    moves fast, little water lies in each bucket, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    small. When <hi rend="italic">ν</hi> is small, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    great, for the opposite reason; but <hi rend="italic">a × v</hi> remains the
                    same. Therefore we must make PS a maximum, that is, we must deliver the water as
                    high up as possible. But this diminishes AP, and this diminishes the velocity of
                    the wheel; and as this has no limit, the proposition is demonstrated, and an
                    overshot wheel does the more work as it moves slowest.</p>
                <p>Convincing as this discussion must be to any mechanician, we are anxious to
                    impress the same maxim on the minds of practical men, unaccustomed to
                    mathematical reasoning of any kind. We therefore beg indulgence for adding a
                    popular view of the question, which requires no such investigation.</p>
                <p>We may reason in this way. Suppose a wheel having thirty buckets, and that six
                    cubic feet of water are delivered in a second on the top of a wheel, and
                    discharged without any loss by the way at a certain height from the bottom of
                    the wheel. Let this be the case whatever is the rate of the wheel’s motion, the
                    buckets being of a sufficient capacity to hold all the water which falls into
                    them. Let this wheel be employed to raise a weight of any kind, suppose water in
                    a chain of thirty buckets, to the same height and with the same velocity.
                    Suppose further, that when the load on the rising side of the machine is one
                    half of that on the wheel, the wheel makes four turns in a minute, or one turn
                    in fifteen seconds. During this time ninety cubic feet of water have flowed into
                    the thirty buckets, and each has received three cubic feet. Then each of the
                    rising buckets contains 1½ feet, and forty-five cubic feet are delivered into
                    the upper cistern during one turn of the wheel, and 180 cubic feet in one
                    minute.</p>
                <p>Now, suppose the machine so loaded, by making the rising buckets more capacious,
                    that it makes only two turns in a minute, or one turn in thirty seconds. Then
                    each descending bucket must contain six cubic feet of water. If each bucket of
                    the rising side contained three cubic feet, the motion of the machine would be
                    the same as before. This is a point which no mechanician will controvert. When
                    two pounds are suspended to one end of a string which passes over the pulley,
                    and one pound to the other end, the descent of the two pounds will he the same
                    with that of a four pound weight which is employed in the same manner to draw up
                    two pounds. Our machine would therefore continue to make four turns in the
                    minute, and would deliver ninety cubic feet during each turn, and 360 in a
                    minute. But, by supposition, it is making but two turns in a minute: this must
                    proceed from a greater load than three cubic feet of water in each rising
                    bucket. The machine must therefore be raising <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than
                    ninety feet of water during one turn of the wheel, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi> than 180 in the minute.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears, that if the machine be turning twice as slow as before, there is
                    <hi rend="italic">more than twice the former quantity</hi> in the rising
                    buckets, and more will be raised in a minute by the same expenditure of power.
                    In like manner, if the machine go three times as slow, there must be <hi
                    rend="italic">more than three times</hi> the former quantity of water in the
                    rising buckets, and more work will be done.</p>
                <p>But we may go further, and assert, that the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> we retard
                    the machine, by loading it with more work of a similar kind, the greater will be
                    its performance. This does not immediately appear from the present discussion:
                    but let us call the first quantity of water in the rising bucket A; the water
                    raised by four turns in a minute will be 4 × 30 × A = 120 A. The quantity in
                    this bucket, when the machine goes twice as slow, has been shown to be greater
                    than 2 A (call it 2 A + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>); the water raised by two turns
                    in a minute will be 2 × 30 × (2 A + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>) <hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi> 120 A + 60 <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Now, let the machine go four times
                    as slow, making but one turn in a minute, the rising bucket must now contain
                    more than twice 2 A -∣- <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or more than 4 A + 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">x;</hi> call it 4 A + 2 <hi rend="italic">x + y.</hi> The work
                    done by one turn in a minute will now be 30 × (4 <hi rend="italic">A</hi> + 2
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + <hi rend="italic">y) =</hi> 120 A + 60 <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> + 30 <hi rend="italic">y.</hi></p>
                <p>By such an induction of the work, done with any rates of motion we choose, it is
                    evident that the performance of the machine increases with every diminution of
                    its velocity that is produced by the mere addition of a similar load of work, or
                    that it does the more work the slower it goes.</p>
                <p>We have supposed the machine to be in its state of permanent uniform motion. If
                    we consider it only in the beginning of its motion, the result is still more in
                    favour of slow motion: for, at the first action of the moving power, the inertia
                    of the machine itself consumes part of it, and it acquires its permanent speed
                    by degrees, during which the resistances arising from the work, friction,
                    &amp;c. increase, till they exactly balance the pressure of the water; and after
                    this the machine accelerates no more. Now the greater the power and the
                    resistance arising from the work are in proportion to the inertia of the
                    machine, the sooner will all arrive at its state of permanent velocity.</p>
                <p>There is another circumstance which impairs the performance of an overshot wheel
                    moving with a great velocity, viz. the effects of the centrifugal force on the
                    water in the buckets. Our millwrights know well enough, that too great velocity
                    will throw the water out of the buckets; but few, if any, know exactly the
                    diminution of power produced by this cause. The following very simple
                    construction will determine this. Let AOB (fig. 10) be an overshot wheel, of
                    which AB is the upright diameter, and C is the centre. Make CF the length of a
                    pendulum which will make two vibrations during one turn of the wheel. Draw FE to
                    the elbow of any of the buckets. The water in this bucket, instead of having its
                    surface horizontal, as NO, will have it in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> O perpendicular to FE very nearly.</p>
                <p>For the time of falling along half of FC is to that of two vibrations of this
                    pendulum, or to the time of a revolution of the wheel, as the radius of a circle
                    is to its circumference; and it is well known that the time of moving along half
                    of AC, by the uniform action of the centrifugal force, is to that of a
                    revolution as the radius of a circle to its circumference. Therefore the time of
                    describing one half of AC by the centrifugal force, is equal to the time of
                    describing one half of FC by gravity. These spaces, being similarly described in
                    equal times, are proportional to the accelerating forces. Therefore ½ FC: ½ AC,
                    or FC: AC = gravity: centrifugal force. Complete the parallelogram FCEK. A
                    particle at E is urged by its weight in the direction KE with a force which may
                    be expressed by FC or KE; and it is urged by the centrifugal force in the
                    direction CE, with a force = AC or CE. By their combined action it is urged in
                    the direction FE. Therefore, as the surface of standing water is always at right
                    angles to the action of gravity, that is, to the plumb-line, so the surface of
                    the water in the revolving bucket is perpendicular to the action of the combined
                    force FE.</p>
                <p>Let NEO be the position of the bucket, which just holds all the water which it
                    received as it passed the spout when not affected by the centrifugal force; and
                    let NDO be its position when it. would be empty. Let the vertical lines through
                    D and E cut the circle described round C with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=844" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0844-0804"
                    />radius CF in the points II and I. Draw HC, IC, cutting the circle AOB in L and
                    Μ. Make the arch <hi rend="italic">d’δ</hi> equal to AL, and the arch <hi
                    rend="italic">e'ε</hi> equal to AM: then C <hi rend="italic">δ</hi> and C <hi
                    rend="italic">ε</hi> will be the positions of the bucket on the revolving wheel,
                    corresponding to CD <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and CEO on the wheel at rest. Water
                    will begin to run out at ε, and it will be all gone at <hi rend="italic">δ</hi>.
                    The demonstration is evident.</p>
                <p>The force which now urges the wheel is still the weight <hi rend="italic"
                    >really</hi> in the buckets; for though the water be urged in the direction with
                    the force FE, one of its constituents, CE, has no tendency to impel the wheel;
                    and KE is the only impelling force.</p>
                <p>It is but of late years that mills have been constructed or attended to with that
                    accuracy and scientific skill which are necessary for deducing confident
                    conclusions from any experiments that can be made with them; and it is therefore
                    no matter of wonder that the opinions of millwrights have been so different on
                    this subject. There is a natural wish to see a machine moving briskly; it has
                    the appearance of activity; but a very slow motion always looks as if the
                    machine were overloaded. For this reason mill-wrights have always yielded
                    slowly, and with some reluctance, to the repeated advices of the mathematicians:
                    but they have yielded, and we see them adopting maxims of construction more
                    agreeable to sound theory, making their wheels of great breadth, and loading
                    them with a great deal of work. Euler says that the performance of the best mill
                    cannot exceed that of the worst above one fifth; but we have seen a stream of
                    water completely expended in driving a small flax-mill, which now drives a
                    cotton-mill of 4000 spindles, with all its carding, roving, and drawing
                    machinery, besides the lathes and other engines of the smith and carpenter’s
                    workshops, exerting a force not less than ten times what sufficed for the
                    flax-mill.</p>
                <p>The above discussion only demonstrates in general the advantage of slow motion,
                    but does not point out in any degree the relation between the rate of motion and
                    the work performed, nor even the principles on which it depends. Yet this is a
                    subject fit for a mathematical investigation, and we would prosecute it in this
                    place if it were necessary for the improvement of practical mechanics. But we
                    have seen that there is not, in the nature of things, a maximum of performance
                    attached to any particular rate of motion which should therefore be preferred.
                    For this reason we omit this discussion of mere speculative curiosity. It is
                    very intricate; for we must now express the pressure on the wheel by a <hi
                    rend="italic">constant</hi> pillar of water incumbent on the extremity of the
                    horizontal arm, as we did before when we supposed the buckets completely filled;
                    nor by a smaller <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> pillar, corresponding to a
                    smaller but equal quantity lying in every bucket. Each different velocity puts a
                    different quantity of water into the bucket as it passes the spout, and this
                    occasions a difference in the place where the discharge is begun and completed.
                    This circumstance is some obstacle to the advantages of very slow motions,
                    because it brings on the discharge sooner. All this may indeed be expressed by a
                    simple equation of easy management; but the whole process of the mechanical
                    discussion is both intricate and tedious, and the results are so much
                    diversified by the forms of the buckets, that they do not afford any rule of
                    sufficient generality to reward our trouble. The curious reader may see a very
                    full investigation of this subject in two dissertations by Elvius in the Swedish
                    Transactions, and in the <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamique</hi> of Professor
                    Kastner of Göttingen, who has abridged these dissertations of Elvius, and
                    considerably improved the whole investigation, and has added some comparisons of
                    his deductions with the actual performance of some great works. These
                    comparisons however arc not very satisfactory. There is also a very valuable
                    paper on this subject by Lambert, in the Memoirs of the Academy of</p>
                <p>Berlin for the year 1775. From these dissertations, and from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrodynamique</hi> of the Abbé Bossut, the reader will acquire
                    all that theory can teach of the relation between the pressures of the power and
                    work on the machine, and the rates of its motion. The practical reader may rest
                    with confidence on the simple demonstration which we have given, that the
                    performance is improved by diminishing the velocity.</p>
                <p>All we have to do, therefore, is to load the machine, and thus to diminish its
                    speed, unless other physical circumstances throw obstacles in the way; but there
                    are such obstacles. In all machines there are little inequalities of action that
                    are unavoidable. In the action of a wheel and pinion, though made with the
                    utmost judgment and care, there are such inequalities. These increase by the
                    changes of form occasioned by the wearing of the machine: much greater
                    irregularities arise from the subsultory motions of cranks, stampers, and other
                    parts which move unequally or reciprocally. A machine may be so loaded as just
                    to be in equilibrio with its work, in the favourable position of its parts. When
                    this changes into one less favourable, the machine may stop; if not, it at least
                    staggers, hobbles, or works unequally. The rubbing parts bear long on each
                    other, with enormous pressures, and cut deep, and increase friction. Such slow
                    motions must therefore be avoided. A little more velocity enables the machine to
                    get over those increased resistances by its inertia, or the great quantity of
                    motion inherent in it. Great machines possess this advantage in a superior
                    degree, and will therefore work steadily with a smaller velocity. These
                    circumstances are hardly susceptible of mathematical discussion, and our best
                    reliance is on well-directed experience.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, the reader will do well to peruse with care the excellent paper
                    by Mr Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions for 1759. This dissertation
                    contains a numerous list of experiments, most judiciously contrived by him, and
                    executed with the accuracy and attention to the most important circumstances
                    which is to be observed in all that gentleman’s performances.</p>
                <p>It is true, these experiments were made with small models; and we must not,
                    without great caution, transfer the results of such experiments to large works.
                    But we may safely transfer the laws of variation which result from a variation
                    of circumstances, although we must not adopt the absolute quantities of the
                    variations themselves. Mr Smeaton was fully aware of the limitations to which
                    conclusions drawn from experiments on models are subject, and has made the
                    applications with his usual sagacity.</p>
                <p>His general inference is, that, in smaller works, the rim of the overshot wheel
                    should not have a greater velocity than three feet in a second; but that larger
                    mills may be allowed a greater velocity than this. When every thing is executed
                    in the best manner, he says that the work performed will amount to fully two
                    thirds of the power expended; that is, that three cubic feet of water descending
                    from any height will raise two to the same height.</p>
                <p>It is not very easy to compare these deductions with observations on large works;
                    because there are few cases where we have good measures of the resistances
                    opposed by the work performed by the machine. Mills employed for pumping water
                    afford the best opportunities. But the inertia of their working gear diminishes
                    their useful performance very sensibly, because their great beams, pump-rods,
                    &amp;c. have a reciprocating motion, which must be destroyed and produced anew
                    in every stroke. We have examined some machines of this kind which are esteemed
                    good ones, and we find few of them whose performance exceeds one half of the
                    power expended.</p>
                <p>By comparing other mills with these, we obtain the best information of their
                    resistances. The comparison with mills worked by Watt and Boulton’s
                    steam-engines, is perhaps<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=845" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0845-0805"/> a
                    better measure of the resistances opposed by different kinds of work, because
                    their power is very distinctly known. We have been informed by one of the most
                    eminent engineers, that a ton and a half of water per minute falling one foot
                    will grind and dress one bushel of wheat per hour. This is equivalent to nine
                    tons falling ten feet.</p>
                <p>If an overshot wheel opposed no resistance, and only one bucket were filled, the
                    wheel would acquire the velocity due to a fall through the whole height. But
                    when it is in this state of accelerated motion, if another bucket of water is
                    delivered into it, its motion must be checked at the first, by the necessity of
                    dragging forward this water. If the buckets fill in succession as they pass the
                    spout, the velocity acquired by an unresisting wheel is but half of that which
                    one bucket would give. In all cases, therefore, the velocity is diminished by
                    the inertia of the entering water when it is simply laid into the upper buckets.
                    The performance will therefore be improved by delivering the water on the wheel
                    with that velocity with which the wheel is really moving. And as we cannot give
                    the direction of a tangent to the wheel, the velocity with which it is delivered
                    on the wheel must be so much greater than the intended velocity of the rim, that
                    it shall be precisely equal to it when it is estimated in the direction of the
                    tangent. Three or four inches of fall are sufficient for this purpose; and it
                    should never be neglected, for it has a very sensible influence on the
                    performance. But it is highly improper to give it more than this, with the view
                    of impelling the wheel by its stroke; for even although it were proper to employ
                    part of the fall in this way (which we shall presently see to be very improper),
                    we cannot procure this impulse; because the water falls among other water, or it
                    strikes the boards of the wheel with such obliquity that it cannot produce any
                    such effect.</p>
                <p>It is a much debated question among mill-wrights, whether the diameter of the
                    wheel should be such that the water will be delivered at the top of the wheel;
                    or larger, so that the water is received at some distance from the top, where it
                    will act more perpendicularly to the arm. We apprehend that the observations
                    formerly made will decide in favour of the first practice. The space below,
                    where the water is discharged from the wheel, being proportional to the diameter
                    of the wheel, there is an undoubted loss of fall attending a large wheel; and
                    this is not compensated by delivering the water at a greater distance from the
                    perpendicular. We should therefore recommend the use of the whole descending
                    side, and make the diameter of the wheel no greater than the fall, till it is so
                    much reduced that the centrifugal force begins to produce a sensible effect.
                    Since the rim can hardly have a smaller velocity than three feet per second, it
                    is evident that a small wheel must revolve more rapidly. This made it proper to
                    insert the determination that we have given of the loss of power produced by the
                    centrifugal force. But even with this in view, we should employ much smaller
                    wheels than are generally done on small falls. Indeed the loss of water at the
                    bottom may be diminished, by nicely fitting the arch which surrounds the wheel,
                    so as not to allow the water to escape by the sides or bottom. While this
                    improvement remains in good order, and the wheel entire, it produces a very
                    sensible effect; but the passage widens continually by the wearing of the wheel.
                    A piece of wood or stone falling in about the wheel tears off’ part of the
                    shrouding or bucket, and frosty weather frequently binds all fast. It therefore
                    seldom answers expectations. We have nothing to add on this case to what we have
                    already extracted from Mr Smeaton’s Dissertation on the subject of Breast or
                    Half Overshot Wheels.</p>
                <p>There is another form of wheel by which water is made to act on a machine by its
                    weight, which merits consideration. It is known in this country by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Barker’s mill,</hi> and has been described by Desaguliers,
                    vol. ii. p. 460. It consists of an upright pipe or trunk AB (fig. 11),
                    communicating with two horizontal branches BC, B <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, which
                    have a hole C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> near their ends, opening in opposite
                    directions, at right angles to their lengths. Suppose water to be poured in at
                    the top from the spout F, it will run out by the holes C and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> with the velocity corresponding to the depth of these holes under the
                    surface. The consequence of this must be, that the arms will be pressed
                    backwards; for there is no solid surface at the hole C, on which the lateral
                    pressure of the water can be exerted, while it acts with its full force on the
                    opposite side of the arm. This unbalanced pressure is equal to the weight of a
                    column having the orifice for its base, and twice the depth under the surface of
                    the water in the trunk for its height. This measure of the height may seem odd,
                    because if the orifice were shut, the pressure on it is the weight of a column
                    reaching from the surface. But when it is open, the water issues with nearly the
                    velocity acquired by falling from the surface, and the quantity of motion
                    produced is that of a column of twice this length, moving with this velocity.
                    This is actually produced by the pressure of the fluid, and must therefore be
                    accompanied by an equal re-action.</p>
                <p>Now suppose this apparatus set on the pivot E, and to have a spindle AD above the
                    trunk, furnished with a cylindrical bobbin D, having a rope wound round it, and
                    passing over a pulley G. A weight W may be suspended there, which may balance
                    this backward pressure. If the weight be too small for this purpose, the
                    retrograde motion of the arms will wind up the cord, and raise the weight; and
                    thus we obtain an acting machine, employing the pressure of the water, and
                    applicable to any purpose. A runner millstone may be put on the top of the
                    spindle; and we should then produce a flour-mill of the greatest simplicity,
                    having neither wheel nor pinion, and subject to hardly any wear. It is somewhat
                    surprising, that although this was invented at the beginning of last century,
                    and appears to have such advantage in point of simplicity, it has not come into
                    use. So little has Dr Desaguliers’s account been attended to (although it is
                    mentioned by him as an excellent machine, and as highly instructive to the
                    hydraulist), that the same invention was again brought forward by a German
                    professor (Segner) as his own, and has been honoured by a series of elaborate
                    disquisitions concerning its theory and performance by Euler and by John
                    Bernoulli. Euler’s Dissertations arc to be found in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    of Berlin, 1751, &amp;c. and in the <hi rend="italic">Nov. Comment.
                    Petropol.</hi> tom. vi. Bernoulli’s are at the end of his Hydraulics. Both these
                    authors agree in saying that this machine excels all other methods of employing
                    the force of water. Simple as it appears, its true theory, and the best form of
                    construction, are most abstruse and delicate subjects; and it is not easy to
                    give such an account of its principles as will be understood by an ordinary
                    reader.</p>
                <p>We see in general that the machine must press backwards; and little investigation
                    suffices for understanding the intensity of this pressure when the machine is at
                    rest. But when it is allowed to run backwards, withdrawing itself from the
                    pressure, the intensity of it is diminished; and if no other circumstances
                    intervened, it might not be difficult to say what particular pressure
                    corresponded to any rate of motion. Accordingly, Desaguliers, presuming on the
                    simplicity of the machine, affirms the pressure to be the weight of a column
                    which would produce a velocity of efflux equal to the difference of the velocity
                    of the fluid and of the machine; and hence he deduces that its performance will
                    be the greatest possible when its retrograde velocity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=846" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0846-0806"/>is
                    one third of the velocity acquired by falling from the surface, in which case it
                    will raise <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of
                    the water expended to the same height, which is double of the performance of a
                    mill acted on by the impulse of water.</p>
                <p>But this is a very imperfect account of the operation. When the machine
                    (constructed exactly as we have described) moves round, the water which issues
                    descends in the vertical trunk, and then, moving along the horizontal arms,
                    partakes of this circular motion. This excites a centrifugal force, which is
                    exerted against the ends of the arms by the intervention of the fluid. The whole
                    fluid is subjected to this pressure (increasing for every section across the arm
                    in the proportion of its distance from the axis), and every particle is pressed
                    with the accumulated centrifugal forces of all the sections that are nearer to
                    the axis. Every section therefore sustains an actual pressure proportional to
                    the square of its distance from the axis. This increases the velocity of efflux,
                    and this increases the velocity of revolution; and this mutual co-operation
                    would seem to terminate in an infinite velocity of both motions. But, on the
                    other hand, this circular motion must be given anew to every particle of water
                    as it enters the horizontal arm. This can be done only by the motion already in
                    the arm, and at its expense. Thus there must be a velocity which cannot be
                    overpassed even by an unloaded machine. But it is also plain, that by making the
                    horizontal arm very capacious, the motion of the water from the axis to the jet
                    may be made very slow, and much of this diminution of circular motion prevented.
                    Accordingly, Euler has recommended a form by which this is done in the most
                    eminent degree. His machine consists of a hollow conoidal ring, of which fig. 12
                    is a section. The part AH <hi rend="italic">ha</hi> is a sort of funnel-basin,
                    which receives the water from the spout F, not in the direction pointing towards
                    the axis, but in the direction, and with the precise velocity, of its motion.
                    This prevents any retardation by dragging forward the water. The water then
                    passes down between the outer conoid AC <hi rend="italic">ca</hi> and the inner
                    conoid HG <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> along spiral channels formed by partitions
                    soldered to both conoids. The curves of these channels are determined by a
                    theory which aims at the annihilation of all unnecessary and improper motions of
                    the water, but which is too abstruse to find a place here. The water thus
                    conducted arrives at the bottom <hi rend="italic">CGcg.</hi> On the outer
                    circumference of this bottom is arranged a number of spouts (one for each
                    channeD, which are all directed one way in tangents to the circumference.</p>
                <p>Adopting the common theory of the re-action of fluids, this should be a very
                    powerful machine, and should raise <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of the water expended. But if we admit the
                    reaction to be equal to the force of the issuing fluid (and we do not see how
                    this can be refused), the machine must he nearly twice as powerful. We therefore
                    repeat our wonder that it has not been brought into use. But it appears that no
                    trial has been made even of a model; so that we have no experiments to encourage
                    an engineer to repeat the trial Even the late author Professor Segner has not
                    related any thing of this kind in his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes
                    Hydraulicos,</hi> where he particularly describes the machine. Such remissness
                    has probably proceeded from fixing the attention on Euler’s improved
                    construction. It is plain that this must be a most cumbrous mass, even in a
                    small size requiring a prodigious vessel, and carrying an unwieldy load. If we
                    examine the theory which recommends this construction, we find that the
                    advantages, though real and sensible, bear but a small proportion to the whole
                    performance of the simple machine as invented by Dr Barker. It is therefore to
                    be regretted that engineers have not attempted to realize the first project. We
                    beg leave to recommend it, with a further argument taken from an addition made
                    to it by M. Mathon de la Cour, in Rozier’s <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    Physique,</hi> January and August 1775. This gentleman brings down a large pipe
                    FEH (fig. 13) from a reservoir, bends it upward at H, and introduces it into two
                    horizontal arms DA, DB, which have an upright spindle DK, carrying a millstone
                    in the style of Dr Barker’s mill. The ingenious mechanician will have no
                    difficulty of contriving a method of joining these pipes, so as to permit a free
                    circular motion without losing much water. The operation of the machine in this
                    form is evident. The water, pressed by the column FG, flows out at the holes A
                    and B, and the unbalanced pressure on the opposite sides of the arms forces them
                    round. The compendiousness and other advantages of this construction are more
                    striking, allowing us to make use of the greatest fall without any increase of
                    the size of the machine. It undoubtedly enables us to employ a stream of water
                    too scanty to be employed in any other form. The author gives the dimensions of
                    an engine which he had seen at Bourg Argental. AB is 92 inches, and its diameter
                    3 inches; the diameter of each orifice is 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>; FG is 21 feet; the pipe D was fitted into C by
                    grinding, and the internal diameter of D is 2 inches.</p>
                <p>When the machine was performing no work, or was unloaded, and emitted water by
                    one hole only, it made 115 turns in a minute; thus giving a velocity of
                    forty-six feet per second for the hole. This is a curious fact; for the water
                    would issue from this hole at rest with the velocity of 37 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. This great velocity
                    (which was much less than the velocity with which the water actually quitted the
                    pipe) was undoubtedly produced by the prodigious centrifugal force, which was
                    nearly seventeen times the weight of the water in the orifice.</p>
                <p>The empty machine weighed eighty pounds, and its weight was half supported by the
                    upper pressure of the water, so that the friction of the pivots was much
                    diminished. It is a pity that the author has given no account of any work done
                    by the machine. Indeed it was only working ventilators for a large hall. His
                    theory by no means embraces all its principles, nor is it well founded.</p>
                <p>We think that the free motion round the neck of the feeding pipe, without any
                    loss of water or any considerable friction, may be obtained in the following
                    manner. AB (fig. 14) represents a portion of the revolving horizontal pipe, and
                    CE <hi rend="italic">ec</hi> part of the feeding pipe. The neck of the first is
                    turned truly cylindrical, so as to turn easily, but without shake, in the collar
                    Ce of the feeding pipe, and each has a shoulder which may support the other.
                    That the friction of this joint may not be great, and the pipes destroy each
                    other by wearing, the horizontal pipe has an iron spindle EF, fixed exactly in
                    the axis of the joint, and resting with its pivot F in a step of hard steel,
                    fixed to the iron bar GH, which goes across the feeding pipe, and is firmly
                    supported in it. This pipe is made bell-shaped, widening below. A collar or hose
                    of thin leather is fitted to the inside of this pipe, and is represented (in
                    section) by LKM <hi rend="italic">mkl</hi>. It is kept in its place by means of
                    a metal or wooden ring Nn, thin at the upper edge, and taper-shaped. This is
                    drawn in above the leather, and stretching it, causes it to apply to the side of
                    the pipe all around. There can be no leakage at this joint, because the water
                    will press the leather to the smooth metal pipe; nor can there be any sensible
                    friction, because the water gets at the edge of the leather, and the whole
                    unbalanced pressure <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=847" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0847-0807"/>is
                    at the small crevice between the two metal shoulders. These shoulders need not
                    touch, so that the friction must be insensible. We imagine that this method of
                    tightening a turning joint may be used with great advantage in many cases.</p>
                <p>We have only further to observe on this engine, that any imperfection by which
                    the passage of the water is diminished or obstructed produces a saving of water,
                    which is in exact proportion to the diminution of effect. The only inaccuracy
                    that is not thus compensated, is when the jets are not at right angles to the
                    arms.</p>
                <p>We repeat our wishes, that engineers would endeavour to bring this machine into
                    use, seeing many situations where it may be employed to great advantage.
                    Suppose, for instance, a small supply of water from a great height applied in
                    this manner to a centrifugal pump, or to a hair belt passing over a pulley, and
                    dipping in the water of a deep well. This would be a hydraulic machine exceeding
                    all others in simplicity and durability, though inferior in effect to some other
                    constructions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Undershot Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p>All wheels go by this name where the motion of the water is quicker than that of
                    the partitions or boards of the wheel, and it therefore impels them. These are
                    called the <hi rend="italic">float-boards,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >floats,</hi> of an undershot wheel. The water, running in a mill-row, with a
                    velocity derived from a head of water or from a declivity of channel, strikes on
                    these floats, and occasions, by its deflections sidewise and upwards, a pressure
                    on the floats sufficient for impelling the wheel.</p>
                <p>There are few points of practical mechanics that have been more considered than
                    the action of water on the floats of a wheel; hardly a book of mechanics being
                    silent on the subject. But the generality of them, at least such as are
                    intelligible to persons who are not very much conversant in dynamical and
                    mathematical discussion, have hardly done any thing more than copied the
                    earliest deductions from the simple theory of the resistance of fluids. The
                    consequence has been, that our practical knowledge is very imperfect; and it is
                    chiefly from experience that we must still learn the performance of undershot
                    wheels. Unfortunately this stops their improvement; because those who have the
                    only opportunities of making the experiments are not sufficiently acquainted
                    with the principles of hydraulics, and are apt to ascribe differences in their
                    performance to trifling nostrums in their construction, or in the manner of
                    applying the impulse of the water.</p>
                <p>We have said so much on the imperfection of our theories of the impulse of fluids
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of</hi> F <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >luids,</hi> that we need not here repeat the defects of the common explanations
                    of the motions of undershot wheels. The part of this theory of the impulse of
                    fluids which agrees best with observation is, <hi rend="italic">that the impulse
                    is in the duplicate proportion of the velocity with which the water strikes the
                    float;</hi> that is, if <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be the velocity of the stream,
                    and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> the velocity of the float, we shall have F, the
                    impulse on the float when held fast, to its impulse <hi rend="italic">f</hi> on
                    the float moving with the velocity <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> as <hi

                    rend="italic">f</hi> = ***F χ *"∙</p>
                <p>This is the pressure acting on the float, and urging the wheel round its axis.
                    The wheel must yield to this motion, if the resistance of the work does not
                    exert a superior pressure on the float in the opposite direction. By yielding,
                    the float withdraws from the impulse, and this is therefore diminished. The
                    wheel accelerates, the resistances increase, and the impulses diminish till they
                    become an exact balance for the resistances. The motion now remains uniform, and
                    the momentum of impulse is equal to that of resistance. The performance of the
                    mill therefore is determined by this; and, whatever be the construction of the
                    mill, its performance is best when the momentum of impulse is greatest. This is
                    had by multiplying the pressure on the float by its velocity. Therefore the
                    momentum will be expressed by</p>

                    third of the velocity of the stream. It only remains to say what is the absolute
                    pressure on the float thus circumstanced. Let the velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> be supposed to arise from the pressure of a head of water <hi
                    rend="italic">h.</hi> The common theory teaches that the impulse on a given
                    surface S at rest is equal to the weight of a column AS; put this in place of F,

                    rend="subscript"> 27</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi> for the momentum. Now the
                    power expended is S <hi rend="italic">hv</hi>, or the column S <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> moving with the velocity v. Therefore the greatest performance of an
                    undershot wheel is equivalent to raising <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of the water that drives it to the same
                    height.</p>
                <p>But this is too small an estimation; for the pressure exerted on a plane surface,
                    situated as the float of a mill-wheel, is considerably greater than the weight
                    of the column SA. This is nearly the pressure on a surface wholly immersed in
                    the fluid. But when a small vein strikes a larger plane, so as to be deflected
                    on all sides in a thin sheet, the impudse is almost double of this. This is in
                    some measure the case in a mill-wheel. When the stream strikes it, it is heaped
                    up along its face, and falls back again, and during this motion it is acting
                    with a hydrostatic pressure on it. When the wheel dips into an open river, this
                    accumulation is less remarkable, because much escapes laterally; but in a
                    mill-course it may be considerable.</p>
                <p>We have considered only the action on one float, but several generally act at
                    once. The impulse on most of them must be oblique, and is therefore less than
                    when the same stream impinges perpendicularly; and this diminution of impulse
                    is, by the common theory, in the proportion of the sine of the obliquity. For
                    this reason it is maintained, that the impulse of the whole stream on the lowest
                    float-board, which is perpendicular to the stream, is equal to the sum of the
                    impulses made on all the floats which then dip into the water; or that the
                    impulse on any oblique float is precisely equal to the impulse which that part
                    of the stream would have made on the lowest float-board had it not been
                    interrupted. Therefore it has been recommended to make such a number of
                    float-boards, that when one of them is at the bottom of the wheel, and
                    perpendicular to the stream, the next in succession should be just entering into
                    the water. But since the impulse on a float by no means annihilates all the
                    motion of the water, and it bends round it and hits the one behind with its
                    remaining force, there must be some advantage gained by employing a greater
                    number of floats than this rule will permit. This is abundantly confirmed by the
                    experiments of Smeaton and Bossut. The latter formed three or four suppositions
                    of the number of floats, and calculated the impulse on each, according to the
                    observations made in a course of experiments by the Academy of Sciences, and
                    inserted by us in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of Fluids;</hi>
                    and when he summed them up, and compared the results with his experiments, he
                    found the agreement very satisfactory. He deduces a general rule, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=848" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0848-0808"
                    />that if the velocity of the wheel is one third of that of the stream, and if
                    seventy-two degrees of the circumference are immersed in the stream, the wheel
                    should have thirty-six floats. Each will dip one fifth of the radius. The
                    velocity being still supposed the same, there should be more or fewer floats
                    according as the arch is less or greater than seventy-two degrees.</p>
                <p>Such is the theory, and such are the circumstances which it leaves undetermined.
                    The accumulation of the water on a float-board, and the force with which it may
                    still strike another, are too intricate to be assigned with any tolerable
                    precision: for such reasons we must acknowledge that the theory of undershot
                    wheels is still very imperfect, and that recourse must be had to experience for
                    their improvement. We therefore strongly recommend the perusal of Mr Smeaton’s
                    experiments on undershot wheels, contained in the same dissertation with those
                    which we have quoted on overshot wheels. We have only to observe, that to an
                    ordinary reader the experiments will appear too much in favour of undershot
                    wheels. His aim is partly to establish a theory, which will state the relation
                    between their performance and the velocity of the stream, and partly to state
                    the relation between the power expended and the work done. The velocity in his
                    experiments is always considerably below that which a body would acquire by
                    falling from the surface of the head of water; or it is the velocity acquired by
                    a shorter fall. Therefore if we estimate the power expended by the quantity of
                    water multiplied by this diminished fall, we shall make it too small, and the
                    difference in some cases is very great; yet, even with these concessions, it
                    appears that the utmost performance of an undershot wheel does not surpass the
                    raising one third of the expended water to the place from which it came. It is
                    therefore far inferior to an overshot wheel expending the same power; and Μ.
                    Belidor has led engineers into very mistaken maxims of construction, by saying
                    that overshot wheels should be given up, even in the case of great falls, and
                    that we should always bring on the water from a sluice in the very bottom of the
                    dam, and bring it to the wheel with as great a velocity as possible. Mr Smeaton
                    also says, that the maximum takes place when the velocity of the wheel is two
                    fifths of that of the stream, instead of two sixths according to the theory; and
                    this agrees with the experiments of Bossut. But he measured the velocity by
                    means of the quantity of water which ran past. This must give a velocity
                    somewhat too small, as will appear by attending to Du Buat’s observations on the
                    superficial, the mean, and the bottom velocities.</p>
                <p>The rest of his observations are most judicious, and well adapted to the
                    instruction of practitioners. We have only to add to them the observations of De
                    Parcieux and Bossut, who have evinced, by very good experiments, that there is a
                    very sensible advantage gained by inclining the float-boards to the radius of
                    the wheel about twenty degrees, so that the lowest float-board shall not be
                    perpendicular, but have its point turned up the stream about twenty degrees.
                    This inclination causes the water to heap up along the float-board, and act by
                    its weight. The floats should therefore be made much broader than the vein of
                    water interrupted by them is deep.</p>
                <p>Some engineers, observing the great superiority of overshot wheels above
                    undershot wheels driven by the same expense of power, have proposed to bring the
                    water home to the bottom of the wheel on an even bottom, and to make the
                    float-board no deeper than the aperture of the sluice, which would permit the
                    water to run out. The wheel is to be fitted with a close sole and sides, exactly
                    fitted to the end of this trough, so that if the wheel is at rest, the water may
                    be dammed up by the sole and float-board. It will therefore press forward the
                    float-board with the whole force of the head of water. But this cannot answer;
                    for if we suppose no float-boards, the water will flow out at the bot tom,
                    propelled in the manner those persons suppose; and it will be supplied from
                    behind, the water coming <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi> from all parts of the
                    trough to the hole below the wheel. But now add the floats, and suppose the
                    wheel in motion with the velocity that is expected. The other floats must drag
                    into motion all the water which lies between them, giving to the greatest part
                    of it a motion vastly greater than it would have taken in consequence of the
                    pressure of the water behind it; and the water out of the reach of the floats
                    will remain still, which it would not have done independently of the
                    float-boards above it, because it would have contributed to the expense of the
                    hole. The motion therefore which the wheel will acquire by this construction
                    must be so different from what is expected, that we can hardly say what it will
                    be.</p>
                <p>We are therefore persuaded that the best way of delivering the water on an
                    undershot wheel in a close mill-course is, to let it slide down a very smooth
                    channel, without touching the wheel till near the bottom, where the wheel should
                    be exactly fitted to the course; or to make the floats exceedingly broader than
                    the depth of the vein of water which glides down the course, and allow it to be
                    partly intercepted by the first floats, and heap up along them, acting by its
                    weight after its impulse has been expended. If the bottom of the course be an
                    arch of a circle described with a radius much greater than that of the wheel,
                    the water which slides down will be thus gradually intercepted by the
                    floats.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made to construct water-wheels which receive the impulse
                    obliquely, like the sails of a common wind-mill. This would, in many situations,
                    be a very great acquisition. A very slow but deep river could in this manner be
                    made to drive our mills; and although much power is lost by the obliquity of the
                    impulse, the remainder may be very great. It is to be regretted that these
                    attempts have not been more zealously prosecuted; for we have no doubt of their
                    success in a very serviceable degree. Engineers have been deterred, because when
                    such wheels are plunged in an open stream, their lateral motion is too much
                    impeded by the motion of the stream. We have however seen one which was very
                    powerful. It was a long cylindrical frame, having a plate standing out from it
                    about a foot broad, and surrounding it with a very oblique spiral like a
                    cork-screw. This was plunged about one fourth of its diameter (which was about
                    twelve feet), having its axis in the direction of the stream. By the work which
                    it was performing, it seemed more powerful than a common wheel which occupied
                    the same <hi rend="italic">breadth</hi> of the river. Its length was not less
                    than twenty feet: it might have been twice as much, which would have doubled its
                    power, without occupying more of the water-way. Perhaps such a spiral, continued
                    to the very axis, and moving in a hollow canal wholly filled by the stream,
                    might be a very advantageous way of employing a deep and slow stream.</p>
                <p>But mills with oblique floats are most useful for employing small streams, which
                    can be delivered from a spout with a great velocity. Bossut has considered these
                    with due attention, and ascertained the best modes of construction. There are
                    two which have nearly equal performances.</p>
                <p>1. The vanes being placed like those of a wind-mill, round the rim of a
                    horizontal or vertical wheel, and being made much broader than the vein of water
                    which is to strike them, let the spout be so directed that the vein may strike
                    them perpendicularly. By this measure it will be spread about on the vane in a
                    thin sheet, and exert a pressure nearly equal to twice the weight of a column
                    whose base is the orifice of the spout, and whose height is the fall producing
                    the velocity. Mills of this kin&lt;l are much in use in the south of Europe. The
                    wheel is horizontal, and the vertical axis carries the millstone; so that the
                    mill is of the utmost simplicity: and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=849" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0849-0809"
                    />this is its chief recommendation, for its power is greatly inferior to that of
                    a wheel constructed in the usual manner.</p>
                <p>2. The vanes may be arranged round the rim of the wheel, not like the sails of a
                    wind-mill, but in planes inclined to the radii, but parallel to the axis, or to
                    the planes passing through the axis. They may either stand on a sole, like the
                    oblique floats recommended by De Parcieux, as above mentioned; or they may stand
                    on the side of the rim, not pointing to the axis, but aside from it. This
                    disposition will admit the spout to be more conveniently disposed either for a
                    horizontal or a vertical wheel.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this article by describing a contrivance of Mr Burns, the
                    inventor of the double bucketed wheel, for fixing the arms of a water-wheel. It
                    is well known to mill-wrights that the method of fixing them by making them to
                    pass through the axle, weakens it exceedingly, and by lodging water in the
                    joint, soon causes it to rot and fail. They have therefore of late years put
                    cast-iron flanches on the axis, to which each arm is bolted; or the flanches are
                    so fashioned as to form boxes, serving as mortises to receive the ends of the
                    arms. These answer the purpose completely, but are very expensive; and it is
                    found that arms of fir bolted into flanches of iron are apt to work loose. Mr
                    Burns has made wooden flanches of a very curious construction, which are equally
                    firm, and cost much less than the iron ones.</p>
                <p>This flanch consists of eight pieces, four of which compose the ring represented
                    in fig. 15, meeting in the joints <hi rend="italic">ab, ab, ab, ab,</hi>
                    directed to the centre O. The other four are covered by these, and their joints
                    are represented by the dotted lines <hi rend="italic">αβ, αβ, αβ, αβ.</hi> These
                    two rings break joint in such a manner that an arm MN is contained between the
                    two nearest joints <hi rend="italic">a'bf</hi> of the one, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >α'β</hi> ' of the other. The tenon formed on one end of the arm A, &amp;c., is
                    of a particular shape: one side, GF, is directed to the centre O; the other
                    side, BCDE, has a small shoulder BC; then a long side CD directed to the centre
                    O; and then a third part DE parallel to GF, or rather diverging a little from
                    it, so as to make up at E the thickness of the shoulder BC; that is, a line from
                    B to E would be parallel to CD. This side of the tenon fits exactly to the
                    corresponding side of the mortise; but the mortise is wider on the other side,
                    leaving a space GFK <hi rend="italic">h</hi> a little narrower at FK than at G
                    <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> These tenons and mortises are made extremely true to
                    the square; the pieces are put round the axle, with a few blocks or wedges of
                    soft wood put between them and the axle, leaving the space empty opposite to the
                    place of each arm, and firmly bolted together by bolts between the arm-mortises.
                    The arms are then put in, and each is pressed home to the side CDE, and a wedge
                    HF of hard wood is then put into the empty part of the mortise and driven home.
                    When it comes through the flanch and touches the axle, the part which has come
                    through is cut off with a thin chisel, and the wedge is driven better home. The
                    spaces under the ends of the arms are now filled with wedges, which are driven
                    home from opposite sides, till the circle of the arms stands quite perpendicular
                    on the axle, and all is fast. It needs no hoops to keep it together, for the
                    wedging it up round the axle makes the two half rings draw close on the arms,
                    and it cannot start at its joints till it crushes the arms. Hoops however can do
                    no harm when all is once wedged up, but it would be improper to put them on
                    before this be done.</p>
