                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">WITSIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Herman</hi></label>, a learned
                    divine, was born on the 12th of February 1636, at Enckhuysen in North Holland.
                    His father, a member of the municipal council of that place, was the author of
                    some pious meditations, written in his native tongue. In 1650 he became a
                    student in the university of Utrecht, where he distinguished himself by his
                    rapid progress in different branches of learning. At the age of eighteen, he
                    publicly recited a Hebrew discourse on the Messiah of the Jews and the
                    Christians. He afterwards removed to Groningen, in order to attend the lectures
                    of Desmarets. He was ordained a minister in 1657, and exercised his functions in
                    different places till 1675, when he was appointed professor of divinity at
                    Franeker. In 1680 he was nominated to a similar chair at Utrecht; and in 1685 he
                    proceeded to London as chaplain of the Dutch embassy sent to congratulate the
                    king on his accession to the throne. In 1698 he succeeded Spanheim as professor
                    of divinity at Leyden; but this office he afterwards exchanged for the
                    rectorship of the Theological College. He died on the 22d of October 1708, in
                    the seventy-third year of his age.</p>

                <p>Witsius was a judicious, as well as a learned and pious writer; and some of his
                    works continue to be held in much estimation. Of his more important publications
                    we subjoin a notice. 1. Judaeus Christianizans circa Principia Fidei et</p>
                <p>SS. Trinitatem: sive, Dissertatio de Principiis Fidei Judaeorum, &amp;c. Traj. ad
                    Rhen. 1661, 12mo. 2. De Oecono-mia Foederum Dei cum Hominibus libri iv. Leovard.
                    1677, 8vo. This treatise has frequently been printed. It was translated into
                    English, and in that form has likewise passed through many editions. In Hervey’s
                    Theron and Aspasia, it receives very high commendation. “The (Economy of the
                    Covenants is a body of divinity, in its method so well digested, in its doctrine
                    so truly evangelical, and, what is not very usual with our systematic writers,
                    in its language so refined and elegant, in its manner so affectionate and
                    animating, that I would recommend it to every student of divinity.” 3. Diatribe
                    de septem Epistolarum Apocalyp-ticarum Sensu historicoac prophetico Franeq.
                    1678, 12mo.</p>
                <p>4. Exercitationes Sacrae in Symbolum quod Apostolorum dicitur; et in Orationem
                    Dominicam. Franeq. 1681, 4to.</p>
                <p>5. Aegyptiaca et ∆ <hi rend="italic">εχάφυλον</hi>: sive, de Aegyptiorum Sacro
                    rum cum Hebraicis Collatione libri tres; et de decem Tribubus Israelis liber
                    singularis. Accessit Diatribe de Legione Fulminatrice Christianorum sub
                    imperatore Μ. Aurelio Antonino. Amst. 1683, 4to. In this valuable work, Witsius
                    maintains, against Sir John Marsham and Dr Spencer, that the Jews did not borrow
                    from the Egyptians any part of their religious rites and ceremonies. The
                    Aegyptiaca are reprinted in the great collection of Ugolini, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesaurus Antiquitatum Sacrarum,</hi> tom. i. The dissertation on the
                    thundering legion was attacked by Larroque. 6. Miscellanea Sacra. Traj. ad Rhen.
                    1692-1700, 2 tom. 4to. The first volume, including thirty additional
                    dissertations, was reprinted at Leyden in 1695. 7. Exercitationum</p>
                <p>Academicarum, maxima ex parte historicocriticotheologi-carum, decas. Traj. ad

                <p>Leidensia. Lugd. Bat. 1703, 4to. A collective edition of his works appeared at
                    Herborn, 1712—7, 6 tom. 4to. Besides his Latin treatises, he published several
                    practical works in Dutch. He was the editor of a Latin version of Godwin’s Moses
                    and Aaron, printed at Utrecht in 1690, and of Gataker’s <hi rend="italic">Opera
