                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    >Malmesbury</hi></label>, an historian of considerable merit in the reign of
                    King Stephen, but of whose life few particulars are known. According to Bale and
                    Pitts, he was surnamed Somersetus, from the county in which he was born. From
                    his own preface to his second book “De Regibus Anglorum,” it appears that he was
                    addicted to learning from his youth; that he applied himself to the study of
                    logic, physic, ethics, and particularly to history. He retired to the
                    Benedictine convent at Malmesbury, became a monk, and was made precentor and
                    librarian; a situation which much favoured his intention of writing the history
                    of the kingdom. In this monastery he spent the remainder of his life, and died
                    in the year 1142. He is one of our most ancient and most faithful historians.
                    His principal work is that entitled “De Regibus Anglorum,” in five books; with
                    an appendix, which he styles “Historiae Novell®,” in two more. It is a judicious
                    collection of whatever he found on record relative to England, from the invasion
                    of the Saxons to his own times.</p>

                    >Newbury, so</hi> called from a monastery in Yorkshire, of which he was a
                    member, wrote a history which begins at the Conquest and ends at the year 1197.
                    His Latin style is preferred to that of Matthew Paris; and he is entitled to
                    particular praise for his honest regard to truth in treating the fables of
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth with the contempt they deserve, as well as for expressing
                    his approbation of Henry II.'s design of reforming the clergy, by bringing them
                    under the regulation of the secular power.</p>

                    >Wykeham</hi> shop of Winchester, was born in the village of Wykeham in
                    Hampshire in 1324. He was educated at Winchester school; and his patron Nicholas
                    Uvedale, governor of Winchester castle, afterwards took him into his family, and
                    appointed him his counsellor and secretary. He could not have made choice of a
                    fitter person for that employment, no man in that age writing or speaking more
                    politely than Wykeham. For this reason, Edington, bishop of Winchester, lord
                    high treasurer of the kingdom, appointed him his secretary three years after,
                    and also recommended him to King Edward III. who took him into his service.
                    Being skilled in geometry and architecture, he was appointed surveyor of the
                    royal buildings, and also chief justice in evre. He superintended the building
                    of Windsor Castle. He was afterwards chief secretary of state, and keeper of the
                    privy seal, and in 1367 succeeded Edington in the see of Winchester. A little
                    after he was appointed lord high chancellor and president of the privy council.
                    That he might well discharge the several functions of his employments, both
                    ecclesiastical and civil, he endeavoured on one hand to regulate his own life
                    according to the strictest maxims, and to promote such parish priests only as
                    were able to give due instructions to their parishioners, and at the same time
                    led exemplary lives: on the other hand, he did all in his power to cause justice
                    to be impartially administered. In 1371 he resigned his chancellorship. Edward
                    returning to England, after having carried on a very successful war in France,
                    found his exchequer in great disorder. The duke of Lancaster, one of his sons,
                    at the head of several lords, having brought complaints against the clergy, who
                    then enjoyed the chief places in the kingdom, the king removed them from their
                    employments. But the laymen who were raised to them behaved so ill that the king
                    was forced to restore the ecclesiastics. The duke of Lancaster showed strong
                    animosity to the clergy, and set every engine at work to ruin Wykeham. He
                    impeached him of extortion, and obliged him to appear at the King’s Bench. He
                    got such judges appointed as condemned him; and not satisfied with depriving him
                    of all the temporalities of his bishopric, he advised Edward to banish him; but
                    this prince rejected the proposal and afterwards restored to Wykeham all that he
                    had been divested of. Richard II. was but eleven years old when Edward died, so
                    that the duke of Lancaster had an easy opportunity of reviving the accusations
                    against the bishop of Winchester; nevertheless Wykeham vindicated himself. He
                    now founded two noble colleges, the one in Oxford, called New College, the other
                    in Winchester. While he was exerting his utmost endeavours to improve these
                    foundations, he was recalled to court, and in a manner forced to accept of the
                    office of lord high chancellor in 1389. Having excellently discharged the duties
                    of that employment for three years, he obtained leave to resign it, foreseeing
                    the disturbances that were about to break out. Having returned to his diocese,
                    he finished his college at Winchester, and there built so magnificent a
                    cathedral that it almost equals that of St Paul’s in London. He laid out several
                    sums in things advantageous to the public and to the poor, notwithstanding
                    which, in 1397 he was in great danger, for he and some others were impeached of
                    high treason in open parliament; however he was again fully cleared. From that
                    time till his death he kept quiet in his diocese, and there employed himself in
                    all the duties of a good prelate. He died in 1404, in the eighty-first year of
                    his age.</p>
