                    this title are included the various British settlements which have been
                    established in the island of New Holland. A description of that island will be
                    found under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Australasia,</hi> together with a

                    of the colony. We now propose to add such further information, and recent
                    statistical details, as will exhibit a view of its progressive increase and its
                    present condition; and to conclude with a short account of the other settlements
                    which have arisen on its western and southern shores, on Swan River, King

                <p>It was after the separation of the United States from this country that it was
                    first proposed to establish a colony for the reception of convicts from Great
                    Britain on the eastern shore of New South Wales; and in the year 1787
                    preparations were completed for carrying the design into effect. In 1787 a fleet
                    consisting of eleven sail of ships, including a frigate<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=752" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0752-0712"/>
                    and an armed tender, and having on board 565 male and 192 female convicts, with
                    200 troops, and several of their wives and children, set sail from Portsmouth in
                    May; and after a voyage of eight months, in the course of which they touched at
                    Teneriffe, Rio Janeiro, and the Cape of Good Hope, where they spent a month,
                    they arrived at their destination on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of January 1788.
                    Captain Arthur Philip of the royal navy was appointed the first governor of the
                    colony. Botany Bay, where it was proposed to fix the settlement, was found ill
                    adapted for that purpose, being exposed to the fury of the east winds, which
                    roll a tremendous sea on the beach. In seeking for a more eligible situation,
                    Captain Philip entered the inlet to which Cook had given the name of Port
                    Jackson, which he found one of the most capacious and safe harbours in the
                    world, navigable for vessels of any burden fifteen miles from its entrance,
                    indented with numerous coves, sheltered from every wind, and possessing the
                    finest anchorage. Within this harbour, on the shores of Sydney Cove, thinly
                    wooded, and the haunt of the kangaroo, but now marked out as the capital of the
                    future empire, the British ensign was hoisted on the 26th of January 1788. They
                    immediately proceeded to clear the ground, to land the live stock and the
                    stores, and to establish the colony, amounting to 1030 souls. In its early
                    progress the settlers encountered numerous obstacles, which it required
                    extraordinary courage, and perseverance, and untiring industry to overcome.
                    These arose from various causes, from the extremely sterile soil around Sydney
                    Cove, from which no industry could extract a sufficient supply of grain for the
                    wants of the people; from the profligate habits of the convicts, which
                    occasioned continual disorders among themselves; from their outrages on the
                    natives, and the retaliation which these produced. It was some years before an
                    adequate supply of provisions for the maintenance of the colony could be derived
                    from the ungrateful soil. The settlers consequently depended on foreign
                    supplies, which did not arrive, and they experienced the severest privations.
                    The loss of the store-ship the Guardian, under the command of Captain Riou, when
                    proceeding to their relief with a large supply of provisions and stores, was a
                    severe blow to the prosperity of the colony; and the general distress was
                    greatly aggravated by the unseasonable arrival of a convict ship with 222 female
                    convicts on board, thus increasing the number of consumers without any addition
                    to the stock of provisions. The consequence was a severe scarcity, during which
                    the weekly rations were, in April 1790, two and a half pounds of flour, two
                    pounds of rice, and two pounds of pork; the governor sharing equally with others
                    in the common calamity. Even this allowance, barely sufficient for the wants of
                    nature, could not have been afforded if the governor had not sent off upwards of
                    200 convicts and troops to Norfolk Island, which is about twenty-one miles in
                    circumference, with a fertile soil. Here the settlers, with even smaller
                    allowance than at Sydney, would probably have perished, but for an unlooked-for
                    supply from a flight of aquatic birds alighting on the island to lay their eggs.
                    Owing to the length of their pinions, they take wing with difficulty; and they
                    were so numerous that from 2000 to 3000 were taken every night, besides an
                    incalculable quantity of eggs, which was a seasonable supply, and saved the
                    lives of this detachment from the main body. Every effort was made to obtain
                    supplies from China, India, and the Cape of Good Hope. There were not at one
                    period four months’ provisions in the store on the most reduced scale, and
                    several persons had already perished. Shortly after, three other vessels arrived
                    with convicts, a large number of whom perished of the scurvy during the voyage.
                    For about three years the settlers were in danger of starvation, and it was not
                    till June 1790 that relief was afforded, by the arrival of three transports from
                    the Cape; and in the following year a ship of war arrived at Sydney, conveying
                    ten vessels, with 1695 male and 68 female convicts, after losing 198 on the
                    passage. The arrival of this fleet changed the aspect of affairs, and gave the
                    necessary stimulus to the industry of this rising community. Amid the
                    difficulties with which the colony had to struggle, its improvement was not
                    altogether neglected. Cultivation was begun, farms were established at Rose Hill
                    (Paramatta), at other places two towns were commenced, and a few convicts were
                    emancipated, and obtained grants of land as settlers.</p>
                <p>Governor Philip embarked for England in December 1792, when Lieutenant-governor
                    Grose succeeded to the government. He was succeeded, on the 15th December 1794,
                    by Captain Paterson; and on the 7th September 1795 Governor Hunter arrived, and
                    immediately entered on his important office. From the year 1792 the improvement
                    of the colony was decisive and rapid. It was in 1789 that the first harvest was
                    reaped at Paramatta; and in 1793 the settlers were enabled to sell corn to the
                    public stores, which was purchased at a given price. Trade began to make its
                    appearance; passage-boats were established between the towns of Sydney and
                    Paramatta, and the settlers visibly increased. The bulls and cows that had been
                    originally-brought to the new settlement had, by the carelessness of the keeper,
                    been suffered to stray into the woods, and every subsequent search had proved
                    ineffectual, when a fine and numerous herd of wild cattle was at length
                    discovered in the interior of the country, evidently the progeny of the animals
                    which had been so long lost to the settlers. At the close of the year 1795, the
                    public and private stock of the colony consisted of 57 horses, 227 head of
                    cattle, 1531 sheep, 1427 goats, 1869 hogs, besides a numerous breed of poultry.
                    The total quantity of land in cultivation amounted to 5419 acres. At this period
                    the storehouses were so completely exhausted that, on the arrival of Governor
                    Hunter, there were no salt provisions in store; and the settlement was, as
                    before, reduced to rations. The colony was in danger of falling back; and it was
                    only the speedy arrival of a store-snip at this critical and distressing moment
                    that saved it from destruction in the eighth year of its establishment.<note

                    South Wales, p. 6.</p></note> At the commencement of the year 1800, the
                    inhabitants had increased to 6000. The stock consisted of 203 horses and mares,
                    1044 cattle, 1024 sheep, 2182 goats, and 4017 hogs. The quantity of land sown
                    with wheat was 4665 acres, with Indian corn 2930 acres, and with barley 82
                    acres.</p>
                <p>Governor Hunter quitted the colony in the year 1800, and was succeeded by Captain
                    King, who had effected the settlement on Norfolk Island. His administration
                    lasted six years, and was distinguished by what is termed the “Irish rebellion,”
                    which broke out about the year 1804. Several hundred convicts attached to the
                    government establishment at Castlehill, about twenty miles from Sydney, struck
                    work and demanded their liberty; having armed themselves with pikes, they
                    prepared for resistance. They were however overthrown after a brief contest by
                    the troops at Vinegar Hill, a few miles from Paramatta, on the Hawkesbury road;
                    a few were shot by the troops; the leaders were apprehended; three of them were
                    led to instant death; two others were executed the following day at Sydney,
                    three others at Castlehill, and the remainder returned quietly to their labour.
                    There is no other instance of any insurrection in the colony by the convict
                    population.</p>
                <p>A printing-press bad been established in the colony about the year 1795, by
                    Governor Hunter, and in March 1803 the Sydney Gazette was published by
                    authority. In 1800 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=753" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0753-0713"/>a
                    copper coin was issued by the government. The colony was at this time governed
                    by general orders issued by the government. Captain King does not seem to have
                    been adequate to the magnitude of the trust committed to him. He quitted the
                    colony in August 1806, and was succeeded by Captain Bligh, who was even less
                    qualified than his predecessor. He had given ominous proofs of his incapacity
                    when he acted as commander of the Bounty, where by his tyrannical conduct he
                    provoked the men to a mutiny; and his selection for the delicate task of rearing
                    up this infant colony, by providing for its various interests, fostering the
                    industrious, repressing the unruly, and discouraging and reclaiming the
                    profligate, evinced a marked indifference to its welfare, which merits decided
                    condemnation. His administration produced exactly the consequences which might
                    have been expected. So unwarrantable was his tyranny, and especially his
                    persecution of one influential person, noted alike for his public spirit and for
                    his private virtues, that the colonists, with all the honest indignation of
                    freemen, declared against his authority; and being aided by the officers and men
                    of the New South Wales corps, they deposed him, and marching up to the
                    government-house, they dragged him from his concealment behind a bed, and
                    carefully protecting his person and property, sent him on board a sloop of war,
                    in which he set sail for Europe, after he had been governor for eighteen months.
                    He was succeeded by General Macquarrie, on the 1st January 1810; the government
                    having in the mean time, from 1808 to December 1809, been successively
                    administered by Lieutenant-colonels Johnstone, Foveaux, and Colonel W.
                    Patterson. During the government of General Macquarrie, which lasted for twelve
                    years, the settlement made great progress in wealth and improvement. The
                    population was increased by the influx of numerous convicts, and some new
                    settlers; though it was not till a later period that the full tide of emigration
                    began to set in towards New Holland. By aid from the British treasury, many
                    public buildings were erected, roads were constructed, and the colonists,
                    compelled by a season of drought in 1813, and animated by the spirit of
                    discovery, made their way over the barrier of the Blue Mountains, hitherto
                    deemed impassable. It was in search of new pasturage, and by following the
                    course of the Grose river, that a pass was at last found, and a road commenced
                    in the following year, over this mountain range, whose summits were considered
                    by the aborigines to be inaccessible, and who often declared that there was no
                    pass into the interior.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See History of Australasia, by R. Montgomery Martin, F. S. S.</p></note> One
                    great principle of Governor Macquarrie’s administration was to encourage and
                    bring forward the convict population. It was his maxim to consider the European
                    life of every convict as past and forgotten; their arrival on the shores of
                    Australasia as a new era in their existence, in which the errors of the past
                    might be entirely redeemed. It was a most enlightened and benevolent policy; and
                    if he erred in carrying it into effect with too little discretion, as was
                    alleged, it was the error of a generous mind. Under his rule the convicts were
                    patronised; some were chosen to be magistrates; he conferred on others colonial
                    situations of trust, along with liberal grants of land. But his further
                    endeavours to introduce into respectable society those who had been branded as
                    felons, were opposed by the invincible antipathies of the European settlers,
                    who, though they agreed in countenancing and rewarding good conduct in the
                    convict population, could not be persuaded that any after-purity of life could
                    thoroughly efface their original disgrace. To force them into the society of men
                    of honour and character, was therefore a vain and useless attempt. Such an
                    intermixture of classes could only be effected by the debasement of European
                    manners, and by lowering the moral tone of society in the colony. Those who have
                    been transported for felony can hardly ever aspire to the distinction that
                    belongs only to moral worth. They may and ought to be treated kindly and
                    indulgently; but a certain degree of disgrace attaches to their crimes, from
                    which they cannot be freed; and it could hardly be expected that the new
                    settlers would lay aside all at once their European prejudices in New Holland,
                    and associate on familiar terms with men whose society they would have abhorred
                    in Britain.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas Brisbane, a man of science and talent, succeeded General Macquarrie in
                    1821. His successor, General Darling, also possessed ability, but he was too
                    jealous of the comments of the press, and involved himself in disputes and
                    difficulties, some arising from his own indiscretion, others from the
                    intemperate violence of his opponents. The present governor, General Bourke, has
                    endeavoured to steer a middle course between these extremes, and has encountered
                    opposition from both parties.</p>
                <p>The British settlements in New South Wales were at first along Port Jackson and
                    the Hawkesbury river. They have since extended backward into the country, and
                    across the Blue Mountains, long deemed the barrier of the colony. They are
                    divided into the following nineteen counties, namely, Cumberland, Camden, St
                    Vincent, Northumberland, Gloucester, on the sea-coast; Durham, Hunter, Cook,
                    Westmoreland, Argyle, Murray, farther into the interior; and still farther
                    westward, Brisbane, Bligh, Philip, Wellington, Roxburgh, Bathurst, Georgiana,
                    King. These nineteen comprise all the counties that have already been settled.
                    They extend along the coast about 250 miles, and into the interior 180 miles.
                    These nineteen counties, with the exception of Cumberland, Argyle, and Bathurst,
                    have been but very imperfectly explored.</p>
                <p>On the sea-coast, along which the great Southern Ocean rolls its tremendous
                    surge, the country is bold and rugged, and for five or six miles from the coast
                    it wears in some parts a bleak and barren aspect; the soil is poor and swampy,
                    and clothed with stinted trees. In other parts, however, the country on the
                    coast, as at Illawarra in Camden, a maritime county to the north of Cumberland,
                    has a different aspect; being, as described by Martin, romantic and beautiful,
                    adorned with tall ferns, umbrageous cedars, graceful palm trees, with numerous
                    creeping vines, throwing around in wild luxuriance their flowery tassels, here
                    and there interspersed with flights of red-crested black cockatoos and purple
                    couries, which present to the spectator the appearance of some tropical region,
                    with the opposite property of a temperate climate. Beyond the girdle of the
                    coast the country begins everywhere to improve, extending in gentle undulations
                    for ten miles, clothed with stately forests, which, where cultivation has made
                    progress, are diversified with farms and tenements, and intersected by broad and
                    excellent turnpike roads. The forest is extremely thick, but there is little or
                    no underwood. A poor kind of grass, which is too effectually sheltered from the
                    rays of the sun to be possessed of any nutritive qualities, shoots up at
                    intervals. This description of country, with few exceptions, forms another
                    girdle of about ten miles in breadth, so that, generally speaking, the colony,
                    for about sixteen miles into the interior, possesses a soil by no means fertile,
                    but requiring both skill and industry to render it productive. At the distance
                    however of twenty or twenty-five miles from the coast, the country begins
                    greatly to improve.</p>
                <p>To the northward, in about 28° south latitude, and seventy-seven miles from the
                    settlement on Brisbane river, the country stretches out into vast plains, with
                    rising downs, at an elevation of about 1800 feet above the level of the sea.
                    They consist of a rich black and dry soil, timbered, and covered with the most
                    luxuriant herbage, interspersed here and there with valleys, open woodlands, and
                    forests. The <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=754"

                    genial and salubrious. Between the parallels of 34° and 27°, there is a vast
                    area of depressed country, the course of the rivers being to north-north-west
                    and north-west; which agrees with the opinion and the report of the natives,
                    that there is a great lake in the interior, discharging its waters on the
                    north-west coast. To the west and south-west of Sydney, the plains extend for
                    130 miles, destitute of trees, and not having a greater elevation of surface
                    than 250 feet above the level of the sea. To the southward of the colony there
                    are also vast plains, discovered in 1823, and called the Brisbane Downs. These
                    fine pasture-lands extend upwards of forty miles south of the parallel of 36°
                    15', which is their southern limit. They are enclosed on the east by the
                    coast-range of hills, and on the west, towards the interior, by the lofty chain
                    of the Australian Alps, known by the name of the Warragong chain, whose peaks
                    are covered with snow all the year round. The table-land thus enclosed by
                    mountains cannot be less than 2000 feet above the level of the sea; and
                    possessing abundant pasturage, and a temperate climate, it affords an unlimited
                    scope to the breed of fine-woolled sheep.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>To the westward of that portion of the country that has been settled or explored,
                    various ranges of mountains are visible, down whose western declivities the
                    streams descend, and afterwards taking a southerly course, fall into the ocean
                    on the southern shore. The first discoveries of travellers in this direction
                    were extremely imperfect. The Lachlan and the Macquarrie, both rising on the
                    western side of the Blue Mountains, were, the first in 1817, and the latter in
                    1818, traced by Mr Oxley, the surveyor-general of the colony, to what he
                    considered a swamp, spreading far and wide over a flat, where there was no
                    outlet for the collected waters, and the whole country beyond he concluded to be
                    an uninhabitable marsh. But in 1824, a journey westward was undertaken by Messrs
                    Howell and Hume, which terminated in the discovery of several large rivers, the
                    tributaries of another larger river, the Morrumbidgee, flowing in a direction
                    nearly west. In 1830, Captain Sturt embarked on this river, which had been named
                    after himself by Hume, and which he named the Murray, and descending the
                    swelling stream, found that it joined the Murray river, which has its estuary by
                    the shallow lake of Alexandrina in Encounter Bay, on the southern coast. In 1831
                    Major Mitchell, on the report of a bush-ranger, of a river which he had followed
                    in a north-western direction from Liverpool Plains to the sea-coast, being sent
                    by the governor on an expedition westward from that point, discovered a
                    fresh-water river, the Karaula or Darling, in latitude 29°, flowing first
                    westward and afterwards in a southern direction, and joining, along with the
                    Morrumbidgee, the Murray river in Encounter Bay. As the structure of the country
                    is gradually brought to light by these discoveries, we observe the broken
                    fragments of its geography gradually pieced together, and at last united into
                    one great whole. Mr Oxley traced the course of the Lachlan and Macquarrie
                    westward a certain length. Other streams that take their rise north of the
                    colony, namely, the Peel and the Namoy rivers, which flow down the western
                    declivity of the coast-range, with a westerly or southerly course, were also
                    traced a certain distance, and were then lost. The descent of the Morrumbidgee,
                    and finally of the Murray, by Captain Sturt, was a valuable discovery, as it
                    threw light on the interior structure of the country, and afforded data for
                    geographical inferences of great importance; and, finally, the journey of Major
                    Mitchell, in which he discovered the great stream of the Darling running almost
                    southward, converted inference into fact, and would seem to point out the river
                    Murray in Encounter Bay as the centre to which, from the nature of the ground,
                    all the waters flow that rise in the great basin formed by the coast-range or
                    the Blue Mountains on the east, and farther north by the Australian Alps, or
                    Warragong range, and interior mountains not yet discovered, on the west; and
                    that the Peel, the Namoy, the Macquarrie, the Lachlan, the Darling, with the
                    Oxley, the Hume, the Goulburn, &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> which descend
                    westward from the Warragong chain, whatever might be the direction of their
                    upper streams, must finally terminate in the common embouchure at Encounter
                    Bay.</p>
                <p>This hypothesis, however, though it seems plausible, is not quite certain, and it
                    is open in some points to objections. From the direction of the river Darling,
                    which was discovered by Captain Sturt in 1829, and traced for forty miles
                    through a level country to the south-west as far as 30° 16' south latitude, 144°
                    50' cast longitude, it would seem to have no other outlet but in the Murray in
                    Encounter Bay; and the fact of a large river falling into the Murray from the
                    south, exactly the course the Darling would take in its progress to the sea,
                    appears a further confirmation of this conjecture. Between the point however to
                    which the Darling has been traced by Captain Sturt in its upper course, and that
                    portion of the river which has been explored by the same traveller, there are
                    400 miles of unknown country. But the greatest objection is, that the Darling
                    was found by Captain Sturt to be perfectly salt, especially as it was farther
                    traced; while the river that he found to fall into the Murray was quite sweet to
                    the taste. This fact seems sufficient to disprove the identity of the two
                    rivers, though it seems certain that the Darling river must find its way to the
                    southern shore; on which, however, though it has been carefully explored, no
                    large river has been found, except where the Murray joins the sea at Encounter
                    Bay.</p>
                <p>The valley which is watered by these streams, is of great extent. Its
                    declivities, according to the course of the streams, is to the south; and it is
                    diversified throughout by ridges of mountains, diverging westward, some of them
                    of great height. All this extensive country southward from the river Murray to
                    the coast, Major Mitchell denominated, from its agreeable aspect and its
                    fertility, Australia Felix. It is well watered; and the Snowy Mountains not only
                    temper the climate, but they afford a supply of moisture throughout the summer
                    to the large rivers to which they give birth; while the great Southern Ocean on
                    three sides throws up clouds of moisture, which descend in abundant rains.
                    Extensive downs occur, which are covered with the best kind of grass, or are
                    gracefully wooded. From Mount Macedon Major Mitchell says he reconnoitred Port
                    Philip at the distance of sixty miles. “In this region,” he adds, “the party
                    crossed ranges of granite, others of trap-rock, the woods forming open forests,
                    which only partially covered the country. This, even in its present state, seems
                    nearly all available for the purposes of agriculture and grazing; and being
                    almost without any aboriginal inhabitants, it is consequently in the best state
                    for the reception of British emigrants.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which flow eastward to the ocean, and those which, with a westerly, and
                    afterwards a southerly course, and a larger and broader stream, terminate in the
                    Southern Ocean, chiefly in the Murray river, at Encounter Bay. To the first
                    class belongs the Hawkesbury, which is a continuation of the Nepean river, after
                    the junction of the latter with a considerable stream called the Grose, and
                    issues from a remarkable cleft in the Blue Mountains, in the vicinity of the
                    town of Richmond, about forty miles from Sydney. It is apt to overflow its
                    banks, from the sudden swelling of the mountain torrents by which it is fed; and
                    in one instance rose, near the town of Windsor, ninety-seven feet above its
                    ordinary level. It falls into Broken Bay, fourteen miles to the north of Port
                    Jackson, where it forms an excellent harbour. Hunter’s river, about seventy
                    miles to the north of Port Jackson, falls into the sea at the harbour of
                    Newcastle. It is sufficiently safe and capacious for vessels of 300 tons burden,
                    and navigable for small craft of thirty or forty tons burden for fifty miles
                    above Newcastle. Manning river, still farther to the north, enters the sea by
                    several mouths, in about latitude 31° 25' south. Hastings river enters the sea
                    at the large harbour of Port Macquarrie, 220 miles north-east of Port Jackson;
                    it rises in south latitude 33½°, and 150° east longitude. Brisbane river falls
                    into Moreton Bay, in latitude 27° 1' south, longitude 153° 26' east. It was
                    discovered in 1823. Its source is in the mountain ranges to the north, and its
                    course is through a large extent of fine country. Among the rivers that take
                    their rise on the western ridge of the Blue Mountains is the Darling, which has
                    its rise between the parallels of 27° and 33½°, and of which the course has been
                    traced for about forty miles through a level country, and is supposed, as
                    already stated, to be the same river which unites its waters with the Murray and
                    Morrumbidgee, on the southern coast, though this is not certain. The Macquarrie
                    river has likewise its origin in the torrents which descend the western ridges
                    of the mountains. It has a winding course to the north-west, in some places
                    deep, broad, and navigable for large boats, in others rapid, and obstructed by
                    falls. It was seen by Mr Oxley to expand over the adjacent country, which had
                    the appearance of a sea, but which was found in 1829, by Captain Sturt, after
                    three years drought, to be converted into a vast expanse of arid soil. Its
                    termination has not been distinctly traced, but it is supposed to be a tributary
                    of the Darling. There are numerous streams which rise in the northern mountains,
                    and which all terminate, as is most probable, in the main trunk, whether of the
                    Darling or any other river which conveys the waters of this valley to their
                    termination in Encounter Bay. The Lachlan river has its origin on the borders of
                    Argyle county, between 34° and 35° of south latitude. Like the Macquarrie, it
                    loses itself in a marsh, from which it emerges to join the Morrumbidgee in 34½°
                    south latitude. The Morrumbidgee river has its origin in the Warragong range,
                    200 miles south-west of Sydney, in latitude 35° south, and about eighty miles
                    from the eastern coast. It pursues a westerly course, and joins the Murray in
                    latitude 34° 15' south, and longitude 141° east, after pursuing a tortuous
                    course of 800 or 1000 miles. The Murray is the central channel through which are
                    conveyed to the ocean all the various streams which descend the western
                    declivity of the great chain of mountains that runs along the coast. It has not
                    been traced to its source, but it receives, as already stated, another river,
                    supposed to be the Darling, and a second considerable stream which enters its
                    left bank from the south-east. Mr Cunningham is of opinion that it is formed by
                    the Hume and the Ovens streams, which take their rise in the Warragong
                    Mountains, and flow west..</p>
                <p>New Holland being situated in the southern hemisphere, its seasons are exactly
                    the reverse of those in Britain. July is the middle of winter, and January of
                    summer. The festivities of Christmas and of the new year are celebrated here,
                    not, as in the old country, with doors and windows shut, and a cheerful fire to
                    dispel the winter cold, but amid the oppression and heat of summer, with doors
                    and windows thrown open to invite the refreshing breeze. We no longer hear in
                    this Australian climate of the “gentle south wind,” nor of “rude Boreas,
                    blustering railer.” The north is here the region of heat, as the south is of
                    cold. Every thing is changed. Nature no longer wears a European dress, and
                    poetry must conform and reverse its images. The summer extends from the 1st of
                    December to the 1st of March. The mean heat during the three months of December,
                    January, and February, is about 80° at noon. This great heat is tempered along
                    the sea-coast by a regular sea-breeze, that sets in regularly about nine o’clock
                    in the morning, and blows with considerable force till about six or seven
                    o’clock in the evening, when it is succeeded by a land-breeze from the
                    mountains, which varies from west-southwest to west. In very hot days the breeze
                    often veers round to the north, and blows a gale. The hot winds to which the
                    country is exposed, especially in the interior, three or four times every
                    summer, blow from the north-west, like a current of air issuing from a heated
                    furnace, raising the thermometer to 100° in the shade, and to 125° when exposed
                    to their influence. They imbibe their heat from the tropical regions of the
                    north, which they traverse, and which, like certain portions of Africa, are
                    probably arid deserts. They are generally succeeded by a cold southerly squall,
                    and by a thunder-storm and rain, which cools the air. The spring months are
                    September, October, and November. In the beginning of September the nights are
                    cold, but the days clear and pleasant. The thermometer varies from 60° to 70°
                    towards the end of the month; and light showers occasionally prevail, with
                    thunder and lightning. The days become gradually warmer, and in October the hot
                    and blighting winds from the north begin to be apprehended. The three autumn
                    months are March, April, and May. The first is rainy, and more fertile in floods
                    than any other in the year. Towards the end of April the weather becomes
                    perfectly clear and serene. The thermometer varies from 72° at noon to 60°, and
                    in the mornings is as low as 52°. During May the thermometer varies from 50° at
                    sunrise to 60° at noon, with a perfectly cloudless sky. During the three winter
                    months of June, July, and August, the mornings and evenings are cold; hoar
                    frosts are frequent, and become more severe in advancing into the interior. At
                    Sydney the thermometer is rarely below 40°; at Paramatta it is frequently as low
                    as 27° in the course of the winter. As the land rises from the ocean, the
                    temperature declines. The winter at Bathurst, where snow falls in its season, is
                    much colder than on the sea-shore. On the loftiest hills heavy falls of snow
                    take place during the winter, and it remains for many days on their summits; and
                    some high ranges penetrate the level of perpetual snow. In the valleys however
                    the snow' does not lie. The greatest defect in the climate is the prevalence of
                    periodical droughts, during which the vegetation is parched for want of
                    moisture, a general failure of the crops follows, and numbers of the cattle
                    perish. Although in general a large quantity of rain falls throughout the year,
                    yet the colony has hitherto been subject to severe drought every twelve years. A
                    drought took place in 1826, which continued to 1829; and more recently, in 1839,
                    another severe drought took place, which occasioned general distress in the
                    colony. The climate is however on the whole highly salubrious and agreeable. Out
                    of a community of 1200 persons, it has been known that only five or six have
                    been sick at a time; and at some of the military stations,' seven years have
                    elapsed without the loss of a man.</p>

                <p>Wheat, maize, barley, oats, and rye are all grown in the colony of New Holland;
                    but the two former are most cultivated. The heat at Sydney appears to be too
                    great for the common species of barley and oats, though they are produced of a
                    tolerable quality on the poorer soils. What is called the Siberian wheat arrives
                    at very great perfection, and is greatly superior to the common species of
                    barley; but being only used in the breweries, the demand is limited. The Indian
                    corn, or maize, is of more general use, being much better adapted for the food
                    of horses, oxen, pigs, and poultry. The produce is also much more abundant than
                    that of barley and oats; and it has this additional recommendation to the
                    settler, that it may be planted two months later than any other grain. The best
                    months for sowing wheat are April, May, and June, though it may be sown from
                    February to July, and even so late as August if that month happens to be moist.
                    Oats and barley may be best sown in June, though they may be sown in the middle
                    of August with a fair prospect of a crop. Indian corn may be planted from the
                    end of September to the middle of December; but the best month is October. The
                    wheat harvest generally commences partially about the middle of November, and is
                    generally over by Christmas. The maize is not ripe till the end of March, and
                    the gathering is not complete till the end of May. The culinary vegetables in
                    Australia are numerous, and they thrive admirably in the climate. Potatoes,
                    cabbages, carrots, parsnips, turnips, pease, beans, cauliflowers, lettuces,
                    cucumbers, and in fact every species of vegetable known in this country, are
                    produced in the colony. Many of them attain to greater perfection than in
                    Europe, as the cauliflower and the brocoli, and the different varieties of the
                    pea; and a few also degenerate, as the bean, for which the climate appears too
                    hot, and the potato, which is not nearly of so good a quality as in this
                    country. The colony is justly famed for the goodness and variety of its fruits.
                    Peaches, apricos, nectarines, oranges, grapes, pears, plums, figs, pomegranates,
                    raspberries, strawberries, and melons of all sorts, attain the highest degree of
                    maturity in the open air; and even the pine-apple may be produced in a common
                    hot-house. The climate at Sydney is not however so congenial to the fruits of
                    the northern climate, as the apple, the pear, the currant, the gooseberry, and
                    the cherry, which, though they are produced, do not equal in flavour those
                    produced in this country. To the westward of the Blue Mountains, where the
                    climate is colder, they attain to the same perfection as in Europe. Grapes of
                    the finest quality are produced in New Holland; and some not wholly unsuccessful
                    attempts have been made to manufacture wine, which might in time become a
                    valuable export, and staple of commerce. Oranges, lemons, citrons, guavas, and
                    other fruits, are so abundant that during part of the year swine are fed on
                    peaches and apricos.</p>
                <p>The animal kingdom in New Holland is extremely curious and interesting. There are
                    no large animals, such as elephants, lions, tigers, &amp;c.; and there are few
                    varieties. But the animals of New Holland are peculiar to the country, and are
                    not found in any other quarter of the globe. The most remarkable animal found
                    here is the kangaroo, of which there are very many varieties, from the
                    kangaroo-rat to the forester, which stands from four to five feet high. The
                    kangaroo, from its peculiar structure, the fore legs being so much shorter than
                    those behind, does not run; but it advances by springs or bounds, the length of
                    which is sometimes prodigious, exceeding twenty paces; at which rate they will
                    proceed for some time, and outstrip the fleetest greyhounds. The abdominal pouch
                    which this animal possesses, and into which, as in a burrow or nest, the mother
                    shelters her helpless young, letting them out by day to graze on the tender
                    herbage, or carefully conveying them across rivers and through forests when
                    pursued by enemies, until they are able to provide for their own sustenance and
                    safety, is extremely curious. The kangaroo is very timid, and it is only when it
                    is hard pressed that it turns upon the hunters, when it will set its back
                    against a tree, and boldly awaiting the dogs, will rip them up with its hard
                    claws, or will give them such a hug with its fore-arms as to cause the blood to
                    gush from the hounds’ nostrils; and sometimes taking to the water, it will drown
                    every dog that comes near it. These animals are fast disappearing Before the
                    progress of civilization; and it is a saying of the aborigines, “where white men
                    sit down, kangaroo go away.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    v.</p></note> The opossum tribe are very numerous, and resemble those found in
                    America. They take up their residence in the hollows of decayed trees, from
                    which they are chased by the natives. The hyena opossum, or tiger, is very
                    destructive among flocks. He sometimes measures six feet from the snout to the
                    tail. He has a mouth like the wolf, with large jaws opening almost to the ears.
                    The female carries its young in a pouch, like most of the other quadrupeds in
                    the country. The native dog, which, next to the kangaroo and the opossum, is the
                    animal most frequently met with, resembles the Indian jackal. It is about two
                    and a half feet long, two feet high, with a head like a fox, and erect ears, and
                    is of a reddish-brown colour. It preys on the sheep and poultry, making great
                    havock among them; and is hunted without mercy by the settlers, who are fast
                    extirpating the breed. The wombat is a kind of badger, weighing forty pounds; is
                    good eating, and is in consequence quickly disappearing, as is also a species of
                    sloth. The porcupine ant-eater is a small animal. A specimen mentioned by Mr
                    Martin measured from the snout thirteen inches, the quills two inches long. It
                    preys upon ant-eggs. There are varieties of the flying squirrel, fox, and mouse.
                    The platypus is a singular animal, which it is difficult to know whether to
                    class as a beast or as a bird. It has four legs like a quadruped, and a bill
                    like a duck, and according to general belief lays eggs and suckles its young. It
                    is about fourteen inches in length, and resembles an otter, though inferior in
                    size; is covered with a very thick, soft, and beaver-like fur. It has a small
                    flat head, and short legs terminating in a broad web. It has five claws; and in
                    the male there is a perforated spur, through which is discharged a poisonous
                    secretion. Of the domestic animals, there are those that are common in Britain,
                    from which they have been imported. The breed of horses has been greatly
                    improved, and is now excellent, insomuch that they are exported to India for the
                    purpose of supplying the East India Company’s cavalry and artillery. The horned
                    cattle are in many instances of a gigantic size; and in this congenial climate
                    and abundant pasture the sheep have an improved fleece, and are of a delicious
                    flavour. Swine are abundant; goats are not numerous; and asses and mules are
                    seldom reared, though a fine breed of the former has been introduced from South
                    America. The camel would be a valuable addition to the domestic animals, as by
                    his patience of thirst and fatigue he would be admirably fitted for long
                    journeys in the interior of the country.</p>
                <p>The ornithology of New South Wales is rich and various. The birds are numerous,
                    and many of them of the most beautiful plumage. The emu, or cassowary, is one of
                    the most remarkable of the feathered race, both for its great size, being six
                    feet in height, and for its singular properties. Its covering is more like hair
                    than feathers; it cannot fly, and being thus confined to the earth, has little
                    of the character of birds. It is wonderfully fleet, outstripping the swiftest
                    dog, and kicking with such violence as to break a man’s leg. It is easily tamed,
                    and becomes quite <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=757"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0757-0717"/>domestic. It is, like all the other wild
                    creatures, fast disappearing before the progress of cultivation. The “gigantic
                    crane,” or “native companion,” is a stately bird, about six feet high, of a pale
                    ash colour, with a reddish tinge on the head. It is gregarious and carnivorous,
                    and haunts the borders of rivers and lakes, where also the black swan is found.
                    The bustard, or native turkey, is a large bird, weighing from fifteen to
                    eighteen pounds, and is good eating. Eagles and hawks are to be found in all
                    their varieties. Some are white and very large; the eagle-hawk measures nine
                    feet from wing to wing, and is feathered to the toes. There are about thirty
                    varieties of the pigeon; and the parrot species is in boundless variety, and of
                    the most brilliant plumage. The cockatoos are easily domesticated, and taught to
                    imitate sounds. Some of them are of a milk-white; others black, richly
                    variegated on the tail with red, and adorned with superb crests. The <hi
                    rend="italic">lories,</hi> green, red, crimson, and purple, are in great
                    variety; and there are numerous birds not yet described by naturalists. The <hi
                    rend="italic">spotted grosbeak</hi> is of a light slate colour above, bill and
                    tail deep crimson, throat black, and the sides are marked with snow-spots on the
                    dark ground. The rifle-bird is nearly the size of a jay, its bill long and
                    sickle-shaped, and colour a rich dark green, like velvet. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ring oriole</hi> is of a golden yellow and the deepest black, the feathers on
                    the head resembling the softest velvet. The doves, in variety and beauty of
                    plumage, surpass those in any other part of the world. The spur-winged plover is
                    noted for a large spur upon the shoulder of each wing, with which it fights
                    fiercely. There are two kinds of pheasants, and three of magpies. The common
                    crow and the swallow are everywhere to be found; also the Australian sparrow,
                    with varied plumage, in which a scarlet tinge is intermixed; the <hi
                    rend="italic">butcher-bird,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">laughing jackass,</hi>
                    which destroys snakes and other reptiles, so called from the resemblance of its
                    note to a coarse and boisterous laugh; <hi rend="italic">the coach-whip,</hi> a
                    small bird, whose note resembles the crack of a short whip. Snipes, quails,
                    king-fishers, and coots are abundant; also honey-suckers, woodpeckers, toucans,
                    fly-catchers, warblers, cuckoos, and various species of small birds. Here are
                    likewise to be found the pelican, penguin, goose, duck, teal, widgeon,
                    frigate-bird, noddy, peterel, gull, and other sea-birds.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Insects are numerous, and of every variety. Locusts are common in some parts of
                    the colony. The butterflies are neither abundant nor beautiful. Of bees there
                    are three kinds, all without stings. The flies are a great nuisance in summer,
                    particularly one species, which taints and putrefies every thing it touches. The
                    mosquitoes are disappearing with the progress of civilization. The spiders are
                    very large; and caterpillars, at intervals of several years, swarm in incredible
                    numbers, blighting in a few hours the finest fields of wheat. Measures have been
                    taken to stop the ravages of this mischievous creature. Whence they come in such
                    myriads, and almost in a single night, is unknown.</p>
                <p>Reptiles are not at all in such numbers as they are in general in marshy
                    countries. There are several varieties of the snake, some of them poisonous,
                    namely, the <hi rend="italic">deaf adder,</hi> which resembles the puff adder of
                    America. It is thick, short, swelling out in the middle, with a flat head, and a
                    cleft tail which opens and shuts like a forceps; its back is beautifully
                    variegated with rows of red and white specks; and when irritated it seizes a
                    stick as tenaciously as a cur dog. The diamond snake, which grows to the length
                    of twelve or fifteen feet, is not poisonous. There is a small hazel-coloured
                    snake, with two little flaps at its sides like fins; it darts along with great
                    rapidity, and is termed the winged snake. Mr Martin saw a serpent at Paramatta,
                    resembling the boa constrictor, fourteen feet long; its coat of a bright hue,
                    but changing as the animal became irritated. Several water-snakes have been
                    found, and at a considerable distance from the land. Scorpions, centipedes,
                    tarantulas, and frogs are found. Lizards are numerous, but without the varied
                    hues of those in the east. The guana is also found, of a dirty brown colour, and
                    about four feet in length.</p>
                <p>Fish are plentiful along the coasts; but they are not so plentiful in the rivers,
                    especially in those in the eastern declivity of the Blue Mountains, owing to the
                    rapidity of the currents. The fish called the <hi rend="italic">cod-fish,</hi>
                    though not the same as that known in Europe, is taken in the fresh-water rivers
                    west of the Blue Mountains, in great quantities, of a large size, some weighing
                    seventy pounds, and thirty pounds being very common. They are of a fine flavour;
                    as are also the eels, which are caught of the weight of twelve or even twenty
                    pounds. Perch, covered with scales and prickly fins, abound in the rivers on the
                    eastern coast. In flavour and juiciness they resemble a sole. There are many
                    varieties of other fish, with which the markets are well supplied; and of late
                    sharks have been caught in Sydney Cove. Shell-fish are abundant. Fresh-water
                    mussels have been found at Bathurst six inches long and three and a half broad,
                    and shrimps are in great numbers. Oysters are found in great abundance around
                    the Australian shores; every rock is covered with them; and though generally
                    small, they are of a delicate flavour.</p>
                <p>The country of New South Wales having been hitherto but imperfectly explored, its
                    geology cannot be fully known. The line of coast, where the nature of the
                    country has been chiefly ascertained, presents in its general aspect bold
                    perpendicular cliffs of sandstone lying in horizontal strata, and interrupted
                    occasionally by sandy beaches, behind which the country is low and flat. From
                    the sea-coast to the river Nepean on the west, the sandstone seems to spread
                    like a level platform; and although the country rises into hills and ridges,
                    these seem to consist of a mass of clay, worn into inequalities on the surface
                    by the action of the water, which accounts for the singular fact that the tops
                    of the hills, which contain most of the original clay, are generally more
                    fertile than the valleys, unless they contain alluvial deposits. Westward, or
                    beyond Nepean river, the sandstone strata are forced upwards, and extend from
                    north to south, forming the lofty ridge of the Blue Mountains. Towards the south
                    the sandstone gives place in many parts to whinstone. On advancing farther to
                    the south and west, granite and limestone are abundant, perforated in all
                    directions with extensive subterraneous caverns, exactly resembling, in
                    stalactitic decoration, those found in Europe and America. To the north-westward
                    of Sydney occurs a fine limestone formation, which passes in some parts into a
                    beautiful close-grained marble, affording materials to several skilful artisans
                    in Sydney. In several other places other varieties of minerals are to be found.
                    Hunter’s river flows for a considerable distance over rocks of jasper, and
                    beautiful agates, opal, and chalcedony; while innumerable petrifactions are
                    found on its banks. Cornelian and agate have been found near the burning
                    mountain of Wingen; some of the specimens crested with copper, and others
                    presenting a beautiful auriferous appearance. For a more particular account of
                    the mineralogy of New South Wales, the reader is referred to the work of Mr
                    Montgomery Martin, which abounds in the most important information. We may add,
                    however, respecting the coal formation, that this valuable mineral is found in
                    several districts, especially in the country to the south of Hunter’s river,
                    about sixty miles north of Port Jackson, which is an extensive <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=758" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0758-0718"
                    />coal-field. In this district is situated the town of Newcastle, so called from
                    the produce in its neighbourhood. This district was originally the place of
                    transportation for the most incorrigible class of offenders from Port Jackson,
                    who are worked in chains from sunrise to sunset, in burning lime and in
                    procuring coals and timber. In consequence of the fertility of the soil and the
                    extent of water-communication, Hunter’s river being navigable for 200 miles with
                    boats, numerous emigrants reside in good farms along the shores of the river,
                    and the country resembles the richest pastoral scenery in Devonshire.</p>
                <p>An account of the aborigines of New South Wales will be found under the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Australasia.</hi> That they will in the end gradually
                    disappear, is no longer doubtful. In new settlements of the Europeans, they
                    generally perish in the conflicts which take place between them and the
                    intruders; but in New South Wales this enmity has subsided, and the most humane
                    attempts have been made to reclaim them from their savage state. These efforts,
                    however laudable, have been vain. Where the experiment has been tried under the
                    most favourable circumstances, and they have been provided with every comfort,
                    they have invariably relapsed into their primitive barbarity; so that in this
                    respect New Holland will afford no exception to the general experience, that as
                    the civilized inhabitants increase, the savage race invariably disappears. The
                    British colony, when it was first established in Sydney, consisted of 1030
                    individuals, 700 of whom were convicts; and notwithstanding the discouragement
                    of emigration by some of the authorities, the population, owing to the fineness
                    of the climate and the number of convicts sent out, rapidly increased. A census
                    has been taken at four different times, and the following is the result:</p>

                </table>
                <p>The total number of white inhabitants now in the colony is estimated at upwards
                    of 100,000, of whom 25,000 are convicts, the residue of upwards of 90,000 who
                    have been transported to the settlement since 1788. The population is divided
                    into three classes: 1. the free settlers who have arrived in the colony, and
                    their descendants; 2. those who have served their legal term, or who are free by
                    pardon, the reward of good behaviour, and their descendants; and, 3. the
                    convicts who are still in bondage. The convicts, when they arrive in New
                    Holland, are conveyed, the male and the female prisoners, to different stations
                    or barracks, which are surrounded by a high wall, and guarded by soldiers and
                    several constables. The convicts are assigned as agricultural, manufacturing, or
                    domestic labourers, to farmers and townspeople, who, in return for their
                    services, are bound to provide them with food and clothing. Upwards of three
                    fifths of all the prisoners in the colony are provided for in this manner. After
                    serving a certain time with an unblemished character, the convict is entitled to
                    a “ticket of leave,” which makes him free within the district over which it
                    extends; and if he does not forfeit this ticket by any crime for a certain
                    number of years, he is then entitled to a conditional pardon, which makes him
                    free within the precincts of the colony. And this system is found by experience
                    to be attended with the most beneficial results. “On every side,” says
                    Montgomery Martin, in his account of this colony, “the traveller witnesses
                    proofs of an industrious and prosperous community; he beholds ships, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=759"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0759-0719"/> warehouses, steam-engines, farms, &amp;c., the
                    owners of which were transported from their natal soil, and who, after having
                    paid the penalty demanded by the laws, have commenced a new life, setting an
                    example of honesty, morality, and enterprise to those from whose abject
                    condition they have emerged, and who are thus strongly urged to imitate their
                    example.” The second class consists of those who have been once prisoners, and
                    are now free. They are termed <hi rend="italic">emancipists,</hi> and by their
                    industry are possessed of great wealth in land, houses, ships, and merchandise;
                    and many of them are remarkable for probity, benevolence, and their enterprising
                    spirit. The next and highest class consists of emigrants from Europe, either
                    farmers, shop-keepers, merchants, or government officers and functionaries. Some
                    individuals of this class refuse to associate in private with those who have
                    been once convicted, though they be now free; and hence has arisen in the colony
                    the distinction of the two opposite and hostile classes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >exclusionists</hi> on the one hand, and <hi rend="italic">emancipists</hi> on
                    the other.</p>
                <p>When the colony of New South Wales was first established, the whole powers of the
                    government necessarily centred in the governor alone. In 1824, a council was
                    appointed to aid and to control him in the exercise of his authority. Several
                    alterations have since taken place, and the supreme authority is now vested, 1.
                    in the governor; 2. in an executive council, which consists of the colonial
                    secretary and treasurer, the bishop, and lieutenant-governor, which office has
                    been recently abolished; and, 3. in a legislative council, consisting of the
                    members of the executive council, with the addition of the chief justice, the
                    attorney-general, the chief officer of the customs, the auditor-general, and
                    seven individuals in the colony who are appointed by the crown for life. The
                    legislative power is vested in the governor and in this legislative council, two
                    thirds of which must concur before any law can be passed. The governor has the
                    initiative of all laws, though any member of the council may request the
                    governor to introduce a bill for the consideration of the council. If the
                    governor decline, he must lay his reasons in writing, together with a copy of
                    the bill, before the council; and any member disapproving of such refusal, may
                    enter on the minutes the grounds of his disapprobation. Every bill passed by the
                    council must be transmitted to the supreme court to be enrolled, when, if the
                    judges represent that it is repugnant to the act 9 Geo. IV., or to the charter,
                    or letters patent, or orders in council, or to the laws of England, it is again
                    brought under the consideration of the council, and if again passed, proceeds
                    into operation until the pleasure of her majesty be known. For the sole
                    administration of the laws there is a supreme court, over which preside a chief
                    and two puisne judges. The supreme court is a court of oyer and terminer, and
                    gaol delivery; it is also a court of equity, and a court of admiralty for the
                    trial of criminal offences within certain limits; it is empowered to grant
                    letters of administration, and it is an insolvent debtors court. From the
                    supreme court lies an appeal for all actions for less than L.500, to the
                    governor or acting governor, who is directed to hold a court of appeals, from
                    whose decision lies a final appeal to the king in council. There are courts of
                    general and quarter sessions, which have the same powers as those in England.
                    Courts of requests have been established for summarily determining claims not
                    exceeding L.10; and their decision is final. Juries now sit in civil and
                    criminal cases. A very vigilant police has been established throughout New South
                    Wales. There are benches of stipendiary as well as unpaid magistrates in Sydney
                    and other principal towns, aided by head-constables and a civil and military
                    police-force at each station.</p>
                <p>The country of New South Wales, recently a pathless forest, is now intersected in
                    all directions by excellent roads, some of them carried with equal labour and
                    skill over lofty mountains, and bringing into close intercourse the remotest
                    parts of the country by a daily increasing traffic. The royal mail proceeds from
                    Sydney to all the different towns in the interior, and letters are delivered
                    with punctuality and despatch. Stage-coaches with four horses also start from
                    the same place daily, and from other places; so that there is every facility of
                    internal intercourse by land; while numerous steam-vessels leave Sydney and ply
                    along the coast to the different seaports.</p>
                <p>There is here, as in the mother country, a variety of religious sects, a
                    statement of whose respective numbers will be found in the population table
                    already given. But different modes of faith here mingle in perfect harmony in
                    all the duties of civil life. No religious distinctions are recognised; all
                    classes, of whatever creed, enjoy equal rights, and are equally eligible to
                    offices of honour or emolument; and the government provides equally for the
                    maintenance of all sects. One seventh of the land was formerly appropriated to
                    the support of the episcopal church: it is still applicable to the genera)
                    purposes of religion and education, but without any distinction of sects, all of
                    which participate equally in the government fund. Thus we find the principle of
                    religions toleration more fully maintained in New South Wales than in the mother
                    country, where there still exists a dominant religion fostered by the state. The
                    episcopalian church was until very lately within the diocese of Calcutta. It is
                    now subject to a bishop who resides in the country. There are, besides, fifteen
                    chaplains of this church, who take charge of different districts in the country.
                    There are four ministers of the established church of Scotland, and of the Roman
                    Catholic clergy a vicar-general and six chaplains. The Wesleyan Missionary
                    Society has four principal stations and upwards of sixty chapels, besides
                    preaching stations, and five ordained missionaries, with several agents under
                    them. There are also five Sunday schools, with 300 boys and 250 girls.</p>
                <p>Great efforts have been made in Australia to promote education among all classes,
                    and numerous excellent seminaries have been established. In the Australian
                    College, instituted in 1831, are taught the ancient languages, English
                    literature, and the sciences. This seminary consists of elementary schools, with
                    a provision for the higher branches of education. Private establishments for
                    education are numerous. Sydney College was instituted in 1830. It is under the
                    control of a president and committee of management, consisting of emigrants and
                    <hi rend="italic">emancipists;</hi> those two classes joining amicably together
                    in the promotion of knowledge. There are two excellent establishments, the male
                    and female orphan schools, each containing 125 destitute children, who are
                    reared from their infancy. There are several infant schools, thirty-three
                    primary or parochial schools, in different parts of the colony; and two king’s
                    schools at Sydney and Paramatta, with classical teachers. There are a Mechanics
                    School of Arts, an Australian Subscription Library, and various other societies
                    connected with literature and science. The press, as usual, lends its aid to the
                    diffusion of knowledge. It is not restrained by any law, nor by taxes of any
                    description. The newspapers are numerous; some of them published every day, and
                    others three times a week. In the town of Sydney there are six, and a New South
                    Wales Magazine is published every month. The materials of these publications are
                    chiefly supplied by local topics, though due attention is also given to the
                    politics of Europe.</p>

                <p>The revenue of the customs chiefly arises from a duty on the importation of
                    spirits, of tobacco, and of manufactures; of L.25 a year on licenses to distil
                    spirituous liquors; on auctioneers, L.2 per annum; on butchers, carters, and
                    carts; on boatmen and boats; on porters; on dogs.</p>
                <p>The following table contains the total expenditure in the colony for nine
                    successive years, beginning with 1828. Expenditure in 1828, L.40,912; 1829,
                    L.55,544; 1830, L.55,980; 1831, L.87,046; 1832, L. 110,524; 1833, L.123,817;

                    amounted to L.460,217.</p>
                <p>The trade of the colony has rapidly increased within the last few years, with the
                    surplus produce of the country. The staple products of New South Wales are wool,
                    whale-oil, cattle, and provisions. The first has become one of the most valuable
                    articles of export, and now furnishes nearly one tenth of the foreign wool
                    imported into this country. The origin and progress of this important branch of
                    industry is remarkable. In 1810, only 167 lbs. of wool were imported into
                    Britain from New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land; in 1815, 73,171 lbs.; in
                    1825, 323,995 lbs.; in 1830, 1,967,309 lbs.; and in 1836,3,564,532 lbs.<note

                    indebted for the introduction of this article of wool to the enterprising spirit
                    of Mr J. M‘Arthur, who being convinced, so long ago as in 1793, that the climate
                    and grasses of New South Wales would suit the Merino sheep, obtained a ram and
                    two ewes from the Cape of Good Hope, which rapidly increased. Having afterwards
                    explained his plans for the improvement of New South Wales to the privy council,
                    he procured from the Merino flock of George III., two ewes and three rams, with
                    which he returned to New South Wales, where these flocks are now increased to
                    upwards of a million, of which the wool is highly prized in the London market,
                    and has been sold as high as 10s. 4d. per lb. After wool, whale-oil is the chief
                    staple of the colony. This article is also a recent product, which has been
                    annually increasing. The number of ships employed in this trade in the year
                    1829, was 27; the value of the produce, L.94,101. In 1836, the number of ships
                    amounted to 40; the value of the produce to L. 126,085. The black whale is found
                    in abundance along the coast of New South Wales. But the sperm fishing is the
                    most valuable; and in prosecution of this adventurous trade, forty vessels
                    sailed out of Sydney in 1834. The value of the spermaceti and train oil exported
                    in 1836 was L.141,532; namely, spermaceti, L.108,794; train oil, L.32,738.<note

                    Zealand flax (phormium tenax) is another article of export, which is yearly
                    increasing in amount. In its appearance it is similar to English flax, and is
                    chiefly dressed by the native women of New Zealand, who scrape off the outer
                    part of the leaf with mussel-shells; the inner fibres or filaments, resembling
                    dressed flax, arc then exported to Sydney, where it brings from L.15 to L.25 per
                    ton. Timber, particularly cedar-plank, blue gum, and other timber, has been for
                    some time exported. The value amounted in 1836 to L.14,385. Coals, which abound,
                    and are worked in various parts, will prove a valuable staple of the colony; and
                    grain was exported in 1836 to the value of L.9306. The total value of the
                    imports in 1836, according to accounts laid before parliament, was L.991,943; of
                    the exports, L.599,893.</p>
                <p>The shipping has increased along with the commerce, as will appear from the

                <p>Prior to 1817, the currency consisted principally of the private notes of
                    merchants, traders, shopkeepers, publicans, and the amount was sometimes as low
                    as sixpence. In this year the Bank of New South Wales was established, with a
                    capital of L.20,000, whose notes superseded this objectionable currency. In 1825
                    the Bank of Australia was begun, with a capital between L.300,000 and L.400,000,
                    of which L.45,000 is paid up. The Bank of Australasia was established in 1834,
                    with a capital of L.200,000. There is also the Commercial Bank. All these banks
                    have carried on a prosperous business, having paid a dividend from twelve to
                    twenty per cent. The following is the amount of their respective circulation in

                    the Revenue, &amp;c. of the United Kingdom and its Dependencies, p.

                <p>From the preceding account of this prosperous and interesting colony, it will be
                    seen that it has taken root in the country, and that it will progressively and
                    rapidly increase, until the whole island be overspread with a civilized
                    population. At the same time, those who have explored the interior of New South
                    Wales do not bring back a good report of the land. The general testimony is,
                    that the good land is chiefly confined to the banks of rivers; and, with the
                    exception of these, it bears a small proportion to the poor and barren tracts.
                    Many parts are but indifferently watered, and in general water is not abundant;
                    and during the long droughts to which the country is liable, great distress must
                    frequently ensue from this cause. To contend with these disadvantages, which
                    will be the lot of succeeding generations, will require the full exercise of
                    European skill and industry; and still the country, from its nature, will never
                    support a dense population.</p>
                <p>As in all new colonies, there is a scarcity both of labour and capital, and
                    consequently a high rate of wages and profits; which, however inconvenient in
                    some respects, must operate nevertheless as a powerful stimulus to internal
                    improvement. The hire of mechanics is from six to eight shillings per day, and
                    of common labour in proportion. The colony thus presents a decided contrast to
                    the mother country, where the market is overstocked, where the great difficulty
                    is to find employment for labour, and where, from the low rate of wages, the
                    labourer can scarcely maintain himself and his family. The want of labour in New
                    South Wales could be speedily supplied from the overcrowded community of this
                    country, to the great benefit of both; but the expense of the voyage entirely
                    prevents the emigration of the poorer class. In this case, there cannot be a
                    wiser policy than to assist them with the necessary funds, and to this purpose
                    rigidly to apply the sums that are received by government for the sale of lands
                    in the colony. This system has been so far adopted; but the colonists complain
                    that the emigration fund, as it is termed, which amounts to between L.100,000
                    and L.200,000 annually,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It amounted in 1337 to L.120,427. See Account ordered by the House of
                    Commons, 27th August 1839.</p></note> is diverted from this paramount object, to
                    others less important. So essential is an adequate supply of labour to the
                    improvement of the colony, that the whole sum received for the sale of lands,
                    they insist, should be laid out in facilitating emigration. The time however is
                    fast approaching when the internal administration of this country must be
                    committed to a legislative assembly of its own inhabitants. They are the best
                    judges of their own affairs, and have the deepest interest in the public
                    welfare; and it is only by a free constitution that abuses can be corrected, and
                    that the colony can possess any security for the upright and careful management
                    of its concerns.</p>
                <p>Of late years, British colonies have been established on the western coast of New
                    South Wales, at Swan river, and on the southern shore, on the Gulf of St
                    Vincent, at Port Adelaide; and farther west, a new settlement has been begun at
                    Port Philip, opposite to Van Diemen’s Land. It was in 1829 that a number of
                    settlers left England for Swan river, and located themselves on the banks of the
                    Swan and Canning; and by the end of the year, the new residents amounted to 850,
                    and the non-residents to 440. The settlers received grants of land in proportion
                    to the capital which they had to invest; and Mr Peel received 500,000 acres on
                    condition of conveying a certain number of emigrants to the colony. Many
                    difficulties and hardships were at first experienced. The land near the coast
                    was found poor and sandy; but in the interior, fine pastoral and agricultural
                    tracts have been discovered. Thus Western Australia seems to be of the same
                    character as the eastern coast. A border of inferior land, diversified with rich
                    tracts near the principal rivers, is bounded on the east by a range of primitive
                    mountains, rising between 3000 and 4000 feet above the level of the sea, and
                    occasionally showing the bare granite. Beyond these appears a level country,
                    superior to the coast district, without however being anywhere highly
                    productive, but covered with excellent pasture, where stock, and especially
                    sheep, thrive well. The colony which has been established on this western coast,
                    having overcome the first difficulties, now begins to prosper and to increase.
                    Several townships have been established, namely, Freemantle, Perth, and
                    Guildford, on the Swan river, and Augusta at the mouth of the Blackwood. There
                    are several hotels, with excellent accommodations, and the state of society is
                    well spoken of. Sir James Stirling was the founder, and is the governor. The
                    coast abounds in excellent harbours, several of which are much frequented by
                    sealing vessels. The temperature is warm and dry, and the climate salubrious.
                    The governor has an executive and a legislative council to assist and to advise
                    him, and there arc about thirty magistrates in the colony. Several thousand
                    sheep and fine cattle are depastured in different parts. Roads have been formed,
                    and public buildings erected; and a newspaper, first published in manuscript,
                    now issues every week from the press, which is in full operation on the banks of
                    the Swan river. Wool of a superior quality, plaster of Paris, and timber, have
                    been exported to England.</p>
                <p>The coast of South Australia, deeply indented with various inlets and commodious
                    harbours, presents several advantageous situations for a settlement; and
                    accordingly a charter was granted in 1834, to a colony to be established between
                    east longitude 132° and 141°, and 26° of south <pb break="no"

                    />latitude from the Southern Ocean. An adventurous band of emigrants accordingly
                    proceeded to take possession of the country along the shore of St Vincent’s
                    Gulf, where they founded a settlement and town, which they called Port Adelaide.
                    They encountered the usual difficulties of new settlers, but the colony now
                    prospers and increases. The inhabitants in 1839 amounted to between 8000 and
                    9000. In 1837, the land sales, at the rate of twenty shillings peracre, produced
                    L.3300, in 1838 L.37,800, and in 1839 it was estimated that they would amount to
                    between L.50,000 and L.60,000. Between February 1837 and September 1838,
                    twenty-eight vessels arrived, with between 500 and 600 emigrants. The greatest
                    care was taken to obtain a moral and industrious population. Schools are already
                    established, every effort has been made to conciliate the natives, several of
                    their tribes being settled within the colony, and located in fixed habitations,
                    where there is a school, with an interpreter, who is endeavouring to train them
                    to civilized habits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Third Annual Report of the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia,
                    ordered to be printed by the House of Commons 13th April 1839.</p></note> On the
                    30th June 1840, the population of South Australia amounted to 14,000. In
                    Adelaide there were eight churches and meeting-houses, houses built of brick or
                    stone 816, of wood 1588. The wages for carpenters were from 12s. to 15s. per
                    day, masons and bricklayers 12s. to 14s., labourers 6s. to 7s.; men servants
                    L.25 to L.60 per annum, women servants L.12 to L.25. Of the live stock there
                    were, sheep 180,000, bringing prices from 25s. to 40s.; cattle 15,000, L. 12 to
                    L.20; horses 1500, L.30 to L. 150; pigs 3600, L.2 to L.6; goats 400, L.3 to L.6.
                    Of the land selected, there were 1042 acres in the town of Adelaide, 1053 in the
                    port of Adelaide; of rural lands there were 357,880 acres; total number of acres
                    surveyed, 359,975; special surveys of 4000 acres each, 36. The number of ships
                    which arrived in the colony was 104, tonnage 19,399; number of ships from Europe
                    18, now in the harbour 12, tonnage 3059.</p>
                <p>A settlement has more recently been formed at Port Philip, on the southern shore
                    of New Holland, between 144° and 146° east longitude, to which settlers are
                    resorting in great numbers; and the original locations have already greatly
                    advanced in value. The comparative vicinity of this settlement to Sydney, with
                    which there is a land communication, and to Van Diemen’s Land, must give it a
                    preference to Swan River settlement, with which the communication is by a long
                    sea-voyage. Nor can the settlement at Port Adelaide communicate so conveniently
                    with the parent colony. The sea-coast is also indented with deep and extensive
                    inlets, which would afford accommodation, equally capacious and safe, for any
                    number or size of shipping. These natural harbours are on so grand a scale, that
                    the most magnificent works of art appear insignificant in the comparison. <hi
