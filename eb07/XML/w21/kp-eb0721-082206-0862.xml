                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">WEATHER</label>. The term <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> is
                    used, in the popular sense which is commonly attached to the word, to express
                    the general condition of the atmosphere resulting from heat or cold,
                    tranquillity or commotion, dryness or humidity, in all its modifications of
                    visible and invisible vapour, together with the other variable phenomena
                    accompanying the meteorological changes which are exhibited in ceaseless
                    rotation by that great mass of attenuated matter. There being no department of
                    physical inquiry where the desire of knowledge and the gratification of a
                    rational curiosity is so constantly and inseparably connected with our personal
                    comfort, the state of the weather has, in all ages and in every country,
                    occupied a large share of the attention of naturalists, as well as of ordinary
                    observers. It is not a little remarkable, however, that notwithstanding the
                    general interest which the subject is fitted to excite, and the constant
                    attention that has been devoted to it, there is no branch of science in which,
                    with all the advantages of accurate instruments and accumulated observations,
                    there is less of systematic and well-established principles, or more of arrogant
                    and unfounded pretension. This must be ascribed, not so much to the defective
                    state of our knowledge concerning the actual condition of that portion of the
                    atmosphere which is within the immediate sphere of our observation, as to the
                    fact that the causes which contribute to produce changes in the meteorological
                    phenomena which it exhibits in some particular geographical situation,
                    frequently have their origin in regions far beyond the reach of the observer;
                    and hence predictions respecting the state of the weather must be founded more
                    upon conjectures suggested by a cautious induction than upon the indications of
                    instruments which, however well fitted to give precise and accurate information
                    respecting the condition of the surrounding air with regard to pressure,
                    temperature, or humidity, furnish no means of discovering the remote causes by
                    which that condition was produced, or may be afterwards affected and even
                    entirely subverted.</p>
                <p>It may be hoped, however, that the efforts which have been lately made for the
                    erection of magnetic and meteorological observatories in almost every important
                    station of the globe, and the liberal encouragement which has been granted by
                    the various governments of Europe for supplying these establishments with
                    suitable instruments, under the superintendence of skilful observers, will, at
                    no distant period, furnish precise and accurate data for determining the
                    simultaneous condition of the atmosphere over an extensive portion of the
                    surface of the earth, and thus enabling us to ascertain whether the
                    meteorological appearances which distinguish different seasons are altogether of
                    an anomalous character; or, otherwise, to what extent they are, like other
                    physical phenomena, the result of fixed and invariable laws, which, though
                    involved in obscurity as to their mode of action, do not fail, after a certain
                    lapse of time, to display their operation by the periodical revolutions in the
                    weather, to which they give birth.</p>
                <p>Though this country can scarcely claim the honour of having first set the example
                    to other states, of engaging with zeal and alacrity in this great and important
                    undertaking, it must be admitted that the British Association for the
                    Advancement of Science has contributed in no small degree to draw the attention
                    of other learned bodies to the subject, while it has annually devoted a
                    considerable portion of its funds to the investigation of objects which are
                    calculated to throw great light upon the leading principles of meteorology. At
                    the recommendation of that institution, the British government has established
                    magnetic and meteorological observatories at various places in the empire, as
                    well as in the colonies, particularly at Greenwich, Dublin, Plymouth, the Cape
                    of Good Hope, Van Diemen’s Land, Madras, Sincapore, Simla in the Himalaya range,
                    Aden in the Arabian Gulf, and Toronto in Canada. It has also furnished
                    instruments to the observatories established at Breslau in Prussia, at
                    Hammerfest in Norway, as well as to those established at Cairo and at Algiers.
                    The liberal and enlightened views evinced by the British government for the
                    support of these institutions have been followed by corresponding efforts on the
                    part of other civilized states; and accordingly we learn that establishments for
                    similar purposes are now fixed at St Petersburg, Kasan, Catherinehourg,
                    Barnaoul, Nicoaieff, and various other places in the Russian empire, as well as
                    at Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Göttingen, Gotha, Hanover, Heidelberg, Leipzig,
                    Milan, Munich, Philadelphia, Prague, Upsala, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It is only by the co-operation of numerous observers pursuing with regularity and
                    perseverance a system of judicious observations, at stations so remote from each
                    other, that we can obtain, in the first place, an accurate register of the
                    meteorological phenomena which are connected with geographical position, and be
                    afterwards enabled to apply suitable equations to the general laws by which
                    these phenomena are regulated, for the purpose of adapting them to the local
                    peculiarities which distinguish the climates of particular places. Many years
                    may be necessary for the full development of these laws; but already have the
                    magnetic observations recorded at stations separated widely by distance
                    indicated the existence and operation of a diffusive principle, probably of a
                    thermo-electric character, which, exerting its influence in the bowels of the
                    earth, is capable of producing contemporaneous magnetic effects of the most
                    palpable kind at the surface. The relation subsisting between caloric and the
                    distribution of the electric fluid may lead us to expect from these observations
                    new discoveries respecting the mysterious laws which govern the periodical and
                    secular changes of terrestrial temperature that have so long perplexed
                    geologists, and may thus authorize us to anticipate some of the great thermal
                    revolutions to which our globe is from time to time exposed. For further
