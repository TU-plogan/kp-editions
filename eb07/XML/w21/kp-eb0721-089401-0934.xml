                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> history of wines is both curious and amusing; and
                    their topography is not less so, if we may apply this term to the several kinds,
                    to their enumeration, and to that of the countries where they grow, and to the
                    variations followed in their manufacture. This is a subject which would occupy a
                    volume; and we must therefore pass it over, that we may dwell on what is of more
                    moment, the general mode of making this important article, and the several
                    chemical circumstances connected with it. France is the only nation which has
                    bestowed much attention on the philosophy of wine-making, as it is that which
                    excels all others in the variety and the goodness of its produce.</p>
                <p>Vinous liquors, resembling wine, may be made from every fruit, as well as from
                    every vegetable which contains acids united to its extractive matter. The term
                    wine is thus applied to the produce of currants, gooseberries, and many others;
                    while that of cider is especially reserved for the liquor to be obtained from
                    apples. That term would be a fitter one for many of the vinous liquors in
                    question, and we shall here restrict the term <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> ito
                    the produce of the vine.</p>
                <p>All fruits consist of the following principles: water, sugar, a peculiar
                    combination of sugar and extract, called the sweet principle by the French,
                    supertartrite of potash, malat of potash, and malic acid, superoxalate of
                    potash, extractive matter analogous to mucilage, and vegetable gelatin, tannin,
                    a principle of flavour, and a colouring principle. These however are not all
                    found in any one fruit, and they also vary in their proportion in different
                    fruits. The essential ones to the making of wine are the tartarous acid, sugar
                    or the sweet principle, extract, and water; and those which are useful, without
                    being indispensable, are flavour, tannin or astringency, and colour. And it is
                    by possessing these in right proportions that the grape excels all other fruits
                    for the purpose of making wine.</p>
                <p>Tartarous acid, or its combinations, are especially indispensable: and hence it
                    is that the grape, which contains it in large quantity, produces wine; while the
                    apple, and other fruits which contain the malic acid, produce cider. It is
                    essential to the fermentation, as well as to the quality of the produce; and it
                    is decomposed in the process so as to increase the quantity of alcohol, which
                    the sugar would otherwise yield. Where malic acid is also present, the quality
                    of the wine is bad. Sugar must be considered the fundamental element, and as
                    that from which the alcohol is chiefly derived. Thus the most saccharine grapes
                    produce the strongest wine. But it seldom exists in a pure state in the grape,
                    or in any other vegetable. It appears to be most pure in the sugar-cane; hut
                    even there it is combined with the extractive matter, and also with some acid,
                    forming the sweet principle of the French. Pure sugar does not ferment in water,
                    it crystallizes; and whenever fermentation occurs, some other vegetable matter
                    is present. When sugar, again, has crystallized from a solution of the sweet
                    principle, what remains runs still more readily into fermentation. In the
                    produce of the cane, this is molasses. It is very important to keep this
                    distinction in view, because the fabrication of sweet wines depends materially
                    upon it. It explains many circumstances in the process of fermentation, and some
                    that are often overlooked. It explains, among other things, why wine ferments in
                    a cask when it will not ferment in bottles; because the sugar derives the
                    necessary extractive matter from the wood. The chemical nature of the extractive
                    matter is not known, but it is supposed to contain azote, as this is the produce
                    of fermentation. Yeast, or leaven, contains the extractive principle in great
                    abundance, and hence its power in inducing fermentation in a solution of pure
                    sugar. All vegetables contain it; and it is most abundant in those juices which
                    gelatinate in boiling. It is found in the grape, and it is thus the natural
                    leaven of wine, whether existing in a separate state, or united to sugar in the
                    form of the sweet principle. Water is a much more essential ingredient than
                    would at first be suspected. If over-abundant, it is difficult to prevent the
                    produce from running to the acetous stage. Hence weak wines become sour. If
                    deficient, it is difficult to establish the fermentation; and hence sweet wines.
                    Thus also sweet wines are insured by drying the grapes, or evaporating their
                    juice, both common practices in the wine countries. Colour must be looked on in
                    the light of an ornament, and is found in the husk of the grape. So is the
                    tannin principle, which occasions astringency in Port wine. Of the principle of
                    flavour chemistry knows nothing; it seems often the produce of fermentation, as
                    in Claret and Burgundy wines: in those of Frontignan and Muscat it is the
                    natural flavour of the fruit.</p>
                <p>When the process is complete, the wine is dry, or contains no sugar, so that
                    sweet wines, which are compounds of wine and sugar, are the produce of an
                    incomplete fermentation. When all the elements above described are in due
                    proportion, the product is perfect, a dry wine; and the elements that require
                    particularly to be balanced for this result are the extract or leaven, and the
                    sugar. If the former is in excess, the wine tends to vinegar, unless means are
                    used to stop the fermentation by abstracting the leaven; if in defect, the
                    product is imperfect, a sweet wine. Hence the perfection and management of the
                    leaven are among the most important circumstances in the manufacture. It is
                    coagulable partially by heat; and hence also it is, as well as by evaporating
                    the water, that boiled <hi rend="italic">must</hi> produces sweet wine. It is
                    also abstracted by precipitation, and by the action of sulphurous acids; whence
                    other processes in use in wine-making.</p>
                <p>In fermentation, the superfluous extract or leaven is separated in two forms,
                    that of yeast and lees; and these will excite that process in fresh solutions of
                    sugar, or renew it, or continue it, in the mixture whence it was separated;
                    whence racking and fining. There is however one important difference between the
                    natural or original, and this artificial or secondary leaven. The latter is
                    soluble in hot water, and not in cold; and hence it is separated in
                    fermentation. By restoring this separated matter to wine in the course of
                    fabrication, the fermenting process is prolonged, or the wine rendered drier; by
                    skimming, and fining, and racking, the process is checked; and hence the
                    application of these practices to sweet wines. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >rolling</hi> of wine, or returning on its lees to <hi rend="italic">feed,</hi>
                    is hence understood; and hence also the improvement which certain wines
                    experience in long voyages. But the same principle and process which improves
                    Madeira destroys Burgundy, and the reason must now be obvious. The theory of
                    racking, fining, and sulphuring, is hence also apparent; and, of the sulphurous
                    acid, it is a property to combine with the leaven, and form an insoluble
                    separable compound. It is thus that it checks fermentation. Hence also it is
                    that sweet wines do not turn sour: their leaven has been expended. Thus also we
                    may see that the process of fermentation is not an unmanageable and a precarious
                    one; but that the essential ingredients are in our power, and that we can modify
                    them to the desired result. If it has been stopped prematurely, it may be
                    renewed by fresh leaven; if in ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=935" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0935-0895"
                    />cess, it may be checked or suspended. And thus it is, too, that dry wines, and
                    fined wines, and wines in bottles, are durable, when they would perish in the
                    cask.</p>
                <p>The acid was shown to be also essential to the produce of wine. Mere extract, or
                    leaven, and sugar, produce beer, not wine. Tartarous acid cannot well be in
                    excess in that compound in which it exists, viz. the supertartrite of potash;
                    because it is a salt of difficult solution, and the superfluity is precipitated;
                    hence the tartar of wine-casks; hence also the crystals which are seen, in cold
                    weather, to float in Madeira wine. We noticed that it was decomposed in the
                    fermentation, and was thought to contribute to the quantity of alcohol. The
                    French chemists also assert that a part of it is converted into the malic; hence
                    the peculiar properties of some wines; hence also the practice of liming the
                    vats, or of sprinkling the grapes with lime in the manufacture of Sherry wines,
                    whence they acquire that peculiar dry and hard taste which distinguishes them
                    from the wines of Madeira. As the tartarous salt adds to the fermenting power of
                    the fluid, hence we explain the facility with which the juice of green grapes
                    runs into fermentation when compared with ripe ones; the immature fruit
                    containing a much larger proportion of this salt than the mature. Thus also
                    those wines continue to ferment longer, or to retain the power of fermenting;
                    and hence the vivacity of Champagne wines, the most effervescent kinds of which
                    are made from half-ripened fruit.</p>
                <p>The temperature of 54° Fahrenheit is considered the most favourable to this
                    process. In extreme heat it fails, as in extreme cold. Hence the difficulty of
                    making wine in India and the West Indian islands. Hence also, in the temperate
                    climates, we have it in our power to regulate fermentation by the use of heat or
                    of cold. Hence also it is that wines which had ceased to ferment, recommence in
                    spring; and hence one of the processes essential to the manufactures of
                    Champagne wines, namely, that of watching the spring fermentation, and bottling
                    the wines in this stage.</p>
                <p>Air is necessary to fermentation, rather than essential. The operation does not
                    cease in closed vessels, but is retarded. Air is not absorbed in the vinous
                    fermentation, although its oxygen is in the acetous. The wine is stronger in
                    close vessels if the process is slower, because a portion of the alcohol escapes
                    from the vats; and this is now understood in our malt distilleries. That alcohol
                    is held in solution in the carbonic acid which is generated, and thus it appears
                    to intoxicate more rapidly; as is well known in Champagne wines. Under pressure,
                    this compound is united to the fluid; and being disengaged, produces the
                    well-known effervescence. The practice of fermentation is partly regulated by
                    this consideration. The violent stage of that process in wine-making is allowed
                    to take place in an open vat, the next is partially checked by an occasional
                    bung, and in the last of all the vessel is completely closed. In strong still
                    wines, the whole process may be conducted in open vessels; but in light and
                    brisk ones, it is absolutely necessary that the last part should take place in
                    closed ones. Champagne wines are managed so as to ferment even in their
                    bottles.</p>
                <p>The volume of the fermenting fluid has a considerable effect on the process; a
                    few days are sufficient to complete it when the quantity is large. When small,
                    it is difficult to establish, and tedious in the progress, and the results are
                    also different; wines of different qualities being thus produced from the very
                    same materials. It is the same in the ultimate fermentation or ripening of
                    wines. Champagne would be destroyed in a large cask: porter, an extreme case, is
                    ripened in enormous quantities, as are many of the stronger wines. Bulk is
                    peculiarly required for the strong and sweet wines; Champagne may be made in a
                    gallon measure.</p>
                <p>The first appearance is the production of air-bubbles, terminating at length in a
                    general ebullition. The liquor then becomes turbid, a variety of solid matters
                    are disengaged, some falling to the bottom, and others rising to the top of the
                    fluid. The leaven before mentioned is thus separated among other matters, while
                    the bulk of the fluid is materially increased. It is in this stage that we have
                    the power of regulating the extent of the fermentation, by separating the
                    floating leaven, or allowing it to return into the liquor. Hence the process of
                    fermenting in a full cask ejecting that substance by the bung-hole.</p>
                <p>The disengaged gas is chiefly carbonic acid; but holding, as first remarked, some
                    alcohol in solution. It appears by analysis that this is the produce of part of
                    the carbon of the sugar and of its oxygen; and this is the great change which
                    leads to the production of the alcohol. But it also contains some obscure
                    vegetable matter in suspension; because, if passed through water, it not only
                    converts it into vinegar, but deposits that mucilage which in vinegar is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">mother.</hi> It is possible, however, that this may itself
                    be a new compound; and it is one which, in certain cases, contains azote. That
                    substance, which exists in yeast, has also been found in the disengaged gas,
                    partly, it is said, in the form of ammonia; and hence, possibly, a nauseous
                    ammoniacal taste, well known in bad wines, and very remarkable in those of the
                    Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>The generation of heat is one of the most remarkable phenomena in fermentation,
                    and it bears a proportion to the bulk of the fluid. It is sometimes so great as
                    to render it necessary to reduce it by art; its cause is obscure. The colour of
                    wines is also produced during the fermentation; the red appears to be a
                    substance analogous to resin, soluble in alcohol; and thus its production is
                    accounted for. Hence white wines may be made from red grapes, by excluding the
                    husks; hence also red wines are often astringent, because the tannin also lies
                    in the husk. Thus also, in Champagne wines, the red are generally inferior,
                    because the species of fermentation required to extract the colour dissipates
                    part of the flavour.</p>
                <p>The formation of alcohol is the last and the essential phenomenon; and it is now
                    plain how this must depend on the quantity of sugar, on the goodness of the
                    fruit, on the due apportioning of the leaven, and on the management of the
                    process.</p>
                <p>Thus, when all the necessary circumstances are present, the process goes on till
                    the produce is pure wine, or a compound of alcohol, water, acid, colour,
                    vegetable extract, and sugar. For although the two latter are said to be
                    destroyed, there is almost always a minute portion of both remaining; the former
                    rendered very sensible, in some wines, by the skinny matter which it deposits on
                    the sides of the bottles. In a similar manner it happens that a portion of sugar
                    continues attached to the wine for a long time, though it is not always sensible
                    except to a fine taste. Thus it is perceptible in Claret, and even in Madeira,
                    which are among the driest of our wines. It is often very sensible in Fort, and
                    when in excess is commonly the mark of a bad wine. In the first stages of the
                    fermentation the sugar is never thoroughly decomposed. If that were the case,
                    indeed, the process would stop, or it would proceed to vinegar. Further
                    fermentation, that slower species which takes place in the casks, tends further
                    to diminish it; but still a portion remains, even when it has been bottled.</p>
                <p>It is the gradual conversion of this sugar, the chief operation that goes on in
                    bottled wines, which is the cause of the change which these undergo. This
                    process often requires many years for its completion: that is the case in the
                    Clarets of Chateau Margaux, and other Bordeaux wines; and the same process
                    indeed takes place to a greater or less degree in Madeira and the other strong
                    wines. In these cases it is a cause of improvement, the wine becoming <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0936-0896"/> more perfect under this last tedious
                    fermentation; in others however it is mischievous, and hence the destruction of
                    many wines. Thus Champagne is destroyed, and often very quickly: thus Burgundy
                    also is easily ruined; and thus even our Port is not a very durable wine, though
                    the destruction is here accelerated by the intermixture of brandy used in this
                    particular manufacture. Age, which thus meliorates one wine, destroys another,
                    independently of that loss of flavour which occurs in some of the more delicate,
                    though this also is the result of the slow fermentation under review. In the
                    sweet wines the same process tends constantly to diminish that sweetness; and
                    hence the comparatively dry qualities of ancient Malmsey and of Paxaret under
                    the same circumstances. In this class of wines also the flavour is injured by
                    the same process, or by age; and hence, though age may confer merit as well as
                    honour on Malmsey and Malaga, and generally on the sweet Spanish and Greek
                    wines, which have little flavour, by diminishing their lusciousness, it destroys
                    or injures the highly perfumed wines of Frontignan, which can scarcely be drunk
                    too new.</p>
                <p>By the same considerations we can account for the benefit which Madeira wines
                    receive in a hot climate, or in a hot cellar. The effect of the heat, and, in
                    the case of a sea-voyage, united to the agitation, whose action was considered
                    before, is that of accelerating the imperceptible fermentation, and thus
                    ripening the wine sooner than would have happened in a low temperature and at
                    rest. But it is a mistake to imagine that this is peculiar to Madeira, or that
                    it is the only wine which can be benefited by this treatment. It is the same for
                    all the Spanish wines, for Sherry and for Port; and it is also true of the
                    better and safer wines of France, of those of Hermitage and the Bordelais.
                    Claret becomes drinkable in a much shorter time in a warm than in a cold cellar;
                    and that is equally true of many more of these wines. But that which some will
                    bear, others will not; and thus many of the wines of France, so far from
                    admitting a high temperature, can scarcely be preserved even in a low one. As to
                    Port, it is a useful piece of knowledge to be aware that it may speedily be
                    rendered aged by heat. And in this case it deposits its colour, and assumes the
                    marks of old wine to the eye as well as to the palate. One year will thus do
                    that for Port which might have required five or six; but the period of its
                    entire duration is consequently shortened, as might be expected. The effect of
                    heat is indeed such in this case as is suspected by few. In America it is a
                    well-known practice to boil Madeira, or to heat it to the boiling temperature;
                    and the effect is that of rendering it good and old wine, when previously harsh
                    and new. The same practice is applicable to Port. If newly-bottled wine be
                    exposed to the sun, it begins shortly to deposit, and improves in flavour; and
                    even the rawest wine of this kind may, by heating it in hot water, be caused, in
                    the course of a day, to assume the quality which it would have had after many
                    years of keeping. It is so far from being injurious, as might be imagined, that
                    it is a valuable secret; and, as we believe, one that is but little known to
                    those whose interest it is to give the complexion of old wine to new, and who
                    generally effect this purpose in a fraudulent manner, by putting it into foul
                    and crusted bottles.</p>
                <p>It is important, in another view, to consider the effects which follow from a
                    portion of undecomposed sugar remaining in wine. It is supposed to be a means
                    and a test of the security of wine; and the French chemists assert, that as long
                    as any portion remains undecomposed, such wine cannot run into the acetous
                    fermentation. This appears true only in a limited sense. In Hock, it would seem
                    as if every atom of sugar had vanished, and yet the durability of that wine
                    appears to be endless. If that is not absolutely the case in Claret and Madeira,
                    still these are very durable wines; the most so, after Hock, at least of the dry
                    class. None of these, when of a good quality, ever runs into the acetous
                    fermentation. Perhaps this may depend on some peculiar balance of principles,
                    which chemistry has not yet found the means of discovering; for, in other cases,
                    it is certain that the chemists in question are under an error, and that the
                    acetous fermentation will come on though sugar should still be present. This
                    happens in many of the French wines of the lighter kinds. If, in the sweet wines
                    from the grape, that effect does not take place, it is very certain that it
                    happens in the wines made in this country in imitation of them from various
                    substances. In these cases even sweet wines are found to be occasionally <hi
                    rend="italic">pricked,</hi> as the technical term is, or vinegar and sugar are
                    co-existent in the fluid at the same time. Nor are even all the foreign sweet
                    wines of the grape exempt from this disease; as must be well known to those who
                    have an extensive knowledge of wines, or of the wine market.</p>
                <p>There is reason to believe, that the cause of this must be sought as a
                    circumstance which these chemists seem to have overlooked. If the balance of
                    principles in a sweet wine has been perfect, and the process of fermentation has
                    also been complete, and if, in addition to this, these wines have been so
                    carefully racked and fined that no lee or leaven remains in them, they may be
                    safe, because there is nothing left in them to re-excite a fermentation, or to
                    bring on the acetous stage. But if that is not the case, if any impurity, any
                    leaven in any form remain, the sweetness offers no security against the change
                    into vinegar, or at least against the partial change which constitutes a <hi
                    rend="italic">pricked</hi> wine. The acetous fermentation may commence, and
                    proceed as far as the circumstances allow; and thus vinegar and sweet wine may
                    exist together in the fluid. The nature of the acetous fermentation is indeed
                    very ill understood, as little as that of the vinous; and we are at present
                    incompetent to reason much about it. It is a common opinion that it must be
                    preceded by the vinous; yet this does not appear to be true. Certain mixtures of
                    sugar, leaven, and water, will immediately tend to vinegar, without our being
                    able to detect a previous vinous stage; and this seems always the case when the
                    solution is very weak, or the water in large quantity, provided, of course,
                    there be access of air. It is indeed unquestionable, that in the common process
                    of making vinegar, the acetous fermentation is going on in a saccharine fluid,
                    so that the mixed taste of vinegar and sugar is perceptible until that process
                    is completed. Vinegar can also be produced by passing alcoholized carbonic acid
                    through water, another obscure operation; and in the human stomach it is
                    produced in a very few minutes, when we can scarcely imagine that any previous
                    vinous stage can have taken place.</p>
                <p>When all the favourable circumstances above stated are present, the fermentation
                    begins, and passes through its regular stages, till there is produced wine,
                    perfect and dry if the sugar has been thoroughly and accurately proportioned to
                    the other ingredients; sweet if it has been in excess; and acid, as in Hock,
                    when this substance has been in undue proportion to the other ingredients. The
                    unfavourable circumstances must be sought in the temperature, or in the quality
                    of the fluid. The juice of the grape rarely labours under any defect but the
                    want of sugar, arising from a bad variety of this fruit, from a bad season, or
                    from imperfect ripening. In the latter case, however, there may be added to
                    defect of sugar or excess of water, an excess of acid and an excess of
                    extractive matter.</p>
                <p>In the wine-countries, the defect of sugar is remedied by different expedients.
                    In some, sugar or honey is added to the juice or must; in others, a portion of
                    the juice is evaporated and added to the rest; and sometimes all the juice is
                    boiled before it is submitted to fermentation. These seem to have been the <hi
                    rend="italic">vina cocta</hi> of the ancients, which, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=937" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0937-0897"
                    />from other circumstances, we know to have been thick and sweet wines,
                    requiring dilution. They could not have been boiled to any consistence after
                    they had become wine, without losing all their properties; and as to wines that
                    were to be cut by a knife, it is plain that we must have misapprehended the
                    meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">vinum</hi> in this case, as no wine could
                    exist under such a form. To gain the same ends, it is a practice in many
                    countries to dry the grapes partially, by suffering them to remain on the vine;
                    but this is chiefly resorted to for sweet wines, as in the case of Cyprus,
                    Tokay, Lipari, and others. The other expedient for increasing the properties of
                    sugar in the juice is by plaster of Paris or gypsum, not an uncommon ingredient;
                    and this effect, as well as that of absorbing and destroying superfluous acid,
                    is also partially attained by the use of lime.</p>
                <p>The management of the fermentation, supposing the fluid to be perfect, is
                    regulated by the intended nature of the wine. If sweet wine is desired, not only
                    must the proportion of the water be diminished by one or other of the means
                    above mentioned, if necessary, but the proportion of extractive matter or leaven
                    must be reduced, to prevent it from running to the ultimate stage, and producing
                    a dry and strong wine. In this case the yeast is separated as fast as it rises,
                    by mechanical means; as by fermenting in full casks in such a manner that it may
                    be continuously ejected at the bung-hole as fast as it is formed. Should the
                    reverse be desired, or a dry wine be the manufacturer’s object, the yeast is
                    suffered to remain on the surface in the vat, that it may be continually
                    returned into the liquor by the internal agitation; or else it is stirred, or
                    rolled in a cask or in the vat, so as to protract the fermentation. Lastly, if
                    the wine is to be brisk, to retain carbonic acid, as in the wines of Champagne,
                    not only must the proportions of water and leaven be increased, but the
                    fermentation must be conducted in vessels partially closed, and these also must
                    be fully closed before the fermentation is completed. The management of the
                    temperature is easily deduced from the principles already laid down. A
                    deficiency of heat is easily remedied by artificial means, by a fire, or by
                    exposure to the sun; and this is sometimes done by heating a portion of the
                    fluid, and then mixing it with the mass. An equal temperature in the vat is also
                    procured by agitation; and when it is necessary carefully to maintain a mean
                    heat, this is frequently done in the wine-countries by surrounding it with straw
                    or other bad conductors, or by other obvious artifices.</p>
                <p>On apparently minute attentions of this nature, far more depends than would, on a
                    superficial view, be imagined; and the great superiority of the wines of France
                    above those of Spain, Italy, and Greece, often depends much more on delicacies
                    of this nature than on any difference in the quality of the grape. In
                    wine-making, indeed, more seems often to depend on art than on nature; and it is
                    both to the praise and advantage of the French, that, by these minute
                    attentions, they have contrived to excel all Europe in this art. Italy, Spain,
                    and Greece, with better climates, and every natural advantage, are thus the
                    manufacturers of a thousand detestable wines, which, in the hands of Frenchmen,
                    might rival the produce of that country. The recent improvements made in the
                    Sicilian wines in new hands, are a proof how much depends on these attentions;
                    and those who have drunk the nauseous, putrid, acid, and disgusting common wines
                    of Italy and Spain, where nothing is wanting but management and care, will know
                    how to appreciate the value of these.</p>
                <p>In conducting the fermentation, some other considerations are necessary, on which
                    some remarks are also required. The first of these is the flavour. That
                    evanescent and delicate property, the <hi rend="italic">bouquet,</hi> as it is
                    called, depends on attentions no less minute. The flavour is very apt to be
                    dissipated by a violent or a long fermentation, or by an open one; and hence,
                    for the finer wines, great care is required through every stage of that process
                    It is the same for the brisker wines; as, if this be neglected, this volatile
                    substance, on which their peculiar property depends, may be irrecoverably
                    dissipated. A consideration of the general divisions of the quality of wines
                    will render these remarks more intelligible.</p>
                <p>They may be divided into four classes; the sweet and strong; the dry and strong;
                    the delicate and light, which are generally weak compared to the former; and the
                    effervescent or brisk. Malmsey, Tokay, Frontignan, are examples of the first;
                    and the second are peculiarly familiar to Britain. Hermitage holds an
                    intermediate rank, as does Claret, between these and the third class; of which
                    the lighter Burgundy wines, the white wines of Greece, and those of the Rhine
                    and the Moselle, may be considered pure examples; and, of the last, Champagne is
                    almost the only one that deserves to be named.</p>
                <p>If therefore the intention is to make either a strong sweet wine or a strong dry
                    one, the fermentation is commenced in an open vat. But in the former case it is
                    not suffered to remain there long as it is in the latter. For the driest wines,
                    or for those which are manufactured for distillation, the fermentation is
                    allowed to expend itself in the vat, and the wine is not tunned till it is made;
                    the completion of the process merely, or the final solar fermentation, being
                    reserved for the cask. In the sweet wines, on the contrary, it is soon removed
                    from the vat to the casks, that it may be more in the operator’s power to
                    suspend the process, and thus to prevent the annihilation, or total conversion,
                    of the saccharine matter. In the third class, again, in the highly flavoured
                    wines, of which Burgundy may be selected as an example, the fluid is only
                    suffered to remain a few hours in the vat; from six perhaps to twenty, that
                    period varying according to the state of the temperature, the particular quality
                    of the juice as to goodness or strength, and the other views of the
                    manufacturer. This is done to prevent the dissipation of the flavour, which
                    would be injured, if not destroyed, by an open fermentation. The same practice
                    is followed for the wines of Champagne, though there is little flavour to
                    preserve; the purpose being in this case to secure the power of checking the
                    fermentation by pressure, so as to retain the wine in a low stage of this
                    process, and thus to secure a supply of mixed or combined carbonic acid at the
                    period of use or drinking.</p>
                <p>There is nothing which more strongly distinguishes the bad or inferior wines of
                    Spain and Italy from those of France, even from those which, from their
                    cheapness, must be considered as belonging to the same class, than the various
                    disgusting flavours which they commonly present. Wines may have bad qualities
                    from other causes,—from the nature of the soil or the grape; but there is far
                    less difference in this fruit in different countries than there is in the care
                    bestowed on the manufacture. To use a short and intelligible term, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">filth</hi> which is the cause of the bad quality of these wines;
                    filth and neglect in every stage of the process, from the gathering to the
                    pressing, the fermentation, and the tunning. In the fermentation, no precaution
                    too great can be used to have all the vessels clean, and entirely free from
                    every odour. There is no substance more delicate than wine, nor any one which is
                    so easily contaminated and destroyed by bad flavours, even in the minutest
                    quantity.</p>
                <p>The same rules apply to the casks as to the vats. New casks communicate the
                    well-known flavour of oak, often found in wines, and that, fortunately, is so
                    agreeable that it is often given designedly by means of oak shavings. But in the
                    finer wines, where it would be injurious, it is extracted from the wood by
                    washing, and by hot water and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=938" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0938-0898"/>by
                    salt. The more destructive evil of musty vats or casks, so often a cause of the
                    nauseous flavour of the common wines above mentioned, is remedied by scraping,
                    by washing with boiling water, and most effectually by firing or charring the
                    insides; while staves which are deeply injured are replaced by new ones. Hot
                    lime and water are also used for the same purposes.</p>
                <p>Another precaution is that of removing all the insoluble matter, of whatever
                    nature, during every stage of the process; and from this neglect it is also that
                    the great mass of bad wines is produced in those countries where this art is
                    neglected. Thus the seeds are always to be removed as fast as they rise to the
                    surface, as they both render the wine harsh and communicate a bad flavour. The
                    same is done with the husks when they have performed their duty in giving out
                    their colour. It is most peculiarly necessary to be watchful over these, lest
                    they should become moulded or musty; whence often arises that taste which
                    resembles that of what is called <hi rend="italic">corked</hi> wine; a disease
                    also arising from a bad cask, and often attributed wrongfully to careless
                    bottling. In the finer wines, a single musty seed or husk will ruin a whole tun.
                    In transferring the wine from the vat to the cask, or from one cask to another,
                    whether by drawing ofl' or pumping, care must be taken not to disturb the
                    sediment, and more especially still, to separate any of the scum which may be on
                    the surface, as this is always in danger of becoming musty, more particularly
                    where it is most injurious, that is, in the lighter and finer wines.</p>
                <p>When the quantity of the fermented fluid is considerable, the remaining wine,
                    which adheres to the solid matter, is separated by the press, and made into wine
                    of an inferior quality, either for use or distillation. That refuse is also
                    subjected to distillation with water in some cases; sometimes, by means of
                    water, it is converted into vinegar, or used for the manufacture of white-lead
                    or of verdegris; or, lastly, formed into cakes with the other refuse of the
                    first pressing of the grapes, and used for feeding cattle.</p>
                <p>If, after the wine is made and tunned, it were suffered to go on fermenting, it
                    would in many cases be destroyed. This, it has already been seen, does not
                    easily happen in the sweet wines, where a large portion of the saccharine matter
                    remains unchanged, though even these are not absolutely exempt. Nor does it very
                    easily happen in the stronger dry wines. Yet it does happen to all, and is
                    almost inevitable in the light still wines, and in the brisk ones, whatever the
                    strength or sweetness of the latter may be. Champagne would quickly become
                    vapid, Burgundy would become stale and sour, and Claret would become vinegar.
                    For though the natural progress is supposed to be from the vinous to the acetous
                    stage of fermentation, there are phenomena in practice which show us that we are
                    yet imperfectly acquainted with the exact nature and varieties of fermentation.
                    Champagne, for example, becomes mucilaginous and flat; while, though Burgundy
                    becomes acid, it is scarcely possible to make it pass to the exact state of
                    vinegar.</p>
                <p>Yet the tendency to the acetous stage must be considered as general, for want of
                    a better expression; and on this view the management after the great
                    fermentation is regulated. If it is suspected that even intended sweet wine has
                    been overwrought, boiled must or sugar is added to it, and thus, in the tedious
                    fermentation of the cask, it is secured or restored. But it must be remarked,
                    that if the acetous stage should have commenced, that addition would only serve
                    to accelerate and determine it. The remainder of the general management consists
                    in regulating the fermentation of the cask by the general principles before laid
                    down; that is, if the wine is incomplete, it is not suffered to rise to the
                    bung-hole, so that the new leaven which is disengaged may fall back again and
                    protract the fermentation, while this is also aided by heat, by stirring up the
                    lees, and by agitation. If the reverse be the case, and it is necessary to check
                    the secondary fermentation, then a cool temperature and rest are adopted; while,
                    as fast as the wine wastes, it is kept close to the bung by fresh additions,
                    that so the disengaged leaven may escape. Some of the other requisites to the
                    completion of wine will fall better into another section of this little essay;
                    but the process of sulphuring belongs to the second stage of management, as well
                    as to the final operations of the manufacture.</p>
                <p>However vulgar and mechanical the process of sulphuring may appear, it is a
                    refined chemical operation, the practice of which was long known before the
                    theory, however discovered, and the theory of which, in a scientific and rigid
                    view, is not very well understood even now. It has been already shewn, that the
                    process of fermentation has a perpetual tendency to continue as long as all the
                    requisites are present, and more particularly as long as there is present that
                    peculiar and obscure substance, the extractive matter or leaven, on which it
                    mainly depends. If this substance has been entirely separated in the two forms
                    of yeast and lee, the process terminates naturally, the produce being dry or
                    sweet, according to other circumstances now understood; but if any portion of
                    leaven remains in the liquor, then the acetous or some similar stage may come
                    on, and the wine will be destroyed.</p>
                <p>The processes of racking and mechanical separation just described, are all
                    intended to separate this matter; and whenever the wine remains turbid, it is
                    always in danger, because the fermentation may at any time be renewed. But these
                    operations are often insufficient to disengage all the leaven or lee, as much of
                    it not only continues mixed, so as to produce the turbid state, but the
                    extractive matter itself, which has not been brought to this insoluble form,
                    remains combined with the fluid.</p>
                <p>The merely turbid state is remedied by the process called fining, which
                    precipitates all the insoluble or disengaged lee and leaven that will neither
                    subside nor rise; thus removing one part of the hazard, besides communicating
                    that brightness and beauty which is demanded in all wines. That brightness,
                    therefore, is more than a beauty, since without it there is no security, at
                    least in the finer and lighter wines. Various substances are used for this
                    purpose, and the action of many of them is very obscure. They are either
                    chemical or mechanical. The mechanical substances are sand and gypsum, both of
                    which have the property of precipitating the insoluble matter, while the latter
                    also absorbs water. Beechwood chips are sometimes used for the same purpose; but
                    the mode in which these act is not known. But the matters chiefly in use are
                    chemical ones, gluten and albumen. Of the latter, eggs and milk are both used,
                    but the former are preferred. Of gluten, isinglass alone is used; for, from some
                    causes hitherto undiscovered, the gluten of terrestrial animals, or common glue,
                    does not produce this effect to the same extent that it is obtained by the glue
                    of fishes. It is also usual to adopt albumen for the white wines, and gluten for
                    the red, as the former is found to precipitate much of the colour from these
                    last. The proportion used is very small, an ounce of isinglass being sufficient
                    for a hundred gallons. To these chemical matters we might have added starch,
                    gum, rice, and blood; but they are very little used. The action of the albumen
                    appears more mechanical than chemical; becoming coagulated, and then entangling
                    the dust, if it may so be called, which is suspended in the fluid, in the same
                    manner as it would purify muddy water. In the case of the gluten, however, a new
                    chemical combination is formed with the tannin of the wine; and the produce is
                    that well-known substance resembling bird-lime, which is the basis of leather.
                    Hence, also, fining diminishes the astringency of red wines.</p>
                <p>Presuming that one of these substances has been introduced<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=939" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0939-0899"/>.
                    the fluid is strongly agitated, and suffered to repose till clear, when it is
                    again racked into a fresh cask. It is found very important to select for this
                    purpose dry cold weather, and, as is particularly remarked, north-east winds.
                    From some mysterious cause, in close weather, and fogs, and southerly winds, the
                    precipitated matters rise again, and defeat the objects of the operation. The
                    other precautions are those of using a syphon instead of a cock, as affording
                    greater security; or, what is now used in all the best French manufactories,
                    blowing off. This is performed by a condensing engine, as in the drawing of
                    porter, and thus access of air is prevented. This is very important where
                    fine-flavoured wines are concerned, as it is in brisk wines; because the
                    carbonic acid which would be lost, carrying away also a portion of the alcohol
                    or strength of the wine, is thus preserved.</p>
                <p>But the leaven held in solution cannot be separated in this manner, and for that
                    purpose recourse is had to the process of sulphuring. The most common and the
                    simplest practice in this case, is to fill the proposed cask into which the wine
                    is to be racked, with sulphurous gas, by burning matches in it till full. The
                    wine being then introduced, becomes turbid, and, after the necessary time, it is
                    found as before. Should the fermentation still be renewed or dreaded, this
                    operation is repeated as often as it may be necessary. If, as in the case of
                    some of the Bordeaux wines, the quantity of leaven in the wine is so great that
                    it cannot be overcome in this manner, the combustion of the sulphur within the
                    cask is repeated at intervals during the process of filling it. But it is also a
                    practice in that country to impregnate with sulphurous acid a quantity of wine,
                    and this substance or mixed fluid, called <hi rend="italic">Muet,</hi> is
                    reserved for adding to those which may require it, by which means the efficacy
                    of the operation is better insured.</p>
                <p>The theory of this practice seems to a certain extent simple. The sulphurous
                    acid, or possibly its oxygen, unites to the extractive matter, or the soluble
                    leaven, and renders it insoluble, as happens in the act of fermentation itself;
                    and thus it becomes capable of being separated by the mechanical processes of
                    racking and fining. It is for this reason also that sulphuring is largely used
                    for the sweet wanes, to insure their preservation in that state. It has been
                    said that manganese, and other substances containing much oxygen, will produce
                    the same effect; but the cheapness and simplicity of the common process renders
                    other expedients unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Supposing wines of any class to have been thus obtained, there is yet much more
                    to be done before they become the wines which we know in our market. The
                    processes in use for making marketable wines are badly distinguished by the term
                    medication, as they are of various natures. There is indeed a great deal of wine
                    which can scarcely be considered as strictly natural, though it is a common
                    prejudice that all wines are so, except when fraudulently mended, or altered, or
                    mixed. It is difficult to draw the line between what may be considered fraud,
                    and what is legitimate; and certainly by those who expect that all wine is to be
                    what it is commonly thought, the mere produce of the grape, and of one process
                    on one grape, every subsequent process may be esteemed a fraud. We must here
                    limit ourselves to some of the most important operations, as the whole would
                    lead into a very long detail.</p>
                <p>The simplest process is that of mixing different wines together, whether of the
                    same quality or country, or of different ones. In either case this practice may
                    sometimes be considered fraudulent, and in the latter especially so. But in a
                    degree it is inseparable from the nature of the manufacture, and the mode in
                    which it is conducted. The larger maker, or the capitalist on the spot, buying
                    in small lots from the petty manufacturers, is obliged to adopt this practice,
                    partly to insure a certain quality, and partly for the purpose of remedying
                    those that are defective, by the addition of better ones.</p>
                <p>The mode of performing this operation, which requires great experience and
                    judgment, is to select, first, that period of the year in which the wines show a
                    disposition to renew their fermentation, which is in the spring. They are then
                    said, in English, to bear the <hi rend="italic">fret;</hi> and hence the
                    operation is called fretting-in. It is only thus that a new and <hi
                    rend="italic">fine</hi> wine can be produced. The operation of mixing different
                    wines in all cases disturbs both, so that they become foul. They also tend to
                    ferment again, till a new balance of all their principles is produced; and thus
                    it is expedient to accelerate and determine this fermentation, so as to form a
                    proper compound, without which the new wine would be perishable. After this,
                    also, it becomes necessary once more to have recourse to sulphuring, fining, and
                    racking; and not till all this has been gone through is the wine completed. In
                    the Bordeaux practice of mixing Clarets, the muet or sulphured wine is sometimes
                    added at the same time, where the wines being of very discordant qualities, a
                    dangerous fermentation might be excited.</p>
                <p>In the wine-countries it is usual to cultivate particular grapes or wines, rough,
                    or coloured, or astringent, or high flavoured, for the mere purpose of mixing
                    with others; so far is this art from being so simple as is commonly imagined. It
                    is a frequent practice to import the wines of one country to mix with those of
                    another, and thus to suit the taste of purchasers, or obtain other ends. This
                    practice is pursued even by the importers into Britain, and, as we need not say,
                    opens a door to endless frauds, while it may also be innocent. Thus, in this
                    country, as well as in Portugal, the wines of Spain, Alicant, Barcelona, and so
                    forth, are mixed with Port wines; as are the cheaper Clarets of the south of
                    France, and some other of the strong-flavoured wines of that country. In a
                    similar manner, the wines of Fayal and the Canaries are manufactured into
                    Madeira, as are those of Sicily; and thus, too, Sherry is largely compounded out
                    of many of the wines of Spain and Portugal, and of the islands of the African
                    coast.</p>
                <p>But the most extensive operations of this nature are carried on at Bordeaux with
                    the wines which we call Claret, not one-thousandth part of which are of a good
                    quality, or unmixed in some way, and the one half of some of which, perhaps, are
                    not French, but Spanish wine. The following statement, while it is curious in
                    itself, will illustrate this subject. In the year 1814, the total quantity of
                    the Clarets, or Bordeaux of the first class, was as follows :—</p>
                <p>Chateau Margaux 80 tons.</p>
                <p>Latour 70 ...</p>
                <p>Chateau Latite 80 ...</p>
                <p>In the second class it was thus:</p>
                <p>Margaux de Madame Derauzan 60 tons.</p>
                <p>M. Chevalier 25 ...</p>
                <p>M. Monterison 25 ...</p>
                <p>Μ. Montalambert 25 ...</p>
                <p>St Julian Leoville 80 ...</p>
                <p>Lanoze 70 ...</p>
                <p>Pauillac M. Depichon 60 ...</p>
                <p>Brame Mouton 80 ...</p>
                <p>We cannot afford room for the remainder of this statement, comprising the produce
                    of the fourth and the fifth qualities; but it is plain that very few of those
                    persons who imagine that they are drinking the first growth of Bordeaux wines,
                    can even be drinking the second.</p>
                <p>The first growth of Claret, it is thus seen, amounts only to 230 tons for an
                    average; and that even of the second is only 425; a fraction indeed in the
                    consumption of Europe. But in the third class, of which we cannot afford to give
                    the details, there are 1061 tons, and in the fourth 825, making a general total
                    of 2541 tons. Besides this,, there are other inferior<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=940" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0940-0900"/>
                    wines which do not enter into the enumeration; and it is by mixing the greater
                    number of these in various proportions that the market is supplied, it being
                    necessary to reserve many of the better wines to render the others saleable.</p>
                <p>We must however remark, that, among the districts which produce the inferior
                    wines, such as those of the Bas and the Petit Medoc, a few farms produce small
                    quantities, of a quality equal nearly to the good St Julian or Lafite wines; and
                    these add to the bulk of the better kinds, being generally reserved, and sold at
                    high prices. In the district Medoc. the seat of the better wines already
                    mentioned, there are, besides the third and fourth classes, six or eight kinds
                    of wine, known by the names of <hi rend="italic">Gros Bourgeois, Petit
                    Bourgeois, Artisan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paysan;</hi> and these are
                    manufactured, with others, for the British market chiefly, by means of Spanish
                    wines, by mixing with the strong wines of Bene-casto and Alicant. The same is
                    true of the Grave wines.</p>
                <p>This is the great mixture, in fact, by which the market is filled to almost any
                    extent with Claret wines so called; and these mixed wines are almost the only
                    ones we drink in this country. If that be a fraud, it must also be remembered
                    that such is British taste in wine, and that Claret is generally esteemed here
                    only in proportion to its strength. Of the stronger and finer wines there is not
                    enough for even our consumption; and as we must have them strong, they are
                    rendered so by this process. That effect is also obtained, however, by some of
                    the south of France wines; by those of Côté, which are used for mixing with the
                    weak Medoc and Grave wines, for the British market. This is the case with those
                    of Queyries, such as Monferrant and Bassens; and those of Palu, such as Macaw,
                    St Romain, Codillac, St André, Lugon, and many more.</p>
                <p>The French wines of which we have been speaking will not endure to be rendered
                    stronger by means of brandy. The property of this substance, thus mixed, is to
                    decompose the wine in process of time, causing the extractive matter or mucilage
                    to be deposited, as well as the colour, as is daily seen in Port wines, and thus
                    diminishing their powers of duration. At the same time it destroys their
                    lightness and flavour, that peculiar indefinable delicacy well known to drinkers
                    of good wine, but quite imperceptible to British drinkers of Port. In a certain
                    sense, we may consider that it is only the bad wines which will bear this
                    medicine; those which have no flavour of their own, and whose whole merit
                    already is their strength. What sort of a compound is made of a weak wine with
                    brandy, ought to be known to those who drink what is called Lisbon wine. But a
                    depraved taste has rendered it necessary to our nation, and thus it is largely
                    used, even in those wines of Portugal and Spain, of which the chief fault is
                    that of being too strong already. We may thank the Methuen treaty for being
                    condemned to drink what Mr Pinkerton calls wine fit for hogs only. This mixture
                    is performed in the same manner, at the period of fretting; and the proportion
                    is regulated partly by the taste of the consumers, and partly by the badness of
                    the wine. As it must have a certain strength, the worst wines require most; and
                    hence, whenever we taste the brandy in wine, we may be sure it is bad. It is a
                    taste sufficiently perceptible to those who know what real wine is.</p>
                <p>Many wines have naturally so little flavour, that they can scarcely be considered
                    to possess any. There are few indeed that possess this quality in any great
                    degree; and of these flavours a large proportion is bad. Wines so highly
                    perfumed by nature as Hermitage and Burgundy are rare; indeed these are almost
                    the only examples; and after them we may consider the finest Clarets, and then
                    the finest of the Rhine wines. The sweet wines which possess it are well known;
                    and these also are but a small part of the total number in this class, being
                    almost limited to Paxaret and the Muscat wines, among which Rivesaltes stands
                    first. Constantia has rather a taste than a flavour; and what the ordinary sweet
                    Spanish wines possess is rather bad than good, though, like the taste of Sherry,
                    and porter, and olives, they may become agreeable by habit.</p>
                <p>Excepting these cases, and a few among the Italian wines, which we cannot afford
                    room to detail, many of the flavours found in wines are communicated by art; and
                    this forms part of the business of the manufacturer and merchant. Much of this
                    is a secret, but some of the substances used for the purpose are known. The
                    taste of Greece is now, as it was in ancient times, to perfume its wines with
                    turpentine —the <hi rend="italic">vina picoa</hi> of the ancients; and this is
                    effected by putting turpentine or rosin into the casks. In Britain our
                    chivalrous and baronial ancestors perfumed their wines with every strange
                    ingredient that can be imagined; but that was the age of spicery and perfumes,
                    and he who ate cinnamon with his pork, might drink ambergrease in his wine.</p>
                <p>The flavour of Madeira is nothing but that which we know is given by means of
                    bitter almonds, and we believe of sweet almonds also; and the same practice is
                    followed for the wines of Saint Lucar. That which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">borrachio</hi> taste in wine is for the most part that of the tar
                    with which the seams are secured. In Sherry the flavour seems produced by the
                    destruction of the acid, the consequence of the lime used, and possibly by some
                    other action of that substance on the fruit. One of the most common ingredients
                    used for flavouring wines is oak chips; and from this the wretched Lisbon wines
                    acquire the little taste they have. Orris root is also a common ingredient, and
                    the high-flavoured wine of Johannesberg is imitated by a proportion of
                    rose-water. The orris root gives a very agreeable flavour, and is used in
                    France; and there it is also the custom to use raspberries and other highly
                    perfumed fruits. A very agreeable flavour is also said to be produced by
                    wormwood. The flowers of the vine itself are likewise used for the same purpose,
                    their smell much resembling that of our mignonette. This last is an ancient
                    practice in Egypt.</p>
                <p>The method of gaining this end requires some delicacy and attention. In
                    particular, care is taken that it be not overdone. As the full fermentation
                    would destroy the more volatile flavours, these substances are only introduced
                    towards its decline. In Madeira the nut-cake is put into the cask. Flowers are
                    suspended in a net or cloth, either in the fluid or the vacant part of the cask,
                    and thus a small quantity of raspberries communicates a considerable
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>The colouring of wine is also part of the business of the maker, because colour
                    is in a good measure a matter of fashion and fancy. Some grapes contain
                    naturally very little colour, while that of the Claret vine, and many of the
                    grapes of Spain, are highly charged with the colouring principle. We already
                    explained that the colour was contained exclusively in the husk. These latter
                    wines are often, therefore, selected and reserved for this particular purpose;
                    and it is also a practice to use the dyeing woods, logwood and Brazil wood, for
                    obtaining the same end. The elder-berry, which is full of colour, is also
                    resorted to; and in Portugal it used to be extensively cultivated for the
                    purpose of dyeing Port wines. When white wines are thought too pale for the
                    market, they are coloured browner by means of the well-known ingredient burnt
                    sugar; and the chips of oak also produce the same effect. By some means also
                    iron finds its way into some of the French wines, and thus, on exposure to air,
                    they become black. This unpleasant effect is not unusual in the sweet wines from
                    the south of France.</p>
                <p>This property relates almost exclusively to the wines of Champagne, and it is one
                    that may err in excess or defect. It is already apparent that it is the product
                    of an unfinished fermentation, and therefore a due degree of it must mainly
                    depend on the proper management of this process. It is secured by bottling at
                    the proper season, March, and before the fermentation is exhausted; and if in
                    danger of excess, it is restrained or diminished by racking, or decanting and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=941"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0941-0901"/>sulphuring. But it happens not unfrequently that
                    it fails altogether, either from accident in the management, or a bad season;
                    from faults in the fruit, or fermentation carried too far, or a weak wine
                    exhausting itself unexpectedly. In this case the remedy is to introduce sugar,
                    not only into the casks, but into the bottles. In the first case the
                    fermentation is renewed, and the wine may thus become legitimate and good. In
                    the other the effect is far different, and not good; and hence it is that all
                    the very sweet Champagne wines are bad or indifferent. These are, in fact, a
                    mixture of wine and sugar rather than proper wine; and in this case the effect
                    of the sugar is not to produce a new fermentation, but to disengage the carbonic
                    acid of the wine, as a salt or any other soluble substance would do by a
                    superior affinity. To gain this end, the solid sugar is corked up in the bottle,
                    so that the disengaged gas is retained under the pressure of the cork, ready to
                    fly out whenever that is removed. Thus Champagne which has been destroyed by
                    age, is rendered at once sweet and effervescent; and this, however convenient a
                    secret it may be to the possessor, is but a fraud, and a very common one.</p>
                <p>The acidity, or the pricked taste of wines, is a fault which perhaps ought never
                    to be corrected, as in this case the wine is generally spoiled. This
                    nevertheless is done, and sometimes to a considerable extent. Acidity arising
                    from tar-tarous acid, or even from malic acid, if that really be the acid in
                    wines which is not tartarous, may be a virtue and a quality, as it is very
                    remarkably in Hock. But it is often thought otherwise, even when it is the
                    natural property of the wine, arising from its own native acid, and after a
                    correct fermentation. In this case means are applied to remedy it as a disease
                    in the wine. In the manufacture of Sherry, it was already remarked that lime was
                    used to prevent it; and this is also applied in other cases where tartar is in
                    excess, as the tartrite of lime is insoluble, and can be fined down and
                    separated by racking. It has been the fashion to use lead, metallic lead, for
                    this purpose; and in France it was formerly used largely in the wines consumed
                    in Paris. It was then discovered, and the act made penal; and if not abandoned
                    entirely, it is less used at present everywhere. That this is a poisonous
                    substance is too well known; but that has been overrated in this particular
                    case. The tartrite of lead, like that of lime, is insoluble; so that after the
                    lead had done its duty, it was discharged by racking and fining. Had this not
                    been the case, all Paris, at the time we speak of, must have been poisoned. Yet
                    it is a substance that ought not to be used, because, in an acid wine ascescent
                    from fermentation, it might produce either white lead or subcarbonate of lead,
                    or else sugar of lead, acetite, both of them poisons if in different
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>For the acidity of wine from the commencement of the acetous fermentation there
                    is no proper remedy. It may be checked if taken in time, as it would be
                    prevented by careful sulphuring. Here lead is highly pernicious; and it need
                    scarcely be said, that to add sugar of lead, as has been done from ignorance and
                    fraud united, is to add a poison without even obtaining a remedy. Chalk and lime
                    may be used with impunity; yet neither can these, and far less alkalies, be used
                    to such an extent as to cure the disease, as they unite to the other acids, and
                    also decompose and destroy the wine. To prevent it as far as possible when
                    commenced, a low temperature and careful exclusion from the air are necessary.
                    But it must be remembered that air will find access, not merely through cork,
                    but through sealing-wax, and indeed through all rosins also; and thus there can
                    be no complete security, the best being that of placing the bottles on their
                    sides, so that the fluid itself becomes its own cork. The Italian practice of
                    using oil is thus far safer, but it is balanced by various inconveniences.</p>
                <p>Ropiness is a disease almost peculiar to the wines of Champagne, and its
                    chemistry is very obscure. It is not a destruction of the wine, although it
                    materially injures its flavour and other qualities. It occurs in this wine from
                    the quantity of extractive matter which it still contains, and which is that by
                    which the fermentation is maintained. It is conceived to arise from the action
                    of oxygen on this substance, converting it into a matter analogous to fibrine,
                    instead of changing the whole into vinegar. Thus it resembles the mucilaginous
                    deposit of vinegar called the <hi rend="italic">mother.</hi> In the bottles it
                    may be often cured merely by heat, by exposure to the sun, or by immersion in
                    hot water. When obstinate, it is remedied by uncasking and by agitation, by
                    exposing the fluid to the air. It is also said to be removed by a small quantity
                    of vegetable acid, or by sugar; but when on a large scale, it requires the
                    process of fining.</p>
                <p>It is held essential by the French, who are our chief teachers in every thing
                    that relates to wine, that a wine-cellar should not only be dry, but preserved
                    in a very uniform state of temperature, as near to the mean annual heat of the
                    country as possible. We have already shewn, however, when this rule may be
                    usefully departed from, for the purpose of accelerating the ripening of wines.
                    In the delicate wines of that country the rule still holds good, and very
                    conspicuously too with regard to the wines of Burgundy and Champagne. It is
                    equally true of the finer and lighter Italian wines. The wines of Spain and
                    Portugal seem to defy every thing. It is also held by the French most essential
                    that a cellar should not be subject to the agitation of carriages, the reason of
                    which is plain enough; and that it should be free of bad smells. As to moisture
                    however we must remark, that, like heat, it seems to accelerate the deposition
                    and consequent ripening of Port wines. Of bottling we need say nothing; only let
                    it be remembered that corks cannot be too good, but that no precaution will
                    absolutely prevent all communication through a cork, however secured and
                    sealed.</p>
                <p>The rules which we have thus given are all of a general nature; but there are yet
                    a few niceties to be explained, and an example from each of the four classes
                    into which we divided wines will render the subject more intelligible.</p>
                <p>The attentions required in Champagne wines are perhaps the most minute and the
                    most complicated, and they therefore stand most in need of being detailed.
                    Champagne is a late country, and it frequently happens that the frosts have
                    commenced before the grapes are ripe. Of course it is an imperfect vintage,
                    which limits that country to this particular class of wine. A very brisk wine is
                    not easily secured from grapes absolutely ripe; and thus the half-ripened fruit
                    of this district is brought into use. Yet the best of these wines, the finest
                    class of Sillery, rarely seen in this country, is made from the ripened grapes;
                    and hence it is that the best of the Champagne wines are those which are least
                    brisk or violent, and that great violence is a characteristic of the inferior
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>The finest wine is produced here by a very light pressure of the grapes, in which
                    case only the ripest give out their juice. It is held necessary to gather them
                    when the morning dew is off, to prevent water being added to the juice. The next
                    pressure and the least ripe grapes are reserved for the inferior classes. When
                    the juice is poured into the vat, it remains one night only, the seeds being
                    carefully separated. In all cases the greatest care is taken to separate damaged
                    grapes or rotten ones; and it is as much from this neglect as any other cause
                    that the common Italian wines are so bad. If the Champagne is to be red, the
                    fermentation is suffered to proceed on the husks a little longer, for the
                    purpose of extracting the colour; and according to the length of this process,
                    we have the <hi rend="italic">oeil de perdrix,</hi> and the pink and red wines.
                    But, as we remarked before, this injures the flavour, as all good judges of
                    Champagne know.</p>
                <p>When the liquor is transferred to the cask, the discharge· of yeast at the
                    bung-hole is encouraged for ten or twelve <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=942" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0942-0902"
                    />days; and when the fermentation has become moderate, the bung is put down, and
                    a hole is made by its side. This hole is occasionally opened to give vent to the
                    air, for a space of eight or ten days. When no more air is discharged, fresh
                    wine is introduced, so as to keep the cask constantly full to the bung-hole.
                    This operation is continued if necessary till the end of December, when the wine
                    generally becomes clear. It is then racked into a fresh cask, and fined. After
                    this it begins to ferment again, losing a portion of its sweetness, and
                    improving in quality. If too sweet, it is not decanted and fined till the
                    fermentation has been renewed by agitation. As the fineness of this wine is one
                    of its essential qualities, and one difficult to obtain on account of its
                    perpetual fermentation, it is racked and fined a second time, and thus it
                    remains till March. In March it is bottled; yet still it ferments, though
                    corked, and again it begins to deposit. In the best wines it thus remains from
                    fifteen to eighteen months in the cellar, when it is bottled over again, and is
                    then marketable. The inferior kinds are seldom bottled twice, but an expedient
                    is used instead to get rid of the sediment. For this purpose the bottles are
                    ranged in frames with their necks downwards, and when the sediment has been
                    collected in the neck, the cork is dexterously drawn, and again replaced, after
                    which the bottles are filled and completed for the market. There are varieties
                    also in this general process, such as that of suffering the wine to remain in
                    the cask for a year or more on its lees; but we need not enter into these
                    collateral details.</p>
                <p>There is little difference in the practice of Burgundy, except what refers to the
                    retention of the carbonic acid. All else is the same; but great care is taken to
                    clear these wines of their lees, as, from their extreme delicacy, they would
                    soon lose their flavour, and also become sour. In the practice of Bordeaux also
                    the first stages of the process are the same, excepting in as far as a longer
                    fermentation in the husks is used to extract the colour from the red wines. But
                    there is a difference as to the process of sulphuring, which is largely used in
                    these, in the manner already described. The red wines of Bordeaux are racked
                    about the end of March or the beginning of April, but the white in December; and
                    in all these wines great care is taken in all those circumstances which relate
                    to cleanliness, however rude the people and the operations may appear on a
                    superficial view.</p>
                <p>In the drier Italian wines, the must is allowed to ferment completely in the vat.
                    In some vineyards a quantity of selected and half-dried grapes is thrown into
                    each tun when the wine is finished, so as to give it sweetness, and prevent the
                    hazard of its running to the acetous stage; a rude and a bad process. In the
                    manufacture of Florence wine, the must is withdrawn from the vat as soon as the
                    head is raised, and the wine is transferred to a cask, where it is only suffered
                    to remain thirty-six hours, when it is again decanted into a fresh cask at the
                    end of a few hours, and so on until it is clear and marketable. Thus it is
                    completed in a short time by little more than the process of racking.</p>
                <p>In different countries the practices used for procuring the sweet wines vary, but
                    they will be found to depend on one or other of the principles already laid
                    down. In Italy, as in the making <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Florence wine, the
                    fermentation is quelled by repeated racking and shifting. Thus the other
                    processes are partly or entirely saved. But it is necessary that very sweet and
                    rich grapes should be used if this process is to be followed. To insure
                    sweetness, on the principles formerly laid down, the grapes of Tokay are
                    partially dried before they are used; and this is also done for the wines of
                    Cyprus, and for some of those of France and Spain. The remaining processes,
                    consisting in sulphuring, &amp;c., need not again be detailed, as they are
                    nearly the same in all countries.</p>
                <p>In Oporto, for the dry wines, the practice is to carry on the complete
                    fermentation of the must in the vats. The wine is then introduced into large
                    tuns, capable of holding twenty-five pipes each, and at this stage the brandy is
                    added at the discretion of the maker. In Madeira, the second or insensible
                    fermentation is effected in pipes; and at the end of three months the wine is
                    racked, when a certain portion of brandy is added. In both these practices it
                    would seem as if the union of the brandy with the wine was less perfect than it
                    might be rendered by a different management of this part of the process. Hence
                    probably it arises, in a great measure, that the taste of brandy is so sensible
                    in many of these wines. In the best, the quantity is said to be about a
                    twentieth part; but in the worst class of Port wines it seems sometimes to
                    amount to a fifth or more. The process followed in making Sherry is rather more
                    complicated. The grapes in this case are first slightly dried, and then
                    sprinkled with quicklime. They are then wetted with brandy when introduced into
                    the press, and a further portion is again added to the must before fermentation.
                    It is highly probable that by this practice the brandy is more perfectly
                    combined in the wine, and the fluid rendered more uniform; and hence also
                    probably it arises that the taste of brandy is not to be perceived in genuine
                    Sherry, though often found in those baser imitations which are manufactured from
                    the tasteless wines of the Canary Islands, and of other parts of Spain. The
                    remainder of the process for Sherry consists in racking repeatedly, at intervals
                    of a month or two, fresh brandy in small quantities being added at each stage of
                    this process.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we remark, that in the attempts to make wines in our own country
                    from native fruits, the same rules are of universal application, and that an
                    attention to them would render these domestic processes more complete than they
                    now are, and the results more valuable. In Britain also it is easy to make very
                    good wine from immature grapes, by the addition of sugar in the necessary
                    proportions; and these can be procured in almost any season, so that this might
                    even become an object of a petty domestic commerce. Nor is the manufacture
                    limited to the fruit alone, since the leaves and tendrils, by infusion, admit of
                    the same treatment, and with the same results. Very tolerable wine, perfectly
                    resembling the wines of France, can thus be made, and at an expense of little
                    more than the very moderate cost of the sugar. (z. z. z.)</p>
