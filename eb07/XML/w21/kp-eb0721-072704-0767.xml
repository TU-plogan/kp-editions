                <p><label type="entry">WALPOLE, SIR <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, Earl
                    of Orford, was born at Houghton in Norfolk, September 6th, 1674, and was
                    educated on the foundation at Eton school. Thence he was elected to King’s
                    College in Cambridge; but on the death of his elder brother, he resigned his
                    scholarship. He was elected member for Castle-Rising, and represented that
                    borough in the two short parliaments assembled during the last two years of
                    William’s reign. In 1702 he was elected for King’s Lynn, and represented that
                    borough in several succeeding parliaments. In 1705, he was nominated one of the
                    council to Prince George of Denmark, lord high admiral of England; in 1707, was
                    appointed secretary at war; and in 1709, treasurer of the navy. In 1710, upon
                    the change of the ministry, he was removed from all his posts, and held no place
                    during the remainder of the queen’s reign. In 1711 he was expelled from the
                    House of Commons for what they called notorious corruption in his office as
                    secretary at. war. The borough of Lynn however re-elected him in 1714; and
                    though the house declared the election void, yet they persisted in the choice.
                    In the well-known debate relating to Steele for publishing the Crisis, he
                    greatly distinguished himself in behalf of liberty, and added to the popularity
                    which he had previously acquired.</p>
                <p>On the death of the queen, a revolution of politics took place, and the Whig
                    party prevailed both at court and in the senate. Walpole had before recommended
                    himself to the house of Hanover, by his zeal for its cause, when the commons
                    considered the state of the nation with regard to the Protestant succession; and
                    it is not surprising that his promotion soon took place after the king’s
                    arrival. In a few days he was appointed receiver and paymaster-general of all
                    the guards and garrisons, and of all the other land forces in Great Britain,
                    paymaster of the royal hospital at Chelsea, and likewise a privy counsellor. On
                    the opening of a new parliament, a committee of secrecy was chosen to inquire
                    into the conduct of the late ministry, of which Walpole was appointed chairman;
                    and, by his management, articles of impeachment were read against the earl of
                    Oxford, Lord Bolingbroke, the duke of Ormond, and the earl of Strafford. The
                    eminent service which he was thought to have rendered the crown, by the vigorous
                    prosecution of those ministers who were deemed the chief instruments of the
                    peace, was soon rewarded by the extraordinary promotions to the offices of first
                    commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor and under treasurer of the
                    exchequer.</p>
                <p>In two years time he resigned all his offices, on account of a misunderstanding
                    which took place between him and the rest of the ministry about certain supplies
                    demanded for the support of his majesty’s German dominions. On the day of his
                    resignation he brought in the famous sinking-fund bill, which he presented as a
                    country gentleman, saying that he hoped it would not fare the worse for having
                    two fathers; and that his successor Mr Stanhope would <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=768" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0768-0728"
                    />bring it to perfection. His calling himself the father of a project, which has
                    since been so often employed to other purposes than were at first declared, gave
                    his enemies frequent opportunity for satire and ridicule; and it has been
                    sarcastically observed, that the father of this fund appeared in a very bad
                    light when viewed in the capacity of a nurse. In the next session of parliament,
                    Walpole opposed the ministry in every thing; and even Wyndham or Shippen did not
                    exceed him in patriotism. Upon a motion in the house for continuing the army, he
                    made a speech of above an hour long, and displayed the danger of a standing army
                    in a free country, with all the powers of eloquence. Early in 1720 the rigour of
                    the patriot began to soften, and the complaisance of the courtier to appear; and
                    he was again appointed paymaster of the forces, and several of his friends were
                    found soon after in the list of promotions. No doubt now remained of his entire
                    conversion to court-measures; for before the end of the year, we find him
                    pleading as strongly for the forces required by the war-office as he had before
                    declaimed against them, even though at this time the same pretences for keeping
                    them on foot did not exist.</p>
                <p>It was not long before he acquired full ministerial power, being appointed first
                    lord commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer; and when the
                    king went abroad in 1723, he was nominated one of the lords justices for the
                    administration of government, and was sworn sole secretary of state. About this
                    time he received another distinguished mark of the royal favour; his eldest son,
                    then on his travels, being created a peer, by the title of Baron Walpole of
                    Walpole. In 1725 he was made knight of the Bath, and the year after knight of
                    the Garter. The measures of his administration, during the long time he remained
                    prime or rather sole minister, have been often canvassed with all the severity
                    of critical inquiry. It is difficult to discern the truth through the
                    exaggerations and misrepresentations of party. He has indeed been accused of
                    employing the sinking fund for the purposes of corruption, of which it was long
                    the fashion to call him the father; but the man who reflects on the transactions
                    of Charles II. and his infamous cabal, will acquit him of the latter part of
                    this charge. He was an enemy to war, and the friend of commerce; and because he
                    did not resent some petty insults of the court of Spain so suddenly as the fiery
                    part of the nation thought he should have done, a formidable opposition was
                    formed against him in the house, which had influence enough to employ in its
                    cause almost all the wit of the nation. Pulteney and Pitt were the great leaders
                    of the party in the House of Commons; while Bolingbroke, and Pope, and Johnson,
                    and almost every man of genius, exerted themselves without doors to enlighten,
                    by pamphlets in prose and verse, the minds of the people, and show the necessity
                    of a Spanish war. This he strenuously opposed, because he knew that the foreign
                    settlements of that power are very remote, and in a climate destructive to
                    Englishmen; and that such of them as we might be able to take, we could not
                    possibly retain. The opposition however prevailed. The nation was indulged in a
                    war. of which it surely had no cause to boast of the success; and it is now
                    universally known, that the greater part of those who with honest intentions
                    had, either in parliament or out of it, been engaged to run down the minister,
                    lived to repent of their conduct, and do justice to the man whom they had so
                    pertinaciously vilified.</p>
                <p>In order to encourage commerce and improve the revenue, Walpole projected a
                    scheme for an extension of the excise, as the only means of putting a stop to
                    the frauds of merchants and illicit traders. This was another ground of clamour
                    to the orators within and the wits without doors; and while the opposition
                    represented it as a measure big with public mischief, Swift and Pope
                    occasionally alluded to it as an oppression calculated to deprive private life
                    of all its comforts. The minister was therefore obliged to abandon the scheme;
                    but in a succeeding administration it was partly carried into execution, at the
                    express solicitation of the principal persons concerned in that article of trade
                    which it was suggested would be most affected by it; and afterwards the most
                    popular minister that ever directed the councils of this country declared in
                    full senate, that if a time should ever arrive which was likely to render the
                    project feasible, he would himself recommend an extension of the excise laws, as
                    a measure of the greatest advantage to commerce, to the revenue, and to the
                    general interests of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In 1742 the opposition prevailed; and Walpole, being no longer able to carry a
                    majority in the House of Commons, resigned all his places, and fled for shelter
                    behind the throne. He was soon afterwards created earl of Orford; and the king,
                    in consideration of his long and faithful services, granted him a pension of
                    L.4000 per annum. The remainder of his life he spent in tranquillity and
                    retirement, and died in 1745, in the 71st year of his age.<note anchored="true"

                    Sir Robert, was born in 1717, became fourth earl of Orford in 1791, and died on
                    the 2d of March 1797, in the eightieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>After having been educated at Eton and Cambridge, Horace Walpole passed two years
                    on the continent, the greater part of the time being devoted to Italy, where he
                    acquired that taste for art which afterwards furnished the main employment of
                    his life. In the autumn of 1741, he returned to England; and he took his seat in
                    the parliament which, meeting in the end of that year, drove his father from
                    power before the close of its first session. He continued to be a member of the
                    House of Commons for twenty-six years, retiring at the age of fifty-one. His
                    political career was by no means distinguished. We do not hear of his having
                    delivered more than three speeches in all, and of these the two that have been
                    preserved exhibit no great talent for oratory. For political business he
                    possessed neither industry nor ambition; and the character in which he appeared
                    throughout was little more than that of a spectator, who took greater pleasure
                    in watching the acts of others, and recording his own impressions in regard to
                    them, than in endeavouring himself to act either for his own benefit or for that
                    of others.</p>
                <p>As an observer of public men, however, he never allowed his attention to flag;
                    and his observations were most diligently set down in a multifarious
                    correspondence with friends, and, for a part of his life, in political memoirs,
                    avowedly intended for publication when the writer and his contemporaries should
                    have quitted the scene. Politics, however, like all things else, were for Horace
                    Walpole nothing<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=769"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0769-0729"/> more than an amusement. Literature, art, and
                    antiquities ministered by turns to the same end, although all these pursuits
                    were followed in the same careless and Epicurean spirit. But his pen never lay
                    long idle; few themes that demanded but little study for their treatment proved
                    alien to it; and among his works there gradually accumulated, not only an
                    immense mass of letters, as evidently calculated for publication as any thing
                    else he ever wrote, but specimens of his aptitude for the composition of novels,
                    of dramas serious and comic, of political tracts and satires, of grave
                    historical disquisitions, of memoirs for the history of English art and of
                    English aristocratic literature, and of those light verses which may be written
                    by gentlemen having but slender pretensions to the name of poets.</p>
                <p>Walpole’s circumstances however allowed him to indulge, in a more dignified
                    fashion, his taste for art and literature. One who was ashamed of writing plays
                    and poems, had no need to be ashamed of collecting books and antiques, or of
                    building baronial castles, and designing romantic gardens. Although Sir Robert
                    Walpole himself left his affairs exceedingly embarrassed, he had carefully
                    provided for the younger branches of his family by grants of public posts.
                    Several sinecure offices conferred on Horace made up his income, during the
                    greater part of his life, to L.4000 at least, or perhaps considerably more. To a
                    bachelor, sufficiently methodical and cautious in money-matters, a sum like this
                    offered no inconsiderable facilities for the indulgence of one or two expensive
                    tastes. Walpole began to collect a few antiques while in Italy; but his passion
                    for collecting did not arrive at its height till much later. In 1747, when he
                    was thirty years old, he purchased a cottage and piece of ground at one end of
                    the village of Twickenham. Subsequent purchases increased the domain to an
                    extent of several acres, the whole of which was laid out as pleasure-grounds;
                    and the “little plaything house,” incessantly altered and enlarged, grew at
                    length into the Gothic castle of Strawberry Hill. Its owner’s taste had
                    received, partly perhaps from his friend Gray, an early direction towards this
                    style of architecture, as well as to the branches of antiquarian study connected
                    with it.</p>
                <p>In the erection and decoration of his mansion, in desultory study and
                    composition, in the enjoyments of society which embraced many of the
                    aristocracy, and a very few of the literary men of the country, and in several
                    excursions to Paris, which introduced him to the philosophical precursors of the
                    revolution,—in employments such as these, varied only by his retirement from
                    parliament, passed the life of Horace Walpole, till he had attained his
                    seventy-fourth year. The death of his unfortunate nephew then gave him his
                    father’s earldom, an honour unaccompanied by any substantial accession of
                    fortune. He had for many years been a victim of gout, and the short remainder of
                    his life was spent in utter helplessness of body. But the mind was unshaken to
                    the last.</p>
                <p>The works in which Walpole exhibits most characteristically all his qualities of
                    mind, both moral and intellectual, are his Letters, especially those in which
                    the politics of the country are the matters chiefly handled. Accordingly his
                    correspondence with Sir Horace Mann (which was prudently suppressed till the
                    present generation) may be most advantageously studied as a likeness of the
                    writer; and to this interesting series other sets of letters, such as those to
                    the Conways, and even the posthumous Memoirs, may be regarded as little else
                    than supplementary. The dissection of motives, which is the task undertaken with
                    the greatest readiness, is that which is performed least satisfactorily. The
                    analysis of the springs of action is often evidently just; but as often it is
                    clearly performed by one who was incapable alike of believing that men whom he
                    disliked could act patriotically or nobly, and of even conceiving that any party
                    or any individual could be actuated by motives of a higher class than those by
                    which, unconsciously in part, he himself was led. The selfishness of Strawberry
                    Hill, though not its refinement, was indeed a fair enough measure by which to
                    estimate such statesmen as the Pelhams: but both the selfish indolence and the
                    confined though acute intellect were utterly alien to the mind of Pitt, and
                    utterly incapable of estimating him and the few other spirits which in that age
                    of intrigue and detail possessed real strength and elevation. Akin to this
                    temper of universal censoriousness, and indeed springing from the same source,
                    is another distinctive peculiarity of all Walpole’s political sketches; namely,
                    his incapacity for determining the relative importance either of principles or
                    actions. An intrigue which substitutes in the ministry a Holdernesse for a
                    Pelham, possesses in his eyes equal consequence with the agitation which decides
                    whether the foreign policy of the nation is to be swayed by strength and
                    patriotism or by weakness and corruption—hy William Pitt, or by the creatures
                    who, during the greater part of his life, thwarted and crippled his exertions.
                    Nay, the politics of the day themselves appear, in Walpole’s eyes, as standing
                    on the same level with the amusements, the family history, the debauchery of the
                    fashionable world: Lady Orford is satirized in the same breath with the
                    Chancellor Hardwicke, and the king of Prussia is not less a theme of merriment
                    than “Prince Pigwiggin" or the duchess of Kingston.</p>
                <p>These very qualities, which at once bear unfavourable witness to the state of the
                    writer’s mind, and diminish the value of the writings as historical documents,
                    do nevertheless give a peculiar attraction to them as literary compositions of a
                    certain class. The class is not a high one, but in it the best parts of this
                    Correspondence occupy the very foremost place. The Letters are inimitable
                    pictures of society and of human character, drawn by the hand of one who was a
                    master in the delineation of scenes from familiar life; not, it is true,
                    inspiring his figures with poetic truth or serious significance, but shedding
                    over all of them a gaily comic light. They are a kind of satires, and few
                    compositions claiming that name are equal to them in lively wit, in striking
                    grasp of character, in picturesque colouring of incidents, and in apposite,
                    epigrammatic, vigorous language. They have been criticised at great length, and
                    with consummate talent, in the Edinburgh Review, vol. lviii.</p>
