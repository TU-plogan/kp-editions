                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    bedchamber, serving to dispose and keep a person’s apparel in; or for a servant

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wardrobe,</hi> in a prince’s court, is an apartment wherein
                    his robes, wearing apparel, and other necessaries, are preserved under the care
                    and direction of proper officers. In Britain, the Master or Keeper of the Great
                    Wardrobe was an officer of great antiquity and dignity. High privileges and
                    immunities were conferred on him by King Henry VI. which were confirmed by his
                    successors; and King James I. not only enlarged them, but ordained that this
                    office should be a corporation or body politic for ever. It was the duty of this
                    office to provide robes for the coronations, marriages, and funerals of the
                    royal family; to furnish the court with hangings, cloths of state, carpets,
                    beds, and other necessaries; to furnish houses for ambassadors at their first
                    arrival; cloths of state, and other furniture, for the lord lieutenant of
                    Ireland, and all his majesty’s ambassadors abroad; to provide all robes for
                    foreign knights of the garter, robes for the knights of the garter at home;
                    robes and all other furniture for the officers of the garter; coats for kings,
                    heralds, and pursuivants at arms; robes for the lords <pb break="no"

                    the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer, &amp;c.; livery for the lord
                    chamberlain, grooms of his majesty’s privy chamber, officer of his majesty’s
                    robes; for the two chief justices, for all the barons of the exchequer, and
                    several officers of these courts; all liveries for his majesty’s servants, as
                    yeomen of the guard, and wardens of the Tower, trumpeters, kettle-drummers, and
                    fifers; the messengers, and all belonging to the stables, as coachmen, footmen,
                    littermen, postilions, and grooms, &amp;c.; all the king’s coaches, chariots,
                    harnesses, saddles, bits, bridles, &amp;c.; the king’s watermen, game-keepers,
                    &amp;c.; also furniture for the royal yachts, and all rich embroidered tilts,
                    and other furniture, for the barges. Besides the master or keeper of the
                    wardrobe, who had a salary of L.2000, there were his deputy, who had L.150, and
                    a comptroller and a patent clerk, each of whom had a salary of L.300; besides
                    many other inferior officers and servants, who were all sworn servants to the
                    king. There was likewise a removing wardrobe, which had its own set of officers,
                    and standing wardrobe-keepers at St James’s, Windsor Castle, Hampton Court,
                    Kensington, and Somerset House; but the whole of the wardrobe establishment was
                    abolished by act of parliament in 1782, and the duty of it in future was to be
                    done by the lord chamberlain.</p>
