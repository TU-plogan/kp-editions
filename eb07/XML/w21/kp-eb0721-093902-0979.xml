                <p><label type="entry">WORCESTER</label>, an inland English county in the Oxford
                    circuit, and nearly in the centre of the kingdom. It is bounded on the north by
                    Staffordshire and Shropshire, on the south by Gloucestershire, and on the east
                    by Warwickshire. Its figure is very irregular; and it is remarkable for having
                    several detached portions scattered about the neighbouring counties, which makes
                    it difficult to be accurate in its dimensions. It may be stated as about thirty
                    miles in length and twenty-four in breadth, and to be 723 square miles or
                    462,720 acres in extent.</p>
                <p>The population of the county at the four decennial enumerations has been as
                    follows: in 1801, 139,331; in 1811, 160,546; in 1821, 184,424; and in 1831,
                    211,400. At the last of these periods the males were 103,383 and the females
                    107,982. The number of dwelling-houses was 41,406, inhabited by 45,512 families;
                    of whom 14,654 were chiefly employed in agriculture; 19,040 were chiefly
                    employed in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and 11,828 were not comprised
                    in either of the preceding classes. At the same period the number of males
                    twenty years of age was 52,796; the occupiers of land employing labourers were
                    2636; the occupiers not employing labourers, 1260; the labourers employed in
                    agriculture, 14,590; the labourers employed in manufactures, and in making
                    manufacturing machinery, were 8024; those employed in retail trade or
                    handicraft, as masters or workmen, 12,693; those described as bankers,
                    professional and other educated men, 2085; labourers employed in labour not
                    agricultural, 6544; other males under twenty years, except servants, 2885; male
                    servants twenty years of age, 1079; male servants under twenty years of age,
                    446; female servants, 8162.</p>
                <p>There is a soft beauty on the face of this county, when viewed from any
                    elevation, such as the Malvern or Abberley Hills, which is highly gratifying.
                    From such spots the state of its cultivation appears to great advantage, as
                    there are no parts of any considerable extent so barren or neglected as to be
                    destitute of an agreeable and profitable verdure. With the exception of those
                    hills, the former of which rise to the height of 1440 feet, the whole county
                    consists of gentle undulations, wholly enclosed, well wooded, and intersected by
                    the great rivers Severn and Avon, and their several tributary streams. The
                    abundance of orchards of pear-trees, and the scattered hop plantations, give a
                    peculiar richness to the autumnal scenery. Even the poorer parts of the county,
                    between the towns of Droitwich and Bromsgrove, have of late been cultivated; and
                    though they do not rival in beauty the vale of Evesham, they are far from the
                    aspect of sterility which they exhibited twenty years ago. The farms are
                    generally of small extent, from forty to three hundred acres, and the
                    cultivation is generally well conducted. The arable land, which, in the rotation
                    of crops, produces artificial grasses, is estimated to be 360,000 acres; the
                    permanent grass land 100,000 acres; and the woods, wastes, rivers, roads, sites
                    of towns, and gardens, 40,000. The crops of wheat, barley, and especially of
                    beans, are more productive than the average of England. Hops are extensively
                    cultivated, and the pear-trees are so abundant and so productive as to afford
                    perry for the common drink of the labourers in agriculture. There is no breed of
                    cattle peculiar to Worcestershire, as it is found more profitable to buy oxen
                    and sheep in a lean condition from poorer districts, and to fatten them in this
                    county, than to breed them on its rich soil.</p>
                <p>The great rivers Severn and Avon are both navigable, the former to an extent of
                    nearly two hundred miles from its mouth, and the latter to Stratford from its
                    junction with the former. The Severn abounds with salmon, shad, and lampreys,
                    though those delicious fish are never known to ascend the Avon. The other rivers
                    are, the Stour, the Sal-warpe, the Ledden, and the Rea. This county has partaken
                    largely of the benefit communicated by internal navigation. The canals are, the
                    Trent and Severn, the Droitwich, the Worcester and Birmingham, the Dudley and
                    Leominster. The town of Stourport has risen into importance since the extension
                    of canals, and exhibits a large maritime town in the centre of the kingdom,
                    connecting its various productions in a focus, and distributing them where
                    needed.</p>
                <p>Although this county has hitherto had no railways formed through it, yet as one
                    portion of it is in contact with the town of Birmingham, that part has, by the
                    vicinity, the means of the most rapid communication with London, Liverpool, and
                    Manchester; and projects are now on foot which in a few years may give
                    facilities of speedy intercourse with Bristol and Exeter, and may perhaps be
                    extended to Plymouth.</p>
                <p>The county possesses a variety of manufactures in hardware, carpet-making,
                    gloves, and china. At Dudley, Stourbridge, and Old Swinford, about 450 males
                    upwards of twenty years of age are employed at the forges, who make anvils,
                    chains, and the heavier kinds of iron tools and machinery. At Woolverley, and
                    some other neighbouring villages, about 280 men make gun-barrels, edge-tools,
                    and files. At Tardebig, and the parishes near it, 540 men make needles and
                    fish-hooks. The number of nailers throughout the county is about 3000, chiefly
                    in and near Bromsgrove, Dudley, and Swinford. At and around Kidderminster, 2300
                    men are employed in making carpets, and in preparing materials for that
                    manufacture. At Worcester, and in its suburbs, nearly 1000 men, and a much
                    greater number of females, are employed in making gloves; and about fifty men,
                    besides many females, are occupied in making china, chiefly in burnishing and
                    other delicate operations. At Pershore, some men are employed in making
                    watch-springs.</p>
                <p>The salt made at Droitwich supplies nearly one half of England with that
                    indispensable article. The duty collected there before the abatement of the tax
                    amounted to more than L.1000 per day. The water, from which the salt is made by
                    evaporation, is more highly saturated than any other that has been discovered.
                    Researches in the bowels of the earth have shown that a river of salt water,
                    about twenty-two inches in depth, runs about 250 feet below the surface.
                    Immediately above this subterranean stream is a bed of gypsum 130 feet thick.
                    When this stratum is penetrated by the borer, the spring rises to the surface,
                    and yields a never-failing supply of water, so fully saturated that no more salt
                    can be dissolved in it. The springs at Droitwich hold in solution about one
                    fourth of their weight in salt; and no other in England holds more than a ninth.
                    The subterraneous<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0980-0940"/> river runs over a bed of rock-salt, whose
                    thickness has not yet been ascertained. Besides the springs at Droitwich, other
                    mineral springs are found at Malvern, which are resorted to for their healing
                    properties, as well as for the pure air of the district. The combinations of the
                    wells are carbonate of soda, carbonate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, carbonate
                    of iron, sulphate of soda, and muriate of soda.</p>

                <p>The titles derived from the county are the marquisate of Worcester and the
                    earldom of Beauchamp. For election purposes the county has been formed into two
                    divisions, distinguished as the eastern and the western, each of which elects
                    two members to the House of Commons. The election for the eastern division is
                    held at Droitwich; and the other polling places are Pershore, Shipston, and
                    Stourbridge. The election for the western is held at Worcester; and the other
                    polling places arc Upton, Stourport, and Tenbury. The city of Worcester and the
                    borough of Evesham, as formerly, return two members, and Bewdley one. By the
                    reform bill, Droitwich has been deprived of one of its members, and
                    Kidderminster and Dudley have been constituted boroughs, each electing one
                    member.</p>
                <p>Among the numerous seats of noblemen and gentlemen in this county, the most
                    distinguished are, Madresfield, Lord Beauchamp; Hagley, Lord Lyttelton; Croome
                    Court, earl of Coventry; Northwick, Lord Northwick; Hartlebury Castle, bishop of
                    Worcester; Dailsford, late Warren Hastings; Ombersley Court, marquis of
                    Downshire; Hewell Grange, earl of Plymouth; Hanbury Hall, John Phillips;
                    Overbury, James Martin; Winterdyne House, William Moselay; Westwood House, Sir
                    Herbert Packington; and Whitely Court, Lord Foley.<note anchored="true"

                    >Worcester</hi> city, the capital of the county of that name, in nearly the
                    centre of England. It is finely situated on a gradual ascent from the left bank
                    of the river Severn, over which is an elegant stone bridge. The river is
                    navigable for barges far above the town; and after the winter rains, timber is
                    floated down from Montgomeryshire in Wales. The trade by the river is very
                    considerable, as by that channel the foreign and colonial productions required
                    by the inhabitants are supplied from Liverpool or from Bristol. One branch of
                    trade, that of culinary salt from the brine springs of Droitwich, about six
                    miles higher up the river, and connected with it by a short canal, is very
                    extensive, as it supplies some of the western counties of England, and some
                    parts of South Wales, with that indispensable article.</p>
                <p>In past time this city had some trade in making woollen cloths and carpets; but
                    that business has departed, and now the chief manufacturing employment is the
                    making of leather gloves. There is also a manufactory of porcelain, more
                    remarkable for the beauty of the work than for its being in any extensive
                    demand. The city was anciently surrounded with walls, in which were six gates,
                    some traces of which are still to be seen. Worcester suffered much during the
                    wars between the rival houses of York and Lancaster; but the most remarkable
                    event of a historical nature was the great battle fought here in 1650, by the
                    English army under Cromwell, and the Scotish army under the command of King
                    Charles II. The loss of the king’s troops is stated to have been 2000 men killed
                    and 8000 taken prisoners. Most of the latter were Bold as slaves to the colonies
                    in America and the West Indies. The destruction of the walls and gates was
                    ordered by Cromwell after his decisive victory. It is, generally speaking, a
                    well-built city, and the chief street, the Foregate, is remarkably fine. The
                    guildhall, in that street, is a handsome structure, finished in 1723. Its front,
                    which is of brick, is ornamented with stone quoins, with mouldings and tablets
                    to the windows, of the same materials. The principal entrance, after ascending
                    some semicircular steps, is ornamented with columns of the composite order,
                    highly enriched, and crowned with an indented cornice and open pediment, in
                    which are the city arms. On each side of this principal entrance are the statues
                    of the two kings Charles, in niches; and over it a statue of Queen Anne. The
                    county-jail and the county-hall are fine buildings. The market-house is another
                    fine edifice. It is highly ornamented, and conveniently arranged for the purpose
                    it is intended to serve. The cathedral, whose effect is lessened by the close
                    approach of some of the surrounding dwellings, is a noble specimen of Gothic
                    simplicity. It was first erected by Ethelred, king of Mercia, in 680, when it
                    was a convent of secular priests. Soon after the Norman conquest, it was laid in
                    ashes by the Welsh, and was afterwards rebuilt with greater magnificence, though
                    not entirely completed until the year 1374. The building is 394 feet in length,
                    78 in breadth, and the tower is 162 feet high. On the south side is a chapel of
                    curious workmanship. Both the church and the cloisters are arched with stone of
                    a reddish colour; and in the tower are eight good bells, the largest of which
                    weighs 6600 pounds. The elegant window in the west front was constructed on
                    occasion of the visit of George III. to this city in 1788, when, at the music
                    meeting, the throne was placed near to it. Another window was built at the east
                    end in 1792, containing some excellent painting in glass. The pulpit is
                    octagonal, and of stone, curiously carved in the Gothic manner, with the symbols
                    of the four evangelists, and a representation of the New Jerusalem, as described
                    in the book of Revelation. The altar-piece is of plain oak, having in the centre
                    a painting of the descent from the cross. The chief monument is that of King
                    John, standing in the midst of the choir; but the body was interred under a
                    small stone in the eastern part of the church. On each side of the figure of the
                    king are those of the bishops Wolstan and Oswald. On the south side of the altar
                    is Prince Arthur’s sepulchral chapel, a most curious piece of antique
                    workmanship, which was repaired and beautified in 1791. It consists of five
                    orders of images, viz. virgins, bishops, kings, confessors, and angels,
                    ornamented with the various badges of royalty; and under an arched roof is the
                    tomb, of fine marble. There are also several other handsome monuments, one of
                    Bishop Hough, by Roubiliac. The cloisters, where the monks formerly resided, and
                    which are now inhabited by the dignitaries of the cathedral, are 125 feet by
                    120, and sixteen feet in breadth. The vaulted roof is adorned with a variety of
                    sculptures. The bishop’s palace stands near the cathedral, in a most commanding
                    situation, overlooking the river Severn, which flows at the bottom of the
                    garden.</p>
                <p>There are nine parish churches within and two without the walls. The most
                    remarkable of them are, St Michael’s, a very ancient specimen of ecclesiastical
                    architecture; St Andrew’s, with a lofty and well-proportioned tower, built in
                    the eleventh century; All-Saints, which was rebuilt in 1742, an edifice of the
                    modern style; St Martin’s, a handsome edifice, finished in 1772, after four
                    years’ labour; and St Nicholas, of which the interior is neat and commodious.
                    Its style of architecture, executed in stone, is very pleasing, the front being
                    of the Doric order, with six pilasters, the <pb break="no"

                    />lower part rusticated, and the roof balustraded. The other churches do not
                    deserve particular notice. Besides these, there are places of worship for the
                    Roman Catholics, the Quakers, and several other denominations of protestant
                    dissenters.</p>
                <p>The country around Worcester is highly fertile, and the supply of every kind of
                    provisions is abundant in the markets, which are held every Wednesday, Friday,
                    and Saturday. The river Severn affords an abundant supply of salmon and
                    lampreys, and other fresh-water fish. Among other articles of cultivation, hops
                    are the most extensive; and this city is the largest depot for that article
                    after Maidstone and Canterbury. Coals are supplied by the Severn at a cheap
                    rate; and, under all circumstances, few places are better adapted for the
                    residence of families who wish to unite economy with comfort.</p>
                <p>The city gives the title of marquis to the eldest son of the duke of Beaufort. It
                    returns two members to the House of Commons; and by the late law it is divided
                    into six wards, and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and thirty-five
                    councillors, with justices of the peace appointed by the crown. The population
                    amounted in 1821 to 17,849, and in 1831 to 18,610. Worcester is 111 miles from
                    London, fifty-five from Oxford, and twenty-two from Birmingham, with excellent
                    roads in every direction around it.</p>
