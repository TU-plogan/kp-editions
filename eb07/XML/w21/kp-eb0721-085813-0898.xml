                <p><label type="entry">WESLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, founder of
                    the sect of Methodists, was the son of Samuel Wesley, rector of Epworth, in the
                    isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and was born in that village in the year 1703.
                    His very infancy was distinguished by an extraordinary incident; for when he was
                    only six years old, the parsonage-house at Epworth was burnt to the ground, and
                    the flames had spread with such rapidity that few things of value could be
                    saved. His mother, in a letter to her son, Samuel Wesley, then on the foundation
                    at Westminster school, thanks God that no lives were lost, although for some
                    time they gave up <hi rend="italic">Poor Jachy,</hi> as she expresses herself;
                    for his father had twice attempted to rescue the child, but was beaten back by
                    the flames. Finding all his efforts ineffectual, he resigned him to divine
                    providence. But parental tenderness prevailed over human fears, and Mr Wesley
                    once more attempted to save his child. By some means equally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=899" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0899-0859"
                    />unexpected and unaccountable, the boy got round to a window in the front of
                    the house, and was taken out by one man’s leaping on the shoulders of another,
                    and thus getting within his reach. Immediately on his rescue from this very
                    perilous situation, the roof fell in. This extraordinary escape explains a
                    certain device, in a print of John Wesley, engraved by Vertue in the year 1745,
                    from a painting by Williams. It represents a house in flames, with this motto
                    from the prophet, “Is he not a brand plucked out of the burning?” Many have
                    supposed this device to be merely emblematical of his spiritual deliverance; but
                    from this circumstance it is apparent that it has a primary as well as a
                    secondary meaning; it is real as well as allusive.</p>
                <p>In the year 1713 he was entered a scholar at the Charter-house in London, where
                    he continued seven years under the tuition of Dr Walker, and of the Rev. Andrew
                    Tooke, author of the Pantheon. In his seventeenth year he was sent to Christ
                    Church at Oxford. In 1726 he was elected a fellow of Lincoln College, and took
                    the degree of A. Μ. in 1727. He was afterwards appointed a tutor of his college.
                    He discovered very early an elegant turn for poetry. Some of his gayer poetical
                    effusions are proofs of a lively fancy and a fine classical taste; and some
                    translations from the Latin poets, while at college, are allowed to have great
                    merit. He had early a strong impression, like Count Zinzendorf, of his
                    designation to some extraordinary work. This impression received additional
                    force from some domestic incidents, all which his active fancy turned to his own
                    account. His wonderful preservation, already noticed, naturally tended to
                    cherish the idea of his being designed by Providence to accomplish some purpose
                    or other that was out of the ordinary course of human events.</p>
                <p>The reading of the writings of Mr William Law, the celebrated author of Christian
                    Perfection, and of a Serious Address to the Christian World, contributed to lead
                    John Wesley and his brother Charles, with a few of their young fellow-students,
                    into a more than common strictness of religious life. They received the
                    sacrament of the Lord’s Supper every week, observed all the fasts of the church,
                    visited the prisons, rose at four in the morning, and refrained from all
                    amusements. From the exact method in which they disposed of every hour, they
                    acquired the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Methodists;</hi> by which their
                    followers have been ever since distinguished.</p>
                <p>From Dr Potter, bishop of Oxford, he received deacon’s orders in 1725, and
                    priest’s in 1728. For some time he officiated as his father’s curate. But the
                    boundaries of this island were soon deemed by Wesley too confined for a zeal
                    which displayed the piety of an apostle, and of an intrepidity to which few
                    missionaries had been superior. In 1735 he embarked for Georgia, one of our
                    colonies, which was at that time in a state of political infancy; and the great
                    object of this voyage was to preach the gospel to the Indian nations in the
                    vicinity of that province. He returned to England in 1737. Of his spiritual
                    labours, both in this country and in America, he himself has given a very
                    copious account, in a series of Journals printed at different periods. These
                    journals drew upon our laborious preacher and his coadjutors some severe
                    animadversions from two prelates, Dr Lavington, bishop of Exeter, and Dr
                    Warburton, bishop of Gloucester. The former published, in three parts, the
                    Enthusiasm of the Methodists and Papists compared; the third part of this
                    performance containing a personal charge of immoral conduct. Mr Wesley, in his
                    vindication, published a letter to his lordship, which produced a reply from the
                    latter. Bishop Warburton’s attack is contained in his celebrated treatise,
                    entitled “The Doctrine of Grace: or, the Office and Operations of the Holy
                    Spirit vindicated from the Insults of Infidelity, and the Abuses of Fanaticism:
                    concluding with some thoughts, humbly offered to the consideration of the
                    Established Clergy, with regard to the right Method of defending Religion
                    against the Attacks of either party.” Lond. 1762, 2 vols. 8vo. There is much
                    acute reasoning, and much poignant and sprightly wit, in his Doctrine of Grace;
                    but there is too much levity in it for a grave bishop, and too much abuse for a
                    candid Christian. On this occasion Wesley published a letter to the bishop, in
                    which, with great temper and moderation, as well as with great ingenuity and
                    address, he endeavoured to shelter himself from his lordship’s attacks, not only
                    under the authority of the holy Scriptures, but of the church itself as by law
                    established.</p>
                <p>On his return from Georgia, Mr Wesley paid a visit to Count Zinzendorf, the
                    celebrated founder of the sect of Moravians or Hernhutters, at Hernhut in Upper
                    Lusatia. In the following year he appeared again in England, and with his
                    brother Charles, at the head of the Methodists. He preached his first field
                    sermon at Bristol, on the 2d of April 1738, from which time his disciples have
                    continued to increase. In 1741 a serious altercation took place between him and
                    Whitefield. In 1744, attempting to preach at an inn at Taunton, he was regularly
                    silenced by the magistrates. Although he chiefly resided for the remainder of
                    his life in the metropolis, he occasionally travelled through every part of
                    Great Britain and Ireland, establishing congregations in each kingdom. In 1750
                    he married a lady, from whom he was afterwards separated. By this lady, who died
                    in 1781, he had no children. He had been gradually declining for three years
                    before his death; yet he still rose at four in the morning, and preached, and
                    travelled, and wrote as usual. He preached at Leatherhead in Surrey, on the
                    Wednesday before that event. On the Friday following, appeared the first
                    symptoms of his approaching dissolution. The four succeeding days he spent in
                    praising God; and he left this scene, at a quarter before ten in the morning of
                    the 2d of March 1791, in the 88th year of his age. His remains, after lying in a
                    kind of state at his chapel in the City Road, dressed in the sacerdotal robes
                    which he usually wore, and on his head the old clerical cap, a Bible in one
                    hand, and a white handkerchief in the other, were, agreeably to his own
                    directions, and after the manner of the interment of Mr Whitefield, deposited in
                    the cemetery behind his chapel, on the morning of the 9th March, amid an
                    innumerable concourse of his friends and admirers, many of whom appeared in deep
                    mourning on the occasion.</p>
                <p>Wesley was a very various and voluminous writer. Divinity, both devotional and
                    controversial, biography, history, philosophy, politics, and poetry, were all,
                    at different times, the subjects of his pen; and whatever opinion may be
                    entertained of his theological sentiments, it is impossible to deny him the
                    merit of having done very extensive good among the lower classes of people. He
                    certainly possessed great abilities, and a fluency which was well accommodated
                    to his hearers, and highly acceptable to them.</p>
