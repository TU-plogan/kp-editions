                <p><label type="entry">FUR TRADE</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> fur trade in Great Britain, and in most parts of
                    the world, is divided into two distinct branches; namely, one for the preparing
                    of fur for felting purposes, or the manufacturing of men’s hats of various
                    descriptions; and the other for dressing the skins of animals for articles of
                    clothing and ornament. But before entering into a detailed account of these two
                    divisions of the fur trade, we shall present the reader with a brief sketch of
                    the history of this branch of commercial traffic in modern times. In doing this,
                    however, our limits will only permit us to give a dry statement of facts,
                    although the subject naturally abounds with moving incidents and perilous
                    enterprises. There is not, perhaps, a single article of commerce which has
                    called forth a more daring and adventurous spirit, or given rise to a more
                    patient and courageous endurance of personal dangers, privations, and hardships,
                    than have been manifested throughout the whole history of the fur trade. We have
                    by its means become pretty accurately acquainted with nearly three fourths of
                    the immense continent of North America, extending from the Gulf of Mexico on
                    both sides of the country, to the Frozen Ocean on the north. The indefatigable
                    exertions of the fur merchant, stimulated by the prospect of attaining great
                    profits from his hazardous undertakings, have made many nations and tribes of
                    savage men partially acquainted with the arts and refinements of civilized life,
                    who, in the natural course of things, would otherwise have remained many ages
                    immersed in heathen darkness and barbarity. Nor are the general advantages
                    derived from the fur trade confined to a more accurate geographical knowledge of
                    a vast range of country, and the extension of the arts of social comfort and
                    peace. The adventurous fur trader has often been the precursor of the gospel
                    missionary, and has enabled him to pursue his important labours with comparative
                    security and success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi></p>
                <p>The French, soon after their establishment in Canada in 1608, were the first who
                    brought this commerce into repute, by extending their traffic in skins to the
                    remotest settlements of the Indian tribes in North America. When this trade had
                    been carried on for nearly half a century by the French, it was thought to be so
                    extremely profitable and advantageous that it became the leading temptation for
                    incorporating the English Hudson’s Bay Company. The vast countries which
                    surround this bay abounded with animals whose furs and skins were of great
                    value, and far superior in quality to those found in less northerly regions. ïn
                    1670 a charter was accordingly granted by Charles II. to the governor and
                    company of adventurers of England trading to Hudson’s Bay. They were to have the
                    sole trade and commerce of and to all the seas, bays, straits, creeks, lakes,
                    rivers, and sounds, in whatever latitude, which lie within the entrance of the
                    straits commonly called <hi rend="italic">Hudsons Straits</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> together with all the lands, countries, and territories, upon the coasts
                    of such bays, seas, and straits, which were then possessed by any English
                    subject, or the subjects of any Christian state. The company established several
                    forts, namely, Prince of Wales’ Fort, Churchill River, Nelson, New Severn, and
                    Albany, which stood on the west side of the bay, and were garrisoned by a
                    sufficient number of men for ordinary purposes. But in May 1782 the French took
                    and destroyed these forts and settlements, which the company considered as a
                    loss equal to half a million sterling.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this misfortune, however, the company carried on for many years a
                    very steady and lucrative* business. But in spite of the restrictions which grew
                    out of their charter, the fur trade gradually extended itself beyond the
                    territorial limits of the Company; never-thelesβ<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517360" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7360-0261"/>, being principally carried
                    on by private individuals, with divided interests and very limited means, the
                    company did not look upon their enterprises with jealousy, and allowed them to
                    pursue their traffic without molestation. But for some time after the conquest
                    of Canada by the English, this irregular trade was suspended, and several years
                    elapsed before it was again revived.</p>
                <p>In the year 1766 private adventurers began to traffic from Michilimakinac. The
                    first persons who attempted it went as far as the river Camenistignia, and soon
                    returned successful to Michilimakinac. Their success induced them to renew the
                    journey, and incited others to follow their example. One of these adventurers,
                    Thomas Curry, with a skill and enterprise superior to the others, penetrated to
                    Fort Bourbon, one of the French forts, and returned to Canada with four canoes
                    filled with fur. From this period the people began to spread over every part of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>In 1787 these scattered and independent trading parties were united into one
                    body, under the denomination of the North-West Company. This was neither more
                    nor less than an association of commercial men, who agreed to carry on the fur
                    trade conjointly. The capital consisted of twenty shares, of which a certain
                    proportion was held by the company’s agents in Canada. The remaining shares were
                    held by the proprietors, who were obliged to manage the business of the concern
                    with the Indians, their clerks, and other servants. They were not bound to
                    furnish capital, nor even credit. Some of them held double shares, and could
                    retire from business at any period with one of them, naming to succeed him in
                    the other any young man in the service, who might be approved of by the majority
                    of the concern, which became accountable to the succeeding person for the share
                    so transferred. The retiring proprietor was also discharged from all duty, and
                    became a dormant partner. Shares were transferable only to such as had served
                    their time in the trade. Every share had a vote, and two thirds formed a
                    majority. The liberal way of providing for the clerks of the company, by
                    admitting them as partners in the concern, excited a spirit of emulation amongst
                    them, and was one of the principal causes of its past and present prosperity. In
                    1788 the amount of the adventure did not exceed L.40,000; in eleven years it
                    increased to triple that sum. In the same year this concern assumed a new form:
                    the shares were more than doubled, and the company split into two parties; the
                    majority acting upon the old stock and firm, and the rest commencing a new
                    one.</p>
                <p>The following is the mode of carrying on the fur trade by these companies. The
                    agents order the goods from England in October, which are shipped from London
                    the next spring, and arrive at Montreal by the summer. From thence they are sent
                    to the Indian market in May following, where they arrive in the ensuing winter,
                    and are exchanged for furs, which reach Montreal next autumn, and are thence
                    shipped for London. As these are not sold nor paid for till the succeeding
                    spring or summer, the merchant, allowing twelve months’ credit, receives no
                    return for his goods, and the expenses attending them, which is about equal to
                    the value of the goods themselves, until two years after they are considered as
                    cash; which makes this a very heavy business.</p>
                <p>The articles necessary for the trade are coarse woollen cloths, milled blankets,
                    arms and ammunition, tobacco, Manchester goods, linens and coarse sheetings;
                    common hardware, cutlery, ironmongery, and sheet iron; handkerchiefs, hats,
                    shoes, and hose; calicoes and printed cottons, &amp;c. Spirituous liquorsand
                    provisions are purchasedin Canada. These, with the expenses of making up, and
                    transporting them to and from the Indian market, form about half the annual
                    amount against the adventure.</p>
                <p>The number of men employed in the North-West Company, after its firm
                    establishment, was in all 1276; consisting of fifty clerks, seventy-one
                    interpreters, 1120 canoemen, and thirty-five guides. Of these, five clerks,
                    eighteen guides, and 350 canoe-men, were employed for the summer in going from
                    Montreal to the Grand Portage, and were called pork-eaters, or goers and comers.
                    One third of the total number remained during the winter; all the rest were
                    hired by the year, and sometimes for three years, except the apprentice clerks,
                    who were generally engaged for five or seven years, for which they had only
                    L.100, besides clothing. At the expiration of their time they were either
                    admitted as partners, or were allowed from L.100 to L.300 per annum till thus
                    provided for. Those who acted both as clerks and interpreters received from 1000
                    to 4000 livres per annum, with clothing and provisions. The guides, who also
                    acted as interpreters, had from 1000 to 3000 livres. The canoe-men are of three
                    descriptions; foremen, steersmen, and middlemen. The first two were allowed
                    annually 1200, and the latter 400 livres each. To the last class were attached
                    upwards of 700 Indians, women and children, victualled at the company’s
                    expense.</p>
                <p>The necessary number of canoes being purchased, the goods packed, and the rivers
                    free of ice, they are dispatched from La Chine, about eight miles above
                    Montreal, with eight or ten men in each canoe, and their baggage; sixty-five
                    packets of goods, six hundredweight of biscuit, two hundredweight of pork, three
                    bushels of peas, two oilcloths to cover the goods, a sail, &amp;c., an oar, a
                    towing-line, a kettle, a sponge to bail out the water, with a quantity of gum,
                    bark, and watape to repair the vessel. An European seeing one of these vessels
                    thus laden, with her gunwale within six inches of the water, would think his
                    fate inevitable in it; but the Canadians are very expert, and few accidents
                    happen.</p>
                <p>The number of skins obtained annually by the company has varied considerably. In
                    the year 1798 the total produce of their trade for twelve months consisted of
                    184,300 skins. Of these, 16,338 were diverted from the British market, and sent
                    to China. This speculation, however, did not turn out very profitable,
                    principally on account of the difficulty of getting home the return from this
                    country in the East India Company’s ship, the payment of duty, and various other
                    restrictions which do not affect the direct trade with America.</p>
                <p>We shall now leave the fur trade in this part of the American continent for the
                    present, and give a short sketch of the trade in other parts of the world.
                    During Captain Cook’s last voyage to the Pacific Ocean, besides the various
                    scientific advantages which were derived from it, a new source of wealth was
                    laid open to future navigators, by trading for furs of the most valuable kind to
                    the north-west coast of America. The first vessel that engaged in the new branch
                    of trade which had been pointed out by that great navigator, was equipped by
                    some gentlemen in China. She was a brig of sixty tons and twenty men, commanded
                    by James Hanna; and having sailed from the Typa in the end of April 1785,
                    proceeded to the northward along the coast of China, passed Diemen’s Straits,
                    the south end of Japan, and arrived at Nootka in August following. Soon after
                    her arrival, the natives, whom Captain Cook had left unacquainted with the
                    effect of firearms, tempted probably by the diminutive size of the vessel, which
                    was scarcely longer than some of their own canoes, and the small number of her
                    people, attempted to board her in open day, but were repulsed with considerable
                    slaughter. This was the introduction to a firm and lasting friendship. Captain
                    Hanna cured such of the Indians as were wounded; an unreserved confidence took
                    place; they traded fairly and peaceably; a valuable cargo of furs was procured;
                    and the tad weather setting in, h&lt; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517373"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7373-0262"/>left the coast in the end of September, touched at
                    the Sandwich Islands, and arrived at Macao about the end of December.</p>
                <p>Captain Hanna sailed again from Macao in May 1786, in the snow Sea Otter, of a
                    hundred and twenty tons and thirty men, and returned to Macao in February 1787.
                    In this second voyage he followed his former track, and arrived at Nootka in
                    August; traced the coast from thence as far as fifty-three degrees; and explored
                    the extensive sound discovered a short time before by Mr Strange, and called by
                    him Queen Charlotte’s Sound, the latitude of which is 51 degrees north, and the
                    longitude 128 west.</p>
                <p>The snow Lark, Captain Peters, oftwo hundred and twenty tons and forty men,
                    sailed from Macao in July 1786. Her destination was Kamtschatka (for which she
                    was provided with a suitable cargo of arrack, tea, &amp;c.), Copper Islands, and
                    the north-west coast. Captail? Peters was directed to make his passage between
                    Japan and Corea, and examine the islands to the north of Japan, said to be
                    inhabited by hairy people; which, if Captain Cook had lived, would not have been
                    left for the French to determine. No account having been received of this vessel
                    since her departure, there is every reason to fear that she perished.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1786 two coppered vessels were fitted out at Bombay, under
                    the direction of Mr James Strange, who was himself a principal owner. These
                    vessels were the snow Captain Cook, of three hundred tons, and snow Experiment,
                    of a hundred tons. They proceeded in company from the Malabar coast to Batavia,
                    passed the Straits of Macassar, where the Experiment was run upon a reef, and
                    was obliged to haul ashore upon Borneo to repair; and thence they steered to the
                    eastward of the Palaos Islands, made Sulphur Island, and arrived at Nootka the
                    end of June following. From Nootka, where they left their surgeon’s mate,
                    Mackay, to learn the language and collect skins against their intended return
                    (but who was brought away in the Imperial Eagle the following year), they
                    proceeded along the coast to Queen Charlotte’s Sound, of which they were the
                    first discoverers, and thence in a direct course to Prince William’s Sound.
                    After some stay there, the Experiment proceeded to Macao (their vessels being
                    provided with passes by the governor-general of Goa); the Captain Cook
                    endeavoured to get to Copper Island, but without success, being prevented by
                    constant westerly winds.</p>
                <p>Two coppered vessels were also fitted out by a society of gentlemen in Bengal,
                    viz. the snow Nootka, of two hundred tons, and the snow Sea Otter, of a hundred
                    tons, commanded by John Meares and William Tipping, lieutenants in the royal
                    navy. The Nootka sailed in March 1786 from Bengal; passed through the China
                    seas; touched at the Bashees, where they were very civilly treated by the
                    Spaniards, who had taken possession of these islands; arrived at Oonalashka the
                    beginning of August; found there a Russian galliot and some furriers; discovered
                    accidently near Cape Greville a new strait near Cook’s River, fifteen leagues
                    wide and thirty long; saw some Russian hunters in a small bay between Cape
                    Elizabeth and Cape Bear; and arrived in Prince William’s Sound about the end of
                    September. They determined to winter in Snug Corner Cove, latitude 60. 30. in
                    preference to going to the Sandwich Islands, which seem placed by Providence for
                    the comfort and refreshment of the adventurers in this trade; and were frozen up
                    in this gloomy and frightful spot from the end of November till the end of May.
                    By the severity of the winter they lost their third and fourth mates, surgeon,
                    boatswain, carpenter, and cooper, and twelve of the foremast-men; and the
                    remainder were so enfeebled as to be under the necessity of applying to the
                    commanders of the King George and Queen Charlotte, who just at this time arrived
                    in the sound, for some hands to assist in carry ing the vessel to the Sandwich
                    Islands, whither, abandoning all further thoughts of trade, they determined
                    (after getting a sea-stock of fish off Cape Edgecumbe) immediately to proceed.
                    The Nootka arrived at Macao in the end of October 1787.</p>
                <p>The Imperial Eagle, Captain Barkley, fitted out by a society of gentlemen at
                    Ostend, sailed from Ostend in the latter end of November 1786; went into the bay
                    of AllSaints, and thence, without touching anywhere, to the Sandwich Islands,
                    and arrived in the beginning of June at Nootka, whence he proceeded to the
                    south, as far as 47.30. in which space he discovered some good and spacious
                    harbours. In the latitude of 47. 46. he lost his second mate, purser, and two
                    seamen, who were upon a trading party with the long boat, and imprudently
                    trusting themselves ashore unarmed, were cut off by the natives. This place
                    seems to be the same which Don Antonio Mourelle calls the <hi rend="italic">Uha
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">lo» Dolore»,</hi> where the Spaniards, going ashore to
                    water, were also attacked and cut off.</p>
                <p>The King George, of three hundred and twenty, and the Queen Charlotte, of two
                    hundred tons, commanded by Captains Portlock and Dixon, who served under Captain
                    Cook in his last voyage, were fitted out by a society of gentlemen in England,
                    who obtained a privilege to trade to the north-west coast of America, from the
                    South Sea and East India Companies. These vessels sailed from England in the
                    beginning of September 1785, touched at the Falkland Islands, Sandwich Islands,
                    and arrived at Cook’s River in the month of August. From thence, after
                    collecting a few furs, they steered in the end of September for Prince William’s
                    Sound, intending, it is said, to winter there; but they were prevented entering
                    by heavy storms and extremely bad weather, which obliged them to bear away, and
                    seek some other part of the coast to winter at. The storms and bad weather
                    accompanied them till they arrived off Nootka Sound, when they were so near the
                    shore that a canoe came off to them; but though thus near accomplishing their
                    purpose, a fresh storm came on, and obliged them finally to bear away for the
                    Sandwich Islands, where they remained during the winter months; and returning
                    again to the coast, arrived in Prince William’s Sound in the middle of May. The
                    King George remained in Prince William’s Sound; and during her stay her long
                    boat discovered a new passage from the sound into Cook’s River. The Queen
                    Charlotte proceeded along the coast to the south; looked into Behring’s Bay,
                    where the Russians have now a settlement; and examined that part of the coast,
                    from fifty-six to fifty degrees, which was not seen by Captain Cook, and which
                    consists of a cluster of islands, called by Captain Dixon Queen Charlotte’s
                    Islands, at a considerable distance from the main, which is thus removed further
                    to the eastward than it was supposed to be. Some part of the continent may,
                    however, be seen from the east side of these islands; and it is probable that
                    the distance does not anywhere exceed fifty leagues. According to this
                    estimation, Hudson’s House, longitude 106.27. west, latitude 53. north, is not
                    more than 800 miles distant from that part of this coast, in the same parallel.
                    It is therefore not improbable that the enterprising spirit of our Canadian
                    furriers may penetrate to this coast, the communication with which is probably
                    much facilitated by lakes or rivers, and add to the comforts and luxuries of
                    Europe this invaluable fur, which in warmth, beauty, and magnificence, far
                    exceeds the richest furs of Siberia. Queen Charlotte’s Islands are inhabited by
                    a race of people differing in language, in features, and in manners, from all
                    the other tribes of this coast. Amongst other peculiarities, they are
                    distinguished by a large incision in the under lip, in which is inserted a piece
                    of polished wood, sometimes ornamented with mother of pearl shell, in shape and
                    size like a weaver’s shuttle, which undoubtedly is the most effectual mode of
                    deforming the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517386" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7386-0263"
                    />human face divine that the ingenious depravity of taste in any savage nation
                    has yet discovered. These ships, after disposing of their furs in China, were
                    loaded with teas on account of the English company, sailed from Waitipoa, and
                    arrived in England after an absence of three years.</p>
                <p>The year after the departure or me King George and Queen Charlotte, the
                    association to which they belonged fitted out two other vessels, viz. the
                    Princess Royal, of sixty tons, and the Prince of Wales, of two hundred tons,
                    commanded by Captains Colnet and Duncan, the former of whom had served under
                    Captain Cook. These vessels left England in August 1786; touched at New Year’s
                    Harbour on Staaten Land, where they left an officer and twelve men to kill seals
                    against the arrival of a vessel which was to follow them from England; and
                    thence proceeded directly to N∞tka, where they arrived the 6th of July, sickly
                    and in bad condition, and found there the Imperial Eagle, which had left Europe
                    some months after them. Leaving Noot∙ ka, they steered along the shore to the
                    northward, and soon after fell in with the Queen Charlotte.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1788 Captain Meares again sailed with two other vessels, the
                    Felice, which he commanded himself, and the Iphigenia, Captain Douglas, to
                    Nootka Sound. Here he purchased of the chief of the district a spot, on which he
                    built a house for his residence and the more convenient intercourse with the
                    natives; hoisting the British colours thereon, surrounding it with a breastwork,
                    and mounting a three-pounder on the front. Having done tills, he sent Mr Douglas
                    in the Iphigenia to trade along the northern coast, whilst he himself proceeded
                    to the south; and by presents to the chiefs he obtained the ports Cox and
                    Effingham, and the promise of an excellent trade with the natives of the
                    district, and also some other places, which he took possession of in name of the
                    king. Captain Douglas likewise, by presents to the chiefs of the countries he
                    visited, obtained similar privileges, no other European vessel having been there
                    before him.</p>
                <p>On their return to Nootka, they found a vessel finished, which the commander had
                    laid down before his departure. This, which he named the North-West America, he
                    left at Nootka with the Iphigenia, whilst he sailed with a cargo of furs in the
                    Felice to China.</p>
                <p>A few days after his arrival at China, two vessels, the Prince of Wales and
                    Princess Royal, came to Canton from their trading voyage above mentioned.
                    Captain Meares, fearing that a competition of interests might be injurious to
                    both parties, proposed a partnership, which was mutually agreed to; and another
                    ship was purchased by the firm, and called the Argonaut. In the month of April
                    1787, Captain Meares gave Mr Colnet the command of the Princess Royal and the
                    Argonaut, which were loaded with stores and articles estimated sufficient for
                    three years trade, besides several artificers, and about seventy Chinese, who
                    intended to become settlers on the north-west coast of America, under protection
                    of the new company.</p>
                <p>In the mean while the Iphigenia and North-West America (the vessel built at
                    Nootka), having wintered in the Sandwich Islands, returned to Nootka in the
                    latter end of April; soon after which two Spanish ships of war, under the
                    command of Don Martinez, anchored in the sound. For a few days mutual civilities
                    passed between the Spanish captain and Mr Douglas; but at the end of about a
                    week Don Martinez summoned the latter on board his own ship the Princessa,
                    telling him he was his prisoner, and that the king of Spain had commanded him,
                    Don Martinez, to seize all vessels he should find on that coast. He therefore
                    instructed his officers to take possession of the Iphigenia, which they
                    accordingly did in the name of his Catholic majesty; and the officers and crew
                    were conveyed as prisoners on board the Spanish ships, where they were put in
                    irons, and otherwise ill treated. Immediately after this, Don Martinez took
                    possession of the little settlement, hoisting the standard of Spain, and
                    modestly declaring all the lands from Cape Horn to sixty degrees north latitude
                    belonging to his master. To aggravate the insult, he forcibly employed the crew
                    of the Iphigenia in building batteries, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> and
                    offered no kind of violence to two American vessels which were at the same time
                    in the harbour. At this time the North-West America was sent to explore the
                    Archipelago of St Lazarus. On her return to Nootka she met with similar
                    treatment, and the skins she had collected were seized, with the rest of her
                    cargo.</p>
                <p>A few days after, the Princess Royal (which we have mentioned as having left
                    Canton in company with the Argonaut) arrived. The Spanish commander, for reasons
                    which do not appear, suffered her to depart. The skins collected by the
                    North-West America were shipped on board her for the benefit of her owner, and
                    she proceeded to trade in the neighbouring isles. On the 3d of July the Argonaut
                    arrived at the sound; and Don Martinez, after making every profession of
                    civility to Mr Co)net, the commander, took possession of the said ship in the
                    name of his master, and made prisoners of the crew. Soon after, the Princess
                    Royal returning to receive instructions from Mr Colnet, director of the
                    enterprise, was also seized by the Spanish captain.</p>
                <p>The crews of the British vessels were variously disposed of, some being sent to
                    China by the American vessels, and others to Spanish America; but the Chinese
                    were all detained, and employed in the mines which were opened in the lands
                    purchased by Captain Meares. What these mines consisted of we are nowhere
                    informed. Mr Colnet was so much affected at the failure of the enterprise that
                    he lost his reason.</p>
                <p>This proceeding, as soon as it became known, occasioned a spirited representation
                    from the British court to that of Spain; at the same time that vigorous
                    preparations were made for war in case adequate satisfaction should be refused.
                    Matters, however, were prevented from coming to extremities, by a compliance on
                    the part of Spain, after many delays and much artifice of negotiation, with the
                    requisitions of Britain; in consequence of which, among other advantages
                    unnecessary to be here recited, the whole trade from Calilòmia to China was
                    completely laid open, and the British allowed the full exercise of navigation
                    and commerce in those parts of the world which formed the subject of
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>In some accounts of the voyages above mentioned, the fur trade in those parts has
                    been greatly magnified. In that published by Captain Portlock, however, this
                    officer observes, that the gains hitherto have certainly not been enviably
                    great, although the merchants have no doubt found the trade lucrative.</p>
                <p>Considerable success having attended the Russian voyages to the Aleutian Islands,
                    and along the north-western shore of North America, in the middle of the last
                    century, two Russian mercantile houses, of the names of Schelikoff and Galikoff,
                    projected, in 1785, the formation of a regular company, to encourage the fur
                    trade in those regions, under the denomination of the Russian American Fur
                    Company. Schelikoff himself, the head of one of the establishments, was the
                    commander of all their early expeditions. They erected forts for the protection
                    of a chain of factories on most of the islands, and induced a number of
                    respectable merchants to join in their extensive and lucrative adventures at the
                    expense of the natives, from whom they did not fail to take every opportunity of
                    wresting the staple of the district. Many cruelties were charged against them at
                    this time; and the Emperor Paul was upon the eve of suppressing the association
                    altogether, when the company pledged itself, through its active agent Μ. Von
                    Resanoff, to follow more regular proceedings. In <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517399" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7399-0264"/>] 799 it was formally
                    established with considerable privileges. The present emperor took it under his
                    particular patronage at his accession; and the intelligent minister Romanzoff
                    has introduced many useful changes in its constitution. The condition of the
                    fur-collectors of the company is said, however, to be still wretched in the
                    extreme, and only to be exceeded by that of the oppressed Aleutians, who are in
                    turn their slaves.</p>
                <p>From about the year 1806 till 1823 a very extensive trade was carried on in the
                    South Seas in procuring sealskins, which in that part of the world are covered
                    with a very fine fur. These were obtained in vast abundance by the first
                    traders, and yielded a very large profit; but the traffic has now become nearly
                    extinct, on account of the almost entire destruction of the animals. The price
                    of seal-skins is in consequence very high, averaging from 30s. to 50s. per skin;
                    a price which has effectually prevented the use of the fur for felting purposes,
                    to which it was a few years since extensively applied, and confined it entirely
                    to objects of ornament in dress.</p>
                <p>Within these last twenty years a great trade has been carried on with some of the
                    South American provinces for the skins of a little animal called the nuetra. It
                    is of the rat species, and is found in immense quantities in most of the rivers
                    in that part of the world. The fur of it is now considered as quite a staple
                    article in the hat trade. The traffic is entirely in the hands of private
                    adventurers; and great numbers of these skins are imported annually into the
                    port of Liverpool by the hat manufacturers in Lancashire, who send their goods
                    to the South American market, and obtain nuetra-skins in exchange.</p>
                <p>From the period of the establishment of the North-West Company till 1809, they
                    had succeeded in establishing trading posts adjoining the different factories of
                    the Hudson’s Bay Company in all the interior ports of America; and were still,
                    by their enterprise and skill, making considerable progress both to the north
                    and west. They had numerous trading establishments at Athabasea, Peace River,
                    Great and Lesser Slave Lakes, New Caledonia, St Columbia, <hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c.</hi> to none of which places did the Hudson’s Bay Company attempt to
                    follow them. By these means the North-West Company became undisputed masters of
                    the interior and south-western states. Their influence with the natives was
                    all-powerful; and no single trader, without incurring imminent danger from the
                    Indians, or encountering the risk of starvation, could attempt to penetrate into
                    their territories.</p>
                <p>A few independent individuals unconnected with either company, the chief of whom
                    was Mr John Jacob Astor, a wealthy merchant of New York, still carried on a
                    fluctuating trade with the Indians whose lands border on Canada and the United
                    States; but their competition proved injurious to themselves, as prices far
                    above their value were frequently given to the natives for their furs.</p>
                <p>With the interior thus inaccessible, and the confines not worth disputing, Mr
                    Astor turned his thoughts to the opposite si&lt;le of the American continent;
                    and accordingly made proposals to the North-West Company to join with him in
                    forming an establishment on the Columbia River. This proposition was submitted
                    to the consideration of a general meeting of the wintering proprietors; but,
                    after some negotiations as to the details, it was rejected. Mr Astor, therefore,
                    determined to make the attempt without their co-operation; and, in the winter of
                    1809, he succeeded in forming an association called the Pacific Fur Company, of
                    which he himself was the chief proprietor. As able and experienced traders were
                    necessary to ensure success, he induced several of the gentlemen connected with
                    the North-West Company to quit that establishment and join in his
                    speculation.</p>
                <p>It was intended, in the first instance, to form a trading establishment at the
                    entrance of the Columbia, and as many more subsequently on its tributary streams
                    as the nature and the productions of the country would admit. It was also
                    arranged that a vessel laden with goods for the Indian market should sail every
                    year from New York to the Columbia, and, after discharging her cargo at the
                    establishment, take on board the produce of the year’s trade, and thence proceed
                    to Canton, which affords a ready market for furs of every description. On
                    disposing of her stock of peltries at the latter place, she was to return to New
                    York freighted with the productions of China.</p>
                <p>The first vessel fitted out by the Pacific Fur Company was the Tonquin, commanded
                    by Captain Jonathan Thorne, formerly a lieutenant in the service of the United
                    States. She sailed from New York in the autumn of 1810, and had on board four
                    partners, nine clerks, with a number of mechanics and <hi rend="italic"
                    >voyageurs,</hi> and a large and well-assorted cargo for the Indian and Chinese
                    trade. Much about the same period a party under the command of Messrs W. P. Hunt
                    and Donald Mackenzie, left St Louis on the Missouri, with the intention of
                    proceeding as nearly as possible by Lewis and Clarke’s route across the
                    continent to the mouth of the Columbia. This party consisted, besides the above
                    gentlemen, who were partners, of three clerks and upwards of seventy men.</p>
                <p>The following year, 1811, another vessel, the Beaver, of four hundred and eighty
                    tons, commanded by Captain Cornelius Sowles, sailed for Columbia. She had on
                    board one partner, six clerks, and a number of artisans and <hi rend="italic"
                    >voyageurs,</hi> with a plentiful supply of every thing which could contribute
                    to the comfort of the passengers and crew. After a voyage of nearly seven
                    months, she arrived at the mouth of the Columbia.</p>
                <p>An establishment was here formed, which was called Fort Astoria, in honour of Mr
                    Astor. There were at this fort, when the Tonquin and the Beaver united their
                    respective forces, five proprietors, and as many clerks, artisans, canoe-men,
                    and others, as amounted to a hundred and forty men. The Tonquin was dispatched
                    on a short cruise to the northward, as far as Nootka Sound, with a view of
                    obtaining a few furs there; whilst the party at the Columbia were endeavouring
                    to obtain what would complete her cargo, when she was to be sent forthwith to
                    Canton. But she was destined never to return to St Columbia. The captain and the
                    natives quarrelled, when she was plundered, and every one on board put to
                    death.</p>
                <p>This melancholy circumstance threw a great gloom over the establishment at
                    Astoria, which, three years after this, was doomed to entire dissolution. In
                    1812, war having been declared by Great Britain against the United States, the
                    company found, that in consequence of the strict blockade maintained by the
                    English cruisers, no vessel could venture to trade to such a remote part of the
                    world; added to which, information was received that the Beaver, which had
                    proceeded a short time before to Canton, was blockaded there. These untoward
                    events decided the fate of the Pacific Fur Company. Many of the most active
                    persons in its employment offered their services to the North-West Company,
                    which were readily accepted.</p>
                <p>The standard of exchange established between the fur traders and the Indians,
                    from whom the skins are obtained, is quite of an arbitrary description, and has
                    very little reference to the intrinsic value of the skins when brought into this
                    country. The beaver-skin is taken as the standard of value. Three martens, eight
                    musk-rats, or a single lynx or wolverene skin, are equivalent to one beaver; a
                    silver fox, a white fox, or otter, is reckoned two beavers; and a black fox, or
                    large black bear, is equal to four; a mode of reckoning which has very little
                    connection with the real value of these different skins in the European market.
                    Neither has any attention been paid to the original cost of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517412" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7412-0265"/>European articles, in fixing
                    the tariff by which they are sold to the Indians. A coarse butcher’s knife is
                    one skin, a woollen blanket or fathom of coarse cloth eight, and a fowling-piece
                    fifteen. The Indians receive their principal outfit of clothing and ammunition
                    on credit in the autumn, to be repaid by their winter hunts; the amount
                    intrusted to each of the hunters varies with their individual reputation for
                    industry and skill, from twenty to a hundred and fifty skins.</p>
                <p>From 1810 to 1821, the North-West Company continued to prosecute their trading
                    speculations with the most indefatigable activity and considerable success. They
                    had established their trading forts over almost the whole length and breadth of
                    North America. The Hudson’s Bay Company were not less enterprising and
                    industrious; and from their having been the original possessors of a large
                    portion of the hunting territory, long established and protected by a charter,
                    they had a decided advantage over the other company. But this keen rivalship
                    produced a multitude of evils, both to the companies and to the poor Indians
                    themselves. Each company had to keep an extra number of men in their employment,
                    to collect the skins during winter; for every thing depended upon who should get
                    first among the Indians. The hunters having obtained from either the one or the
                    other of these companies a considerable sum in advance upon the success of their
                    hunting exertions, were often strongly tempted to break through their
                    engagements, by the statements and artifices of rival agents. The Indians, often
                    deceived themselves, became deceivers in their turn; and not unfrequently, after
                    having incurred a heavy debt at one trading post, they would move off to
                    another, and play the same game. In some cases mutual agreements were entered
                    into by both companies, to put a stop to these dishonest proceedings; but such
                    treaties were no sooner made than indirectly violated by the zeal and cupidity
                    of individual agents; so that they proved fertile subjects for disputes and
                    differences, which were more than once decided by force of arms.</p>
                <p>These, with many other serious evils arising out of this keen commercial rivalry,
                    threatened ultimately to destroy both companies, and ruin the fur trade
                    altogether. Both parties, therefore, saw it for their interest to come to a
                    friendly understanding. In 1821 they became united into one body; and the result
                    has hitherto shown that they have since done a great deal more business, the
                    profits upon which have yielded a considerably increased per centage. They
                    possess at this time (1834) a decided monopoly in the fiir trade; and though
                    this may seem to a casual observer as likely to enhance the price of furs, and
                    operate like an additional tax upon the community, yet the whole history of this
                    traffic clearly shows that it cannot be carried on by individual capital and
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>The amount of foreign furs of every description imported into Great Britain
                    cannot be less than from one and a half to two millions annually; whilst the
                    value of the hare and rabbit furs of our own country may be valued at another
                    million. The following are the duties to which skins and furs are at present
                    subjected.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Manufacturing of Fur for Felting purposes.</hi></p>
                <p>In the manufacturing of furs for the making of hats, the principal kinds of skins
                    used are the hare, rabbit, beaver, and nuetra. All these sorts of skins, in the
                    northern parts of Europe, as well as in America, are divided by furriers into
                    two distinct kinds; namely, the <hi rend="italic">seasoned</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">unseasoned</hi> skins. The former are those which are taken off
                    the animal in winter, when the fur is at its full growth, and in the highest
                    state of perfection as to fineness; the latter are those obtained in spring,
                    summer, and autumn. The fur in the unseasoned skins is short, coarse, and hairy,
                    and is generally not worth more than a third of the value of furs cut off the
                    best-seasoned skins. The mode of manufacturing both descriptions is, however,
                    the same; of which we shall now endeavour to give the reader a brief
                    account.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hare-Skins</hi> —The first mechanical operation performed on
                    the hare-skin is to open it with a knife down between the middle of the
                    forelegs, taking great care that the skin be not torn; for there is a
                    considerable waste of the fur if this precaution be not attended to. The skin
                    must now be rubbed with what is called a <hi rend="italic">rake,</hi> which
                    resembles a common dinner-knife, with teeth like a saw. This is used for the
                    purpose of clearing away all manner of dirt and dried blood which may happen to
                    be upon the skin. This cleaning is of very great importance; for the smallest
                    particle of dirt or blood will greatly injure the fur for felting purposes. The
                    operation requires to be carefully and judiciously performed for another reason.
                    If the workman be not attentive, he will tear up, along with the bloody and
                    dirty parts, a considerable part of the good and clean fur; and thus great loss
                    will be incurred.</p>
                <p>Hare-skins, after being thus opened and cleaned, must be damped on the pelt side
                    with a little water, and placed under a heavy weight, pelt to pelt, to press
                    them, so that all ridges and inequalities in the pelt may be removed. The skins
                    are now fit for what is called <hi rend="italic">shearing.</hi> Their outsides
                    are all covered over with a kind of hair, which possesses no felting properties
                    whatever; and this must be taken off with hand shears. These are of two kinds;
                    the one the common shears used for clipping the wool off sheep; the other kind
                    resembles the cutting shears of tailors, only the bowl is made equally large on
                    both sides, for the admission of all the fingers. Some furriers prefer one kind
                    of shears and some another. Those like tailors’ shears make the prettiest work
                    when skilfully used; but the other requires less time for their management. The
                    shearing of the skins forms a very important part of their manufacture; for if
                    you cut too far down, you will seriously destroy both quality and quantity of
                    the fur, as well as disfigure its appearance. On this account many furriers
                    confine a part of their work-people to this branch of the business alone; for
                    the greater part of the profits of a master depends upon the manner in which
                    this shearing process is performed.</p>
                <p>After a hare-skin has been submitted to the process of shearing, it presents an
                    appearance altogether different from what it did before. A stranger would not
                    know it to be the same skin. Before, it was of a uniform brown colour; now, it
                    is down the whole of the back of a most beautiful jet black, which gradually
                    becomes fainter as it approaches the sides of the skin. After it undergoes the
                    process of <hi rend="italic">rounding,</hi> which consists in taking off all the
                    irregular or angular pieces of skin, and making the pelt smooth and even, it is
                    then fit for the cutting board.</p>
                <p>The cutting boards of furriers are made of the willow tree, and are commonly
                    about twenty inches wide, and from two to three feet broad. They ought to be wet
                    with a little water at short intervals, when used, to make the wood soft, and
                    prevent the edge of the cutting knife from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517425"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7425-0266"/>being taken off too soon. These knives are
                    sometimes made of common słìeėt-iron, but more frequently of steel, which are to
                    be preferred to the former, on account of keeping their edge longer, and being
                    much lighter for the hand. A fine edge will not cut the fur off the skins; it
                    must be a rough edge, which is.obtained from rubbing the knife about every two
                    or three minutes upon a piece of common free-stone, of not too fine a grain.
                    These knives are from five to six inches in length and three in breadth, and
                    resemble in some measure those knives used by grocers for the cutting up of
                    cheeses. The skins are all, before cutting, split down the middle of the back
                    into two halves. The cutting then commences at the head or cheeks of the skin,
                    and always in the line of direction in which the fur lies. The cutting knife is
                    run quickly backward and forward against the first joint of the fingers across
                    the skin; whilst at every two or three strokes the hand must be lifted up, to
                    gather in the fur that has been cut, and preserve it in as fleecy a form as
                    possible. Care must be taken against <hi rend="italic">chopping</hi> the fur;
                    because, when this takes place, the felting principle in all furs is
                    considerably weakened, and in some entirely destroyed.</p>
                <p>An important point in the getting up of furs for sale is, to keep them in as
                    unbroken or fleecy consistency as possible. This, abstractedly considered, is of
                    no consequence to their felting power; but the practice of the trade as to this
                    matter has arisen from a desire to keep the different kinds of fur from being
                    mixed with one another, and thereby in some degree to prevent adulteration. From
                    this cause, the above mode of cutting the hare-skin has been very recently much
                    improved, by the use of instruments made of tin, against which the cutting
                    knives run, and which are so contrived as to gather in the whole fur off the
                    largest skin with as much ease as the fur of a half skin could be gathered by
                    the hand when the knife runs against the fingers. This simple invention
                    preserves all the most valuable parts of the skin in one lump or fleece, and
                    enables the workman to sort the fur with more ease and readiness than
                    before.</p>
                <p>The fur of the common hare-skin is sorted into five distinct kinds: 1st, Fine
                    backs, value from 20s. to 24s. per lb.; 2d, second backs, value 12s.; 3rf,
                    sides, from 8s. to 10s.; 4M, bellies, or white sides, from 4s. to 5s.; and, 5M,
                    tail wool, from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rabbil-Skins.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The rabbit-skin is
                    cut in precisely the same manner as that of the hare, only there is a
                    considerable difference in the mode of dressing or preparing the former. The
                    rabbit-skin is covered over on the pelt side with large quantities of grease or
                    fat, from which the hareskin is comparatively free. This must be removed when
                    the rabbit-skin is first opened. The knife used in opening the skin must be
                    pressed down upon that part of the pelt where the fatty substance is, till it
                    gets beneath the cuticle on which it rests, when the whole of the greasy matter
                    may be removed, and a little whitening rubbed on the spot. If this operation be
                    not well attended to, the grease will get mixed with the fur, and damage it
                    considerably. The rabbit, like the hare skin, is covered over with hair upon the
                    top of the fur; but this hair cannot be taken off by shearing, as in the case of
                    the former, but must be removed by <hi rend="italic">pulling</hi> it out. This
                    is done with a short knife about three inches long, which is held so as to grasp
                    the hair between the thumb and it, which is secured from in-' ⅛ry by having a
                    piece of buckskin leather placed over it. The hand of the workman ought to fall
                    lightly upon the skin, otherwise the hair will be cut and the fur pulled out
                    also, which will deteriorate its quality and diminish its quantity very
                    considerably. Rabbit fur is divided into six kinds: 1st, Fine backs, value from
                    10s. to 13s. per lb.; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, sides, 6s.; 3<hi rend="italic"

                    4s.; and 6M, tail woo), 2s. 6d.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beaver-Skins.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The skin of the
                    beaver is manufactured in the same way as that of the rabbit. The fat, however,
                    in the former is much greater in quantity and more firmly imbedded in the pelt
                    than in the latter; and of course greater care and trouble are required to
                    remove it. Fuller’s earth, mixed with whitening, are used to imbibe the fatty
                    particles. The pulling the outside hair off is of great importance. The cutting
                    of the beaver has been for some years performed by machines; the thickness and
                    regularity in the pelt affording facilities for this mode of operation, which
                    the generality of other skins do not.</p>
                <p>The fur of the beaver is sorted into three or four different kinds; but that
                    which is cut off the cheek of the skin bears the highest price. White beaver is
                    comparatively scarce, and is much esteemed for fine drab hats. The prices of
                    beaver fur fluctuate very much; the following are the present quotations of its
                    value. Best cheek, 194s. per lb.; best brown wooms, 130s.; stage, 100s.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nuetra-Skins.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These are dressed
                    like rabbit-skins, only the hair on the outside of the skins is much stronger
                    than in the rabbit, and requires a sharper knife and greater strength to remove
                    it. Nuetra skins are full of fat; and before they are submitted to the pulling
                    process, they must be well washed with soap and boiling water. The skin is laid
                    with the pelt downwards, and well scrubbed on the fur side with a brush, till
                    the grease is entirely removed. They must then be well washed in cold spring
                    water, which is drawn out from amongst the fur by a piece of wood made for the
                    purpose. After this they are placed before a stove or hot fire to dry, and are
                    then fit to go through the other manufacturing processes. The fur is divided
                    into three kinds; and the price at present averages about 60s. per lb.</p>
                <p>Both the beaver and nuetra furs, before they are used for hat purposes, must go
                    through the operation of <hi rend="italic">blowing.</hi> This is done for the
                    purpose of clearing them of those short black hairs which remain amongst the fur
                    after it is separated from the pelt. A blowing machine consists principally of a
                    cylinder, into which the fur is placed; and by means of a fly-wheel, situated
                    within it, the stuff is thrown up, and the hairs, by reason of their greater
                    specific gravity, fall to the bottom, and leave all the fine fur upon the top.
                    Hare and rabbit furs are also partially used in a blown state for the nap or
                    outside covering of hats.</p>
                <p>Though the hare, rabbit, beaver, and nuetra furs are the staple articles of hat
                    manufacture, yet there are other furs occasionally used in their stead, or in
                    conjunction with them. These are the furs of the otter, the seal, musquash, and
                    the mole. The otter is fully as fine as the beaver itself; but the principal
                    objection hatters have to its use is, that it does not retain a good black, but
                    a brown or coppery shade. The seal is not so fine as the otter. It finishes dull
                    upon a hat, and, in consequence, is not much used at present. Musquash is a
                    useful fur. The mole is the only skin known to furriers which for felting
                    purposes needs no preparatory dressing before cutting. Its fur is alike fine
                    throughout. But notwithstanding its fineness, it is so very short as to prevent
                    its being extensively used in the hat manufacture.</p>
                <p>Within these last forty or fifty years many attempts have been made to apply
                    machinery to the cutting <hi rend="italic">off</hi> the various kinds of fur,
                    but, with the exception of the beaver, these attempts have hitherto been but
                    partially successful. The great difficulties in the way of machinery for cutting
                    purposes are, the unevenness on the surface, and the inequalities in the
                    thickness of the pelt in different skins. The smallest particles of the fleshy
                    part of the skin getting among the fur will injure it; so much so, that a piece
                    of pelt not larger than a pin’s head will destroy the finest hat. This
                    circumstance has greatly increased the difficulty of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517438" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7438-0267"/>bringing machinery to bear
                    upon the fur trade. There are, however, at this moment some machines employed
                    in: die cutting of hare and rabbit skins in England; but if re- ∣ ports are to
                    be relied upon, they are not likely, from the obstacles above adverted to, to
                    realise the ex∣&gt;ectations of gain at first entertained by those employing
                    them, either in the saving of labour, or in the superior manner in which die fur
                    is manufactured.</p>
                <p>Many experiments have also been made to dispense with the usual processes of
                    cutting the different kinds of fur with knives, by applying chemical substances
                    to the peļts, so as to loosen the roots of the fur, and make it leave the pelt
                    upon a slight application of force. Lime has often been tried for this
                    pur∣&gt;ose, by using it in the same manner as skinners do in the management of
                    sheep-skins. Some furriers have also tried a partial state of putrefaction; but
                    this, as well as the lime preparation, has proved abortive. The fur obtained off
                    different kinds of skins by such means looks in every respect as well to the eye
                    as if it had been manufactured in the usual manner; but the felting principle is
                    by all such means entirely destroyed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carroted Fur.</hi> Sulphuric acid has die property of
                    increasing the felting power of most kinds of fur. When this is applied the fur
                    is called <hi rend="italic">carroted,</hi> from the colour which the. acid gives
                    it. The most common kind of fur submitted to this process is that belonging to
                    the rabbitskin; and it is generally employed in small quantities for the
                    manufacture of all fine stuff hats. Carroted coney wool is made in the following
                    manner: You mix one part of sulphuric acid with two parts of pure spring water,
                    in a dish of some kind; then take and wet the rabbit-skin with a brush all over,
                    making the liquid penetrate as near to the bottom of the fur as possible; care
                    being used, in this process, not to touch the skin with the fingers, lest they
                    be burned, but with a piece of iron hoop made like unto a pair of sugar-nippers.
                    When the skins are thus wet, they must be placed over a very hot fire to dry;
                    but they must not be placed too near, lest they take fire, which they are very
                    apt to do from the application of the acid. Instead of drying them before the
                    fire in this manner, some run a hatter’s finishing iron, heated to a certain
                    degree, over the skins, and allow them to dry gradually in the sun. This is
                    found to be a very good plan. When the skins are dry, they ought to be gently
                    beaten with a rod, and slightly wet on the pelt side with water, previously to
                    their being put under the pressing stone. They are then cut in the usual manner.
                    Skins prepared in this way attract a great quantity of moisture from the
                    atmosphere; and carroted fur always feels to the hand as if it had been
                    partially wet with water.</p>
                <p>The fur off the rabbit-skin improves in its felting capabilities by being kept a
                    moderate length of time after being taken off the skin; but hare fur does not.
                    Great attention ought to be paid by hat manufacturers, who keep considerable
                    stocks of fur on hand, as to the place they are deposited. If it be too damp,
                    they will rot; if too dry, they will fearfully diminish in weight; therefore a
                    moderately dry and cool place ought to be chosen. The great enemy to all furs is
                    the common moth. This destroys the felting principle. Whenever the slightest
                    appearance in the fur indicates the secure lodgment of this little creature, it
                    ought immediately to be used; or, if this cannot be done, it should be taken out
                    of the paper bags, and broken all over with a small switch rod, or, what will
                    answer the purpose still better, a hatter’s bow. The same rules apply to the
                    keeping of skins in good condition as to fur. The situation ought to be cool,
                    dry, and well aired. They will seldom keep longer than twelve or eighteen
                    months, without running great risk of suffering injury from the moth or black
                    beetle. Too many ought not to be heaped together, and particularly if they be
                    rabbit-skins, because the fat or grease about these skins will get heated, run
                    amongst the fur, and be come of such an acrid nature as to corrode the very pelt
                    itself. Many persons are inclined to keep hare and rabbit skins a long time,
                    from a notion that the fur upon them will increase in length from the moisture
                    left in the pelt. This is an entirely erroneous opinion. Any one who will make
                    the experiment will find that the amount of fur obtained off’ any given quantity
                    of skins is much greater in weight when manufactured immediately after they are
                    taken off the animal, than after having been kept for six or twelve months.</p>
                <p>The qualities of all kinds of furs differ very considerably, from climate and
                    other local circumstances. The best rabbit fur, used for the manufacture of the
                    finest London hats, is commonly considered as the produce of the east coast of
                    England, particularly from Lincolnshire to Berwick inclusively. The rabbit fur
                    is always stronger in the felting principle when got off rabbits bred on the
                    sea-coast, than in those found in inland places, however favourable in other
                    respects these places may be for the rearing of the animals. The skins along the
                    tract of coast already mentioned seem all of the same size and quality. North of
                    Berwick the rabbit-skin grows less, and the fur weaker and shorter; and the
                    further north, along the coast, the more inferior it becomes. The same thing
                    takes place on the west side of the island. The fur of rabbit-skins procured on
                    the western coast of Scotland is very inferior, and quite unfit for the
                    manufacture of fine stuff hats. Along the west of England the skins become
                    larger and finer in quality, but they are always considered as of less value
                    than those obtained on the eastern coast. The rabbit fur from Ireland is
                    generally of an average quality; but what forms a curious circumstance in the
                    natural history of that country is, that the hare-skins, through every part of
                    it, are of no value whatever. Their fur is totally useless, and consists
                    principally of a kind of hair. The Irish hat manufacturers have, in consequence,
                    to import all their hare fur from England.</p>
                <p>The hare fur in Great Britain is superior, for hat purposes, to any in the world.
                    It is finer in its grain, and stronger in its felting properties, than any found
                    in the other countries of Europe. Large quantities of German hare fur are
                    imported into this country, and used along with the produce of our own island;
                    but, on account of its being of a coarser nature, it is generally disposed of at
                    a reduced price. The hare and rabbit furs in all parts of America are very
                    inferior in quality.</p>
                <p>The pelts of skins used for felting purposes, after the fur is taken off them,
                    are of little value. They are generally sent to the west of England, and sold
                    for the purpose of making a fine kind of glue, much used in the manufacture of
                    fine cloth. Their present value is only about eighteen shillings per
                    hundredweight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Manufacture of Furs for Ornament and Cloaùng.</hi></p>
                <p>It was not till the later ages that the furs of beasts became an article of
                    luxury. The more refined nations of ancient times never made use of them; those
                    alone whom the former stigmatized as barbarians were clothed in the skins of
                    animals. Strabo describes the Indians as covered with the skins of lions,
                    panthers, and bears; and Seneca, the Scythians as clothed with the skins of
                    foxes and the lesset quadrupeds. Virgil exhibits a picture of the savage
                    Hyperboreans, similar to that which our late circumnavigators have witnessed in
                    the clothing of the wild Americans, unseen before by any polished people. Most
                    part of Europe was at this time in similar circumstances. Caesar mighl be as
                    much amazed with the skin-dressed heroes of Britain, as our celebrated Cook was
                    at those of his newly-discovered regions. What time has done to us, time, under
                    humane conquerors, may effect for them. Civilization ma; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193517451" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7451-0268"/>take place; and those spoils
                    of animals, which are at present essential for clothing, become the mere objects
                    of ornament and luxury.</p>
                <p>; It does not appear that the ancient Greeks or Romans ever made use of furs. It
                    originated in those regions where they most abounded, and where the severity of
                    the climate required that species of clothing. At first it consisted of the
                    skins only, almost in the state in which they were tom from the body of the
                    beast; but as soon as civilization took place, and manufactures were introduced,
                    furs became the lining of the dress, and often the elegant facing of the robes.
                    It is probable that the northern conquerors introduced the fashion into Europe.
                    We find, that about the year 522, when Totila, king of the Visigoths, reigned in
                    Italy, the Suethons, a people of modern Sweden, found means, by help of the
                    commerce of numberless intervening people, to transmit, for the use of the
                    Romans, the precious skins of the sable. As luxury advanced, furs, even of the
                    most valuable species, were used by princes as linings for their tents. Thus,
                    Marco Polo, in 1252, found those of the Cham of Tartary lined with ermines and
                    sables, the last of which he calls <hi rend="italic">zibelines</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">zambolines.</hi> He says that these and other precious furs were
                    brought from countries far north; from the <hi rend="italic">land of
                    darkness,</hi> and regions almost inaccessible by reason of morasses and ice.
                    The Welsh set a high value on furs as early as the time of Howel Dda, who began
                    his reign about 940. In the next age furs became the fashionable magnificence of
                    Europe. When Godfrey of Boulogne and his followers appeared before the Emperor
                    Alexis Comnenus, on their way to the Holy Land, he was struck with the richness
                    of their dresses. How different was the advance of luxury in France from the
                    time of their great monarch Charlemagne, who contented himself with the plain
                    fur of the otter. Our Henry I. wore furs, yet in his distress was obliged to
                    change them for warm Welsh flannel. But in the year 1337 the luxury had got to
                    such a head that Edward III. enacted, that all persons who could not spend a
                    hundred pounds a year should absolutely be prohibited the use of this species of
                    finery. These, from their great expense, must have been foreign furs, obtained
                    from the Italian states, the traffic of which was at this period boundless. How
                    strange is the revolution in the fur trade. The north of Asia at that time
                    supplied us with every valuable kind; at present we send, by means of the
                    possessions of Hudson’s Bay, furs to an immense amount, even to Turkey and to
                    China.</p>
                <p>The business of preparing skins for articles of dress is much more simple, and
                    employs a great deal fewer hands, than the trade of manufacturing furs for
                    felting purposes. The first thing to be attended to by those who follow the
                    former occupation is to examine the skin as to the manner in which it has been
                    dried. If it has experienced the slightest degree of putrefaction, it will never
                    be of any use for the purpose of dressing as fur. Great attention is, therefore,
                    paid by the hunters, and those who are engaged in bringing the furs to market,
                    as to the drying of the skins, and the proper manner of packing and preserving
                    them when they are dried. Exposure to the air is the best method of drying a
                    skin after it is taken off" the animal, or hanging it up in a dry and c∞l room
                    where there is no fire. If skins be once thoroughly dried in this manner, they
                    may be preserved for a great length of time, and transported to any distance
                    without injury.</p>
                <p>In the dressing of furs for clothing or ornament two things are necessary; to
                    remove the fat or grease from the pelt; and to extract the oiliness from the fur
                    itself, and impart to it a bright and shining appearance. In the accomplishment
                    of these two things the whole art consists. The clearing of the pelt is effected
                    by applying a composition of bran, alum, and salt to it; and the cleansing of
                    the fur by a mixture of soda and fine soap. The skins, after having undergone
                    these processes, are washed with cold water, and dried gradually in the air.</p>
                <p>After the skins are prepared in this manner, the next thing is to cut them to
                    advantage. In almost all the articles of the fur kind used as clothing, we find
                    them made up of small and detached pieces of skin, to give these articles a
                    uniform appearance as to the length and colour of the fur. Hence it becomes a
                    point of great importance to a furrier not to have his skins cut to a
                    disadvantage, but to make the most of every part of them.</p>
                <p>Very few of the skins used for felting purposes are manufactured for dress. The
                    principal of the latter kind are the grey, silver, and black fox, the ermine,
                    the sable, the chinchilla, the fitchet, the bear, the marten, the mink, the
                    lynx, and tire wolf.</p>
